mercedes lackey and larry dixon mage wars the silver gryphon one freedom tadrith skandrakae extended his broad gray wings stretching out his muscles to their fullest extent to take best advantage of the warm wind beneath him freedom at last i thought id never get away from that section meeting he banked just slightly to his left slipping sideways for the best line iknow it wasnt my good looks or charm that were putting me under that old crows watch i swear aubri must get a special pleasure out of keeping people around him who desperately want to be somewhere else he halfclosed his eyes against the glare of the sun on the water beneath him he was conscious of two pressures one tangible and one fanciful the warm imagined push of the sun on his back and the strong uplift of the thermal beneath him then again maybe there were three pressures or four the warm air below the hot sun above and the twin desires to be away from the boredom of yet another section meeting and the wish to be headed for something exciting the thermal tasted of salt and seaweed and it gave him some welcome relief from rowing his wings against the breeze beneath and beyond his left wing the great western sea shone greenblue and vast the horizon a sharp line where the brilliant turquoise of the sky met the deep emerald green of the water farther out to his right the cliffbuilt city of white gryphon sent back the rays of the sun in a dazzling display of snowy stone laced with growing things drifts of trailing vines and falling water as had been planned a generation ago the city itself was laid out in the shape of a stylized gryphon with his wings spread proudly against the mossy uncut stone of the cliff by day it glowed by night it glimmered lit with candle lantern and magelight tadrith loved it a proud promising beckoning city home to thousands beneath him the olivegreen waters of the cove rolled calmly against the base of the cliff and gurgled around the pillars of the dock a delicate lacework of foam atop the swells the moorings there were all empty except for light utility craft for the fishing fleet of white gryphon would be out at sea until sunset tadrith himself had served with the fleet in his first year as a silver gryphon young gryphons acted as aerial scouts spotting schools of fish from above and then worked as catch haulers later in the day the only time that nets were used was when the catch haulers were taking the catch in to the shore in their first years here the fleet had fished with drag and gillnets but did so no more their haighlei allies had been horrified at the wastage caused by net fishing for inedible sea life had been caught and wantonly destroyed along with the edible fish they had rightfully pointed out that the kaledain would not have countenanced such wastage in hunting so why should they allow it in fishing fishing was another form of hunting after all you did not kill creatures that were of no threat or use to you in the forest so why do so in the sea so now the fleets used only baited lines allowing for the release of fish that were too young or unwanted it took longer and was more work but that was a small matter compared with the fact that it ensured feeding the next generation and the ten after that ten generations to come thats always the concernthe generations to come plan and work for ten generations benefit amberdrake says even if we wear ourselves to wingsails and bones doing it such thoughts tended to come to everyone at white gryphon from time to time among the young like him they came to mind at least once an hour in times of even harder work they arose every few minutes it was only natural after all that a day of bright sun and promise would hold a virile young gryphons attention better than going over patrol charts and watch rosters with an elder gryphon even one as likable as old aubri ihave places to go things to do im almost positive of it the landing platform that tadrith had chosen was not untenanted a factor that had played some little part in his choice not that he was vain oh no at least not much but there were three perfectly handsome young gryphon ladies spreading their wings to catch some sun on that platform with their mothers in ohsocasual attendance on the offchance that a young bachelor might show some interest he knew all three of them of course dharra was a year older than he and a mage kylleen a year younger and still serving with the fleet and jerrinni a fellow silver she was already working with a partner on unsupervised assignments and he particularly wanted to impress her if he could she was by far the most attractive of the three being of the same goshawk type that he was but that was not the only reason for his interest in her she was also his senior in the silvers and her comments to her superiors might edge him up a little toward his longdelayed promotion to unsupervised assignments i wear the badge but i am not yet allowed to bear the responsibilities the badge represents he did not have to glance down at his harness to see that badge made in the form of a stylized gryphon the silver gryphons so named for that silver badge they wore served in every kind of military and policing capacity that fighters guards scouts and constables had in the old days and in addition to those tasks the gryphons in the silversespecially the young ones still in trainingmade themselves useful in a variety of other tasks or to be more precise their leaders assigned them to those souseful tasks like hauling cargo or carrynets full of fish or hoisting supplies meat from the herds and the fruits of the fields down from the top of the cliff for instance or sitting through boring meetings ihave a hundred things that need to be done or as father would say places to go people to be he makes a joke of it but i live it more than he ever did even after all of his adventures and missions and roles even more than he did at the eclipse ceremony he sideslipped and caught another thermal one that would place him precisely where he wanted to be the thought of his father as always made him flinch internally not that skandranon was a bad fatheroh no he was an excellent teacher provider and friend he was a fine father but he was a very difficult person to have as a father trying to live up to the image of the black gryphon was difficult and vexing he may be a living legend but it makes being his son a living hell but the platform and its attractive occupants loomed up before and beneath him and tadrith allowed himself a touch of smug satisfaction he prided himself on his aerobatics and most especially on his control his mother zhaneel was the gryphon who had been most revered for her flying finesse and he had studied her techniques more than his fathers at least the great skandranon cant do this as well as i can tadrith banked in over the platform and pulled up to stall in midair and then fall wings cupped to land standing on one foot then two and from then to all fours without any sound louder than the creak of the platform accepting his weight the gryphon ladies all gazed on in approval impressed by his display of control and dexterity and kylleen cooed aloud and smiled in his direction yes that worked out just the way i wanted tadrith stood rock steady and struck a momentary pose wings folded crisply crest up and gently ruffled by the breeze just right that will show them what im made of father never flew like that hed have powered straight in and knocked them half off their feet with the backwash of his wingbeats i have finesse and style tadriths selfcongratulatory reverie was shattered a moment later when one mother said to another did you see that why hes the very image of his father with aerobatics like that crushed tadrith drooped his head and crest and stepped off the platform im doomed at least the younger ladies seemed oblivious to the effect that the casual remark had on him they continued to bestow coy and admiring glances on him as he made as unhurried and graceful an exit as he could manage under the circumstances the platform jutted out over the cove below and led directly to one of the balustraded streets that ran along the edge of the terrace the kaledain who comprised the greater part of the population of white gryphon were accustomed to being surrounded by greenery and even in a city carved and built completely of cliffstone had managed to bring that greenery here built into the balustrades were stone boxes filled with earth brought down a sackful at a time from the fields above those boxes now held luxuriant vines that trailed down to the next terraced level more stone boxes each held a single tree or bush with flowering herbs planted at its base there was water enough coming down from above to allow for the occasional tiny waterfall to trail artfully from terrace to terrace and end in a long fall to the sea the greenery had been planned so that it actually formed featherpatterns adding texture to the pure white of the stone gryphon part of the philosophy of white gryphon when the city was planned had been recovery with dignity the leaders of the peopleskandranon includedused the survivors artistry and style as a point of pride and unification if a simple box would do an ornamented box was better this strategy of increased selfesteem guided by the kestrachern worked in making the people feel less like beaten refugees and more like proud homesteaders the philosophy was simple if an object could be made beautifulwhether it was a street doorway or gardenit was homes were carved directly into the cliff behind the avenue some going twenty or thirty gryphonlengths back into the stone the size of a family home or a gryphon aerie was limited only to the willingness of family members to dig or pay for someone else to digand to live in the windowless spaces beyond the main rooms gryphons tended to find such spaces disturbing and confining and preferred not to carve more than two roomsworth deep but hertasi and kyree and even some humans actually liked the idea of such burrows and sent their dwellings quite far back indeed there were entire complexes of manmade caverns back in those cliffs and tadrith had to admit that the one advantage they had was that weather made little or no difference to the folk living in those rooms amberdrake was one such he and winterhart had buried their personal chambers so far back into the living stone that no natural light ever reached there to disturb late sleepers tadrith shuddered at the very thought of so much rock on every side cutting him off from the air and light he had no idea how his partner blade ever tolerated it for she was another such as her parents not that a gryphon ever needs to worry about being forced to live in such a place not while there are hertasi and kyree vying for such mausoleums and eager to give up cliffside residences to have one in the early days when simply getting a dwelling carved out quickly had been of paramount importance it had been faster and easier just to sculpt rooms sidebyside often simply enlarging and improving existing caves magelights to aid in working deeper into the stone had been at a premium and there were long stretches of time when magic could not be used to help work the stone at all so that it all had to be done by hand workers tended to carve to a standard that happened to be preferred by most humans and all gryphons and tervardi the dyheli of course needed the barest of shelters to be contented and all lived above among the farms but the hertasi and kyree who really were not comfortable with views of endless sky and long drops were forced to make do until there was time and the resources to create dwellings more to their liking that meant there were always those who would happily trade an older precarious perch for a newlychiseled burrow there were wider terraces of course that permitted real buildings and even small gardens but those were all in the body of white gryphon and most building space was reserved for public use it was probably fair to say that threequarters of the population of white gryphon lived in glorified cave dwellings that was how tadrith and his twin keenath had gotten their own aerie which allowed them to move out of their parents home theyd found a narrow stretch of unexcavated terrace down at the bottom of white gryphons tail and had claimed it for themselves then hired a team of masons to carve out a long set of six rooms one after the other deep into the living rock this sort of residence was precisely the kind preferred by denloving kyree and burrowing hertasi once the dwelling had been roughed in and the twins made it known that they were willing to trade there was a bidding war going on even before it was completed the result was that tadrith and keenath had their own bachelor suite of one main room a food storage chamber and two light and airy bedrooms on either side of the main room both bedchambers had windows overlooking the cliff as had the main room the kyree family that had gratefully traded this aerie for the dark tunnellike series of rooms pronounced themselves overjoyed to be leaving such a drafty windswept perch and had wondered why their parents had ever chosen it which only proves that one creatures cozy nest is another creatures draftridden mess of sticks as tadrith neared his home which was out on what would be the first primary of the white gryphons right wing the avenue narrowed to a simple pathway and the balustrade to a kneehigh narrow ledge of stone perhaps that had something to do with the kyrees reluctance to live therecertainly such an arrangement would be dangerous for young clumsy cubs tadrith and keenath had been raised in an aerie virtually identical to this one but on the first primary of the white gryphons left wing that distance between them and their beloved parents had played no small part in their final decision as to which family would win the bidding war tadrith could if he had chosen to do so actually have landed on the balustrade right outside his own doorbut landing anywhere other than the public landing platforms was considered a breech of safety for it encouraged the justfledged youngsters who were by no means as coordinated as they thought they were to reckless behavior no lives had been lost but several limbs had been broken when younglings had missed their landings and slipped off the edge or tumbled into a group of passersby after a number of hysterical mothers demanded that the council do something about the problem the landing platforms were installed and gryphons and tervardi were strongly encouraged to use them tadrith and keenath with every eye in white gryphon always on them had been scrupulous in their use of the public landing platforms by daylight anyway and no fledge is allowed to fly after dark so theyll never see us when we cheat in glorious weather like this the doors and windows always stood wide open so tadrith simply strolled inside his shared dwelling his claws clicking on the bare stone of the floor the room they used for company was airy and full of light with the rock of the outer wall carved into several tall panels with thin shafts of wood between them translucent panes of the tough material the kaledain used for windows were set into wooden frames on hinges which in turn were set into the stone the room itself was furnished only with cushions of various sizes all covered in fabric in the colors of sandstone and granite slate and shale in the winter thick sheepskins and wool rugs would cover that cold white floor and the doors and windows would be shut tight against the gales but in the summer all those coverings were whisked away into storage so that an overheated gryphon could lie bellydown on the cool rock floor and dump some of that body heat quickly and in fact keenath was doing just that spread out on the floor with wings fanned panting slightly i was just thinking about dinner his twin greeted him i might have known that thoughts of food would bring you home tadrith snorted just because youre obsessed with eating it doesnt follow that i am ill have you know that i only just now escaped from yet another yawnsome section meeting food was the very last thing on my mind and escaping aubri was the first keenath laughed silently beak parted as his tongue flicked in and out while his sides heaved that must have been a first then he bantered so who was she the pretty young thing that your mind was really on i mean kylleen perhaps tadrith was not going to get caught in that trap i havent made up my mind he said loftily i have so many to choose from after all it hardly seems reasonable to narrow the field this early in the race it wouldnt be fair to the ladies either to deny my company to any of them it is only polite to distribute my attentions over as wide a selection as possible keenath reached out a claw and snagged a pillow spun it twice as he raised up and expertly hurled it at his brothers head tadrith ducked and it shot across the room to thud against the wall on the other side you should be careful doing that he warned flopping down on the cool stone himself weve lost too many pillows over the cliff that way so what were you studying that has you panting so hard field treatment and rescues under combat conditions and specifically blood stanching and wound binding keenath replied why dont ask me we havent seen a state of combat since before you and i were born winterharts idea probably because i take after mother tadrith nodded keenath was very similar in size and build to their mother zhaneel like her he was technically a gryfalcon rather than a gryphon he was small and light most of his musculature in his chest and shoulders his coloring and body type were that of a peregrine his wings long and narrow but most importantly he had inherited zhaneels stubtaloned dexterous clawhands this was important for keenath was learning the craft of the trondiirn from winterhart herself and he needed hands as clever as a humans before his apprenticeship was complete he would be able to do anything a healer with no gift could do the difference between him and an herb fire or knifehealer was that like all trondiirn his training was tailored to the needs and physiology of gryphons and other nonhumans zhaneel had been trained as a fighterand others had come to the realization that her small size and lack of fighting talons could be put to other uses too late for her to learn a new trade at that point she had opted to adapt her style of fighting to her body type rather than try to fit the accepted mold and with skandranons help she had made the best of her situation with brilliant results but when keenath had shown early signs that he would resemble her physically he was encouraged to think of a career in something other than the silvers nevertheless it had surprised everyone when he had declared he wanted to train as a trondiirn up until now that had been an occupation reserved for humans and hertasi tadrith stretched and yawned turning his head so that the breeze coming in from the open door could ruffle his crestfeathers at least you were doing something he complained i sat there until i thought my hindquarters were going to turn to stone and if any part of me is going to grow stiff on a day like this that is not my primary choice i couldnt even take a nap as usual old aubri had me conspicuously up front have to maintain the tradition of the black gryphon of course have to pretend every section meeting is as important as a wartime conference have to act as if every detail could mean life or death he stretched again enjoying the fact that he could always vent his frustration to his twin you should be glad you look the way you do keeth its bad enough being skandranons son but the fact that i look like him doesnt even remotely help you try living up to the legend sometime its enough to make anyone want to bite something and to display the strength of his own frustration he snagged the poor mistreated pillow keenath had lately lobbed at him and bit at it savagely it was a good thing they had the cushions covered in tough linencanvas for the pillows had to take a great deal of punishment well if you think its hard living up to the legend just try breaking away from it keenath retorted as he always did tadriths twin groaned as he followed tadriths example stretching half the time im left wondering if winterhart isnt pushing me so hard expecting me to fail and half the time i think shes doing it because everyone knows skandranon never failed at anything he tried tadrith snorted and mockscraped his hindfeet as if burying something particularly noxious from a previous meal he never let it be known how often he failed which is the same thing to legendbuilders his brother snorted right back and continued and if it isnt winterhart its everyone else watching waiting to see if the old black gryphon magic is strong enough in keenath to enable the youngling to pull off another miracle he parted his beak in a sardonic grin at least you have a path to followim going through new skies in the fog and i have no idea if im going to run up against a cliffface naturally tadrith had his own set of retorts already primed proving how much more difficult it was to have to follow in the wake of the black gryphon it was an old set of complaints worn familiar by much handling and much enjoyed by both of them who can i complain to if not to my twin for all that they were unalike in form and temper they were bound by the twinbond and knew each other with the twins intimacy there were other twins among the gryphons and one or two sets among the humans and all the twinsets agreed there was a bond between them that was unlike any other sibling tie tadrith often thought that hed never have been able to cope with the pressure if keenath hadnt been around and keenath had said the same thing about his sibling finally the litany of complaints wound to its inevitable conclusionwhich was of course that there was no conclusion possible they ran through the sequence at least once every day having long ago decided that if they could not change their circumstances at least they could enjoy complaining about them so what has your tail in a knot this time keenath asked it wasnt just the meeting tadrith rolled over on his back to let the breeze cool his belly sometimes i think im going to do something drastic if blade and i dont get assigned soon he replied discontentedly what are they waiting for weve earned our freedom by now they could be waiting for you to finally demonstrate a little patience featherhead keenath said and had to duck as the pillow made a return trip in his direction there might have been more pillows than just the one flying if silverblade herself tadriths partner hadnt chosen that moment to walk in their open door she stood in the doorway posing unconsciously with the sun making a dark silhouette of her against the brilliant sky tadrith knew it was not a conscious pose it was totally out of her nature to do anything to draw attention to herself unless it was necessary blade was the name the gryphons knew her by though her childhood name hadnt been the usename she wore now it had been windsong so dubbed by her fond parents in the hopes no doubt that she would grow up to resemble one or the other of them windsong was a perfectly good name for a trondiirn or even a kestrachern or a kaledain healer or mage but windsong hadnt had the inclination for any of those things the young woman who broke her pose and strode into the aerie with the soundless tread of a hunter was small by kaledain standards although there was no mistaking her lineage her short black hair cut in a way that suggested an aggressive bird of prey framed a face that could only have graced the head of one of the clan kleshya and her beak of a nose continued the impression of a hunting hawk her golden skin proclaimed the lineage further as did her brilliantly blue eyes there was nothing of her mother about herand very little of her father she fit in very well with those members of clan kleshya descended from warrior stock however despite her small size she was definitely molded in their image there was nothing to suggest softness or yielding she was hard lithe and every bit a warrior all muscle and whipcord tadrith well recalled the first time he had seen her stand that way the day she showed her real personality one month after her twelfth birthday a month during which she had suddenly turned overnight from a lively if undistinguished child to a rough and unpolished version of what she now was amberdrake had been holding a gathering of some sort which had included the children and of course tadrith and keenath had been in attendance winterhart had addressed her daughter as windsong during the course of the meal and the little girl had unexpectedly stood up and announced to the room in a firm and penetrating voice that she was not to be called by that name anymore i am going to be a silver she had said loudly and with total conviction i want to be called silverblade from now on silverblade had then sat down flushed but proud amidst gasps and murmurs it was a rather dramatic move even for someone with an outgoing personality like tadrith for one as selfeffacing as blade it must have taken an enormous effort of willor assertion of the truth as the kleshya believed the willpower to do anything would come the songs and writings said if the motive was pure nothing her parents could say or do would persuade her otherwisenot that amberdrake and winterhart had been so selfish as to attempt to thwart her in what she so clearly wanted from that day on she would respond to no other name than silverblade or blade for short and now even both her parents referred to her by that name it certainly fits her better than windsong she cant carry a tune any better than i could carry a boulder keeth i hear you didnt kill too many patients today congratulations she said as she invited herself into the room and sat down on one of the remaining cushions thank you keenath said dryly and do come in wont you she ignored his attempt at sarcasm ive got some good news bird she said turning to tadrith and grinning broadly as he rolled over i didnt think it could wait and besides i wanted to be the one to break it to you news tadrith sat up what kind of news there was only one piece of news that he really cared aboutand only one he thought blade would want to deliver to him herself her grin broadened you should have stayed after the meeting there was a reason why aubri wanted you up front if you were half as diligent as you pretend to be youd know for yourself by now she eyed him teasingly im tempted to string this out just to make you squirm what he burst out leaping to his feet tell me tell me this instant orill he gave up unable to think of a threat she couldnt counter and just ground his beak loudly now she laughed seeing that she had gotten him aroused well since it looks as if you might burst if i dontits what weve been hoping for weve gotten our first unsupervised assignment and its a good one only the low ceiling prevented him from leaping into the air in excitement although he did spring up high enough to brush his crestfeathers and wingtips against the ceiling when where how long till we can get in action he shuffled his taloned feet his tail lashing with exuberance all but dancing in place she laughed at his reaction and gestured to him to sit down just as quickly as you and i would like bird we leave in six days and well be gone for six moons were going to take charge of outpost five now his joy knew no bounds five truly he squealed sounding like a fledgling and not caring five outpost five was the most remote outpost in all of the territory jointly claimed by white gryphon and their haighlei allies when this particular band of refugees had fled here as they escaped the final cataclysm of the mage of silences war with maar the wouldbe conqueror of the continent they had been unaware that the land they took for a new home was already claimed theyd had no idea that it was part of the land ruled by one of the haighlei emperors whom the kaledain knew as the black kings king shalaman a clash with them had been narrowly averted thanks to the work of amberdrake and skandranon blades father and tadriths now white gryphon jointly held these lands in trust with the emperor and its citizens were charged with the responsibility of guarding the border in return for king shalamans grant of the white gryphon lands it was a border of hundreds of leagues of wilderness and the emperor himself had not been able to guard it he had relied on the wilderness itself to do the guarding this was not as insurmountable a task as it might have seemed with gryphons to fly patrol it was possible to cover vast stretches of countryside with minimal effort outpost five was the most remote and isolated of all of the border posts because of that it was hardly the most desirable position so far as the silvers were concerned for most silvers perhaps but not for blade and tadrith this meant three whole months in a place so far away from white gryphon that not even a hint of what transpired there would reach the city unless he or blade sent it by teleson there would be no watching eyes waiting to see if he could replicate his legendary father there would be no tongues wagging about his exploits imagined or real of course there would also be no delicious gryphon ladies for three months but that was a small price to pay three months of chastity would be good for him it would give him a rest he would be able to use the leisure time to invent new and clever things to do and say to impress them he would have all that time to perfect his panache by the time he returned as a veteran of the border he should be able to charm any lady he chose outpost duty was a long assignment in no small part because it was so difficult to get people to the outposts even though magic was now working reliably and had been for several years no one really wanted to trust his body to a gate just yet too many things could go wrong with a gate at the best of times and at the moment the only purpose anyone was willing to put them to was to transport unliving supplies the consumables and their mail and special requests would be supplied to their outpost that way a mage at white gryphon who was familiar with the place would set up a gate to the outpost workers would then pitch bundles through and the mage would drop the gate as soon as he could no one wants to leave a gate up very long either you never know what might go wrong or what might stroll through it while its up you know of course that theres a great deal of uninhabited and poorlysurveyed territory in between five and home blade went on with relish were going to be completely on our own from the time we leave to the time we return what no lovely gryphon ladies and human stallions to wile away your time of exile jibed keenath and shuddered realistically well never mind i can guarantee that in the case of the ladies i can make certain that they will not notice your absence twin they are more likely to cry out in pain at your i poor attempts at gallantry keeth tadrith told him and turned back to blade you realize that this shows a great deal of trust in our abilities dont you i mean the usual first assignment is something like like guarding the farms i know she replied smugly that must have been why they kept us behind the others training and overtraining us they wanted to be sure we were ready and i bet they decided to send us out there because were the only people who really want to go in fact i would bet my favorite armband that aubri plans to send us out on long outpost duty every chance he can get they grinned at each other with relish for there was another aspect to outpost duty they both anticipated with pleasure those so posted were expected to do a certain amount of exploring and sometimes the explorers found something valuable the emperor shalaman got a share of course as did the treasury of white gryphon but the generous portion remaining went to the intrepid explorers who made the discovery not that tadrith was greedy of course but he did have a certain love of ornamentation a pronounced interest in the finer things of life and finding something extremely valuable would make it possible for him to indulge his interests and it didnt hurt to have the wherewithal to impress the ladies either and ornament them a bit now and then just how much exploring has been done up there he asked blades eyes widened knowingly not all that much she replied and there are more ways to explore than sailing over the treecanopy hoping something on the ground will show itself he nodded following her thoughts probably most of the silvers assigned to outpost five in the past had been gryphon teams that made sense although it probably wore them down terribly not having humans and hertasi to tend to them a human on station though could make a detailed survey of a particular area including the smaller animals and plants living there and take mineral samples that was something a gryphon was illsuited or for that matter illinclined to do theres been no trouble from that sector for years she mused we should have plenty of time for surveys but most of all youll be on your own keenath said enviously i wish i could find some way to escape for a few months blade patted his shoulder sympathetically and miss all the benefits of trondiirn hertasi and kestrachern fawning on you every spare moment the horror you could ask to be taken on by the silvers once youve finished training under winterhart she suggested then youd get some assignments elsewhere down with the embassy at khimbata maybe you could go as the trondiirn taking care of the emperors gryphonguards keenaths eyes lit up at the idea and tadrith knew how he felt for a chance to get out of white gryphon he would have put up with just about anything the problem was that there was literally nothing that he said or did that skandranon didnt eventually find out about it wasnt that skan was purposefully spying on his sons or even deliberately overseeing them well not much anyway and not overtly it was just that everyone told the black gryphon everything that went on in this city a mouse couldnt sneeze without skandranon finding out about it eventually neither can weexcept that its guaranteed that if we sneeze someone will go running to father with the news not only that but the report would be detailed as to how when and how well we sneezed it wasnt exactly talebearing for people made certain to bring skan the most flattering reports possible skan was a very proud father he cant get enough of hearing about all the marvelous things keeth and i are doing especially now that we arent in the family aerie to bully into making reports on ourselves the trouble is he is fully capable of blowing the most minor accomplishment up into the equivalent of a brilliant piece of wartime strategy or heroism it was embarrassing to say the least and of course anyone who wanted to curry favor with the black gryphon knew the fastest way to his heart was to praise his sons skan would go out of his way to see that someone who flattered the twins got a full hearing and careful consideration that was all he would do but often enough that was sufficient as keeth continued to look envious and a little pained tadrith preened his short eartufts in sympathy i wish there was a way to send you out of the city for trondiirn training twin he murmured keenath sighed so do i when we were all choosing the subject we wanted to study i tried to think of some discipline i could enjoy that would also get me out of the city at the same time but i couldnt i think im going to be good at this and it certainly feels right but it means im stuck here blade wore as sympathetic an expression as tadrith there is this keeth the gryphon said to his twin you can just go on doing what you are doing and you will have earned every right to be considered unique and special youre writing your own definition of a trondiirn you dont have to stand there blushing at the nares with embarrassment when someone comes in acting as if running the obstacle course was the equivalent of stealing one of maars magical weapons but keenath ruffled his neckfeathers and clicked his beak thats true up to a point but there is another problem father literally does not understand me we have absolutely nothing in common when i talk about what im doing he gets this strange look on his face as if i were speaking a foreign tongue he laughed weakly i suppose i am really well ill get my chance eventually you will blade promised but she made no move to rise to her feet im going to have to break the news to my parents assuming that they dont already know which is more than likely tad youd better figure out how to tell yours theyll know tadrith replied with resignation father is probably already telling everyone he thinks will listen how theres never been anyone as young as i am posted so far away on his first assignment blade laughed ruefully youre probably right and mine is probably doing the sameexcept she didnt complete the sentence but tadrith knew her well enough not to pressure her they each had their own set of problems and talking about them wasnt going to solve them only time would do that or so he hoped silverblade sat back on her heels when the twins began to argue over what tadrith should pack she was in no real hurry to get back home since she was still living with her parents she did not even have the illusion of privacy that her own aerie would have provided the moment she walked in the door the questions and congratulationsbracketed by thinlyveiled worrywould begin and at the moment she did not feel up to fielding them she breathed in the scent of salt air and sunbaked rock half closing her eyes i love this place the only neighbors are other gryphons quiet enough that the sound of the surf covers any noise they might make and i love the fact that there are no other humans nearby only tervardi gryphons and a few kyree how she envied tad his freedom he really had no notion just how easy a parent skandranon was to deal with the black gryphon had a sound if instinctive and not entirely reliable knowledge of just when to shut his beak and let tad go his own way he also attempted to restrain his enthusiasm for the accomplishments of his twins although it was difficult for him but at least he showed that he approved amberdrake had never been happy with the pathchoice his daughter had made and although he tried not to let his disapproval color their relationship it leaked through anyway how could it not perhaps disapproval was too strong a word amberdrake understood warriors he had worked with them for most of his life he respected them most profoundly he liked them and he even understood all of the drives that fueled their actions he simply did not understand why his child and winterharts would want to be a warrior he cant fathom how he and mother produced someone like me by all rights with everything that they taught me i should never have been attracted to this life that was a gap of understanding that probably would never be bridged and blade had yet to come up with a way of explaining herself that would explain the riddle to him blade would you play secretary and write the list for me tadrith pleaded interrupting her reverie otherwise i know im going to forget something important if you do you can always have it gated to us she pointed out and laughed when he lowered his eartufts that would be so humiliating i would rather do without he exclaimed id never hear the last of it please just go get a silverstick and paper from the box and help me would you what else are gryphonpartners for except doing paperwork she responded as she rose and sauntered across the room to the small chest that held a variety of oddments the twins found occasionally useful each in its appointed place the chest carved of a fragrant wood that the haighlei called sadar held a series of compartmentalized trays holding all manner of helpful things among them were a box of soft silver sticks and a block of tough reedpaper both manufactured by the haighlei she extracted both and returned to her seat beside tad she leaned up against him bracing herself against his warm bulk using her knees as an impromptu writing desk as the twins argued over each item before agreeing to add it to the list or leave it out she waited patiently only once did she speak up during the course of the argument as keenath insisted that tad include a particular type of healers kit and tad argued against it on the grounds of weight she slapped his shoulder to get him to be quiet who is the trondiirn here she demanded you or keeth tad turned his head abruptly as if he had forgotten that she was there you mean since hes the expert i ought to listen to him precisely she said crisply whats the point of asking his opinion on this if you wont take it when you know hes the authority but the likelihood that wed need a bonesetting kit is so small its infinitesimal he protested and the weight im the one whos going to be carrying all this you know but if we need it well need exactly those supplies and nothing else will substitute she pointed out we dont know for certain that theres a bonesetting kit at the outpost and i prefer not to take the chance that the last few teams have been as certain of their invulnerability as you keenath looked smug as she added it to the list unbidden im going to insist on it and if it isnt in that basket when we leave ill send for one we may be in a position of needing one and being unable to ask for one to be gated to us tad flattened his ears in defeat as he looked from one implacable face to the other you win i cant argue against both of you gryphons could not smirk like humans could but there was enough muscular control of the beak edges at the join of the lower mandible that one could be approximated more than a touch of such an expression showed on keeth as they continued on to the next item part of the reason why blade felt so comfortable in the silvers and with the gryphons in particular was that their motives and thoughts were relatively simple and easy to understand in particular they made poor liars gryphons were just too expressive to hold a bluff effectively once you knew how to read their physical cues such as the lay of their facial feathers and the angle of their ears although they were complex creatures and often stubborn gryphons were also exactly what they appeared to be the kestrachern her father in particular were anything but their job was to manipulate when it came right down to it the whole point of what they did was to manipulate a client into feeling better to give him a little more insight into himself but she wasnt at all comfortable with the idea of manipulating anyone for any reason no matter how pure the motive and how praiseworthy the outcome oh i know things simply arent that blackandwhite but ah things were just simpler with the silvers issues often were a matter of extremes rather than degrees when you had only a single moment to make up your mind what you were going to do you had to be able to pare a situation down to the basics subtleties as judeth often said were for times of leisure she noted down another item and let her thoughts drift icant wait until were away from here i wish we could go without having to talk to my parents once they were away from white gryphon she would finally be able to relax for the first time in several years and once again it was her father who was indirectly responsible for her unease of spirit he knows too much thats the problem when she had been a child she had taken it for granted that amberdrake would know everyone of any importance at all in white gryphon she hadnt known any reason why he shouldnt but as she gradually became aware just what her fathers avocation really entailed she gained a dim understanding that the knowledge amberdrake possessed was extraordinarily intimate finally one day it all fell together she put the man together with the definition of kestrachern and had a moment of blinding and appalling revelation not only did her father know everyone of any importance he also knew the tiniest details about themevery motive every desire every dream and indecision details like that she felt deep in her heart no person should ever know about another such secrets gave the one who held them too much power over the other and that would weigh as an unimaginable responsibility not that father would ever use that power or would he if he had a chance to manipulate someone for a cause he thought was right wouldnt he be tempted to do just that and wouldnt the fear of having such secrets revealed to others be enough to make almost anyone agree to something that amberdrake wanted she had never once seen any indications that amberdrake had given in to the temptation to use his tacit powerbut he was her father and she knew that she was prejudiced on his behalf for that matter she was not certain she would know what to look for if he had misused his powers oh its not likely father would never do anything to harm anyone if only because he is an empath and would feel their emotional distress she ought to know she was something of an empath herself although in her case she got nothing unless she was touching the person in question that was one of the reasons why amberdrake was so confounded by the idea that she wanted to be a silver how could an empath ever choose to go into a profession where she might have to kill or injure someone easily enough its to prevent the people i must take care of from killing or injuring others he would never accept that just as he would never accept the idea that she would not want to use her empathic ability she shuddered at the very idea he knows every nasty little secret every hidden fear every deep need every longing and every desire of every client he has ever dealt with how he manages to hold all those things inside without going madicannot fathom it and that he actually wants to know these thingsi could never do that never it makes my skin crawl i dont want to know anyone that intimately it would be like having every layer of my skin peeled offor doing it to someone else over and over she loved her father and mother she knew they were wonderful admirable people and yet sometimes the things that they did made her a little sick inside all a silver ever had to do was stop a fight or break some bones once in a while and apply force when words didnt work that was just flesh and flesh would heal even if it was shredded and bleedingit wasnt as serious as getting into someones heart and digging around from that moment of understanding of who and what her father was she had been terrified that people would simply assume that she was like him that she wanted to be like him her greatest fear had been that they would take it for granted that she would cheerfully listen while they bared their souls to her gods no anything but that for a while until the healers taught her how to control her empathic ability she had even shied away from touching other people lest she learn more than she wished to even after she had learned to block out what she did not want to know she had been absolutely fanatic about her own privacy at least as much as i can be while i still live with my parents she kept her thoughts strictly to herself just as much as she could never confided anything about the things she considered hers alone even affairs of love or desire especially matters of love and desire by now she wondered if both her parents thought she was a changeling here were two people who knew everything there was to know about the physical and yet their daughter appeared to be as sexless as a vowed virgin she had made up her mind that she was not even going to give her father and mother the faintest of hints that she might have an interest in partnering anyone or anything unfortunately they would not have been taken aback by any liaison she cared to make they were in fact all too assiduous at suggesting possible partners and would have been cheerfully pleased to offer volumes of advice on approach and technique once she even hinted at a choice and it would be advice of a kind she blushed even to contemplate there was such a thing as too much information why cant they be like other parents she thought rebelliously why couldnt they have been surprised that i was no longer an innocent little girl horrified by the idea that i might one day bed someone and attempt to guard my virtue as if it were the gold mines of king shalaman any of those would be so much easier to deal with she had found out personally that it was much harder to deal with sunny cooperation than with outright opposition its a great deal like the handtohand combat styles we silvers learn she thought in frustration noting down yet another item for tadrith when your opponent moves against you there are any number of ways you can counter him you can block him parry him evade him or use his attack against him when he attacks he gives you options to counter him but when he does nothingwhen he actually flows with your moves it is impossible to do anything to extract yourself from the situation ironic to think of her outwardly serene life with her parents as a combat situation the only real escape from this ridiculous situation was to move away from white gryphon altogether as she had advised keenath there were positions available for silvers in the haighlei empire the ambassadors from white gryphon needed a token guard of honor in order to convey the proper presence at the court of the emperor that guard was comprised mostly of humans but always had at least four gryphons and two each of the kyree and dyheli the tervardi preferred not to live in such a warm climate and the hertasi took sly enjoyment in their roles of servants ferreting out intelligence that would otherwise never have come to the attention of the ambassadors the emperor also had two gryphonguards assigned to him serving alongside the younger sons of the other haighlei kings icould ask to be posted there i think i would enjoy the solitude of the outposts but there are more things to consider here tad would never be able to tolerate assignment after assignment to the lonely wilderness he would go absolutely stark staring lunatic after a while he was a very social creature and their partnership would not last very long if she was the only other being around to talk to not to mention what would happen to him without female gryphons about he only thinks hes nothing like his father he has as wild a reputation among the fair flyers as his father ever had if not more so i had better check in on him to make sure he gets some sleep before we leave she chuckled to herself and tad looked back at her for a moment in curiosity and as far as that went she was no chaste virgin untouched and unawakened she might well go quietly insane if she lived too long away from civilization for one thing after too long out there some very disturbing things might begin to look attractive tension can do that when i find myself eying snakes and fondling branches ill know ive been away too long still thats only one thing to miss and easy enough to simulateit is far more difficult to replace a lovers concern for another complicationwellthere is ikala she sighed ikala was important to blade and she had kept her parents from finding out about him only through plotting and planning that would have done a spymaster proud haighlei kings with more than one sonand most of them ceremonially wedded to a new priestessbride each year had many childrensent those sons off to be the personal guards of other kings this ensured that there would be no warfare and no assassination attempts for every king had hostages from every other king furthermore every king had the opportunity to win the loyalty of the sons of his fellow kings giving him an ally in the courts of his neighbors it was a good system and in the highly structured and rigid culture of the haighlei it worked well ikala was one of those younger sons twentieth in succession behind the actual crown prince of nbubi but instead of being sent to serve in one of the other courts he had elected to come to white gryphon instead to be trained by aubri and judeth and serve in the silvers the culture of the haighlei was a strange one by kaledain standards every action was tightly bound up in protocol every moment cemented with custom the haighlei lived in the most rigid society that the kaledain had ever seen or heard of change was only permitted when decreed by the emperor and his chief priests and then only at the eclipse ceremony how anything gets changed at all is a mystery there was a hierarchy for everything from the gods to the poorest beggar and no one was ever allowed to leave his place in that hierarchy except at approved times under rigid circumstances and that was why ikala son of a king was here in white gryphon ikala cannot bear the constraints of his people any more than i can ikala had found relief here as she hoped to find it in the wilderness perhaps that was why she had felt so drawn to him from the first they were both trying to escape from lives that others wished them to lead ikala was not the only haighlei here many found an escape in white gryphon from the intolerable rigidity of their own culture although there were not as many as blade would have expected they were generally young for the old were content to wait for their next lives to improve their lot they were also more often female than male even though there was no real difference in the way that men and women were treated by haighlei law and custom this was just as well since there were more kaledain men in white gryphon than womenan accident that snowstar and cinnabar thought might be due to one of the more subtle effects of the magestorms following the cataclysm that destroyed kavenusho perhaps that was the reason why so many more young haighlei women came here than men the perfectly ordinary reason of husband hunting the kaledain had been nearer the source of the blast than the lands of the black kings and nearest when the storms were at their worst many other subtle changes had taken place during their migration here not all of them as obvious as a superfluity of male children there were changes that affected the mages for instance we had more than half of the mages associated with urthos army youd never know that now the magestorms had made it very difficult to practice magic for the strength of spells literally varied from storm to storm but once the last of the storms had passed it became evident that they had not only affected magic they had affected the mages as well some formerly powerful had lost much of their ability one or two who had only been at the level of hedgewizard before the storms were able to aspire to the rank of master some had undergone personality changes so subtle that the effects did not come to light for months or years growing slowly odder and less social until at last they would gather their belongings and vanish into the wilderness alone one had caused a great deal of damage before he left both physical and emotional that one was not hadanelith though hadanelith had caused a fair share of emotional damage himself it was generally granted however that hadanelith had not been warped into what he was by the magestorms all evidence seemed to indicate he had always been quite mad and quite dangerous only the mages of kleshya were so affected at least as far as anyone knew then again perhaps shalamans nameless brother was turned into what he became by the storms as well well probably never know for certain at any rate since now the rate of birth for boys and girls was about equal again the next generation would not have the trouble finding mates that this one had until haighlei women started coming in by curious ones and twos ikala had intrigued blade however because he was very much different from the other haighlei that had drifted into the city he had kept to himself and simply observed for several weeks after accepting hospitality at the hostel set up for visitors he had not made any secret of his lineage but he had not attempted to trade on it either he had gone about the city quietly watching everything and everyone while the silvers were watching him as they watched all newcomers then one day he presented himself to judeth and asked to be taken into the silvers as a trainee had he been making up his mind if he wanted to stay had he already known he intended to remain and was only looking for a place where he could earn his way not even blade knewunless he had told judeth which was possibleand he had spent more time talking to her than to anyone else this was a fact that she had taken great pains to conceal from her loving family as was her growing affection for him she wasnt certain what she was going to do about that yet as with many things it would have to wait until she returned from this assignment but having a silver well acquainted with another court than shalamans would mean that white gryphon could open up a second embassy in nbubi ikala could prove invaluable there as an expert in the background able to advise the ambassador as silver veil had advised amberdrake in shalamans court and that would be a fine place for blade and tadrith to be postedand perhaps even keeth unless of course amberdrake managed to get himself appointed as ambassador thereor winterhart did no no that couldnt possibly happen she reassured herself hastily fathers needed too much here mother wouldnt go without him not after the mess that almost happened the last time and he knows that theres no one here that could replace him of course he could always train someone as his replacement oh why am i making up these stupid scenarios when i dont even know where im going after this or whether ikala and i would ever be more than close friends or even if judeth would consider tad and me for posts with the embassy she realized that she was making up trouble for herself out of nebulous plans that werent even a possibility yet things must be going too well if im planning for opposition that doesnt exist and problems that would take a thousand variables to come up just about then tad spoke to her i cant think of anything else he said what about you i havent had any great inspirations for the supply list but then i havent been really thinking about it she confessed and frowned at the scrawled document in her hands ill tell you what lets go talk to judeth or aubri and see if either of them have any suggestions tad clicked his beak thoughtfully is that wise he asked will it look as if we arent capable of thinking for ourselves it will look as if we are not too full of ourselves to accept advice from those older and wiser than us and if we tell them that theyll adore us for it she responded and got to her feet stamping a little to ease a bit of numbness come on bird lets go show the old dogs that the puppies arent totally idiots not totally tadrith muttered although he did get to his feet as well only mostly two outpost five heh aubri stretched both his forelegs one at a time regarding the blunted ebony talons on the end of each claw with a jaundiced eye wind rattled the wooden wind chimes harmoniously in the open window behind him and tad watched golden dust motes dance in the beam of clear sunlight lancing down to puddle on the floor beside the old gryphon let me see if i remember anything about outpost five tad sighed as aubri went through the whole of his dry impish absentminded routine first scratching his rustybrown headfeathers meditatively which made more dustmotes dance into the light then staring up at the ceiling of the dwelling he shared with judeth his head moved again after a long moment and tad hoped he was finally going to say something but nohe looked down at the shining terrazzo floor inlaid in a geometric pattern of cream and brown that to all outward appearances fascinated him that is he seemed to be staring at those places like any raptor a gryphons peripheral vision was as good as his straighton sight and tad knew very well that aubri was watching themwell like a hawk outpost five the elder gryphon muttered shaking his head so that the fragments of feathersheath dislodged by his earlier scratch flew in all directions a single headfeather striped in brown and cream and as large as a humans palm drifted down to lie in the pool of sunlight beside him its edges were outlined in light and the white fluff at the base glowed with a nimbus of reflected sunshine outpost five now why does that sound familiar this could go on for some time if tad didnt put a stop to it he fixed aubri with a look that said wordlessly i know just what youre doing and im not falling for it in tones of deepest respect he told his superior you and commander judeth took outpost five three years ago sir when we first took responsibility for it from the haighlei you said the tour of duty was a vacation from trainees who couldnt molt without explicit written instructions aubri blinked mildly but his great golden eyes were twinkling with hidden amusement did i say that im cleverer than i thought well yes i think i remember outpost five now that you mention it pretty remote its hard to find volunteers to man it good place for a vacation if what you want is thunderstorms every evening fog every morning and just enough of the sun to taunt you about its existence theres a reason why the haighlei call that kind of territory a rain forest it is wetter than a swimming kyree well good thats one thing that wasnt in our lessons on manning outposts and theres nothing in the briefing blade read me that says anything about the weather there would you say the weather is difficult enough to become a hindrance to our duties sir he responded politely hindrance i suppose if youre the kind that thinks hes going to melt if he has to fly in the rain aubris mild manner turned just a trifle sharp as if giving tad subtle warning that hed better not be thinking any such thing his pupils dilated and constricted rapidly another sign of warning no one promised sunny beaches and halfday duty when you volunteered for the silvers it is dangerous to fly during thunderstorms sir blade put in politely verbally maneuvering tad from under aubris talons and it can be dangerous to take off during heavy fog we wont be doing white gryphon any favors if we get ourselves bunged up doing something stupid and they have to send in replacements and a rescue party if the weather can become difficult enough to be dangerous we ought to know about it in advance and know what warning signs to watch for we can always ground ourselves and wait out a dangerous storm well now thats true enough aubri was back to being the bumbling genial old uncle but i dont think i said anything to give either of you the impression that the weather was going to make it impossible to fly your regular patrols youll just have to be careful the way you were taught and be diligent in watching for developing problems thats all the thunderstorms arent violent just briefly torrential and the fog is always gone an hour after dawn both of which would have made his bones ache if hes having the same problems as my father aubri might be the oldest surviving gryphon from urthos forces he was certainly older than skandranon he looked it too his feathers were not as sleek or as perfectly preened as tads were in fact they were a bit ragged a trifle faded from what must have been his original colors of dark warm brown and tan now he was rustybrown and cream and even feathers just grown in looked a bit shabby like skandranon he was of the broadwing variety hawklike rather than falconiform but he was huskier than skandranon his raptoral prototype was probably the umbertailed hawkeagle rather than the goshawk there were signs of age in the delicate skin around his beak and eyes a webwork of faint wrinkles though those wrinkles were not as pronounced as the ones that humans got with increasing age there was no sign of age in the mind although you could not have told that from the way he was acting now acting indeed its all an act first to last the old fraud he never forgets anything ill bet he remembers the order in which every trainee finished the last run on the obstacle course two weeks ago aubri and judeth were adept at playing the allyantagonist game with aubri playing the absentminded and easilyfooled ally and judeth the sharpedged antagonist tad had caught onto the game in his first day of training but then he had seen both aubri and judeth all the time when he was growing up in particular he had watched absentminded and bumbling aubri best skandranon time and time again over a game of stones so it wasnt likely that he would ever be fooled into thinking that aubri wasnt as sharp as his human partner not that father would ever admit to losing a game to aubri except on purpose where is commander judeth by the way he asked for the whitehaired human cocommander of the silver gryphons had not been in evidence when the two of them arrived a few moments ago aubri jerked his beak toward the door still standing open as it had been when they arrived on warm pleasant days like this most of the inhabitants of white gryphon preferred to keep all doors and windows open to the sea breezes and aubri was no exception meeting with the haighlei theyre picking out the next set of silvers to be in shalamans personal guard when sella and vorn come back he preened a talon thoughtfully chewing on the very end of it his beak making little clicking sounds as he did so theyll probably take kally and reesk he added they cant resist matched sets you think so blade asked skeptically like tad she was aware that there were several pairs available for the duty whose skills were greater than the partners named aubri snorted his contempt for anyone who would choose the looks of a set of guards over their ability not that kally and reesk were bad no one was offered for shalamans guards who was bad for that matter anyone who wasnt up to aubris standards was generally asked to find some other vocation long before they got out of trainingand exceptions had better prove themselves within six months or they would have to return that coveted silver badge but by the yardstick of these that judeth and her partner picked to represent white gryphon in the service of the haighlei emperor these two were just average nevertheless they were showy their plumage of ruddy gold and bronze would complement the gold and lionskins of shalamans grand court and they could stand at perfect attention for hours without moving a feather tadrith pointed out all of those attributes the emperors chief advisor has other things to consider sir he finished politely it is very important protocolwise for the emperors guards to be as still as carvings all during court that stillness implies his power and control its not as if theyre ever going to have to do anything sir blade said injudiciously even assuming an assassin or madman got as far as the emperors guard hed take one look at a pair of gryphons in full battle rage and pass out tad winced that was not a bright thing to say not to a veteran of the great wars and the migration there was a slight grating as aubris talons reflexively scratched the terrazzo maybe aubri replied with a narroweyed glare in her direction that thoroughly cowed her maybe never assume anything young silver assumptions get you killed either you know or you make your plans for the worstcase contingency always never count on the best happening i thought we taught you better than that the ice behind his words would have done his partner judeth proud and his tone was so sharp that even an idiot would have known he had made a mistake blade flushed at the rebuke and snapped stiffly to attention aubri waited a moment to make certain that his words had taken effect then waved a talon at her and she relaxed but warily thats one mistake she wont make again now what was i saying outpost five he yawned all trace of the commander gone from his demeanor again he could have been any lazy old gryphon without a single interest beyond a place in the sun to rest a bit of good gossip and the quality and timely delivery of his next meal standard outpost all the comforts of home if you happen to be a hermit good hunting always pretty damp the nights are a bit chilly oh and the area is largely unexplored he gryphgrinned at tads illsuppressed look of eagerness figured that out did you if i were to guess and its only a guess id say your best bet might be gold quartz pebbles in the river and streambeds that match the kind ive seen in the past where gold can be panned and separated out we didnt bother looking when judeth and i were there were too old to go wading around in cold water sloshing pans about since youve got a twolegger with you it wouldnt hurt to do a little panning just to see if theres anything there no it wouldnt tad agreed as blade grimaced but nodded that would be the easiest way to find gold if aubri was right and the area was sitting atop a vein or even a lode chances were if they did find gold panning would be the only way any of it would be taken out of the place for a long time the haighlei would first have to perform a divination to see if the gods approved of mining there then they would have to wait for approval from shalaman himself then the priesthood and the emperor would make a joint declaration that mining would be permitted even then there would be no rush to sink mines shalaman himself would choose one person from among the handful born into the trade of mining expert to determine with the help of the priesthood where and when the first shaft should be sunk that person with the aid of his hereditary miners would dig the first shaft while a member of the priesthood watched to be certain it was all done as the gods deemed fit and appropriate if he struck the vein the whole process might be gone through again to see if the gods would allow a second mine in the forest if not it would be taken as a sign that the gods did not approve despite the earlier indications and the whole concern would be packed up and moved home protocol and meanwhile those citizens of white gryphon willing to endure primitive conditions for the sake of the possibility of a fortune would be industriously panning gold out of the streams with shalamans blessing and his tax collectors monitoring panning involved nothing that would change the forest the stream or the earth beneath both and so did not require the approval of the gods what else he asked and got the figure it out for yourself brat look from aubri i meant what supplies would you suggest we take he amended hastily blade took the hint and passed their list over to aubri who spread it out on the floor in front of him other than the usual kit i mean the one we learned in training this is what wed thought of adding so far he was rather proud of the fact that hed already put prospecting pans down after all if they didnt find any gold they could always bake pies in them aubri perused the list slowly rumbling a little to himself finally he looked up this is all very well thought out he said but it doesnt go far enough thats not your fault he added hastily as both tad and blades faces fell we train you fledges about regular outpost duty but five is almost twice as far away as any of the others that was why judeth and i went out there if we couldnt handle it we certainly didnt want to send any of you aubri and judeth shared the leadership of the silvers as cocommanders under skandranon tads father had turned over the actual working position to aubri not long after the affair of the eclipse ceremony more than twelve years ago skandranon had decided by then that he didnt want to be a leader not unless it was a leader in name only he much preferred to be the black gryphon or white gryphon depending on whether he was at khimbata and shalamans court or at home with his talons into everything the daytoday trivia of leadership bored him doing things made him happy aubri on the other hand found himself much to his surprise to be quite good at the daytoday trivia furthermore it amused him he said once to skandranon that after all that he had been through during the wars dealing with requisitions and stupid recruits was a positive pleasure the real truth was that he had long ago mastered the art of delegation and knew just who to saddle with the part of the job that he didnt care for and now with the able tutelage of his partner and cocommander judeth he very much enjoyed being a leader for the last three years or so both of them had been claiming that they were going to retire soon but not one creature in the silvers believed them neither of them was ever likely to enjoy retirement half so much as active duty it was tads opinion that what would probably happen was that a third cocommander would be appointed one in charge of the more physical aspect of the daily activities of the silvers and the minor decisions that didnt require an expert of the quality of either aubri or judeth judeth would remain in place as the overall commander in charge of major decisions and aubri in charge of training with which judeth would assist him now that i can see happening judeth doesnt much like climbing all over the city all day but theyre both so experienced that it would be stupid to turn over complete control of the silvers to someone youngerat least not until they are comfortable with his competence and aubri loves bamboozling the trainees yes that would make altogether too much sense which is probably why thats what theyll do theyre the two creatures in the whole world that i can trust to act sensibly tad couldnt imagine the silvers without aubri and judeth in charge it would have to happen someday but he couldnt imagine what that day would be like when it came now look you two aubri was saying you are going to be a long long way from the city it might be hard to get things to you if something wears out or breaks just because something minor like your water pump goes out that doesnt mean were going to rip open a gate to send one to you gates are expensive and you have perfectly sound limbs for carrying water in buckets tad was taken aback and so was blade that simply hadnt occurred to him living among mages had made him think of gates being put up quite casually gryphons flew mages made gates it was that simple but now he realized that although a gate went up just about every two or three days they didnt stay up for very long and what was more they didnt even go up to the same place more often than once every month or two there were just a lot of outposts and other farflung ventures to supply and that was what had made it seem as if gating was commonplace and simple aubris eyes twinkled your gates will be opened at the scheduled times not one moment earlier unless its a real emergency of a lifethreatening nature they will remain open for only the scheduled times so if theres more stuff youve asked for than can be chucked through in a hurry thats too bad you may have to wait through several resupply opportunities for your water pump so what does that mean silvers manuals blade said with resignation adding them to the list well need repair manuals all the repair tools wed need will be there already right and the manuals too dont worry that outposts been open a long time and remember that judeth and i were there first we had the rank to order whatever we thought should be in place out there try again blade chewed a nail and frowned as she thought her brows furrowed and her eyes darkened until they were nearly blueblack um you said its really damp humid he nodded theres fog there isnt there every morning and rain every evening she brightened bladders seals anything made of leather or woodor metal that might rust repair parts that can get ruined by damp that would be forthe water pump the stove the plumbing she began to scribble good aubri turned to tad who fortunately had an answer waiting because he already knew aubris prejudices hed heard the litany often enough when he was still living at home the kind of equipment that might go missing or get spoiled by damp that doesnt rely on magic to work he said promptly things like firestrikers tinder boxes trace sextant and compass for surveying ah he pummeled his brain aubri nodded dont strain yourself since youve just shown me that you know the principle ill give you a list its basically a few common replacement parts and some old army gear wont add that much to your load but there isnt much you cant do with it if you put your mind to the problem he didnt even move he just stretched out a claw and stabbed a piece of paper already waiting on the top of the goldenwood desk that stood just within snatching distance he must have been ready for them once again proving that he wasnt nearly as absentminded as he seemed blade took it from him and tad noticed that she seemed a bit bemused probably because she had a tendency to take everything and everyone at face value and every time aubri went into his senile old featherhead act she fell for it well she cant help it this was her big weakness and tad had a good idea why she wasnt likely to cure it any time soon part of the problem was that she just didnt want to look past the surface masks that everyone wore no matter how honest and genuine they were tads partner just didnt want to know what surprises might lie beneath those polite masks that empathy thing of hers bothered her and if she could have had it surgically removed tad had it figured that she would have done so no matter what the risk and there were reasons behind that as well she had realized a long time ago that she would never ever be as good as her father at delving into peoples hearts and souls she was the kind of person who if she couldnt excel at something didnt want to try silly not every mage can be a snowstar but the hedgewizards can do plenty of things he hasnt got the time for or even do subtle things he cant do at all well itd be flogging pointlessly to take that up with her at least now maybe after weve been out there a while and we ve had a lot of peace and privacy that particular twitch of hers bothered him though and he wanted to have it straightened out before too very long any amount of mindmagic was useful the more so in someone who might well be supposed to boast nothing of the sort father always says that if youve got an ability its stupid not to train and use it even if it isnt something that youd use very often blade compared the two lists and added several items to theirs before she handed the one aubri had given her back to him tad was pleased to note that she had not needed to copy the whole thing down so they hadnt done so badly on their own iwonder if there was a bone setting kit on aubris list though it certainly fits his criteria of nonmagical and spoiled by damp but oh the weight if only someone could come up with better splints and casting material it seems so stupid to be hauling wood and powdered rock aubri crossed his forelegs in front of him and regarded both of them with a benign almost paternal expression on his face well two more of my fledges go out to prove their wings i think youll like the post neither of you are the kind to pine after a city when you can thrash around in the forest and see things no one else ever has before he sighed adventures are for the young who havent got bone aches now meim happy to be here in white gryphon where i can sunbathe every day but there should be enough new discoveries there to make even two youngsters like you happy he did not mention that he knew their personal prime reason for being so happy with this assignment getting away from their beloved families he had never acted as if he recognized them as skandranons and amberdrakes offspring well he wouldnt not while we were in training but hes never even mentioned our parents casually maybe he is a little absentminded in that direction maybe he doesnt recognize us now that were grown were looking forward to it sir he said honestly and itll be nice to be away from home for the first time aubri nodded then grinned oh you arent the only ones whove been interested in long assignments outside the city believe it or not i told judeth that she should never assign anyone to five who didnt have a good reason for being there as well as a good reason for getting away from home ive never seen anyone who fit those qualifications better than you two and to tell you the truth i had a third reason to want you out thereyoure a twoandfour team thats a good combination for an outpost that was a gryphon paired with a human that particular team was not all that usual among the silvers people tended to team up with members of their own species usually the twoandfours were default teams made up of those who couldnt find a compatible partner among their own kind quite often they broke up after training when a senior silver could take a junior out of training as a partner those who were in default twoandfours generally did just that i like a twoandfour for these remote postings aubri continued then got that twinkle back in his eye the teams are more flexible more versatile even if some people think theres something wrong with a gryphon who doesnt team up with one of his own tad stared back at his superior with his head held high and challenge in his gaze hed heard that one before and it didnt ruffle his feathers oh does that include you too sir aubri laughed of course it does everyone knows im a twisted personality all of us war veterans are warped it comes with combat whats your excuse tad grinned back as the perfect answer came to him family tradition sir he responded immediately prompting aubri into another bray of laughter well said and i cant wait to tell the black boy what you just told me if that doesnt make his nares redden nothing will he shook his head and the feathers rustled now you two run along give that list to the supply officer hell see to getting your basket packed up all you need to worry about is your own kit they both stood and snapped to attention aubri chuckled and rose slowly to his feet to let them outold maybe but not dead yet as tad had expected his father already knew about the posting and was outwardly and loudly enthusiastic if he had beaten every contender and been appointed as judeths subcommander skandranon could not have been more thrilled it was positively embarrassing as they gathered for the evening meal in the main room of the family aerie with the sky a dark velvet studded with jewellike stars beyond the window tad wondered if he shouldnt have opted for a quiet bite aloneor perhaps have gone hungry outpost duty and you fresh out of training he kept saying all through dinner i cant ever remember any silver as young as you are being put on remote duty his tone was forced though and he hadnt eaten more than half his meal at the least this sudden change in his sons status had put him off his feed was he worried why should he be worried whats there to be worried about zhaneel skandranons mate cuffed him lightly let the boys eat she admonished him you wont be doing tadrith any favor by giving him no time to have a proper meal but her look of rebuke followed by a glance at keeth made skandranons nares flush red with embarrassment he had been neglecting keeth the whole time although keeth didnt seem too terribly unhappy about that i hear fine reports about you from winterhart he said hastily to his other son youre training in things your mother and i dreamed of doing but were never able to achieve tad winced now if that didnt sound forced hed eat grass instead of good meat well if there hadnt been that annoying war father you two would probably have invented the gryphon trondiirn the gryphon kestrachern and the gryphon secretary keeth said with a sly grin at his brother and probably the gryphon seamstress mason and carpenter as well trust keeth to know how to turn it into a joke bless him skandranon laughed and this time it sounded genuine and a bit more relaxed and maybe we would have he replied rousing his feathers too bad that war interfered with our budding genius heh tad kept silent and tore neat bites from his dinner the leg of a huge flightless bird the size of a cow and with the brains of a mudturtle one of these creatures fed the whole family the haighlei raised them for their feathers herding them on land that cattle or sheep would damage with overgrazing the gryphons found these creatures a tasty alternative to beef and venison tad was perfectly pleased to let clever keeth banter with their father he couldnt think of anything to say not when beneath the black gryphons pride lurked a tangle of emotions that he couldnt even begin to unravel but he was more and more certain that one of them was a fear that skandranon would never admit to of course not he doesnt want to cripple me with indecision or even fear of my own before i go out there with blade he knows that if he shows hes unhappy with this i might be tempted to back out of it and he knows that theres nothing to worry about we re hardly the first team to ever take this outpost we re just the first team that included one of his sons and hes been thinking about all the accidents that could happen to us ever since he heard of the posting he was worrying too much tad knew that and he knew that his father knew it as well this was not wartime and they were not going to encounter hostile troops but this is the first time im leaving the nest i suppose its perfectly normal for parents to worry i worry too but i know that it can be done i wonder why parents can say they trust their young so much yet still fear for them he supposed that a parents imagination could conjure up a myriad of other dangers from illness to accident and play them out in the space of a heartbeat parents had to be that way they had to anticipate all the trouble youngsters could get into and be prepared to pluck them out of danger before they got too deeply into it but im an adult and i can take care of myself isnt he ever going to figure that out he has been an adult for ages longer than i have and he has had to be rescued beforeso why is it that adults regard trouble as the sole territory of the young do we remind them of their vulnerability that much between bites he cast a glance at his mother surprising her in an openly concerned and maternal gaze at him she started to look away then evidently thought better of it and nodded slightly mothers worried but she admits it father wont which will make it worse on him and theres no reason for either of them to worry at all maybe the more intelligent a parent is the more they worry because then they are able to see more of what could go wrong the kaledain quarters know that they could concentrate just as much on what could go right but when it comes to childrenor young adultsit could be smartest to have only grudging optimism still he spared a thought for blade who was probably undergoing the same scrutiny at the hands of her parents and sighed he didnt know how amberdrake and winterhart would be reacting to this but blade had threatened to spend the night with friends rather than go home to face them tad had managed to persuade her to change her mind it could be much worse he told himself they could be so overprotective that they refuse to let me take the post or worse than that they could be indifferent a couple of his classmates had parents like that tad had heard mages speculating that the raptor instinct ran so strongly in them that it eclipsed what urtho had intended those parents were loving enough as long as their young were in the nest they began to lose interest in them when they fledged just exactly as raptor parents did eventually when the young gryphons reached late adolescence and independence their parents did their best to drive them away if they had not already left such pairs were more prolific than those who were more nurturing raising as many as six or eight young in a reproductive lifetime but those offspring were as aubri would say glorified gamehawks they lived mostly for the hunt and while extremely athletic were not very long in the intelligence department most of the gryphonic fatalities at white gryphon had occurred among this group which for the most part were assigned to hunting to supplement the meat supply of the city they were very much like goshawks in focus and temper they would fly into the ground or a cliff during a chase and break their foolish necks or go out in wretched weather and become a victim of exposure some simply vanished without anyone ever knowing what happened to them aubri had said once in tads hearing that a majority of the fatalities in gryphontroops of the warother than those attributable to human commanders who saw all nonhumans as expendable and deployed them that waywere also among this type of gryphon needless to say the type had been in the minority among those that had reached safe haven here and were not likely to persist into a third generation not at the rate that they were eliminating themselves at least when they werent hunting they could usually be found lounging about on the sunning platform with others of their kind either attempting to impress likeminded females or comparing wingmuscles granted there was always a bit of that going on among young gryphons but this lot acted like that all the time very attractive to look at perhaps but as trysting mates or playfighters i dont think i could stand them so while skandranon was probably thinking over how many young gryphons of tadriths generation had been lost it was not occurring to him what those unfortunate fatalities had in common sayan absolute dearth of brains a squandering of what they had and most importantly a lack of decent parenting keeping a young ones body alive was one thing but it only created more breeders to do the same with the next generation they bred even a charming young idiot can succeed with good parenting im proof of that arent i his father had lost some of his selfconsciousness and was now speaking normally to keeth and zhaneel about some modification winterhart had made to the standard obstacle course in order to train trondiirn tad took full advantage of their absorption to get some more of his meal down in peace skandranon was an odd sight just now halfway into a molt he was piebald black and white the white feathers were his natural colornowand the black were dyed he dyed himself whenever he was due to visit khimbata in his capacity as special representative of white gryphon ever since the eclipse ceremony when he had come diving dramatically down out of the vanishing sun to strike down an assassin who would have murdered emperor shalaman winterhart and probably several more people as well hed been virtually forced to wear his black gryphon guise whenever he visited he had rescued shalaman the black king as the black gryphonand in a culture that set a high value on things that never changed he was mentally set in that persona whenever he returned to the site of his triumph the gryphon king beloved where eer he goes that was what aubri had said to his face mockingly but the real irony of the statement was that it was true he never left khimbata without being loaded down with gifts of all sorts his jewelry collection was astonishing if he and zhaneel wore all of it at one time theyd never get off the ground between us if were lucky keeth and i might manage to be a quarter as famous as he isand then most of it will be due to the fact that were his sons that could have been a depressing thought if tad had any real ambition but to be frank he didnt hed seen the negative effects of all that adulation how it was always necessary for skandranon to be charming witty and unfailingly polite no matter what he personally felt like how when the family visited khimbata skandranon had barely a moment to himself and none to spare for them and how even at home there was always someone who wanted something from him he was always getting gifts and a great many of those gifts came with requests attached even when they didnt there was always the chance that a demand phrased as a request would come later perhaps when he wasnt expecting it and was off his guard there was no way for skandranon to know whether someone wanted his friendship because of what he was or because of who he wasand the difference was critical no thank you i am very fond of obscurity all things considered it would be no bad thing to be an obscure silver always assigned to the outposts hopefully collecting enough extra from his discoveries to finance a comfortable style of living let keeth collect all the notoriety of being the first gryphon trondiirn tad would be happy to donate whatever measure of fame fate had in store for him to his brother just as he had finished that thought he noticed that the others were looking at him evidently keeth had run out of things to say and it was his turn again oh bother skandranon cleared his throat as always the sound an affectation acquired from living so much with humans sounded very odd coming from a gryphon it sounds as if hes trying to cough up a hairball actually well skandranon said heartily your mother and i are very interested in hearing about this outpost youre being sent to what do you know about it tad sighed with resignation and submitted himself to the unrelenting pressure of parental love blade couldnt bring herself to sit although she managed to keep from pacing along the edge of the cliff the stone here was a bit precarious for pacinghow ignoble if she should slip and fall breaking something and force judeth and aubri to send someone else to the outpost after all tad would never ever forgive me or elsehed take a new partner and go and i would be left behind to endure parental commiserations ikala sat on a rock and watched the sunset rather than her hed asked her to meet him here for a private farewell her emotions were so mixed now that she honestly didnt know what to say to him so far he hadnt said anything to her and she waited for him to begin he cleared his throat still without looking at her so you leave tomorrow for several months im told of course he knew her assignment everyone in the silvers did he was just using the question as a way to start the conversation the sun ventured near to the ocean soon it would plunge down below the line of the horizon her throat and tongue felt as if they belonged to someone else yes she finally replied now she knew why people spoke of being tonguetied it had been incredibly difficult just to get that single word out she wanted to say more to ask if he would miss her if he was angry that she was leaving just as their friendship looked to become something more she wanted to know if he was hurt that she hadnt consulted him or chosen him as her partner instead of tad above all she wanted to know what he was thinking instead she couldnt say anything come and sit he said gesturing at the rocks beside him you do not look comfortable im not she said silently im as twitchy as a nervous cat but she sat down anyway warily gingerly the sunwarmed rock felt smooth beneath her hand worn to satinsoftness by hundreds of years of wind and water she concentrated on the rock mentally holding to its solidity and letting it anchor her heart i am both happy for you and sad blade ikala said as if he was carefully weighing and choosing each word i am happy for you because you are finally being grantedwhat you have earned it is a good thing but i am sad because you will be gone for months he sighed although he did not stir blade held herself tensely waiting for him to continue but he said nothing more she finally turned toward him i wanted an assignment like this one very much she agreed im not certain i can explain why though but unexpectedly as he halfturned to meet her eyes he smiled let me try he suggested and there was even a suggestion of selfdeprecating humor you feel smothered by your honored parents and perversely wish for their approval of a life so different from theirs additionally you fear that their influence will either purchase you an easier assignment than you warrant or will insure that you are never placed in any sort of danger you wish to see what you can do with only the powers of your own mind and your own skills and if you are not far away from them you are certain you will never learn the answer to that question yes she exclaimed startled by his insight but how did you then she read the message behind that rueful smile the shrug of the darkskinned shoulders you came here for the same reason didnt you he nodded once and his deep brown eyes showed that same selfdeprecating humor that had first attracted her the same and that is why although i wish that you were not going so far or for so long or that we were going to the same placei wanted you to know that i am content to wait upon your return we will see what you have learned and what that learning has made of you and you think i will be different she licked her lips with a dry tongue at least in part he offered you may return a much different person than the one you are now not that i believe that i will no longer care much for that different person but that person and i may prove to be no more than the best of friends and comradesinarms and that will not be a bad thing though it is not the outcome i would prefer she let out her breath and relaxed he was being so reasonable about this that she could hardly believe her ears i dont know she admitted i think ive spent so much time proving who im not that i dont know who i am so go and find out he told her and laughed now reaching out to touch her hand briefly the touch sent a shivery chill up her arm you see i had to come here to do the same thing so i have some understanding of the process are you glad that you came here she asked wondering if the question was too personal and wishing he would do more than just touch her hand now it was his turn to look away into the sunset for a moment on the wholeyes he told her although in doing so it became impossible to follow the alternate path i might have taken there was a maiden back in my fathers courtbut she was impatient and did not like it that i chose to go somewhere other than to the court of another emperor she saw my choice as a lessening of my status and my leaving as a desertion of her i have heard that she wedded elsewhere one of my more traditional halfbrothers ohim sorry she said quickly awkwardly but he turned back to her and did not seem particularly unhappy as he ran his hand across his stiff black curls there is not a great deal to be sorry about he pointed out if she saw it as desertion she did not know me if i could not predict that she would i did not know her so he shrugged since it was not long before my sorrow was gone i suspect my own feelings were not as deep as she would have liked nor as i had assumed its not as if you were lacking in people willing to console you here she pointed out recklessly with a feeling of breathlessness that she couldnt explain she laughed to cover it and that is also true his smile broadened and it was not long before i felt no real need of such consolation as i had another interest to concentrate on her feeling of breathlessness intensified this was the nearest he had come to flirting with her and yet behind the playfulness there was more than a hint of seriousness did she want that she didnt know and nowshe was very glad that she was going to have three months to think about it well i think on the whole it will be a good thing for you to have six months to learn what it is that blade is made of he said in a lighter tone and i shall have the benefit of knowing that there will be no other young men at this outpost that may convince you to turn your attentions elsewhere so any decisions you makeconcerning our friendshipwill be decisions made by you only she snorted as if any young man could make me change my mind about anything important she replied just a little sharply which only proves that i cannot claim to know you any better than any other friend he countered you see this much i do understand you have a strong sense of duty and that will always be the first in your heart i would like to think that i am the same so whatever we must reconcile ourselves to that before we make any other commitments it was her turn to shrug that seems reasonable but it isnt exactly romantic that last came out much more plaintively than she had expected or intended well if it is a romantic parting that you wish he grinned i can be both practical and romantic as i suspect can you he took one of her hands but only one and looked directly into her eyes silverblade i crossed an empire i left my land and all i have ever known i did not expect to find someone like you here and yeti do not follow some of my peoples reasoning that all is foredestined but it sometimes seems as if i was drawn here because you were here now i know something of what i am i believe that there is in you a spirit that would make a match for my own if in the end a few months more will bring us together such a wait will be no hardship he patted her hand i trust that is romance enough for your practical soul she laughed giddily i think so she said feeling as lightheadedas if she had just drunk an entire bottle of wine iim not nearly that eloquent neither is the falcon he said releasing her hand but she is admirable for her grace without need of eloquence go become a passage bird silverblade when you return we shall try out hunting in a cast of two blade hadnt needed to do all that much packing last night but she had pretended that she didand as soon as she was done she blew out her candle and willed herself to sleep the need for rest was real and if she had not torn herself away from her overlyconcerned parents she would not have gotten any they would have kept her up all night with questions most of which she didnt have any answers to since all of them were fairly philosophical rather than practical she dressed quickly and quietly and without relighting her candle with any luck only her mother would be awake winterhart for some reason seemed to be handling this better than her spouse dont people usually complain that their mothers never see them as grown up she thought as she pulled on a pair of light boots then fastened the silver gryphon badge to the breast of her tunic the silvers had no regular uniform judeth thought it better that they wear the same clothing as those around them uniforms might remind people too much of the regular troops and war and even the most battlehardened wanted to put warfare far behind them nowif i can just walk quietly enough i might be able to get out of here without another discussion of my lifeview her father amberdrake was notorious for sleeping lateto be fair it was usually because hed been up late the night before workingand she hoped by rising with the first light she might avoid him at breakfast but no when she carried her two small packs out to leave beside the door she saw that there were candles burning in the rest of the house amberdrake was already up in fact as soon as she turned toward the rear of the dwelling she saw him dressed alert and in the little nook at the back of the main room that they used for meals waiting for her but so was her mother which might temper things a bit she sighed while her face was still in shadow and he couldnt see her expression breakfast with amberdrake was always a bit strained at the best of times and this was not going to be the best of times he keeps remembering when he was the chief kestrachern and it was his habit to find out about his fellows when they all drifted in for breakfast he keeps trying to do the same thing with me good morning father she said feeling terribly awkward as she approached the tiny table youre not usually up so early she wondered if amberdrakes smile was strained he was too good at keeping a serene mask for her to tell however it was obvious that he had taken special pains with his appearance silk tunic and trews rawsilk coat some of his haighlei giftjewelry and zhaneels feather in his hair you d think he was having an audience with shalaman she regarded him objectively for a moment he was still a strikingly handsome man despite the white streaks in his hair her father scarcely looked his age in the low magelight above the table and the warm browns and ambers of his clothing disguised in part the fact that there were dark circles under his eyes caused by worrying no doubt i didnt want to miss saying goodbye to you silverblade he said his voice quite calm and controlled if i slept until a decent hour i knew that i would you dawn risers are enough to make a normal persons eyes cross she knew that her answering laugh was a bit strained but there was no help for it and you night prowlers are enough to make people like me scream when we think of all the perfectly good daylight you waste sleeping she slid into the seat opposite him and helped herself to fresh bread and preserves he reached across the table and added thinlysliced cold meat to the plate quite firmly she didnt really want anything that substantial first thing in the morning but she knew better than to say so why start an argument that would be a poor way to leave her parents what can it hurt to nibble a piece to please him it cant of course not that long ago she would have protested now she knew there was no point in doing so shed only hurt his feelings he was only trying to help and after today he wont be able to be so meddlingly helpful for six whole months i should be pitying the people gryphon and human and hertasi alike who will wind up as my surrogates for his concern she ate one slice of the meat which was dry and tasted like a mouthful of salty old leather and went back to her bread amberdrake pushed a cup of hot tea toward her then made a move as if he was about to serve her a bowl of hot porridge from the pot waiting beside him oh no she exclaimed not for anything would she eat porridge not even for the sake of pleasing her father none of that not when im flying i do not want to decorate the landscape underneath me amberdrake flushed faintly and pulled his hand back sorry i forgot that you didnt inherit my impervious stomach no she inherited my questionable one stop badgering the child dear winterhart emerged at last from the rear of the dwelling putting the last touches on her hair blade admired the way she moved with a twinge of envy winterhart managed to combine a subtle sensuality with absolute confidence and a nononsense competence that blade despaired of emulating now if i looked like that ah well too bad i inherited mothers interior instead of her exterior unlike her mate winterhart had not dressed for a special occasion which much relieved blade her costume of a long linen split skirt tunic and kneelength manypocketed vest was similar to anything she would wear on any other day the only concession she had made to amberdrakes sartorial splendor was to harmonize with his browns and ambers with her own browns and creams i hope we wont be unwelcome but we would like to see you and tadrith leaving blade winterhart said quite casually as if they were only leaving for a few days not six months we do know how to stay out from underfoot after all yours is not the first expedition weve seen on its way now it was her turn to flush well of course i want you there to see us off of course you wont be in the way she replied acutely embarrassed i would never think that the only trouble was deep down inside she had been thinking precisely that she gulped down her cooling tea to cover her embarrassment and guilty conscience as amberdrake toyed with a piece of bread reducing it to a pile of crumbs hes trying to pretend that he isnt worried trying to put on a brave face when i know hes feeling anything but brave why why is he so worried if hes transparent enough for me to see through he must be all of a knot inside finally amberdrake looked up at her slowly chewing on his lower lip i know i probably seem as if i am overreacting to this situation kechara he said quietly i shouldnt be so worked up over the simple fact that you and your partner are going off on a normal peaceful assignment i realize that i am being quite foolish about this and i cant even pretend that i have some mysterious presentiment of doom its all due to oldwell i suppose youd have to call them habits habits of feeling perhaps winterhart stood behind him and put her hands on his shoulders gently massaging muscles that must have been terribly tense outside seabirds cried greeting the dawn and the winds that would carry them out to their fishing grounds amberdrake reached up and covered one of his mates hands with his own i have two problems with this assignment really and neither of them is rational the first is that it is you my daughter who is going off for six months to a place that is unsettlingly far away and youll be all alone there except for a single gryphon if it were someone else i would see him or her off with a cheerful heart and go about my business but it isnt she stated no he sighed and patted winterharts hand your mother is handling this better than i i have perfect confidence in aubri and judeth winterhart said serenely they wouldnt send anyone that far away who wasnt prepared for any contingency her tone turned just a little sharp as she looked down at him if you wont trust blade dearheart at least trust them intellectually i do amberdrake protested its justits just that its hard to convince the emotions he turned back to blade who was even more embarrassed at her parents decision to bare his soul to her she struggled not to show it and underneath the embarrassment was exasperation cant he learn that i am grown now and dont need him to come haul me out of difficulties cant he just let me go the other problem i have is very old older than you by far he told her earnestly and it has absolutely nothing to do with your abilities its something i would still feel even if you were a warrior out of legend with magical weapons at your side it doesnt matter to my heart that this is peace time that you are simply going off to man a wilderness outpost the point to my reaction is that you are going out when momentary pain ghosted over his expressive features when people used to go out back in the days of the wars they didnt always come back she opened her mouth to protest he forestalled her i know this is peacetime i know you are not going forth to combat an enemy i know that there is no enemy but storms and accident but i still have the emotional reaction to seeing people going out on a quasimilitary mission and that fact that it is my daughter that is doing so only makes the reaction worse he smiled thinly you cannot reason with an old emotional problem i am afraid she looked down at the polished wood of the tabletop and made little patterns with her forefinger tracing the grain of the wood what on earth did he expect her to say what could she say that was years and years ago before i was even born cant he have gotten over it by now hes supposed to be the great magician of the emotions so why cant he keep his own trained to heel what could possibly go wrong with this assignment well have a teleson with us we ii be reporting in and if there is a lifethreatening emergency and they cant get help to us quickly they ii take the risk and gate us back but that wasnt what he wanted to hear and it wouldnt help anything to say it i can understand at least i think i can ill try she finished lamely true it is nothing but wilderness between here and therebut when we get there well be in a fortified outpost built to withstand storm siege or earthquake and granted no one has even tried to explore all the rainforest in between but well be flying not walking what could possibly knock us out of the sky that our people or the haighlei wouldnt have encountered a long long time ago it wasbarelypossible that some magemade creatures of maars survived from the cataclysm it was less likely that any of them could have made it this far south and even if they did there had never been that many of them that could threaten a gryphon the last makaar died ages ago and there never was anything else that could take a flying gryphon down well be flying too high for any projectile to hurt us and even if we werent thereii be the mass of the carrybasket and all our supplies between us and a marksman father i promise you well be fine she only said choking down a last dry mouthful of bread makaar are extinct and nothing less could even ruffle tadriths feathers youve seen him hes one of the biggest strongest gryphons in the silvers but amberdrake shook his head blade its not that i dont trust or believe in you but there is far more in this world than you or tadrith have ever seen there were more mages involved in the mage wars than just urtho and maar plenty of them created some very dangerous creatures too and not all of them were as shortlived as makaar i will admit that we are a long distance from the war zones but we got this far so whos to say that other things couldnt hes not going to listen to me she realized hes determined to be afraid for me no matter what i say there was more likelihood of moving the population of the city up to the rim of the canyon than there was of getting amberdrake to change his mind when it was made up whats more as you very well know the magestorms that followed the cataclysm altered many many otherwise harmless creatures and conjured up more his jaw firmed stubbornly you ask snowstar if you dont believe me some of the territory we passed through was unbelievable and that was only after a year or so of magestorms battering at it we were very very lucky that most of the things we encountered were minimally intelligent sports and changechildren die out in less than a generation she retorted letting her impatience get the better of her thats simple fact father therere just too many things wrong with most magicmade creatures for them to live very long if theyve been created by accident he raised an elegant eyebrow at her and the expression on his face told her shed been caught in a mistake urtho was not infallible he said quietly he had many accidents in the course of creating some of his new creatures one of those accidents was responsible for the creation of intelligence in kyree and another for intelligence in hertasi and neither race has died out within a generation she had already spotted the flaw in his argument an accident may have been responsible for the intelligence of the creature but not the creature itself she countered creature creation takes great thought planning and skill an accident is simply not going to be able to duplicate that he looked as if he were going to say something but subsided instead besides blade continued taking her advantage while she still had it people have been going to this outpost for years and no one has seen anything either there or on the way dont you think by now if there was going to be any trouble someone would have encountered it amberdrake dropped his eyes in defeat and shook his head there you have me he admitted except for one thing we dont know what lies beyond that outpost and its immediate area the haighlei have never been there and neither have we for all we know theres an army of refugees from the wars about to swarm over you or a renegade wizard about to take a force of his own across the land and that blade said with finality is precisely why we will be there in the first place it is our duty to be vigilant he couldnt refute that and he didnt try blade extracted herself from her parents with the promise that she and tad would not take off until they arrived with one pack slung over her back and the other suspended from her shoulder she hurried up the six levels of staircase that led in turn to the narrow path which would take her to the top of the cliff she was so used to running up and down the ladderlike staircases and the switchback path that she wasnt even breathing heavily when she reached the top she had spent almost all of her life here after all and verticality was a fact of life at white gryphon below on the westwardfacing cliff the city was built from she had been in cool shadow she ascended as the invisible sun rose and both she and the sun broke free of the clinging vestiges of night at the same time golden fingers of light met and caressed her as she took the last few steps on the path it would be a perfect morning there were no clouds marring the horizon to presage storms to the east red skies were lovelybut red skies required clouds if i am going to be traveling i prefer a morning like this one not a cloud in the sky and the air dry cool and quiet at the top of the cliff a great expanse of meadow and farmland composed of gently rolling hills stretched out before her it was completely indefensible of course like kavenusho urthos stronghold there was no decent high ground to defend this was why the city itself had been built into the cliff with the only access being a single narrow path you couldnt even rain boulders down on white gryphon from above for the path had been cut into the cliff so cleverly that it channeled objects falling down from the edge away from the city entirely judeths idea but it took some very clever stonecrafters to put her idea into solid form at the edge were large constructions of wooden frames and pulleys that could lower huge amounts of material down to the first level of the city that was how food was brought down from the farms up here those could be dismantled or destroyed in mere moments by a very few people nothing that was up here would be left to be used by an enemy if there ever was an attack the farmers used to live in white gryphon and travel up each day to tend their flocks and fields now they didnt bother with the trip there was a second village up here on the rim a village of farmhouses and barns a few warehouses and workshops and the pens where herds were brought during the few days of each year that the weather was too bad to keep the herds in the fields if severe winter storms came from the sea instead of the landward side the herds could be driven into the shelter of the forest and those who were not sent to watch over them could take shelter within the rock walls of white gryphon the stockade and supply warehouse of the silvers was up here as well space was too precious in the city for any to be wasted on bulk stores except in an emergency and as for the stockade most punishment involved physical labor in the fields with the proceeds going to pay back those who had been wronged since most crime in the city involved theft or minor damage that was usually acceptable to the victims there had been thosea fewwho were more dangerous those were either imprisoned up here under bindings ordealt with out of the sight of the city after hadanelith no one was ever exiled again the possibility that another dangerous criminal might survive exile was too great to risk just outside the stockade was a landing platform sitting squarely in the middle of it was what appeared to be a large basket about the size of a sixperson expeditiontent there was a complicated webbing of ropes attached to it and standing nearby was tadrith with a hertasi helping him into a heavy leather harness as usual he was carrying on a running dialogue with his helper trying to get his harness adjusted perfectly she knew better than to interrupt her life would depend on that harness and whether or not he was comfortable in it this was the carrybasket that would take her and all their supplies to the outpost it looked far far too heavy for tadrith to fly with and it was even the strongest of gryphons would not have been able to lift her alone in it unaided but magic was working reliably enough these days and there would be a mage somewhere around who had made certain that the basket and anything that might be in it would weigh nothing with a reserve for changes in momentum and speed he would essentially have made the basket into a variant of one of the kaledain floatingbarges tadrith would not be lifting the basket only guiding it the spell was a complicated one that blade couldnt even begin to understand anything inside the basketlike herselfwould still have its apparent weight if that wasnt the case everything not tied down would be in danger of drifting off on a stiff breeze but to tad although the basket had no upanddown weight it would still have a certain amount of sidetoside mass and momentum he would not be lifting it but he would have to exert some strength in pulling it just as teams of dyheli and horses pulled the floating barges blade hurried up to check the supplies lashed down inside the basket as aubri had promised the supply sergeant had taken care of everything she and tad would need except for their own personal gear most of the supplies they had requisitionedthe ones for after they reached the outposthad already been sent on via gate so only what they would need for the trip what there had not been time to send by the gate and what she had brought with her would actually travel with them thats certainly going to relieve tad it had also relieved tad when she told him that she was nothing like her father when it came to wardrobe she could manage very simply actually but aubri had once described amberdrakes floatingbarge and if gryphons could have blanched tad would have at the thought of having to help move all that mass of clothing gear and furniture she tossed her two bags into the basket and waited quietly beside the platform for the last of the adjustments to be made the hertasi in charge was gestens daughter ghana as thorough and meticulous as her father she would not leave tadriths side until they were both satisfied with the fit of every strap blade knew that every buckle would be checked and rechecked every rivet and every ring subjected to the most exacting scrutiny ghana would leave nothing to chance and there was no possible compromise with safety in her view finally she stepped back itll do she said in her hissing hertasi voice try to bring the rig back in one piece blade suppressed a laugh for the remark was so like gesten that it could have been he who was standing there like her father ghana would never admit to concern for the trainees she served only to concern that the equipment return intact but of course it went without saying that if the equipment came back to the warehouse in pristine condition the trainee would certainly have arrived at the landing platform in like shape tad waved her over as ghana began hooking up his harness to the basket itself were waiting for the parents i presume he said casually she sighed much as i would like to simply slip away if we leave without allowing them their fanfare they may not let us come back or we may not want to he groaned and flexed his claws restlessly because when we did theyd make our lives sheer misery with guilt she laughed and patted him on the shoulder parents always know how to pull your strings she advised him after all they attached those strings in the first place do i hear someone borrowing my words the newcomer to the conversation was as elegant as amberdrake in dress and demeanor though far less flamboyant blade knew him too well to blush of course uncle snowstar she retorted you werent using them so why shouldnt i he chuckled at her impertinence next to skandranon she was the only person likely to take that tone with him it was not wise to risk the anger of an adeptlevel mage as powerful as snowstar as others even his own underlings had found out to their sorrow i dont think youll have any trouble with the basketspells tadrith he said turning to the young gryphon they are as tight as any ive ever set blade had assumed her adoptive uncle had come to see them off along with her parents she was astonished to hear him say that he himself had placed the magics on their carrybasket that would make it possible to fly with it you set them uncle she said making no secret of her surprise isnt thatwell rather beneath me he laughed first of all it is always a good idea for a mage to keep in practice on anything he might be asked to do and secondly if something were to fail magically on your basket he shrugged suggestively suffice it to say it was easier and safer to do the work myself than have to explain to your parents why i let some inferior mage do it blade nodded ruefully only too true she told him she would have said more but at that moment she caught the sound of familiar voices from below the edge of the cliff at nearly the same moment tad pointed warningly with his beak at a trio of rapidly approaching gryphons who could only be his parents and sibling all we need now are judeth and aubri to make this show complete blade groaned resigning herself to a long and complicated farewell that would shave precious time off the amount of daylight they could have used for traveling is that a complaint or a request commander judeth stalked out of the door to the silvers clifftop headquarters but she was smiling rather than frowning she was not kaledain her hair before it turned to snowy white had been a dark blonde and her eyes a clear graygreen nevertheless she had been one of urthos generals who understood the value of her nonhuman troops and deployed them with care and consideration and no one had been unhappy to find her among the kleshya when the last gate came down she had proved her worth over and over both during their retreat from lands racked by magestorms and at white gryphon with her partner aubri she had organized the first beginnings of the silvers and the silvers in their turn bore the stamp of her personality she alone of all of them wore anything like a uniform a black tunic and trews modeled from the tattered originals of her old dress uniforms the gryphonbadge stood out proudly against such an elegant background she stopped just short of the platform and looked sardonically from tad to blade and back again can i take it from that remark that you think i might be a hindrance to a timely departure she continued blade flushed and the old woman allowed a hint of a smile to steal across her lips i assure you aubri and i came here solely to make certain that your loving relatives did not do any such thing she said crisply and cleared her throat all right troops she called out in a voice that had once commanded thousands just as amberdrake and winterhart appeared at the end of the trail lets get up here and get your goodbyes said and over with this isnt a holiday trip this is a military departure move your rumps thank the gods blade breathed as her parents and tads scrambled to obey we just might actually get out of here before noon in a quartermark judeth replied sternly or every one of you will be on obstaclecourse runs before midmorning blade chuckled not because judeth wouldnt make good on that promisebut because she would what had promised to be a difficult departure was already looking better even with emotionallycharged families approaching after this things could only start looking up three skandranon continued to peer off into the blue cloudless sky for a long time after tadrith and silverblade were out of even his extraordinary range of vision even after fooling himself several times that some speck or other was them he gazed on feeling his eyes gradually go out of focus as his thoughts wandered he was torn now between pride and anxiety their takeoff had been a very good one by anyones standards stylish crisp and professional there had been no exhibitions of fancy flying but not a single mistake in maneuvering either with so many people watching he would have been tempted to indulge in some theatrics when he was tads age and the odds were fairly good that i could have pulled them off too but on the other hand i did have my share of foul ups with the rising sun in his eyes though it didnt make any sense to keep staring off after them he suppressed a sigh and told his knotting stomach to behave itself a gryphons bowels were irritable enough without encouraging cramps through worry well theyre gone my nestling really has fledged gone past the brancher stage and nowwell now hes on his way to have his own adventures real adventures not just high scores on the obstacle course hell be making a name for himself now just like i did he dropped his eyes to meet zhaneels and saw the same pride and worry in her gaze that he felt she wouldnt show it in front of the boy and in fact had kept up a brave and cheerful front but he knew this sudden departure had her upset he tried to look completely confident for her but it was a struggle that he wasnt certain he had won adventures huh now that he wasnt the one having the adventures he wasnt so sure whether or not looking for adventures was such a good idea was tad ready with the war there had been no choice but to go and face the dangerswhether one was ready or notbut this wasnt war and it seemed to him that they could all afford to be more careful of their young his wings twitched a little as the temptation to follow them rose before him i could use some exercise lady cinnabar is always telling me to get more flying time in and if i happened to parallel their course you promised not to fly as the childrens wingman all the way to the outpost zhaneel whispered quietly enough that no one else could have overheard her remember you did promise drat he had and she could read him like a childs primer he twitched his wings again ostentatiously settling them im glad im not making that trip he said not precisely as a reply but to reassure her and to show her that he had heard her and he remembered his promise granted she had caught him in a moment of extreme weakness and vulnerability last night when she extracted that promise but that did not negate the fact that he had made the promise in the first place if the black gryphons word to his mate wasnt good how could anyone trust him aubri sniffed derisively you couldnt make that trip old bird he retorted theyre a lot younger than you and in better shape on top of that skan bristled and started to retort but paused for a moment to rethink his position aubri was not going to get him going this time oh in theory i could he replied as mild as a wellbred matron you did and im in better shape than youwhats more tads towing that carrybasket and that will slow him down to a pace even you could hold but what would the point be what would i have to prove that im stupid enough to make a pointless journey to show im still the equal of a youngster it would be a complete waste of time and i dont have enough time to waste aubri looked surprised and chagrined that he hadnt managed to egg skan on to rash words or a rasher boast zhaneel cast him a look of gratitude which promised another interesting evening and more than made up for the faint blow to his pride administered by aubris taunts judeth had listened to the conversation with a wry halfsmile and now put her own opinion so now the next generation goes off hunting adventures she said combing her fingers through her hair while we stay home and see to it that when they come back they wont find anything much changed personally i dont envy them in the least nor i skan said firmly adventures always seemed to involve impact with the ground at a high rate of speed and ended in a lot of pain maybe my memory is faulty sometimes but i havent forgotten that part amberdrake finally came out of his own reverie and sighed your memory isnt faulty old bird i remember picking quite a few pieces of broken foliage and not a few rocks out of your hide and more than once he patted skans shoulder i dont know why you couldnt have picked a gentler way of collecting souvenirs skan winced and aubri grinned at his discomfiture from the look in his eyes aubri was about to make another stab at puncturing skans pride but aubri had reckoned without winterhart who had been listening just as intently to the conversation as judeth had and i recall that rather than collecting souvenirs of enemy territory aubri specialized in attracting enemy fire she said with a little smirk and a wink at judeth that was so fast aubri didnt catch it in fact he did it so often that his wing used to refer to getting hit by flamestrike as being aubried as in well ive been aubried out until my primaries grow back or well you certainly got aubried back there aubri met this piece of intelligence with his beak open in a gape they did not he gasped indignantly of course they didnt skan who had known every piece of gossip there was to know back then would have heard of this long before winterhart ever had in fact winterhart would probably not have heard any such thing since before she was amberdrakes lover she had tended to treat the gryphons of her wing as little more than intelligent animals such an attitude was not likely to make anyone tell her anything but aubris reaction was so delightful that everyone fell in with the joke for once someone besides skan was going to come in for a share of abuse is it my birthday or has the kaledain lady decided to bless me however momentarily judeth rubbed the side of her nose with her finger im afraid they did she confirmed impishly and then elaborated on it when i deployed your wing they always liked to fly formation with you on the end since it just about guaranteed that no one else would get hit with lightning or magefire once or twice i heard them talking about old charcoal and i think they meant you aubris beak worked but nothing came out the muscles of his throat were moving too but he didnt even utter as much as a squeak it could have been worse winterhart continued delivering the final blow i did succeed in discouraging the nickname of fried chicken aubris eyes widened his head came up and his beak continued to move but all he could manage to say was well over and over since he sounded exactly like a highlyoffended old matron he only managed to cause the entire gathering to break up into laughter and if the laughter was somewhat nervous well there were four nervous parents there who drastically needed the release of laughter they laughed long enough to bring tears to the eyes of the humans and make aubris nares flush bright red before aubri managed to have an apoplectic fit though winterhart confessed that she had made it all up not that you didnt deserve the nickname after all the times you came back singed she added but no one ever suggested pinning it on you aubri growled his hackles still up they wouldnt have dared was all he said and judeth led him off to ease his ruffled feelings and ruffled feathers i dont think he liked being on the receiving end of the teasing amberdrake remarked mildly then perhaps he will stop treating skandranon to so much of it after this zhaneel responded her voice quite tart a little is amusing but he makes a habit of sharpening his tongue on skandranon and i am weary of hearing it skandranon does not deserve it and if aubri continues in this way there may be trouble with younger gryphons believing in his socalled teasing they will think that anything skan says he has done is only wind and empty boast skan turned to her in surprise she didnt often spring to his defense this way aubri doesnt mean anything by it he said on his old friends behalf hes getting old and cranky and he just likes to tease and i dont think im going to lose any respect from the youngsters just because he tries to raise my ire now and again zhaneel sniffed and twitched her tail with annoyance that might be and i will not be rude by chiding him in public but i have had enough of it and he can expect to get as good as he has given from now on i agree winterhart put in firmly crossing her arms over her chest skan deserves a great deal of respect after all maybe not as much as youd like you vain creature but more than aubri gives you skan cast a look at amberdrake who only shrugged dont get me involved in this he said i dont think aubri means anything of what he says and i dont think anyone else takes him seriously eitherbut i think im outnumbered here winterhart made a little face and put her arm over zhaneels grayfeathered shoulders come along my dear she said to the female gryphon i think we should discuss this at length just the two of us since the men dont seem to take this situation with the gravity we think it merits i concur zhaneel said agreeably and the two of them sauntered off toward the cliff rim and several pleasant lookouts that had been constructed there skandranon turned a face full of astonishment on amberdrakewho was gazing after the two females with equal puzzlement what prompted all that he asked trying very hard to get his thoughts back on track amberdrake shook his head i havent any more idea than you do he confessed maybe with their chicks gone from the nest they both feel they have to defend something i might be considered something of an authority on human emotions but i have to admit to you that sometimes my lady winterhart baffles me he nodded with his chin toward the head of the trail care to walk down with me so we can both worry about the youngsters together skan let out a deep breath so drake was just as troubled about tad and blade as he was yes i would he admitted mournfully zhaneel made me promise not to go with them not to follow them and not to talk about them with her unless she brings the subject up i wish i had her confidence that everything is going to be all right but i keep thinking of all the things that can go wrong amberdrake followed his mates example by draping an arm over skans shoulders it felt very good there the support of an old and trusted friend even if the friend was just as much in need of support himself tradition spoke of an elegant halfarch being only a fallen pile of stones without its counterpart to make it whole so much can go wrong even in the most peaceful of times i fear the worst too amberdrake told him but as blade very rightfully reminded me their job is not to confront danger directly theyre only scouts of a sort if something dangerous appears they are supposed to send a warning by way of the teleson then keep themselves intact so that they can get home and brief us in detail skandranon took care not to step on amberdrakes feet and snorted in reply to his statement and just how likely do you think that is to happen he demanded theyre our children do you think theres even half a chance that they wouldnt see themselves as the front line of the white gryphon defenses and go confront something dangerous if it appeared he maneuvered amberdrake into the inside position between himself and the cliff as they started back down toward the city drake needed to walk on the protected inside since if one of them was to slip on the trail it had better be skan he could fly and drake obviously couldnt i honestly dont know amberdrake admitted my daughter baffles me more often than my mate does i sometimes wonder if the midwife switched babies with someone else when she was born she doesnt seem anything like either of us and believe me i have tried to find common ground with her i know what you mean skan replied with chagrin although keenath affects me more that way than tadrith does still just because weve never seen either of them act the way we did at their age it doesnt follow that they wouldnt if you understand what im trying to say i think so amberdrake picked his way over a rough spot in the trail before continuing children tend to act differently around their parents than when theyre on their own at least thats what ive observed both professionally and nonprofessionally of course he wouldnt remember himself being that way he lost his own parents and all his family when he was hardly fledged but hes right i went out of my way to be the opposite of mine they never wanted to be anything but followers and i wanted to be the one others looked to for leadership sometimes i wonder if they werent smarter than i was i wish we had some other way besides the teleson to keep track of them he fretted its very tempting to wish that urtho was here to give us another kechara he couldnt finish the sentence the pang of loss he felt even when mentioning the name of the creator of his adoptive daughter was enough to still his voice for a moment its more than tempting to wish she was the way she used to be amberdrake sighed and not just because shed be useful now id gladly continue all the evasion and diplomatic garbage we had to concoct for the haighlei if it meant she was still such a powerful mindspeaker she is such a cheerful little soul though i dont miss her powers at all if it means we get to see her alive and happy kechara had been one of urthos rare mistakes although skan had never discovered what his leader mentor and friend had intended when he created her had she simply been a first attempt at the gryfalcon type of which zhaneel was the outstanding example was it possible that she had been a deliberate attempt to create a gryphon with tremendous ability at mindmagic or had she simply been a sport something urtho had not intended at all an accident that urtho saw and carried through then hid away for her own protection whichever the case had been little kechara had been what the other gryphons referred to as a misborn severely stunted slightly misshapen with wings far too long for her dwarfed body her mind had been frozen in an eternally childlike state but her pure strength at mindmagic had been without equal adorable little kechara had been able to reach her mindvoice as far away as the haighlei capital of khimbata which was how she had discovered where amberdrake and skandranon had been made prisoners long ago the madman hadanelith and his two haighlei allies had captured them in the last stage before the attempted assassination of emperor shalaman during the eclipse ceremony without kechara skandranon would never have been able to get away in time to save him and amberdrake most certainly would not even be alive at this moment impelled by danger to him that even she had been able to perceive her mental shout had sundered magical shields and incapacitated hadaneliths two allies across all that distance urtho had known just how powerful her abilities were and had kept her closeconfined in his tower for safekeeping he had known that she might be viewed as a prize to be captured or a weapon to be used and had thought to protect her from that fate but in confining her he had assumed that she would not live very long an assumption that had proved incorrect skan shook his head i agree and i also know that i would never want to take the chance that another one with worse problems than hers might be bornwe just dont have the skill and judgment that urtho did we all love her but kecharas flaws were too high a price to pay for her gifts objectively speaking quite frankly i think that it is only because she still doesnt understand most of what she saw in other peoples minds that she hasnt been driven mad by it all he had done his best to make certain she never lost her trusting natureand so had judeth aubri and anyone else in white gryphon who ever came into contact with her in her turn she served the city and its people faithfully and joyously she carefully relayed messages she barely if ever understood to and from all of the silvers with even a touch of mindmagic of their own it was a task they had all tried to ensure was never a chore for her and she had loved the attention and approval skan reflected that it was odd the way the haighlei had acted concerning her for them a creature with the mind of a child and the ability to read anyones thoughts would have been a blasphemy for a year or two after the eclipse ceremony skan was fairly certain the kaledain had been able to keep kecharas existence secret from their allies but eventually they surely had discovered just what she was there had been many many circumspect little hints diplomatic tailchases and discreet suggestions finally an official communique from high king shalaman had come advising the permanent elimination of the longrange communicator of white gryphonreferring to kecharamaking it clear by its phrasing that it was not an idle request and that not doing so would have grave consequences skandranon zhaneel and amberdrake went to khimbata to appeal to shalaman in private and returned to white gryphon with a delegation of mages led by advisor leyuet between various nervous ceremonies of state papa skan explained to kechara that it was time for her to rest from her work and that they were going to make sure nobody was ever scared of her kechara trusted skandranon completely of course and gleefully greeted the delegation the grimfaced haighlei who were steeling themselves to meet a monster and fight against its horrible soulinvading power instead faced a little creature who only thought they were very funny and demanded their absurdly elaborate and colorful hats to play with well thats the haighlei for you i suspect one could probably get away with just about anything so long as it was wrapped in the proper historical protocol come to think of it the reason shalaman was so incensed about those murders in his court was because the assassinations hadnt been done with the proper protocol perhaps if we could have found a way for kechara to be put into shalamans service under their religion she could have kept her powersbut that wouldnt really have been true to her either and it would only have made her into the tool the bargaining chip that urtho feared shed be used as it would have destroyed her loving innocence if she were used against one of us and realized it at least this way she could stay at home and play at least she can still talk to all the gryphons as long as theyre within the city limits well what are we going to do old friend the aging gryphon asked as they picked their way steadily down to the topmost level of the city this level was the receiving platform for everything lowered down from the cliffs above or sent up from the city to the cliffs work crews were already unloading pallets of food from the farms and would continue to do so all day what do we do about the children i mean what can we do amberdrake asked with only the faintest hint of irritation he led the way to the broad whitepainted stairs that formed the back slope of the white gryphons head nothing this is their job the job they chose theyve been assigned to it by their superiors who have judged them capable like it or not they have grown up and im afraid we had better start getting used to that skan ground his beak and prowled after him talons clicking on the stone ramp alongside the stairs which was easier for a gryphon to handle than steps i dont like it he said finally but i cant tell you why amberdrake stopped suddenly turned and faced him looking down at his friend with a troubled expression as the gryphon stopped a step later and looked up i dont either and i havent any real reason to feel this way i wish i could say that i have a premonition about thisbecause this feeling that there is something wrong makes me look like a nervous old aunty but skan prompted youre worried you dont have the correct dress to play aunty amberdrake chuckled then sighed but i am afraid i havent had anything of the sort and there hasnt been a solid sign from anyone who does have foresight that something is going to go wrong with blade and tad i know what i would say to any of my clients who felt this way skan looked into his friends eyes and shook his head let me guess what we are feeling is a combination of old war reactions and unhappiness because this fledging of our youngsters is a sure sign that we are getting old too true and who wants to know that he is getting old not i i can promise you amberdrakes expression was as honest as it was rueful ive been keeping my body limber and capable for decades now through all kinds of strain as loose as a downfeather and as tight as whipcord as needed butits all been to last as long as possible during the pace of time one never bothers to think about growing old as one is growing older then suddenly it is there looming in your face your bones and joints ache youngsters are expressing concern that you are overexerting yourself and when you try to insist that your experience means you know more than they do you find them exchanging knowing looks when they think you dont notice alas it is lifes cruelty i say one moment we are fretting because we are not considered old enough to do anything interesting then we turn around and younglings barely fledged are flying off to do the interesting things we cant do anymore skan shook his head and looked out over the ocean and we are supposed to accept this gracefully it is hardly fair i protest i believe that i shall become a curmudgeon then at least i can complain and it will be expected of me too late for that skandranon snorted then i shall be an exceptional curmudgeon ive earned the title the curmudgeon king endured where eer he goes may i join you then we can drive the youngsters to distraction together amberdrake seemed to have thrown off some of his anxiety and to his surprise skan realized that he had relaxed a bit as well certainly the black gryphon replied with dignity lets go down to the obstacle course and make loud comments about how we used to run it better and in half the time and with more style amberdrake suggested finesse and grace not brutal power naturally skan agreed it couldnt have happened any other wayas far as they know so just how worried are you winterhart asked zhaneel as soon as they were out of the range of skandranons hearing as a trondiirn she had a very good notion of just how sensitive any given gryphons senses were but she knew skans abilities in excruciating detail for all that he was suffering the onset of the ailments of age he was a magnificent specimen with outstanding physical abilities not just for his age but for any gryphon male about skan or about the children zhaneel asked with a sidelong glance at her companion hmm both of course she replied returning zhaneels glance shes just as observant as i thought skan first hes the one we have to live with as we must live with amberdrake heyla zhaneel nodded shrewdly well come and sit beside me here where the wind will carry away the words we do not wish overheard and we will discuss our mates she nodded her beak at a fine wooden bench made of wave and windsculpted driftwood and sat down beside it on the cool stone rimming the cliff winterhart sank gracefully down into a welcoming curve of the bench and laid one arm along the back of it drake is very unhappy about all this i think he expected judeth and aubri to assign blade to something like bodyguard duty or citypatrol i dont think it ever occurred to him that they might send her out of the city much less so far away it didnt occur to me either but it should have ive known that blade wanted to get away from the cityand usfor the past year maybe if drake hadnt been so adamant about her living with us until she was a full silver keeth and tad had been able to move out in part because skan had lent them his resources to excavate a new home to trade for an existing one sensing blades restlessness winterhart had tried to persuade drake to do the same for blade but he wouldnt hear of it why should she need to move out hed asked at the time its not as if she has any need for a place of her own we give her all the privacy she would have anywhere else and its not as if she could feel embarrassed to bring a lover here then he had sighed dramatically not that theres any interest in that quarter the way shes been acting a vow of celibacy would be an improvement in her love life where could we have gone wrong its almost like she doesn t want to listen to her body winterhart could have told himthat children were always embarrassed by the proximity of their parents when trying out the first tentative steps in the dance of amorous life and inhibited by their parents when learning for the first time what kind of adults they would becomebut she knew he wouldnt believe her he would have if blade had been anyone elses child but not when he was her father a parent can sometimes be too close to his child to think about her objectively when it came to seeing someone elses children a parent could see a larger canvas but with their ownall they would see were the close daily details and not grasp the broad strokes amberdrake brilliant as he was couldnt grasp things like blade not wanting to be around parents as she learned her bodys passions and if blade had actually come out and asked him for a place of her own he would probably have given in and made it possible but she was too shy and too proud and now in retrospect winterhart could see that requesting assignment to outpost duty had probably seemed the only way she could get that longedfor privacy skandranon is fretting but not to pieces i think zhaneel said after a long pause during which she gazed out seaward she might have been watching the fishing fleet her eyes were certainly sharp enough to make out details in things that were only moving dots to winterhart i hope that as he realizes the children are capable he will fret less part of it is inaction part of it is that he wishes to do everything and even when he was young he could not do half of what he would like to do now that observation surprised a faint chuckle out of winterhart it is odd how our youthful abilities grow larger as we age isnt it she replied i am absolutely sure that i remember being able to work for two days and nights without a rest and that i could ride like a kaledain and shoot like a highlypaid mercenary as well as perform all my duties as a trondiirn i couldnt of course but i remember doing so even so zhaneel agreed it will not be so bad with skandranon as with amberdrake our children are male and one is still left to us your little falcon was the only chick in the nest and female men wish to protect their females it is bred in the blood and as much as amberdrake would deny it he is more worried because blade is female you are right winterhart stared out to sea wondering how she could ever convince her spouse that their delicate little girl was as fragile as tempered steel perhaps if i keep comparing her to judeth she wondered aloud i dont think blade is doing it consciously but i can see that she has been copying judeths manner and mannerisms he admires and respects judeth and what is more he has seen her in action he knows that judeth took special care in training your blade and perhaps he will take comfort from that zhaneel observed then tossed her head in a gryphonic shrug i can think of nothing else you could do now what am i to do with skan concentrate on keenath perhaps could we get him involved in keeths physical training winterhart asked her im a bit out of my depth thereand you and skan did invent obstaclecourse training ive started all the trondiirn on workingunderfire training but the silvers gryphoncourse is set up for combat not fieldtreatment it isnt really appropriate and im not sure how to adapt it yeesss i believe that might do it will give him action and something to think about or at least more action besides climbing my back to give him exercise zhaneel cocked her head to one side now what of winterhart and what of zhaneel what do we do to take our minds from our absent children winterhart shook her head you have me at a loss i honestly dont know and ill probably wake up with nightmares every few days for the next six months i suppose we should concentrate on our mates worries instead that will certainly give us something to do and give them the job of dealing with how we comfort them zhaneel nodded then turned and reached out to touch winterharts shoulder with a gentle talon she smiled and her eyes grew softer as she met winterharts gaze and perhaps we can give each other the comfort of a sympathetic ear now and again sisterinspirit one small problem with finally being on duty rising at unholy hours tadrith sighed but inaudibly his partner sometimes seemed to have ears as sharp as a gryphons as usual on this journey blade was up at the first hint of light tad heard her stirring around outside the tent they shared building up the fire puttering with breakfast fetching water she was delightfully fastidious about her person bathing at night before she went to bed and washing again in the morning it would have been distinctly unpleasant to share a tent with anyone whose hygiene was faulty especially now that they were away from the coast and into the wet forest it was very humid here and occasionally oppressively hot blade was not just being carried like living baggage the basket shifted in every change of wind and she had to shift her weight with it to keep it from throwing him off this was work hard work and she was usually damp with sweat by the time he landed for a rest she was usually ready for one too he of course was not burdened by the need to wash in order to get clean and most humans expressed pleasure in a gryphons naturally spicy musky scent he couldnt fly with wet wings and there usually wasnt time to bathe before night fell when they stopped he had decided to forgo anything but dustbaths until they arrived at their outpost so he felt perfectly justified in lying in warm and sheltered comfort while she went through her bathing ritual and tended to the camp chores there wasnt anything he could do to help her anyway he couldnt fetch water raptoral beaks were not well suited to carrying bucket handles he shouldnt have anything to do with the campfire gryphons were feathered and feathers were flammable he had done the larger share of work last night when it came to chores he had brought up enough wood to feed the fire until this morning and provided part of his kill to feed them both at breakfast he would take the tent down just as he had put it up the fast way of erecting it required magic and although he was no match for his father in that area he was a minor mage in simple objectmoving spells so he had done his share of the camp chores this was not lazing about it was the just reward of hard work he closed his eyes and listened to water splashing and blade swearing at how cold it was and smiled all was well because they were already working so hard he was bending a personal rule and using magic to hunt with he used it to find a suitable animal and to hold that animal in place once he found it they couldnt afford energy wasted in prolonged hunting not now he had to have the tent up the wood in camp and his kill made before dark back at white gryphon he could afford to be a sportsman there were plenty of herd beasts and fish to feed the gryphons and wild game was rightfully considered a delicacy once he arrived at outpost five there would be time enough on each scouting patrol to hunt properly but he would consume more food than they could carry on this trip and that meant hunting with absolute efficiency using every trick at his disposal finally the sounds of fat sizzling into the fire made him open his eyes and bestir himself again that was breakfast and although he personally preferred his meat raw there were other things to eat besides meat though primarily carnivores gryphons did enjoy other delicacies and blade had found some marvelous shelffungi last night when he had been bringing in wood a quick test had proven them to be nonpoisonous and a quick taste showed that they were delicious they had saved half for breakfast still attached to its log just in case detaching it might make it decay fresh venison and fresh mushrooms a good nights sleep and a fine day of flying ahead of us life is good if you dont come out of there sluggard blades voice warned from beyond the canvas im going to have all of this for myself i was simply granting you privacy for your bath he replied with dignity standing up and poking his beak out of the tent flap unlike some other people i could mention i am a gentleman and a gentleman always allows a lady her privacy perhaps it was technically morning but out there under the trees it was gloomy as deepest twilight blade was slicing bits of fungus into a pan greased with fat he saw that she had already set aside half of the remainder for him it sat on top of his deerquarter from which she had sliced her breakfast steak she had dressed for the heat and humidity in a sleeveless tunic and trews of haighlei weave though not of haighlei colors the haighlei were quick to exploit the new market that white gryphon provided weaving their cool absorbent fabrics in beiges grays and lighter colors as well as black and white the people of kleshya could then ornament these fabrics to suit their own cultural preferences the results varied as much as the rootculture of the wearer those of kaledain descent embroidered belled and beaded their garments in a riot of shades those who had been adopted into the clan those outsiders who had ended up with kleshya and the gryphons were usually more restrained in their garments blade consciously or unconsciously had chosen garments cut in the style of the kaledain but in the colors of her mothers people in this case she wore a subdued beige with woven borders in cream and pale brown as always even though there was no one to see it the silver gryphon badge glinted on her tunic around them but mostly above them the birds and animals of this forest foraged for their own breakfasts after three days of travel they were finally into the territory that the haighlei called a rain forest and it was vastly different from any place he had ever visited before the trees were huge incredibly tall rising like the bare columns of a sylvan temple for what seemed like hundreds of lengths until they finally spread their branches out to compete with each other for sun and compete they did the foliage was so thick and dense that the forest floor was perpetually shrouded in mysterious shadow when they plunged down out of the sunlight and into the cover of the trees it took some time for their eyes to adjust despite that lack of direct sunlight the undergrowth was surprisingly thick as was to be expected all kinds of fungi thrived but there were bushes and even smaller plants growing in the thick leaf litter and ropelike vines that wreathed the trees and climbed up into the light anywhere that a tree had fallen or the course of a stream cut a path through the trees the undergrowth ran riot with competition for the light so fierce that blade swore she could actually see the plants growing larger as she watched them she was the team expert on plants and half of the ones she had examined at their campsites were new to her and they hadnt even done any exploring the only plants she saw were the ones she found in the course of setting up camp tad couldnt even begin to imagine what shed find when she began looking in earnestand he began taking her up into the canopy he couldnt identify half of the calls they heard from above them he couldnt even have told her if those hoots and whistles were coming from the throats of furred animals birds or reptiles it was all just a further reminder of how little had been explored here now he understood why the haighlei were so careful about what they did here not only were there scores of completely unknown hazards in this forest but careless handling of the woodlands could destroy a priceless medicinal herb or some other resource without ever knowing that it was there thats all very well he reminded himself as he eased himself out of the tent and ambled over to fall on his breakfast with famished pleasure but it is difficult to be philosophical on an empty stomach later perhaps he devoted himself singlemindedly to his meal this would be the light one he would eat heavily when they camped and he could digest while resting a full gryphon could not fly very well a hungry gryphon did not take long to finish a meal and tad was famished he polished off the last of his kill in short order saving the tasty fungus for last while he ate blade put out the fire buried their trash in the wet ashes so that it would decay properly and packed up the gear they had taken out as well as everything inside the tent tadrith would leave the bones of his meal for the forest scavengers who would no doubt be glad of the windfall when they took off the only signs that they had been here would be ephemeral the firepit the bones and the presseddown foliage where they had walked and set the tent in two days three at the most the forest would begin to reclaim the site in a month it would be gone not even the bones would remain no vultures not in a place like this probably rodents or perhaps some type of swine or canine he preened his talons fastidiously and stropped his beak on the log that had played host to their fungi well i believe it is time to do my part again he strode over to the tent concentrated for a moment then extended his power with a deft touch he let the mageenergy reach for the trigger point of the tentspell where it lay just under the center of the canvas roof obediently the canvas tent folded in on itself starting from the top the sturdy flexible poles once holding the canvas rigidly in place now became the slightly stiffened ropes they really were without a hand to aid it the tent folded and refolded as if it was a living creature within a few moments where the tent had been a boxy package of canvas sat ready to be put in the basket now as it happened in accordance with aubris advice the tent could be erected without magic although new poles would have to be cut for it since the rope supports obviously required magic to become poles clearly this was a great deal easier however once the spell was triggered the supports which were nothing more than magicallybespelled pieces of thick rope sewn into special channels along the seams of the tent stiffened in a particular order unfolding the tent and setting it up at the same time since the shape of the supports was dictated by the shape of the channel it was possible to have a tent that did not require a centerpole or guyropes and only needed to be staked down in seven places to keep it from blowing away in a wind of course if there had been no mage about to trigger the spell the tent would have required a centerpole as well as cornerpoles and guyropes at each corner this was standard issue among the silvers now tad could never have set the spell himself that required the hand of a master but even an apprentice could trigger it so any expedition coming out of white gryphon that would be camping always had at least one mage along the spell that made the tent collapse and fold itself up was a more complicated one but again it only needed an apprentice to trigger and feed it tad could handle that sort of spell easily and enjoyed doing so perhaps it was analogous to the way that a human felt when whittling or chipcarving wood there was an odd suffused warmth of satisfaction at having created something by use of a tool which was a different sensation from the visceral feelings of hunting by claw or flying by wings perhaps it was the ability to affect things outside ones own momentary grasp that made one feel civilized tad picked up the neat bundle of canvas and rope and deposited it in the carrybasket blade was already stretching out and untangling the ropes of his harness no matter how carefully they stowed the ropes the night before in the morning they always seemed to have gotten tangled how that could be was another of those mysteries he was certain he would never be able to solve there were times when he suspected a supernatural explanation the harness had to be stowed out of reach of rodents or other creatures that might like to gnaw on leatherand it had to go somewhere where dampness would not get into it there was only one place that answered that description and that was the tent itself so although the ceiling of their temporary dwelling was fairly high enough of it was taken up with the harness resting in a net suspended from the corners of the roof that blade could barely stand upright inside but if that minor discomfort meant that they could trust the harness not to have suffered damage in the night it was a small price to pay both of them were agreed on that ill share my bed with it if necessary blade had said firmly i thought that sort of thing was your fathers specialty hed jibed back only to be flattened by a swung harnessgirth apparently blade was not amused blade finally got the ropes sorted out now she stood dangling the harness from one hand beckoning with the other it was time for tadrith to go to work the harness took some time to get into and blade made certain that it was comfortable for him this was not the token harness of soft deerskin every gryphon in the silvers wore displaying his or her badge and carrying the pouch in which they kept small necessities every strap must fit snugly but without chafing large feathers must be moved so that they lay on top of the leather or they would be broken off tadrith could do none of this for himself instead he must stand as patiently as a donkey while blade rigged him up the air warmed marginally and now the usual morning fog began to wreathe among the trees first a few wisps formed and wafted through the forest of columns disappearing and reforming again like the ghosts of floating snakes then the ropes and swaths of fog thickened and joined together until tad and blade were surrounded on all sides by it then lastly it began to thicken until they could not see the trunks of trees more than two or three gryphonlengths away up above the sounds of birds animals and insects continued unabated down below under the cover of the fog animal sounds increased perhaps now that they are concealed they feel bold enough to call tad thought or perhaps they are calling to one another because they cannot see each other it is an interesting question neither the fog nor the heavy overcast that had shadowed them for the past two days had given them any great amount of trouble but tad felt a difference in the air today gryphons were supremely sensitive to changes in the weather and he knew by the feeling behind his nares and the way his feathers felt against his skin that they were going to have a real storm today storms around here seemed to stretch for leagues so there would be no moving out of its path unless they were very lucky if he had been alone he might have taken a chance and tried to climb above the cloudsbut he dared not with the basket in tow unpredictable winds could catch it and send it and him tumbling lightning could incinerate either him or blade or both in a heartbeat no if the storm threatened they would have to go to ground quickly before deadly updrafts or windshear caught them unaware then they would have to make a quick camp and get shelter before they were drenched if the storm was over quickly and he was still dry they could take to the air again to make a little more distance before nightfall but if he was drenched he would have to wait until his wings were dry which would probably take all night he said nothing to blade but she must have felt the same urgency perhaps long association with him had made her weathersensitive too at any rate without skimping on her checks she hurried through the preparations sooner than he had expected she was done she made a quick final check of the campsite as he shook himself checking the harness for loose spots while she continued to police the campsite he stretched and did wingexercises carefully loosening and warming up every muscle even those he didnt normally use in flying he faced away from the campsite sunk his talons deeply into the ground and energetically beat his wings as if he was trying to lift the earth itself he twisted writhed and stretched in a series of dancerlike movements designed to make sure every muscle was ready to do what he had asked it to then when he finally felt no sense of strain no matter which way he moved he looked at blade ready she called as she made her way back through the fog toward the basket he nodded lets get in the air he replied theres a storm coming i thought so she removed the stakes holding the basket firmly to the ground and tossed them in then vaulted into the basket herself she shifted a few things with a deft sensitivity to the weight and balance within it then settled into place with both hands clutching the front of the basket that was his signal with powerful wingstrokes he rose slowly into the air leaves and dust scattered across the forest floor in the wind of his creation and blade narrowed her eyes against it he rose about three lengths into the air before encountering the momentary resistance of the basket beneath him but the spell was still holding firm and the pull against the harness was no more than if he had been hauling a deercarcass instead of the massive basket immediately he felt something mildly wrong the basket felt heavier and now he noticed a stiffness in his muscles that had not been there when he finished his warmups is it the damp and chill no matter he was committed now and he dared not abort the takeoff he simply worked a little harder made his wingbeats a little deeper strained a little more against the harness blade hung on as the basket lurched up off the ground this was the moment when it was possible to overset the basket or novice riders tumbled out he and the basket rose together through the trees in a series of jerks propelled by the powerful downthrust of his wings he was breathing harder than he should have what is the matter with me did i get less sleep than i thought or did i eat too much the thought of the mushrooms hung uneasily in his mind they were not poisonous but what if they had some subtle weakening effect on him but if they had wouldnt he have noticed it last night wouldnt he have noticed as he was warming up not necessarily in the next moment they were above the layer of fog that clung to the earth and shrouded the leaflittered ground hiding it he looked up and the spreading branches of the canopy rushed to meet them he willed strength into his muscles strained toward the light a thousand birds screamed alarm to see them then fell silent with shock as the laden gryphon labored up through the branches he threaded his way through the hole left in the canopy after the death of some millenniumold forest giant while below him blade shifted and released her holds to fend off reaching branches that threatened to foul the ropes or catch on the basket itself she used a long pole with a crosspiece tied to the far end cut last night for this specific purpose as they burst through the last of the branches into the open air she dropped the pole they would not need it for the next descent and it was too long to carry with them without causing problems the contrast between the gloom below the trees and the overcast brightness above dazzled tad until his eyes adjusted he did not pause however for he needed more height he might not be able to see clearly but there was no doubt which way he had to go down was the direction of the dragging on his harness he rowed his wings in great heaves in answer to that steady pull and by the time his eyes cleared he was as far above the canopy as the branches were above the forest floor that was enough he angled out into level flight taking his direction from his own inner senses and now the basket hung true beneath him no longer bobbing with every wingbeat blade did not release her hold on the edges for she might have to shift her weight to compensate for sudden changes in the wind but she did allow herself some relaxation as soon as they leveled out and he was certain that there were no strange winds to contend with tad took a survey of the weather his weathersense had not betrayed him the clouds hung low fatbellied and gray with unshed water he could not scent rain on the air yet but it was just a matter of time these were not yet storm clouds the storm when it came would roar down at them out of clouds that would tower thousands of lengths above their slateblue bottoms if they were extraordinarily lucky they might manage to fly out from under this weather system before it developed into a storm but he was not going to count on it from the wind they were flying in the same direction that this storm was going which made it very likely that they would actually be flying into the teeth of it rather than away from it iiihave plenty of warning before we get into trouble in fact ill see activity in plenty of time to land he might even feel it long before he saw it we arent making the best time right now he noted ruefully in spite of the careful warmup he still felt not stiff not strained but vaguely achy am i coming down with something or did i just eat too much this morning he drove westward moving as quickly as he could watching the horizon for the telltale flickers of the lightning that would herald the storm front he hoped he was not coming down with a fever although gryphons were not prone to such infections they were not completely unknown this would be a bad time and place to get sickalthough if it proved to be a real emergency blade could use the light teleson set they carried with them to call for help now that magic was working again even rudimentary mindmagic like hers could be amplified by the teleson to carry all the way back to white gryphon it would be work but she could get help its probably just from sleeping in the damp ive never had to sleep in a tent on damp ground before now for the first time he had a hint of how he might feel in years to come when his joints began to ache and stiffen no wonder his father moved so deliberately and he had thought it was just an affectation to increase his appearance of dignity idont think im going to like getting old he flew on for some distanceand was very glad that they were not making this journey afoot he had just traversed territory it would probably take days to cross on the ground and all within a few marks it wasnt even noon yet now he scented water and the air felt heavy and thick and another explanation for his flying difficulties occurred to him this is not good air for flying it may not be me at all it may only be the atmosphere that is weighing us down it was as difficult to fly in thick air as in thin though in different ways and the extra exertion necessary would certainly be enough reason for the ache in his joints there was still no sign of the coming storm but it could not be far off now he strained his eyes hunting for that elusive flicker of bluewhite light among the clouds tadrith had no real warning just a sudden lurching sensation in the pit of his stomach as if he had been caught in a burst of wind and been hurled up then dropped his head spun with disorientation for a moment and he gasped thenthe magic on the basket was broken like water draining out of a broken pot all in the blink of an eye and the moment it vanished the basket regained its real weightthe full weight of blade all their supplies and the basket itself with nothing more holding it up than one very shocked gryphon it dropped like a stone and pulled him shrieking in strangled surprise with it the harness cut into his shoulders the sudden jerk drove the breath from his lungs and all thoughts from his mind he pumped his wings frantically and with complete futility against the weight that hauled him down below him blade shouted and sawed at the basketropes trying to cut him free he had to slow their fall she was never going to get him looseeven if the ropes were cut she would still plummet to her death he wouldnt leave her there was no time to try magic no chance to concentrate enough for a spell and what could he do anyway with his heart pounding in his ears and his vision clouded with the strain he tried to make his wings move faster harder scoop in more air surely if he just tried hard enough he could at least slow the basket fear sent him more energy fueling the frantic wingbeats his wingmuscles howled in agony burning with pain as if a million tiny demons were sticking him with redhot daggers his foreclaws scrabbled uselessly at the empty air as if some part of him thought he might be able to catch and hold something his mind jabbered as they plummeted down toward the forest canopy he did not even have enough control to pick where they were going to hit below him he thought blade was screaming he couldnt hear her through the pounding in his ears his vision went red with the strain then they hit the trees that slowed them as they crashed through the treetops he felt the basket lighten a little and for a moment he had hope that the springy boughs might actually catch and hold them but the basket was too heavy and the branches not strong nor thick enough as the basket dragged him down into the gloom he realized belatedly that hitting trees with wings spread wide was not a good idea for a flying creature he was jerked a little sideways as the basket encountered more branches which was not good for him instead of dropping through the hole the basket made he hit undamaged tree limbs with an open wing pain shot through him like a bolt of lightning then there was only darkness four jor some reason blade had never been the kind who sat frozen with shock when something dreadful happened she had always acted there was an even chance that whatever she did in an emergency it would be the right thing without even thinking about it blade had her crossdraw knife out in an attempt to cut tad free as they all plummeted toward the tree canopy below she sawed frantically at the ropes holding him a helpless prisoner of gravity but it was obviously of no use they were falling too fast and there were too many ropes to cut were dead she thought absently but her body wasnt convinced of that and just before they hit the treetops she dropped into the bottom of the basket curled into a protective ball the basket lurched about as they hit tree limbs and broke through them as wood crashed and splintered all around her she was thrown around in the basket among all the lasheddown equipment like another loose piece of junk something hit her shoulder hard and she heard herself scream the pain was like an explosion of stars in her head then mercifully she blacked out her head hurt her head hurt a lot and her shoulder hurt even more with every beat of her heart it throbbed black agony and every time she took a breath or made the tiniest movement it lanced red fire down her arm and side she concentrated on that pain without opening her eyes if she couldnt get that under control she wouldnt be able to move if she couldnt move she and probably tad would lie here until something came to eat them surround the pain and isolate it then accept it stop fighting it dont fear it pain is only information it is up to you how you wish to interpret it you control it her fathers lessons came back as she controlled her breathing she hadnt ever used them on anything worse than a sprained wrist before but to her surprise they worked just as well on this serious injury make it a part of you an unimportant part now let the body numb it let the body flood it with its own defenses blade knew the body could produce its own painkillers the trick was to convince it to produce enough of them and to convince it that at the moment pain was getting in the way of survival slowlytoo slowlyit worked she opened her eyes the basket was on its side a couple of wagonlengths away from her it looked as if she had been tossed free when or just before it hit the ground fortunately her lashings holding the cargo in place had held or she probably would have been killed by her own equipment the basket lay in a mess of broken branches wilting leaves draped everywhere it didnt look like it was ever going to be useful for anything again probably a fair share of the equipment is worthless now too she thought dispassionately it was easy to be dispassionate she was still in shock im alive thats more than i thought a few moments ago she sat up slowly being very careful of whatever injury made her shoulder hurt so badly with her good hand her left she probed delicately at her shoulder and bit her lip drawing blood when her fingers touched loose bone that grated broken collarbone ill have to immobilize the right arm no wonder it hurts like the haighlei hells well so much for doing any lifting or wielding any weapons her questing fingers ran over her face and head without encountering anything worse than a gooseegg knot on her skull and more spatters of congealing blood with the same care as before she stretched out her right leg then her left bruises lots and lots of bruises which just at the moment she couldnt feel at all imust be black and blue from head to toe that could be bad shed start to stiffen up soon and in the morning it would be worse she cradled her right arm in her left hand and worked her legs until they were under her and she was in a kneeling position she couldnt see anything but the basket at the moment but from the direction that the ropes went tad should be right behind her she was almost afraid to look if he were dead she turned slowly and carefully and let out a sob of relief as she saw himand saw his sides heaving he wasnt dead he wasnt in good shape but he was still breathing he lay sprawled atop a tangle of crushed bushes still unconscious his left wing was doubled up underneath him at an angle that was not natural with his primary feathers pointing forward instead of back most of them shredded and snapped so he had one broken wing for certain and that meant that he would not be flying off anywhere for help as she shifted again trying to get to her feet his eyes opened and his beak parted a thin moan came from him and he blinked dazedly dont move she called sharply let me get over there and help you first wing that came out in a harsh whisper and he panted with pain i know i can see it just hold still and let me get to you gritting her teeth she worked her right arm inside her tunic and belted the garment tightly using only her left hand that would do for immobilizing the shoulder for now she stood up with the aid of the debris around her and worked her way over to tad once there she stared at him for a moment deciding where to begin the rain forest was unnervingly quiet can you wiggle the toes on your left hind foot she asked he did so then repeated the gesture with his right then his foreclaws the right rear hurts when i move but not as if something is broken he offered and she heaved a sigh of relief all right your back isnt broken and neither are your legs thats better than we had any right to expect the knife she had been trying to use to get him free was gone but now she could reach all the snaphooks holding the ropes to his harness hissing with pain every time her shoulder was jarred in the least she knelt down in the debris of crushed branches and scratchy twigs and began unsnapping him i think im one big bruise he said as she worked her hand under him to free as many of the ropes as she could without having him move that makes two of us she told him straining to reach one last set of snaphooks he knew better than to stir until she told him to any movement at all might tear fragile blood vessels in the wings where the skin was thinnest and he would bleed to death before she could do anything to help him finally she had to give up on that last set she moved back to his head and studied his pupils was one a little smaller than the other without a light to make them react she couldnt tell you might have a concussion she said doubtfully you might too he offered which she really could have done without hearing icant wait for the concussionheadache to set in just lie there she advised him im going after the medical gear if i can find the medical gear if its still worth anything it had been packed on top of the supplies even though that meant it had to be offloaded and set aside every time they stopped for the night now she was glad that she had retained the packing order that the supply sergeant had ordained for the basket they would have been in worse shape if shed had to move foodstuffs camping gear and the tent to get at it the only question is did everything fall on top of it she worked her way over to the basket again to find to her great relief that the medical supplies were still on topor rather since the basket was on its side they were still the things easiest to reach although easiest to reach was only in a relative sense she studied the situation before she did anything the basket was lying in a heap of broken branches the supplies had tumbled out sideways and now were strewn in an arc through that same tangle of branches the medical supplies were apparently caught in a forked sapling at about shoulder height but there was a lot of debris around that sapling it would be very easy to take a wrong step and wind up twisting or even breaking an ankleand she only had one hand to use to catch herself and then the fall could knock her out again or damage her collarbone even worseor both but they needed those supplies they needed them before they could do anything else ill just have to be very very careful she couldnt see any other way of reaching the package tad tad can you concentrate enough to use a moving spell all she got back was a croaked no and a moan of pain well it wasnt a very good idea anyway a delirious gryphon casting a spell nearby is more risky for me than if i tried running up that tree it looked like she would have to make it by foot it was an agonizing journey she studied each step before she took it and she made certain that her footing was absolutely secure before she made the next move she was sweating like a foundered horse before she reached the sapling both with the strain and with the pain it took everything she had to reach up pull the package loose then numbly toss it in the direction of the clear space beside tad it was heavier than it lookedbecause of the bonesetting kit of course she nearly passed out again from the pain when she did sobut it landed very nearly where she wanted it to well out of the way of any more debris she clung to the sapling breathing shallowly until the pain subsided enough that she thought she could venture back the way she had come her sweat had turned cold by now or at least that was how it felt and some of it ran underneath the crusting scabs of dried blood and added a stinging counterpoint to her heartbeat when she reached the spot beside her precious package she simply collapsed beside it resting her head on it as she shuddered all over with pain and exertion but every time she shook her shoulder awoke to new pain so it was not so much a moment of respite as it was merely a chance to catch her breath with the aid of teeth and her short boot knife she wrestled the package open and the first thing she seized was one of the vials of painkilling yelloworchid extract she swallowed the bitter potion down without a grimace and waited for it to take effect shed only had it once before when shed broken a toe and in a much lighter dose this time however it did not send her into lightheaded giddiness it numbed the pain to the point where it was bearable but no more than that another relief the pain must be bad enough to counteract most of the euphoric effect of the drug there was another drug that did the same service for gryphons she dragged the pack of supplies nearer to tad fumbled out a larger vial and handed it to him he tilted his head back just enough that he would be able to swallow and poured the contents into his beak clamping it shut instantly so as not to waste a single bitter drop she knew the moment it took effect his limbs all relaxed and his breathing eased now what he asked you can see whats wrong better than i can first you are going to have to help me she told him i cant try to move you until this collarbone is set and immobilized if i try i think i might pass out again a bad idea you shouldnt do that he agreed and flexed his forelimbs experimentally i think i can do that sit there and well try he was deft and gentle and she still blacked out twice before he was finished amidst his jabbered apologies for each mistake when he was done though her arm and shoulder were bound up in a tight ugly but effective package and the collarbone had been set hopefully it would remain set they had no way to put a rigid cast on a collarbone only a mage could do that the healers hadnt even figured out a way to do so then it was his turn it could not have been any easier for him although he did not lose consciousness as she rolled him off the broken wing set it and bound it in place this time she did use the bonesetting kit the splints and bandages that hardened into rigid forms when first soaked then dried she was no trondiirn but she had learned as much as she could from her mother once it became obvious to her that her old playmate tad was going to be her permanent partner besides that though she guessed she didnt know enough of the finer points of gryphon physiology to know if what she did now would cause lifelong crippling thin moans escaped tads clenched beak from time to time however and he did ask her to pause three times during the operation finally they both staggered free of the ruins collapsed on the thick leaf mold of the forest floor and waited for the pain to subside beneath the ministrations of their potions it felt like forever before she was able to think of anything except the fiery throbbing of her shoulder but gradually the potion took greater hold or else the binding eased some of the strain the forest canopy was still preternaturally silent their plunge through it had frightened away most of the inhabitants and the birds and animals had not yet regained their courage she was intermittently aware of odd things as different senses sharpened for an instant and her mind overloaded with scent or sound the sharp sour smell of broken woodthe call of one insect stupid enough to be oblivious to themthe unexpected note of vivid red of a single wilting flower they had brought down with them what happened she asked quietly into the strange stillness it was an obvious question one moment they were flying along and all was well and the next moment they were plummeting like arrowshot ducks his eyes clouded and the nictitating membrane came down over them for a moment giving him a walleyed look i dont know he said slowly haltingly honestly i cant tell you anything except whats obvious that the magic keeping the basket at a manageable weight justdissolved disappeared i dont know why or how she felt her stomach turn over not the most comforting answer in the world up until now she had not been afraid but now icant let this eat at me we dont know what happened remember it could still all be an accident could there have been a magestorm she persisted a small one or a localized one perhaps he flattened his eartufts and shook his head emphatically no no im sure of it gryphons are sensitive to magestorms the way that anyone with joint swellings is sensitive to damp or real physical storms no there was no magestorm i would know if one struck her heart thudded painfully and her stomach twisted again if it wasnt a natural event an attack she beganbut he shook his head again but he looked more puzzled than fearful it wasnt an attack either he insisted at least it wasnt anything id recognize as an attack it wasnt anything offensive that id recognize he gazed past her shoulder as if he was searching for words to describe what he had felt it was more likelike suddenly having your bucket spring a leak the magic just drained out but suddenly and i dont know how or why all the magic justjust went away all the magic just went away suddenly the chill hand of panic that she had been fighting seized the back of her neck and she lurched to her feet if the magic in the basket had drained away what about all the other magic whats wrong he asked as she stumbled toward the wreckage of the basket and the tumbled piles of supplies nothingi hope she called back with an edge in her voice whats closest the firestarter yesthere it is the firestarter was something every apprentice mage made by the dozen they were easy to create once the disciplines of creating an object had been mastered it was good practice making them they were also useful and since their average life was about six months you could always barter them to anyone in the city once youd made them anyone could use one you didnt have to be a mage to activate itmost were always ready and to use one you simply used whatever simple trigger the mage had built in the one in their supplies was fresh tad had just made it himself before they left it didnt look like much just a long metal tube with a wick protruding from one end you were supposed to squeeze a little polished piece of stone set into the other end with your thumb and the wick would light you could manipulate it with one hand if you had to and of course she had to hoping that her hunch had been wrong she fumbled the nowdented tube out of a tangle of ropes and cooking gear and thumbed the end nothing happened she tried it again several times then brought it back to tad this isnt working she said tightly whats wrong with it he took it from her and examined it his eyes almost crossing as he peered at it closely thethe magics gone he said hesitantly its not a firestarter anymore just a tube of metal with a wick in it i was afraid youd say that grimly she returned to the tumbled supplies and pawed through them looking for anything that had once been magical in nature every movement woke the pain in her shoulder but she forced herself to ignore it the way that the supplies had tumbled out aided her the last things into the basket had been on top and that meant they were still accessible the magelight in the lantern was no longer glowing the tentwell she couldnt test that herself she couldnt even unfold it herself but the canvas felt oddly limp under her hand without a hint of the resistance it used to possess the teleson that she carried back to tad and placed it wordlessly before him it wasnt much to look at but then it never had been just a contoured headband of plain silver metal with a couple of coils of copper that could be adjusted to fit over the temples of any of the varied inhabitants of white gryphon it was used to magically amplify the range of those even marginally equipped with mindmagic all the gryphons kyree and hertasi had that power and most of the tervardi as well tad should have been able to use it to call for help a shiver ran down her body and she suppressed the urge to babble cry or curl up in a ball and give up she realized that she had been unconsciously counting on that fact if they couldnt call for help he touched one talon to the device and shook his head i dont even have to put it on he said his voice shaking itsempty its useless unspoken words passed between them as he looked up mutely at her were in trouble it wasnt just the basket then she said sitting down hard her own voice trembling as well how could this happen why now why us everything that had any spells on it is inert the magelights the firestarter the tent probably the weatherproof sheltercloaks and the teleson he looked up at her his eyes wide and frightened pupils contracted to pinpoints we cant call for help were out here on our own were both hurt no one at white gryphon knows where we are they wont even know we re missing until we dont show up at the rendezvous point where we were supposed to meet the last team that manned the outpost thatll be days from now its a long way to walk he faltered longer since were hurt and theres something nearby that eats magic is it a natural effect or a creature if it eats magic would it care to snack on us it might it might seek out tad at least gryphons were by their very nature magical creatures dont think about it over and over the silvers had been taught that in an emergency the first thing to think about was the problem at hand and not to get themselves tied into knots of helplessness by trying to think of too many things at once deal with what we can handle solve the immediate problems then worry about the next thing she got unsteadily to her feet theres a storm coming thats our first problem we have to get shelter thenwater warmth and weapons i think wed better salvage what we can while we can before the rain comes and ruins it he got shakily to his feet nodding right the tenteven if we could cut poles for it im not sure we could get it up properly with both of us hurt i dont think the basket will be good for much in the way of shelter not by itself but two of the sides and part of the bottom are still intact she pointed out we can spread the canvas of the tent out over that by hand and use the remains to start a fire she stared at it for a moment so did he it looks as if its supported fairly well by those two saplings he pointed out the open side isnt facing the direction id prefer but maybe this is better than trying to wrestle it around she nodded well leave it where it is maybe reinforce the supports then well clear away the wreckage and the supplies cut away whats broken and tie in more support for the foundation by tying in those saplings she pointed with her good hand and he nodded look there and there he said pointing himself if we pile up enough stuff well have a threesided shelter instead of just a leanto that she agreed would be much better than her original idea in a moment the two of them were laboring as best they could her with one hand and him with one wing encased and a sprained hindleg both of them a mass of bruises he did most of the work of spreading out the canvas over the remaining sound walls of the basket he had more reach than she did she improvised tent stakes or used ones she uncovered in the course of moving supplies and tied the canvas down as securely as she could manage with only one hand one thing about growing up in the household of a kestrachern she had already known more kinds of knots and lashings than even her survival instructor she wasnt certain how tad felt but every movement made her shoulder ache viciously theres no choice she told herself each time she caught her breath with pain rest once it starts to rain work now she wasnt sure what time it was they hadnt gone very far before they had come crashing down and they hadnt been unconscious for long or else they would have awakened to find insects trying to see if they were dead yet scavengers didnt wait long in this kind of forest that meant it was probably still early morning if the rain threatened by those clouds held off they had until late afternoon before the inevitable afternoon thunderstorm struck if our luck hasnt gone totally sour that is eventually they had their threesided shelter the limp tent canvas stretched tightly over the remains of the basket and the three young trees that had caught it there were some loose flaps of canvas that she didnt quite know what to do with yet she might think of something later but this was the best they could do for now they both turned to the tumbled heaps of supplies sorting out what was ruined what could still be useful even though it was broken and what was still all right eventually they might have to sort out a version of what could be carried away in two packs but that would be later she would fight to remain here and so would tad walking off should not become an option until they were certain no one was going to come looking for them always stay with a wreck if you can that much she also remembered very well from their survival course the wreck makes the best target for searchers to find and the first place theyll look for you when they spot it if they could stay here they had a shelter they could improve more each day plus what was left of the supplies even things that were ruined might be useful if they had long enough to think of a use for them if they were forced to leave there was a lot of potentially useful and immediately useful gear they would be forced to leave behind if that was the trick she could not for a moment forget that something out there had drained away their magic without any warning at all if the wreck made a good target for searchers to find it also made a good target for other things to findincluding whatever knocked them out of the sky assume its an enemy and assume he attacked that was the wisest course of reasoning and the one she had to begin planning for for that matter there was no telling what prowled the forest floor just because they hadnt yet run into any major predators that didnt mean there werent any the longer they stayed in one place the easier it would be for predators to locate them thank goodness for aubri came a muffled sigh from her right and tad came up out of his pile of seemingrubbish at the same moment he held in his talon a nonmagical firestriker and blade put aside the pile shed been sorting to take it from him now she could make a fire with the dry shellaccoated splinters of the basket and pile damp green wood around that fire so that it could dry out enough to burn tad remained with his pile evidently hed found the box that had held all of the nonmagical gear that aubri had insisted they take with them she eyed the improvised shelter for a moment think first plan then move if you ruin something theres no one around to help with repairs and not much to make repairs with she wanted a way to shelter the fire from the rain without getting too much smoke into the shelter and she didnt want to take a chance on ruining the shelter they already had right theres the tent flap i bend those two saplings over and tie them to the basket then unfold the tent flap and tie it downthere and i think i can do that with one hand then maybe we can create a wind barrier with long branches and some of those big leaves plan now firmly in mind she onearm manhandled the saplings into place then pulled the flap of canvas out over the arch they formed to protect the area where she wanted to put the fire carefully she tied the end of the tent flap to another broken tree fumbling the knot several times if it wasnt caught by a big gust of wind it would hold at least they wouldnt be lacking in wood even though it was very green theyd brought down a two or three days supply with them when they fell and they also had spare clothing to use for kindling build the fire first then see about that barrier she scraped the leaflitter away from the ground until she had a patch of bare earth then carefully laid a fire of basketbits broken boxes and some of the leaves she found that were actually dry with the striker came a supply of tinder in the form of a roll of bonedry lint lightly pressed together with tiny paperscraps she pulled off a generous pinch and put the rest carefully away resealing the tinder box the firestriker was a pure nuisance to operate especially onehanded she finally wound up squatting down and bracing the box with one foot and finally she got a spark to catch in the tinder and coaxed the glowing ember into a tiny flame frowning with concentration she bent over her fragile creation and fed the flame carefully building it up little by little until at long last she had a respectable fire with the smoke channeling nicely away from the shelter at that point everything ached with strain breathing a painful sigh she straightened and looked over at tad to see what hed found the thing that caught her eye first was the ax that she was incredibly glad to see it was small enough to use onehanded sharp enough to hack through just about anything and right now they needed firewood she got painfully to her feet and helped herself to the implement then began reducing the debris around their improvised camp into something a bit more useful to them she tossed branches too small to be useful as firewood into a pile at one side if they had time before darkness fell or the rain camewhichever was firstshed make a brushpalisade around the camp with them it wouldnt actually keep anything out that really wanted to get at them but animals were usually wary of anything new and they might be deterred by this strange fence in their path and anything pushing through it is going to make noise which should give us some warning now just as long as nothing jumps over it when tad needs to urinate well collect it and spread it around the perimeter the scent of any large predator should scare most foragers and nuisance animals away and other than that it is a perfect day my lord the branches holding huge leaves she treated differently carefully separating the leaves from the fibrous pithy branches and setting them aside when she had enough of them and some straight poles shed put up that sheltering wall every time she swung the ax her body protested but it wasnt bad enough to stop her now that she had some momentum going if i stop i wont be able to move for hours so id better get everything i can done while im still mobile evidently tad had the same idea he was sorting through the supplies with the same singleminded determination she was feeling hed found her two packs of personal supplies and his own as well and put all of them in the shelter laid out next to them was the primitive aubri gear in between swings of the ax she made out candles and a candlelantern a tiny folded cookstove canteens two shovels and three leather water bottles two enormous knives good for hacking ones way through a jungle lay beside that also a neat packet of insect netting fishing line and hooks and a compass hed gotten to the weapons theyd carried with them as a matter of course and she grimaced to look at them they were largely useless in their present circumstances her favorite bow was broken the smaller one was intact but she couldnt pull it now nor could she use the sword tad was placing beside the oiledcanvas quivers of arrows beside that he laid his set of fightingclawswhich might be useful except that he couldnt walk while wearing them and what are we going to do if we re driven away from here and something attacks us on the trail ask it politely to wait while he gets his claws on but her heart rose in the next moment because he had found a sling he placed it beside his claws and two full pouches of heavy lead shot beside it now that she could use and use it well even with only one hand that gave her a little more energy to swing and his next find added to that energy for it was a short spear with a crosspiece on it like a boarspear it had broken but mostly lengthwise with the grain of the haft and what remained was short enough to use onehanded ican keep us fed with the sling with the knife and the spear i can fight things off he has his beak and talons which are not exactly petty weapons and he has some magic all gryphons had at least a small command of magic tad didnt have a lot not compared to his father but it might be useful but she shivered again thinking about what tads magic might attract and decided that she had chopped enough wood she ringed the fire with the green logs stacked the rest at the back of the leanto and piled the remains of the basket that she had chopped up wherever she could under shelter idont think i want him using any magic until we know for certain that whatever sucked the magic out of the basket isnt going to bother us she joined tad in his sorting sadly putting aside some oncemagical weapons that were now so much scrap unfortunately they were shaped too oddly to be of any immediate use the best purpose they could be put to now was as weights to hold pieces of canvas down to protect more useful itemslike woodfrom the rain she found the bedding at the bottom of the spill and took it all into the leanto to spread on the ground over mattresses of leaves and springy boughs she made another trip with more assorted items and the weapons and gear she could actually use now the rest including some broken items she laid under a piece of canvas she might think of something to do with them later most of the equipment was just plain ruined and so was a great part of their food the rations that survived the smash were predictably the kind a mercenary army normally carried dried meat and a hard tengrain rationbiscuit made with dried vegetables and fruit this was not exactly a feast but the dried meat would sustain tad and the hard rationbread was something that a person could actually live on for one or two months at a time he wouldnt enjoy living on it but it was possible to do so without suffering any ill consequences she paused and took a closer look at the smashed and ruined food at the moment some of it was still edible though it wouldnt stay that way for long better save the rations for tonight and eat what we can of this she gathered together enough of the food to make a very hearty meal and placed it by the fire then laboriously took the rest out into the forest and deposited it a goodly way away from the camp better not let the local fauna associate the camp with food they could set snares another time for the curious to supplement the driedmeat ration time for that windbreakwall beside the fire she stuck the ends of four of the long whippy branches into the soil and tied the tops to whatever she could reach along the supported tent flap using her teeth and her one good hand then she threaded the leaves on another of the long branches overlapping them like shingles when she came to the end of the branch she tied that along the base of the four wall supports about a hands length from the ground once again using teeth as well as her hand then she went back to threading leaves on another branch and tied that one so that it overlapped the one below it it didnt take very long and when she finished she thought that the result like the shelter would hold up fairly well as long as no violent winds came up which wasnt too likely under the canopy when she left her completed wall tad was already sticking brush into the soft loam of the forest floor to make that brushfence she had considered she joined him just as thunder rumbled threateningly in the distance she took a quick glance over her shoulder saw that everything worth saving was under some form of shelter and that the fire still burned well itll survive i hope well just have to hope our luck has turned she joined tad in constructing the fence their new home wasnt much of one but it was after all better than nothing the work went quickly the earth was so soft here that it didnt take much effort to thrust the thin branches down well enough to anchor them securely thunder rumbled right above them she glanced up just in time to catch one of the first fat drops right in her eye a heartbeat later as they were scrambling back to the shelter of the tent the sky opened up together they huddled under the canvas it was a very close fit but no closer than it had been when the tent was still a tent water poured out of the sky at a fantastic rate now she was glad that she had brought everything under the leanto that she could as she found it shed seen waterfalls with less water cascading down them it all came straight down too without a sign of any wind to blow it sideways there must have been some high winds at treetop level though the trunks of trees nearest her swayed a little as she watched them the trees acted as a buffer between them and whatever wind the storm brought with it there was no moment when lightning was not illuminating some part of the sky and there were times when she saw the fat raindrops seemingly hanging in the air due to a trick of the flickering light the rain knocked loose what branches hadnt come down with them one or two thudded against the shelter and she was glad that there was canvas and the basket between them and the debris canvas alone would have caved in or torn she wondered if she should clear the fallen branches away later if it isnt hurting anything ill leave it if we look like a pile of debris to animals they might leave us alone nowhat am i thinking the native animals will know what is right or wrong for their own area i must be delirious tad gazed out at the powerful storm with his eyes wide and his feathers roused against the cool damp she wondered what he was thinking every time one of the really big lightningbolts flashed across the sky the back of his eyes glowed greenly her shoulder began to stab at her again throbbing in time to the thunder the drugs she had taken must have worn off a bit if she was in serious pain tad probably was too and there was no reason why they should endure it if they didnt have to the medical kit contained enough painrelieving drugs to last two people for two weeksby then they would either be found or be in such serious trouble that a little pain would be the least of their worries she felt for the bag of medicines and fished in it for two more vials of painkiller handing him his he took it pierced the seal with a talon and swallowed it down before she even had hers open he took hers away from her and punctured the wax seal for her in the same way she took it back gratefully and downed it should we set a watch he asked i think we should i think we should really try to stay awake even if were taking painkillers i dont like the idea of lying here helpless it was different when we could set magewards but now she thought about the question for a moment we probably ought to even though its not likely we could do much against a real enemy then again if all that comes to plague us is scavengers and wild beasts if we set a watch whoever is awake can probably fend off any trouble i agree if you can sleep now go ahead she said finally i cant not even with this demons brew in me if youre rested by the time i cant stay awake any longer then you can take second watch he nodded and she draped some of the bedding over him to keep him warm ill have something for you to eat when you wake up she promised i think its going to rain until well after dark ill wake you up when i cant keep my eyes open anymore she had no idea how he did it but he was actually asleep shortly after she finished speaking must be exhausted she decided he was trying so hard to slow our fall that must have taken an awful lot out of him i ought to be surprised that he didnt just collapse completely after his wing was set she ought to feel a great deal more than she did it was hard to sustain anything even fear for very long thats shock and maybe its just as well as long as i plan everything and concentrate i can carry it out later perhaps she would be able to feel and react now she was oddly grateful for the peculiar numbness since the supplies she had salvaged were pretty much mixed up together already she used the hodgepodge of foodstuffs to make a kind of giant pancake with meat vegetables and spices all baked into it she made as many of these cakes as she had supplies for ate one herself and saved the rest for tad after that she just stared out into the rain it was growing darker by the moment although that simply could have been thickening clouds and not oncoming nightfall a dull lethargy settled over her and the rain lulled her into a state of wary weariness there was no sign that the rain was going to collapse the roof and no sign that it was going to stop any time soon belatedly she realized that here was a good source of fresh water for them and she began to rummage through the supplies again as she found things that could hold water she stuck every container she could find into the streams of runoff along the front edge of the canvas before long she had all their canteens and storagebottles full and had refilled the rest of their containers a second time and shed washed and rinsed the dishes ican get a wash that revived her somewhat she felt sweaty grimy and the mere idea of being able to wash herself revived her a little she put a potful of water beside the fire to warm up if she didnt have to wash herself in cold water she wasnt going to they might not have magic but they still had other resources besides there were some remedies for bruises in that medical gear that had to be steeped in warm water when she finished washing she could do something about her minor injuries they probably wouldnt feel so minor when she tried to sleep poor tad i dont think my remedies will work on his bruises he hasnt got bare flesh to use them on no point in soaking his feathers either that would only chill him and make him feel worse rain continued to pound the canvas the falling rain was the only sound in the whole forest at least to her limited ears she sat with her knees drawn up to her chest and her good arm wrapped around them watching the silver water continue to pour out of the sky sent into a trancelike state by the steady dull roaring the flash of lightning and the pounding of thunder were the only things that kept her from completely succumbing and falling asleep a time or two she caught herself with a sudden shock and a pounding heart jerking herself awake when her water warmed she clumsily stripped off her tunic fished out a scrap of ruined cloth and bathed her bruises with gratitude in lieu of soap how good a simple thing like a warm damp cloth on her aches felt and how good it felt to be clean her sense of being grimy had not been wrong oh how i wish i had one of those hot pools to soak in well while im at it why dont i wish for rescue a soft bed in a deep cave and enough painkiller to keep me asleep until this shoulder is healed more such thoughts would only depress her or make her frantic with worry she should concentrate on now and on doing the best she could with what she had just being clean again made her feel a great deal better time to put on clothing that was equally clean the air had cooled considerably since the rain began now it was getting positively chill as well as damp she pulled out a tunic with long sleevesand realized as she started to put it on that it would be impossibly painful to get her arm into the sleeve without ruining the tunic well who was there to see her no one she slit the front of the tunic with her knife she could belt it closed again but before she put on any clothing she wrapped a blanket around her shoulders and went back to the medical kit she should treat the bruises first then get dressed she found the herbs she needed in the kit and put them into the pot of remaining warm water to steep now the rain did show some signs of slacking off but it was also getting much darker out there this wasnt just thickening cloud cover it must be just past sunset she reached for the shortened spear and pulled out a selection of knives that could be thrown in a pinch then considered her next move do i build the fire up to discourage night prowlers or bank it so as not to attract attention after some consideration she opted for the former most animals were afraid of fire if they smelled the smoke they might avoid this area altogether she had to burn green wood but that was all right since the smoke it made drifted away from the leanto and not into it a bigger fire warmed the interior of their shelter nicely and beside her tad muttered drowsily and settled into deeper sleep when the herbwater was a deep murky brown she stripped off her blanket soaking bandages in the potion until the bowl was empty she wrapped the soaked cloth around the areas most bruised curling up in the blanket until they dried the heat felt wonderfuland the medicines actually began to ease the dull throbbing ache wherever some of the worst bruises were the scent of the potion arose bitter and pungent to her nose good at least i dont smell like anything edible i wouldnt want to eat anything that smelled like me even the bugs wont bite me now maybe it wasnt long before the bandages were dry enough to take off she pulled on her breeches with one hand then got her tunic on over her good arm and pulled it closed fortunately the belt fastener was a buckle with a hook instead of a tongue she belted the slit tunic so that it would stay closed more or less the rain stopped altogether insects called out of the gloom in all directions as the last of the light faded odd whoops and strange haunted cries joined the buzzing and metallic chirping of insects bird animal reptile she had no way of knowing most of the calls echoed down from high above and could come from any throat it was very damp cold and very dark out there the only other spots of light were foxfire off in the distance probably from a decaying stump and the mating lights of wandering insects no moon no stars she couldnt see either right now maybe the cloud cover was still too thick maybe the cover of the leaves was too heavy at least they had a fire the remains of the basket were burning very well and the green wood burning better than she had expected perhaps the most frustrating thing of all about their situation was that neither she nor tad had done a single thing wrong they hadnt been showing off nor had they been in the least careless even experienced campaigners like aubri and judeth would have been caught unaware by this situation and probably would have found themselves in the same fix it wasnt their fault unfortunately their situation was still a fact and fault didnt matter to corpses once blade had immobilized tads wing it hadnt hurt nearly as much as he had expected that might have been shock but it probably wasnt the break was simple and with luck it was already knitting gryphon bones healed quickly with or without the services of a healer it probably didnt hurt nearly as much as his partners collarbone either his wing was not going to move no matter what he did but if she had to move and work she was going to be jarring her shoulder over and over again iwish the teleson wasnt gone i wish i could fix it he could fix the firestarter and the magelight and probably would after he slept but the teleson was beyond him as was the tent and the cook pot if they had the teleson help could be here in two days or three at the most now it might be two or three days before anyone even knew they were in trouble he had volunteered for the second watch because he knew that she was going to have to be very tired before she could sleepbut once she was those painkillers were going to hit her hard once she fell asleep it was going to be difficult to wake her until she woke by herself for his part although the painkiller helped keeth had taught him a fair amount about taking care of himself he could selftrance pretty easily and he knew several painreduction and relaxation techniques lucky i have a trondiirnsor a brother he made himself comfortable and once blade draped a blanket over him so that he was warm he fell asleep quickly strange images too fleeting to be called dreams drifted with him visions of himself visiting a trading fair in khimbata but as an adult rather than a child trailing after his haighlei nurse makke moments of flying so high above the earth that even with his keen eyesight humans below him were no more than specks there were visions that were less rational he thought once that the trees were talking to him but in a language he didnt recognize and that they grew frustrated and angry with him because he didnt understand what they were trying to tell him none of this was enough to actually disturb his rest he roused just enough to dismiss the dreams that were unpleasant without actually breaking his sleep then drifted back into darkness he was just about on the verge of waking all by himselfhalfdreaming that he ought to wake but unable to really get the energy to rouse himself when blade shook him slightly enough to jar him completely out of his halfsleep he blinked up at her her face was a bizarre mask of purpling bruises and dancing golden firelight if it had been a little more symmetrical and less obviously painful it would have been oddly attractive he tasted bitter herbs in the air as she yawned and guessed that she had bandaged herself with some of her human medicines i took more painkillers and i cant stay awake anymore she confessed yawning again i havent seen or heard anything that i can confirm although my imagination has been working away nicely fine then get some sleep he said a little thickly and blinked to clear his eyes ill take over until dawn she settled herself between the wall of the tent and him lying against him he let her curl up in such a way as to take the most advantage of his warmth she needed it and she probably needs the comfort just as much he thought as she tried to arrange herself in a way that would cause the least pain to her broken collarbone itcant have been easy sitting here staring into the dark and wondering what was out there with your partner a great snoring lump beside you granted he wouldnt have stayed a great snoring lump for long if thered been trouble but that was no comfort when you were straining your ears trying to tell if that was a nightbird a bug or a maneating whatever out there gryphons were not noted for having powerful night vision but both skandranon and his two offspring were better than the norm at seeing in the dark they werent owlsbut they werent halfblind either and they were better than humans he let his eyes adjust to the darkness and mentally marked the shadows so that he knew where everything was some he could even identify by matching the general shape with his memory of the objects surrounding the camp the place that looked like a crouching bear was really a stump overgrown with inedible fungi and the bush that seemed to have a deeper shadow at the heart of it really did it had grown around what remained of a snag which could have passed for another crouching creature deep in the distance a phosphorescent shape was a rotting tree with a patch of foxfire fungus in itand it wasnt really moving that was an illusion brought on by eyestrain things that might have been pairs of eyes reflecting the firelight were nothing of the kind if he watched them until they moved it was clear that they moved independently of one another which meant they were only a couple of lightbearing insects probably flying in pairs because they were in the middle of a mating dance a swift and silent shape passing from branch to branch above his head was an owl one that flew with a faint fluttering just out of range of the firelight was a bat once he identified things in his range of vision he began cataloging sounds the obvious buzzes and whirs were insect calls likewise there were croaks and cheeps he knew were frogs there were some calls he recognized from around white gryphon not all the creatures here were new to him the occasional sleepy twitter or mutter from high above meant that something had mildly disturbed a birds restnothing to worry about birds bumped into each other while they slept all the time then there were the howls barks and growls he took note of all of them keeping track of where they were coming from and under what circumstances most of them originated from up in the tree canopy that meant that barring something completely strange whatever made them wasnt going to bother the two down below the things living in the trees would for the most part be prey rather than predator life in the tree tops was difficult with the most difficult task of all being how to get to water anything living up there had a reason not to want to live on the ground any creature up there would probably be relatively small no bigger than blade at the most with a disproportionately loud call because in the thick leaf cover up there it would be hard to keep track of herd or flockmates and if you yelled loudly enough when something grabbed you there was a chance that you might startle it into letting go predators in the tree canopy would either be snakes or winged fourfooted predators would hunt on the ground while it was certainly possible that there could be a snake up there large enough to swallow blade or even tad it would not be able to seize both of them at once and it would not be very fast except when it struck that left winged predators and tad was confident that he would be a match for anything that flew even grounded no what they had to worry about was what lay down here so sounds up above could be dismissed unless and until they erupted in warning or alarm calls while his vision was incredibly keen by human standards it was even more suited to picking up tiny movements so once he had identified everything that lay in front of the shelter he did not need to sit and stare into the darkness as blade did he need only relax and let his eyes tell him when something out there had changed its position no matter how clever a predator was at skulking sooner or later it would have to cross a place where he would spot it moving through the shadows even on a night with no moon his hearing was just as good and now that he knew what the normal noises were he could listen through them for the sound of a grunt a growl or the hiss of breathor for the rustle of a branchor the crack of a twig snapped beneath a foot that was the other reason why he didnt mind taking second watch when all was said and done he was much better suited to it than blade was now if anything decided to come up behind them he wouldnt see it and he might not hear it either but it wouldnt get through the canvas and basketry of their shelter quickly and they should have time to defend themselves or so i tell myself he stared out into the darkness watching winking insect lights and finally acknowledged to himself that far from feeling competent he was feeling rather helpless were both crippled and in pain we cant use most of the weapons we have left we aren t entirely certain where we are and were too far from home to get back and thats the honest truth i dont like it at all they had to hope that in three days or so when they didnt make the appointed rendezvous theyd be missed and that white gryphon would send out a search party looking for them they had to hope that they could survive long enough to be found oh stop feeling sorry for yourself and eat he scolded himself you arent going to get a chance at a better meal for a while and starving yourself is hardly going to do any good whatever blade fixed it probably wont keep past morning slowly to make them last he ate the meatandvegetable cakes that blade had concocted they werent bad considering how awful they could have been blade was not noted for being anything other than an indifferent cook and these had actually been one of her best efforts the two of them would probably joke about the incongruity of cooking a gourmet meal in the middle of a disaster after they had escaped this stranding and healed of course to hear the stories about father you would think he was so dashing that he would fight off two hundred makaar seduce his wingleader arrange a tryst fight off another hundred makaar and then pause for tea from a silver cup blade had placed the odd cakes close enough to the fire that they kept warm without burning or drying out much they would probably stay with him for a while which was a good thing since he wasnt going to be doing much hunting for the next couple of days and even then in order to take down the size of prey he was used to hed have to somehow surprise it on the ground fathers claims about being able to slip through enemy lines unseen might be true but deer have keener noses and ears than human soldiers im going to have to be very lucky to catch anything larger than a squirrel he was satisfied before finishing the cakes so he covered the last four of them with a leaf followed by a layer of hot ashes burying them next to the fire he would leave them for breakfast they should keep that long then he rested his chin on his foreclaws and resumed his interrupted thoughts the trouble is i have no idea just what it was that knocked us out of the sky obviously he had several options it could have been a purely natural phenomenonor if not natural simply an anomalous and accidental creation of the magestorms the trouble with that theory is that there have been a number of folk through here haighlei included so that precludes it being stationary or ground bound if it was something natural or accidental it had to be stationary it seemed so why didnt anyone discover it before this the haighlei in particular suspicious as they were of anything magical that was not under the direct control of one of their priestmages made a point of looking for such wild magic using broad farranging sweeps they had established the outpost they would have come this way though perhaps not this exact route they should have found something this powerful granted we were a bit off the regular route i wasnt watching the ground that closely for landmarks i was watching the sky for weather i think i was even veering off a bit to avoid the worst of the storm still a bad spot even a null area should show up to any skilled mage who was looking for it it should be obvious to any mage looking for oddities iwasnt looking i have to think about using magesight in order to see things im not like snowstar who has to remind himself not to use it that left the next possibility it was something new or else something that was outside his knowledge he inexorably moved his thoughts toward the uneasy concept that something had brought them down intentionally either in an attack or as a measure of preventive defense but if it was a defensive measure how did they ever see us from the ground the attack couldnt have come from the air there hadnt been anything in the air except birds and themselves it hadnt come from the tree canopy or he would have seen something directly below it had to have come from ground level below the tree canopy so how had they seen the basket blade and tad still so far whatever brought them down hadnt come after them that argued in favor of it being a defensive perhaps even a reflexive answer to a perceived threat but it happened so quickly unless they had a spell actually ready to do something like that i cant see how they could have done this before we got out of range that argued for an attack argued for attackers who might actually have trailed them some time before they landed last night and waited for them to get into the sky again before launching a spell that would send them crashing to the ground so why didnt they come see if theyd killed us could they have been that sure of themselves could they simply not have cared or could they be better at hiding themselves than he was at spotting them could they be out there right now it was certainly possible that the attackers had struck from some distance away and had not reached the site of the crash before he and blade were up alert and able to defend themselves the kind of attack certainly argued for a cowardly opponent one who would want to wait until his prey was helpless or in an inescapable position before striking unless of course he is simply a slow opponent one who was making certain of every inch of ground between himself and us before he initiated a confrontation he sighed quietly there was only one problem this was all speculation none of this gave him any hard evidence for or against anything he just didnt have any facts beyond the simplestthat they had been the victim of something that destroyed their holds on magic and brought them tumbling helplessly down out of the sky so for the rest of the night he continued to scan the forest and keep his ears wide open starting at every tiny sound and cursing his unending headache dawn was heralded by nothing more obvious than a gradual lightening of the darkness under the trees tad knew that his partner was about to waken when her breathing speeded up and her heartrate increasedboth of which he could hear quite easily at his side blade yawned stirred started to stretch and swore under her breath at the pain that movement caused her tad hooked a talon around the strap of the medical supply bag and dragged it over to her so she could rummage in it without moving much she heard him and shoved her hand in and pulled out one of the little vials without being asked he pierced the wax seal with his talon and she drank it down blade lay quietly for many long moments before her painkillers took effect i assume nothing happened last night she made it an inquiry nothing worth talking aboutexcept that i think there was some squabbling over the remains of the foodstuffs he hadnt heard anything in particular except a few grunts and the sound of an impact as if one of the scavengers had cuffed another we ought to consider putting out snares especially whipsnares that would take a catch out of reach of the ground it would be very frustrating to discover wed trapped something but a scavenger beat us to it she sat up slowly rubbing her eyes with her good hand i should have thought of that last night she said ruefully they wouldnt have worked last night he pointed out it was raining until well after dark chances are the lines would have been ruined or stakes pulled out of the mud if it doesnt rain that badly today we can put them out after the afternoon rains are over she yawned again then grimaced and gingerly rubbed her bruised jaw good idea she agreed snares are a more efficient means of getting us supplemental rations than hunting well trap the area where i dumped the ruined food even if theres nothing left animals still might come back hoping there will be oh gods i am stiff and sore i know precisely how you feel i saved us some breakfast he scraped away the ashes and revealed the cakes now a bit crisper than they had been and a bit grimier but still edible iwish i had some bruise medicine that would work as well on me as hers does on her did you she brightened and scratched the back of her neck with her good hand well that puts a better complexion on things and my bruise remedy seems to have the additional value of keeping away bugs for once i havent got any new bites do you think you want another dose of your painkillers he shook his head i took one as soon as it was light enough to see which vial was which he handed her a cake and ate the remaining three neatly but quickly one cake seemed to be substantial enough to satisfy her though he noted that she did devour every crumb and licked her fingers clean afterward thanks to the fact that she had filled and refilled every container they had he had even been able to get a drink without her assistance from a wide pot he waited until she ate washed her face and hands and looked a bit more alert now what do we do he asked as she dried off her face on her ruined tunic of yesterday he made a mental note to have her set that out when the rains started to give it a primitive wash she sat back on her heels wincing as she jarred her shoulder nowwe discuss options she said slowly what we do next and where we go he stretched taking care with his bandagedwing and settled back again options he repeated after her well we both know that the best thing we can do is stay here right and build a beacon she squinted past the canvas up through the treetops at the tiny patches of sky visible now and again winking through the greenery like bright white eyes a very smoky beacon its going to take a lot of smoke to trickle up through that cover its going to take two or three days before they know were missing he said aloud just to make certain he had all of his reasoning straight we have a shelter and we can make it better and stronger just by using available wood and leaves i saw what you did with that windbreak and we could certainly add layers of wall that way over the canvas and wicker if you look at the fallen leaves youll see that the ones you used dry up a lot like light leather theyll hold up as shelter material she nodded although she made a face it wont be easy onehanded she warned and im still the only decent knot tier in this team you can bite holes i can tie cord through them but it is still tedious so we take it slowly i can do quite a bit i just have to be careful he paused for a moment and went on were injured but im still a fullgrown gryphon and there arent too many things that care to take on something my size hurt or not in that two or three days whatever brought us down can find us study us and make its own plans she countered falling easily into the role of oppositionjust as he would when she proposed a plan we have to assume we were attacked and plan accordingly to defend ourselves this place isnt exactly defensible he nodded that was obvious enough there was cover on all sides and they didnt have the means to clear it all away not even by burning it down assuming they could he wasnt willing to place bets on anything chances were if they tried nothing would happen after all they had no way to take down trees with trunks big enough for two and three men to put their arms around but there was always the chance that they would succeed better than they anticipatedand set fire to the whole forest trapping themselves in an inferno he had not forgotten that the green wood around the fire last night had certainly burned more efficiently than he had anticipated no setting fire to this place to get a defensible clearing was not a good idea we ought to be someplace where our beacon has a chance of being seen at night she went on i dont think we made that big a hole in the tree cover when we went through it we didnt i checked too bad but she was right half the use of the beacon was at night but there wasnt a chance that a night flyer would see a fire on the ground unless it was much larger than one that two people could build and tend alone the last problem is that theres no source of water here she concluded and held up her good hand i know weve had plenty of rain every afternoon ever since we entered this area but we dont dare count on that sowere in an undistinguished spot with no landmarks under the tree canopy with nothing to put our backs against and no source of water he grimaced when you put it that way staying here doesnt seem like much of an option we only have to go far enough to find a stream or a pond she pointed out with luck that might not be too far away well get our break in the cover and our water source and we can worry about making it defensible when we see what kind of territory were dealing with but i think we ought to at least consider moving maybe he said doubtfully but what he was going to reply was lost in the rumble of thunder overheadand the spatter of rain on leaves not today he breathed as the rain came down again as torrential as yesterday but much earlier in the day blade swore and stuck her head out to get a good look at the raina little too far as she managed to jiggle the canvas and wicker of their roof just enough to send a cascade of cold water down the back of her neck she jerked back and turned white with pain the stream of oaths she uttered would have done a hardened trooper proud but tad didnt say anything the cold water was insult enough but when she lurched back she must have really jarred her bad shoulder ill get wood he offered hastily and crawled slowly out of the shelter trying not to disturb it any more getting soaked was infinitely preferable to staying beside blade when several things had gone wrong at once she was his partner and his best friendbut he knew her and her temper very very well and given the choiceid rather take a thunderstorm five wet gryphon blade announced wrinkling her nose is definitely not in the same aromatic category as a bouquet of lilies neither is medicineslathered human tad pointed out mildly ill drybut in the morning youll still be covered with that smelly soup since he had just finished helping her wrap her limbs and torso in wet brown bandages he thought he had as much right to his observation as she had to hers in fact he had shaken as much off his feathers as he could before he got into the tent and he was not wet anymore just damp and it could be worse you could be sharing this shelter with a wet kyree he added she made a face ive been stuck in a small space with a wet kyree before and you are a bundle of fragrant herbs if not a bouquet of lilies compared to that experience supper for her had been one of the pieces of travelbread which she had gnawed on rather like a kyree with a bone they had been unbelievably lucky blade had spotted a curious climbing beast venturing down out of the canopy to look them over and she had gotten it with her sling it made a respectable meal especially since tad hadnt done much to exert himself and burn off breakfast he had gone out to get more wood searching for windfall and dragging it back to the camp then he had done the reverse taking what wreckage they were both certain was utterly useless and dropping it on the other side of their brushpalisade where they wouldnt always be falling over it blade had gone out in the late afternoon to chop some of the wood tad had found and bathe herself all over in the rain he had been a gentleman and kept his eyes averted even though she wasnt his species she was unusually bodyshy for a kaledainor perhaps it was simply that she guarded every bit of her privacy that she had any control over at any rate she had gathered up her courage and taken a cold rain bath dashing back in under the shelter to huddle in a blanket afterward she claimed that she felt much better but he wondered how much of that was bravado or wishful thinking she was a human and not built for forcefulor badlandings although the basket had given her some protection he had no real idea how badly hurt she was in comparison with him nor was she likely to tell him if she was hurt deeper than the skinobvious to his growing worry he suspected that her silence might hide her emotional wounds as well after she was dry she had asked his help with her bruisemedicines there was no doubt of how effective they were after the treatment yesterday the bruises were fading going from purple dark blue and black to yellow green and purple while this was not the most attractive colorcombination it did indicate that she was healing faster than she would have without the treatments he finished the last scrap of meat and offered her the bones you could put these in the fire and roast them he said as she hesitated then you could eat the marrow marrow is rich in a lot of good things this beast wasnt bad the marrow has to have more taste than that chunk of bread youve been chewing straw would have more taste she replied and accepted the larger bones i can bite the bones open later if they dont split and you can carve out the cooked marrow we can use the long bone splinters as stakes they might be useful tad offered blade nodded while trying unsuccessfully to stretch her arms you try and crunch up as much of those smaller bones as you can theyll help your wing heal she buried the bones in the ashes and watched them carefully as he obeyed her instructions and snapped off bits of the smaller bones to swallow she was right every gryphon knew that it took bone to build bone when one of the roasting bones split with an audible crack she fished it quickly out of the fire scraping the soft roasted marrow out of the bones with the tip of her knife she spread it on her bread and ate it that way this is better its almost good she said around a mouthful thanks tad my pleasure he replied pleased to see her mood slowly lifting shall we set the same watches as last night he yawned hugely its always easier for me to sleep on a full stomach its impossible to keep you awake when your bellys full you mean she retorted but now she wore a ghost of a smile its the best plan we have his wing did hurt less or at least he thought it did gryphon bones tended to knit very quickly like the bones of the birds that they were modeled after just at the moment he was grateful that this was so he preferred not to think about the consequences if somehow blade had set his wing badly not that his days of fancy aerobatics would be over but having his wingbones rebroken and reset would be very unpleasant he peered up at the tree canopy and as usual saw nothing more than leaves and rain lots of it im afraid were in for another long rain like last night he said ruefully so much for putting out snares we cant have everything our way she shrugged so far were doing all right we could survive a week this way with no problemas long as nothing changes as long as nothing changes perhaps she had meant that to sound encouraging but as he willed himself to sleep he couldnt feel any encouragement everything changes eventually only a fool would think otherwise we might think we know what were doing but it only takes one serious mistake out here and were dead even a minor mistake would mean that everything changes the thought followed him down into his sleep where it woke uneasy echoes among his dreams he slept so lightly that blade did not need to shake him awake he roused to the sound of water dripping steadily from the leaves above the crackling and popping of the fire and the calls of insects and frogs that was all it was very nearly silent out there and it was a silence that was unnerving the forest that he knew fell silent in this way when a large and dangerous predatorsuch as a gryphonwas aprowl he doubted that the denizens of this forest knew the two of them well enough to think that they were dangerous that could only mean that something the local creatures knew was dangerous was out there somewhere anything he whispered she shook her head slightly without taking her eyes off the forest and he noticed that she had banked the fire down so that it didnt dazzle her eyes he strained both eyes and ears testing the night even as she did and found nothing it isnt that everything went quiet it was that nothing much started making nightsounds after dark she whispered back i suppose we might have driven all the local animals off even the things that live up in the canopy i doubt it he replied why would anything up there be afraid of us she shrugged all i know is i havent heard or seen anything but i have that unsettling feeling that something is watching us somewhere and whatever it is the local creatures dont like it either he had the same feeling a crawling sensation at the back of his neck and an itch in his talons there were unfriendly eyes out there in the night and tad and blade were at a disadvantage it knew where they were and what they were they had no idea what it was but if it hadnt attacked while he was asleep hopefully it wouldnt while blade took her rest get to sleep he told her if theres anything out there except our imaginations it isnt likely to do anything now that im on watch i look more formidable than you do and i intend to reinforce that under the packs holding blades clothing were his fightingclaws he picked up her packs with his beak and fished them out the bright steel winked cruelly in the subdued firelight and he made a great show of fitting them on once blade had fastened the straps he settled back in but with a more watchful stance than the previous night if theres nothing out there im going to feel awfully stupid in the morning for putting on all this show well better to feel stupid than be taken unaware by an attacker even if it was just an animal watching them body language was something an animal could read very well hopefully in the shiny claws and the alert stance it would read the fact that attacking them would be a big mistake blade pulled blankets around herself as she had the night before but he noticed that she had a fightingknife near at hand and her crossdraw knife under her pillow i just hope she can make herself sleep he fretted a little shes going to be of no use if shes exhausted in the morning if there was the slightest chance of convincing her to drink it id offer her a sleeping tea he waited all night but nothing happened drops of water continued to splat down out of the trees and frogs and insects sang although nothing else moved or made a sound he began to wonder toward dawn if perhaps they had frightened away everything but the bugs and reptiles it wasnt likely but it was possible by the time the forest began to lighten with the coming of dawn every muscle in his body ached with tension his eyes twitched and burned with fatigue and he could hardly wait for blade to wake up but he wouldnt awaken her himself she needed her rest as much as he needed his finally when dawn had given way to full daylight she stirred and came awake all at once nothing he said answering her unspoken question except that nothing larger than a gamebird made a sound all night either near the camp now he moved removing the fightingclaws getting stiffly to his feet and prowling out into the rising fog he wanted to see what he could before the fog moved in and made it impossible to see again shrouding in whiteness what the night had shrouded in black he was looking for foot or pawprints places where the leaves had been pressed down by a body resting there for some time this was the area of which he was most proud he wasnt just a good tracker he was a great one blade was good but he was a magnitude better than she why a gryphon who spent his life furlongs above the ground should prove to be such a natural tracker was a total mystery to him if skandranon had boasted a similar ability no one had ever mentioned it he only knew that he had been the best in his group and that he had impressed the best of the kaledain scouts that was no small feat since it was said of them that they could follow the track of the wind he suspected he would need every bit of that skill now he worked his way outward from the brushfence and found nothing not the least sign that there had been anything out in the darkness last night except his imagination he worked his way out far enough that he was certain no one and nothing could have seen a bit of the camp by this time he was laughing at himself i should have known better exhaustion pain and too many drugs thats a combination guaranteed to make a person think hes being watched when hes alone in his own aerie he debated turning and going back to the camp the fog was thickening with every moment and he wouldnt be able to see much anyway in fact he had turned in his tracks mentally rehearsing how he was going to make fun of himself to blade when he happened to glance over to the side at the spot where he had left the wreckage he had hauled out of the camp yesterday he froze in place for that spot was not as he had left it nor did it look as if scavengers had simply been rummaging through it every bit of trash had been meticulously taken apart examined and set aside in a series of piles here were the impressions he had looked for in vain the marks of something several somethings that had lain in the leaf mold and pawed over every bit of useless debris his intuition and blades had been correct it had not been weariness pain and the medicines there had been something out here last night and before it had set to watch the camp it had been right here some of the larger pieces of wreckage were missing and there were no drag marks to show where they had been taken that meant that whatever had been here had lifted the pieces and carried them off rather than dragging them and except for this one place there was no trace of whatever had been here the creature or creatures that had done this had eeled their way through the forest leaving nothing of themselves behind this couldnt be coincidence it had to be the work of whatever had brought them crashing down out of the sky now their mysterious enemies whatever they were had spent the night studying him blade and as much of the things belonging to them as had been left within their reach they now had the advantage for he and blade knew nothing of them not even if they ran on four legs six eight two or something else all that he knew was that the creatureor creaturesthey faced were intelligent enough to examine things minutelyand cunning enough to do so without clear detection he turned and ran back to the camp despite the added pain it brought him it was not simple fear that galvanized him it was abject terror for nothing can be worse to a gryphon than an opponent who is completely unknown as tad spoke blade shivered although the sun was high enough now that it had driven off the fog and replaced the cool damp with the usual heat and humidity the pain weariness the drugsall of them were taking their toll on her endurance her hands shook her pale face told him that it wasnt fear that was making her shake it was strain this just might be the event that broke her nerve tad had tried to be completely objective he had tried only to report what he had seen not what he had felt out there faced with the evidence of their watchers he had sensed a malignant purpose behind it all that he had no rational way of justifying but blade evidently felt the same way that he did and rather than break this new stress made her rally her resources her face remained pale but her hands steadied and so did her voice we havent a choice now she said flatly we have to get out of here we cant defend this place against creatures that can come and go without a sign that they were there if were lucky theyre territorial and if we get far enough out of their territory theyll be satisfied once again the wildlife of this place was mysteriously absent from their immediate vicinity only a few birds called and cried in the canopy did they know something that the two below them did not and if were not well be on the run with no secure place to hole up he argued his focus sharpened and he felt the feathers along his cheeks and jaws ripple if they can come and go without our seeing them they can track us without our knowing theyre behind us i dont want some unseen enemy crawling up my tail i want to see whoever i am against that unnerved him and he was not ashamed to show it the idea that something could follow them or get ahead of them and set an ambush and he would never know it until it was too late it just made his guts bind and crawl blade was quiet for a moment chewing on her lower lip all around them water dripped slowly from the leaves making the long fall to splash into puddles below and the air was thick with the perfumes of strange flowers look she said finally we didnt fly all that far before we were brought down twenty maybe thirty leagues at most we can go back in the direction of our previous campsite that was defensible remember there was a cliff nearby and remember the river that ran alongside it nervously tad flexed his talons into the loam new scents rose to his nostrils of earth and old leaves dampness and the sharp aroma of a torn fungus you have a point he thought about her suggestion mentally trying to figure out how long it would take two injured people to walk the distance that two uninjured people had flown it isnt so much the distance as what we have to cross to get there it might take us as much as four days he pointed out we dont have any real way of getting good directions other than the northneedle and were going to be crawling through leagues of this he waved his claw at the tangled undergrowth were going to be carrying packs well have to guard our backtrail and watch ahead for ambushes and were both injured all of that will delay us in fact we probably ought to assume that were going to be creeping through the forest not hiking through it if were going to do this i want to creep i want to go from bit of cover to bit of cover i want to walk so that we leave no sign and little scent i want to leave traps behind but when we get therewell be at a cliff face tad that means caves probably at least one waterfall even if we dont find the river at first we can work our way along the cliff until we do find the river well at least have someting we can put our backs against she looked unbelievably tense and tad didnt blame her of the two of them she was the most vulnerable physically and the least able to defend herself knife skill or not not that either of us will be particularly good at it in terrain like this im at a distinct disadvantage if anything gets in front of me i can probably shred it but at my sides and rear im badly vulnerable at close quarters if they left this camp their choice of how to proceed was simple pack out what they could or try to live off the land with very little to aid them take the chance that they could improvise or or find out that we cant were hurt we are going to need every edge we can get that means tools weapons food protection the one advantage that we have is that whatever these creatures are they dont know us so they cant predict us she persisted if we move now we may confuse them they may linger to look over what we left we arent going to lose them unless they lose interest in us but we may leave them far enough behind that it will take them a while to catch up if only they had some idea of what kind of creature they were up against the very fact that they would be trying to slip quietly through the forest rather than running might confuse their foes or it might tempt them into an attack they might read that as an admission of weakness there was just no way of knowing he nodded grinding his beak a bit meanwhile if we stay they can study us at their leisure he admitted and that makes us easy targets go or stay remain where they were or try to find some place easier to defend either way they were targets the only question was whether they made themselves moving targets or entrenched targets aubri and father always agreed on that its better to be a moving target than a stationary one all right i agree he conceded lets make up two packs and get out of here you might as well load me down it isnt going to make a great deal of difference since i cant fly anyway she nodded and wordlessly turned to rummage through the supplies cached in the tent in a few moments she handed him a pack to fill he joined her in picking through all the supplies they had salvaged it was obvious what they were going to leave behind just about everything they had saved they would have to abandon everything that wasnt absolutely essential their discards went everywhere now that there was no point in sheltering them if their foes did come to rummage through what they left behind the confusion of belongings might gain them a little more time clothing personal items those joined the rejected items it was easier to decide what to leave than what to take the piles of discards grew larger with very few items making it into the packs the medicine kit had to come along so did the weapons even though the pouches of lead shot were heavy so far there hadnt been anything around that blade could use in the sling instead of lead shot this was the wrong time of the year for fallen nuts the soil here wasnt particularly rocky and they couldnt count on a cairn of pebbles turning up at a convenient moment the only distanceweapon she could use onehanded was the sling so the shot had to come too the food had to come with them and some of the tools and just enough bedding and canvas to keep them warm and dry at night all of that cloth was bulky and heavy but if they got soaked they could easily die of coldshock even with a fire to keep them warm and dry them out then againif they got soaked in another long rainstorm and they were caught without shelter there would be no way to build a fire to warm them no the canvas halfshelter and a blanket apiece had to come along they were leaving a great deal for their opponents to look over and tad hoped that it would keep them very very busy and if only i knew something anything about them id be able to think of a way to keep them even busier part of their training included this sort of selection process and they had learned just what was truly essential to survive it didnt take long before they had two packs put together one large and one small blade would carry two spears and use them as walking sticks that way she would have both aid and weapon in one it had taken some ingenuity to rig her pack so that it would stay on with a minimum of painthere couldnt have been a worse injury than a broken collarbone when it came to carrying a pack much of the weight was going to fall on her hips now and would probably cause bruises and abrasions both tad and blade had come to accept that pain was going to be an omnipresent part of their immediate future and their concern regarding it was more a case of figuring out ways to lessen its immediate impact since eliminating it was impossible endure now heal later was the philosophy that would serve them best the morning fog was just beginning to lift when they took a bearing with the northneedle and headed into the west blade led in more open areas she was smallthey both had the feeling that if an attack came it would come from the rear he was better suited to bearing the brunt of an attack from the front than she and in open areas he could turn around quickly to help blade in close quarters he led with blade guarding his tail they were still vulnerable from the sides but it was better than a completely unguarded rear they had discussed boobytrapping the camp but decided against it if their foes were kept nicely busy with what remained that was good but if one of their number was hurt or killed by a boobytrap it might make them angry and send them hot on the trail after revenge also discovery of one trap might make whatever it was give up on a search of the camp entirely and go straight into tracking them which would lose them valuable distance as they left the area tad paused once for a look back at the camp wondering if they were making a dreadful mistake they were leaving so much behind so much that they might need desperately in the next few days but their pathetic little shelter looked even more vulnerable now and rationally he knew that it couldnt withstand a single determined blow much less a coordinated attack by several creatures at once in fact with its canvasoverwicker construction it could become a trap for both of them it wouldnt take much to drive the supporting saplings through the wickerwork a shiver ran along his spine at that thought for it was all too easy to picture something slamming the cup of wicker down on top of them trapping them inside where they would be helpless to defend themselves with a shudder he turned away and followed after blade as she picked her way through the tangled growth of the forest floor there was still fog in the treetops just high enough that there was no real way for them to tell precisely where the sun was in a little while the last of the fog would burn off completely and then they might be able to crosscheck their bearings with the angle of the sunalthough so far they hadnt been able to manage that yet well know where we are exactly but only if we can find a hole big enough to see the sun through and then it will only be possible if the sun is high enough to shine down through the hole at the time we find it living in this forest was like living inside an enormous thickaired cave how could anything that lived here know where it was it was very disorienting for tad not to be able to see the sky and somewhat claustrophobic he wondered if blade felt the same as he she seemed determined to concentrate on the forest ahead slipping carefully through the underbrush in such a way that she disturbed as little as possible the kind of leaf litter that served as the forest floor didnt hold tracks very well and if their enemies could just hold off following until the afternoon rains started it wouldnt hold a scent very well either if she found their surroundings claustrophobic she wasnt letting the feeling interfere with what she was doing but he kept swiveling his head in all directions every time they paused to pick a good route those frequent pauses as she pondered her route to the next bit of cover gave him ample opportunity to feel the forest closing in on him his nerves were afire with tension he couldnt imagine why she wouldnt feel the same but maybe she doesnt maybe this doesnt bother her maybe she doesnt even need to feel sky and wind he had always known that humans werent like gryphons and that thought made her seem positively alien for a moment but then again she lived in a veritable burrow back in white gryphon so maybe this landscape felt cozy to her rather than constricting but oh how he longed for enough room to spread his wings wide even if that longing reminded him pointedly that he couldnt spread them at the moment as blade eeled her way between two bushes that were barely far enough apart to let him through he realized something else that was very strange there werent any game trails here that realization was just as disconcerting to him as not being able to see the sky he knew there were some large animals that lived down here on the forest floor so why didnt they leave regular trails there should be deer trails going to and from water deer couldnt collect rainwater in vessels to drink obviously they had to have a water source he had never in all of his life encountered a deer herd that didnt make paths through their territory just by virtue of the fact that there were a lot of them going in the same direction was there something living down here that was so dangerous that it was suicidal to have a regular trail foolhardy to move in groups large enough to make one could that something be what had brought them down and what had been examining their ruined belongings thats altogether too logical and is not a comforting thought i know there are large cats like lions here and bears because the haighlei told us there wereyet i have never seen deer and wild pigs afraid to make game trails in lion or bear country if there is something else living here that makes creatures who regularly face lions afraid to leave a game trail the answer could be that whatever this putative creature was happened to be so fierce so bloodthirsty that it wasnt safe for herbivores to travel in herds that it was the kind of creature that slaughtered everything within its reach whether or not it was hungry he swallowed his throat feeling tight and dry but he might be overreacting again he didnt like this place perhaps his imagination was getting the better of him maybe we just are in a bad place in the forest maybe theres nothing here worth foraging for to bring deer and other browsers into this area there certainly doesnt seem to be anything tasty for a plant eater to feed on all these bushes are extraordinarily tough and weve seen precious little grass maybe thats why there arent any trails through here it simply isnt worth a deers time to come here and perhaps that was the reason for the unnatural silence all about them there might be an even better explanation for the silencethey were dreadfully obvious to anything watching and listening despite the fact that they were trying very hard to be quiet the inevitable sounds they were making were an unholy racket in contrast with the silence surrounding them try as they might as they passed from one spot of cover to the next they rattled vines and rustled bushes and none of those noises sounded natural and anything living up in the trees is going to have a fine view of us down below i doubt that blade looks harmless to whats up there and i know i dont i look like a very large if oddly shaped eagle tree dwellers might not recognize blade as a predator but they would certainly recognize tad there were eagles here they knew that for a fact for he had seen them flying below him hunting in and above the forest canopy anything that looked like an eagle was going make a canopy dweller nervous and yet there hadnt been a silence this wary and profound since they had felt as if they were being watched for that matter the tree dwellers hadnt been particularly quiet in any of the other places that they had camped before they had crashed this is exactly like the silence that falls when an eagleowl is hunting and everything stays absolutely quiet and motionless until the moment it makes a kill hoping that whatever it is hunting it will not find one of them there werent even the sounds made when other animals hunted but when a greater predator prowls the lesser remains silent and hidden are we the greater predators or is something else perhaps he should put his mind to thinking of ways to delay pursuit if whateveritis does come after us it wouldnt matter now if i laid boobytraps behind us would it how much worse could i make things if i hurt something that was following us well the answer to that could well bemuch worse why anger something that was following only out of curiosity perhaps not boobytraps then at least not yet perhaps just things to confuse the trail the first thing to confuse would be scent because that was of primary importance to a grounddwelling predator in an environment like this one there wasnt much of a lineofsight but scent would hold and cling until the next rain washed it away and by then a trail would more than likely be too cold to follow anyway he began watching for a vine with leaves veined with purple and red it had a pungent peppery smell hed noticed that they were fairly common and when he finally spotted one he hissed at blade to stop for a moment when they next moved on it was with the thick juice from those leaves rubbed all over their feet and handsand they were going to have to remember not to rub their eyes until they washed it off for it burned just like real pepper there were other plants less common that had equally distinctive odors and as he came across them he intended to gather generous samples every time the current scent was about to wear off hed change it if anything came hunting them depending on its nose hed have handed it a surprise and maybe one of these plants would have the effect of numbing a sensitive nose he had to hope this ploy would work for they were certainly proceeding at a crawl to begin with and their progress only slowed as the day progressed his pack was awkward heavy and made his bad wing and all his bruises ache he wasnt suited to walking in the first place and his injuries combined with the pack only made it worse fortunately for his own feelings blade wasnt doing any better so he wasnt in the position of knowing that he was the one impeding their progress the longer they walked the worse it got eventually the fog burned off and the temperature rose so that he was overheated as well as in pain blades shirt stuck to her dark with sweat he couldnt sweat so he panted neither sweating nor panting brought any relief in the humid air it must have been nearly as sultry as a kaledain steambath there wasnt a breath of breeze down here to stir the heavy air if he had been left to his own devices hed have called a halt and flung himself to the ground for a rest as he had predicted their progress was measured in furlongs not leagues with no discernible differences in the territory that they crossed he could only be certain that they were not walking in circles by virtue of the fact that blade kept checking the northneedle every time they stopped moving they stopped for a brief break and something to eat the sun actually penetrated the canopy in a few places eventually but it was not much help in showing them where they were there wasnt enough of it visible to help them get a bearing from it either by using a measuring stick or by taking the angle of it in fact the sunlight proved to be something of a new hazard the beams of sunlight lancing down through the dark green leaves were very pretty very picturesque but they were also to be avoided at all costs pinned even for a moment in such a bright light they would be extremely obvious as something that didnt belong there there were still no signs of any watercourses either which probably meant that this forest depended on rain rather than ground water for the trees to thrive that was not precisely a surprise given the daily thunderstorms but a creek or a small stream would have given them a path to a river and a way to break their trail completely if they were ever able to wade for some distance along the path of a creek bed they would completely lose anything that hunted by scent he had been hoping for a stream in fact for that very reason that and stream water would certainly be cooler than the water in my water skin the tepid liquid he was carrying had not been particularly refreshing although he had drunk his ration dutifully and it would taste better much better but there was no sign of any sort of a stream and eventually the beams of sunlight faded the light all about them dimmed and a distant rumble heralded the afternoon storm approaching at that point despite their lack of progress he was almost grateful to hear it now they would have to stop and rig a shelter for the night because it wouldnt be long before the rain started to fall and made it impossible to get anything constructed blade stopped held up her hand then motioned him up beside her weve got to stop and get our canvas up she said weariness in every syllable he felt instantly sorry for her she sounded even more tired than he was she pointed ahead to one of the few distinctive places hed seen in this forest there was a break in the cover through which the fat gray bellies of the clouds were clearly visible at some point in the past few years one of the forest giants had toppled here they edged forward to a place where the hollowedout carcass of an ancient snag stood halfcovered with vines the remains of the rest of the tree lying on the ground beside it smothered in vines and plants that snag is big enough to hold both of us well use that for the base of our shelter its the closest thing ive seen today to something that we can count on to protect us overnight and she doesnt mean from the rain he nodded abandoning any pretext at moving quietly they thrashed their way through the undergrowth to the giant snag it stood a little taller than blades head and as she had stated was just large enough to hold both of them in its hollow interior there was no room for a fire but in confines that close they would keep each other warm with the heat of their bodies and im not certain that i want afire to advertise our presence tonight they were going to need one initially though otherwise they were going to be sharing this shelter with a wide variety of multilegged guests rotten wood meant insects and some of them could be noxious or even poisonous they didnt have much time before the storm broke though perhaps not enough time for blade to use the firestriker to start a fire in the hollow but he was a mage and the easiest spell in the lexicon was to call fire dare i it could have been the mere presence of magic that got us attacked well if i dont she might not get a torch going before the rain comes and the firespell is so very small so limited in scope and durationid better chance it move back he ordered her as soon as she had obeyed he closed his eyes concentratedand called fire into the midst of the hollowedout trunk there was enough in the way of dry leaves and dry halfrotted woodchips on the floor of the snag to start an enthusiastic and very smoky fire the smoke had the immediate effect of driving out everything that could leap or fly blade bundled other burnables together into two torches and they lit both at the fire and proceeded to char the interior smoke rose all about them in a thick fog he coughed and backed out to get a breath of cleaner air more than once halfrotten wood did not give off the kind of pleasant smoke that made sitting beside a campfire a pleasure it was a pity they hadnt come upon this place earlier some of the grubs might have been very tasty especially cooked now their only concern was to rid the tree of all other inhabitants before the rains came he coughed again as a new and more acrid set of odors joined the heavy smoke we must have hit a nest of something nasty ugh or maybe we ve just incinerated a crop of unpleasant fungi he hoped that whatever they burned off didnt give off poisonous fumes a little late to worry about that now they didnt quite beat the downpour completely they were in the process of roofing the snag with their canvas and tying it down when the first cloudburst descended wetting them both to the skin at that point blade gave in to the inevitable and stood in the downpour until she and her clothing had been flushed clean and he let the rain wash all of the soot and dirt from his own feathers before shaking himself partially dry under the shelter of a nearby tree it was too bad that blades clothing didnt sluice clean so easily nor could she shake herself dry he made a dash to the snag and squeezed himself into the downed tree with the supplies she had already gotten out blankets and bread and dried meat he tucked the packs up in a way that she could sleep on them and put her blanket on top of the pile he had to put the dried meat out into the stream of water pouring off the canvas and soak it until he could eat it meanwhile blade emptied and refilled their water skins then joined him in their shelter their combined body heat did do something to warm the interior with blankets over each of them they werent completely miserable and blades clothing actually began to dry out and the strong smell of smoke wasnt too bad after a whilethough they must not have gotten all of the bugs out of their shelter since periodically he would feel a small one taking a tripunder his feathers or blade would slap at something once again the rain persisted until after nightfall though once it stopped it was againuncannily silent beneath the trees damn blade whispered i was hoping that wed left them behind tad was altogether glad of the thick wood at his back and of the deep shadow of the interior of their shelter not even an owl would be able to see them in here it might not be them thats making everything so quiet it might just be the smell of smoke you know how most wild things fear fire and i might be the haighlei emperor no theyre out there they followed us im sure of it she stared out into the darkness fiercely as if willing her eyes to be better than they actually were well they cant get us in here he said and meant it its safe enough for you to sleep if you want to take second watch this time you cant sleep she asked he shook his head it was true he wasnt going to be able to sleep for a while he was horribly tired but not sleepy his muscles kept twitching and jumping with accumulated fatigue his nerves all felt strung as tightly as a kaledain horsebow and every tiny sound out there had him peering into the darkness as fiercely as she it was going to be some time before he relaxed enough to fall asleep well i think ive reached the limit on my nerves she replied punctuating the sentence with a yawn believe it or not im going numb right now i hurt so much that all i want to do is drink my medicine and drop off as soon as the pain stops in fact right now they could come kill me as long as they did it while i was asleep i just cant get up the energy to care i know how you feel awkwardly he managed to pat her leg in sympathy you go ahead ill take the first watch as long as i can she sounded fatalistic he wasnt quite ready to share that emotion but there was something else to consider im not sure it would matter if we both fell asleep tonight so far we havent any evidence beyond the fact that something probably dangerous is probably following us they havent actually done anything even assuming that they intend to attack us as cautious as they have been i dont think theyre ready to try and pry us out of some place like this i think were as safe as we can be under the circumstances get some sleep while you can she didnt need a second invitation in an instant she had downed her vial of medicine and curled up against his side in her blanket propped up by the packs to save her shoulder provided she didnt get a kink in her neck from sleeping this way or stiff muscles from a chill she ought to be more comfortable tonight than she had been since the accident he stared out into the darkness until his eyes burnedand just as he was contemplating waking her to take her watch the forest itself woke but not with sounds of alarmto his intense relief these were normal night sounds the same they had heard every other night of this journey the whoop of something up above startled blade awake she came alive with a jerk and a thin gasp of pain what she demanded then relaxed as she recognized the noises outside their shelter for what they were the sudden onset of normal night sounds had been the trigger that let all of his own fatigue catch up with him suddenly he could not keep his eyes open no matter how hard he tried he was actually nodding off even as he stared into the dark can you take over he whispered and felt her nod that was all he needed a moment later not even the scream of a makaar would have awakened him for the second time that morning blade motioned to tad to freeze obedient to her hand gesture he went rigid and for something as huge as he was he blended into the forest surprisingly well his eyes were fixed on her not on the forest around him that was because she hadnt used the gesture that meant danger just the one that meant wait in fact there was no danger only an opportunity she had spotted another of the longlimbed tree dwellers climbing cautiously down out of the canopy in pursuit of something it had dropped this must be a young one the elders never were so foolish as to risk coming down into the danger zone just because they wanted something they had lost if she was lucky this one would not survive a lesson in why they did not although this hunting was delaying them it was a necessary delay her quarry dropped down off the tree trunk and took two cautious steps on the forest floor reaching for the bright object it had lost it had four long limbs a pointed snout and large eyes set on the sides of its head if it had been up in the canopy she would never have been able to spot it for its brown fur blended in beautifully with the bark of the tree not that she could have reached it with her puny weapon either nothing short of a very powerful bow would put a missile up into the canopy with force great enough to kill she whirled her sling twice and let fly the beast barely had time to register the movement and start to turn his head then the lead shot struck it squarely on the skull with a wet crack and it dropped to the ground instantly dead grinning with elation she ran forward anyway just to make certain of it with her knife fresh meat was too precious a commodity for her to take any chances that it might simply be stunned when she finished she stood up and motioned tad to come up and join her she straightened and walked over to see what it had dropped the brightly colored object that had exerted a fatal attraction for this tree dweller proved to be absolutely unidentifiable it was bladderlike and a bright blue and red it could have been a flower a seed pod a fruit even an insect carapace or a portion of some other unfortunate animal she ignored it at that point perhaps it was edible but this was not the time nor the place to experiment tad meanwhile had made short work of her prey it hadnt been very large and he had dismembered it and eaten it almost whole this was the second such catch shed made this morning for him and he looked much the better for the fresh meat the first had been a rodent both rabbitlike and ratlike bigger than a rat but small for a rabbit this one was about the size of a large rabbit though the long limbs had made it look bigger if her luck kept up shed be able to keep him in freshkilled prey mouthful by mouthful that would take one worry away from her how to keep him from starving gryphons werent big eaters just by choice although the forest sounds had by no means returned to normal there were more signs of other living things now which made her feel a bit better maybe they were outdistancing their invisible trackers or maybe those trackers were just waiting until nightfall to move in on them at least this meant that she could actually see some game to take down i can probably get enough small animals and birds over the course of the day to keep tad in good shape she decided retrieving the bit of lead shot and pocketing it before checking her northneedle tad had cautiously taken the downed creature into the shelter of a bush to eat it she pressed herself against the bole of the tree and picked the next landmark they would head for that was how she was navigating in lineofsight increments checking her northneedle picking a particular bit of distant cover that was farther west and moving in toward it not only were theyhopefullyavoiding being spotted by their foe they were not frightening the game she made two more such moves when she spotted another one of the ratrabbits nosing about on the forest floor in search of something edible she warned tad to freeze and potted it too that made three pieces of small game in about three marks or one piece per mark and she was beginning to feel very proud of herself that was not at all bad for someone hampered by a bad shoulder with a primitive weapon in unfamiliar territory if i remember my gryphonrations correctly he should actually prosper on that amount of food granted its like feeding a hawk by tidbitting it but beggars cant be choosers if he isnt exactly full at any one time he isnt going hungry either he looked faintly annoyed at being asked to swallow another bit of game every mark or so but he didnt say anything he was used to eating once lightly and once hugely then sleeping on that larger meal he probably wondered why they were stopping so frequently just so he could eat but if she carried the game until they had enough for him to have that single large meal shed be weighing herself down for no good purpose let the game ride in the most efficient way possible inside tad if he hasnt figured out what im doing he will soon she decided moving on ahead she was worried about him in spite of the fact that she was the one with the worse injuryas her shoulder reminded her sharply of just how badly hurt she was every time she moved a bit too quicklyin some ways he was the more vulnerable of the two of them she knew only too well just how vulnerable he was trapped on the ground as he was he had as many weaknesses as she did unless he could get his back up against something to protect it he could not only be attacked from the rear but from below most of what he had learned about fighting was meant for aerial combat not ground fighting granted he could improvise and granted he had four sets of very nasty knives on the end of each limb not to mention the weapon in the middle of his face but he was made for another element faced with the need to fight on terms and terrain he was not suited to he was vulnerable in ways even he probably didnt realize his other weakness was the sheer volume of food he had to consume in order to stay in decent physical shape if she couldnt get that into himwell too many days of rainsoaked dried meat and he wouldnt be in good condition at all too many days of that kind of ration and weii have to find a permanent place to hole up because he wont even be able to travel walking was much harder on him than flying he wasnt built for it intellectually of course she had known that watching him try to move through the underbrush had driven it home to her in a more concrete form he was not clumsy he was a great deal more graceful at this sort of travel than his classmates had ever been he was in fact as adept at it as some humansbut he tired easily and occasionally his wings got caught up on some obstacle or other it would be some time before his legs strengthened and gained the endurance for steady walking and until then he was handicapped if they ever ran across a large browser like a deer he should be able to bring it down so long as they surprised it but until then she was the better ground hunter he was going to be depending on her for something he was normally selfsufficient at she was just grateful that he was as good a tracker as he was hed done a fair amount to confuse their scent and backtrail and that could only help right now that might be one of the reasons im spotting game today that muck he had us rub all over ourselves is probably hiding our scent and confusing the tree dwellers scent rose especially in this heat a wary canopy beast would not come anywhere near the ground with the scent of a large predator coming up to meet his nose but at the moment all that they smelled like was crushed plants and that might very well be the explanation of why they had been surrounded by silence until lately quite frankly tad was damp and he smelled likewelldamp raptor a combination of wet feathers and the heavy musk that was peculiar to gryphons and birds of prey he hadnt been able to dry out properly since the accident and that made his scent more obvious could be that when we first camped not only was he not as fragrant but we simply werent on the ground long enough for the scent to rise into the canopy now we are that speculation made her feel a little better and the current state of affairs did seem to offer support for that speculation tad didnt smell like raptor wet or dry at the moment the juicy plant he had her rub all over both of them imparted a peculiar sharp mossy scent to their respective hides it made a hideous mess of her clothing streaking it a mottled green but she wasnt particularly worried about stains besides the stains make a fairly good impromptu camouflage she ought to start looking for a good place to go to ground for the night as she kept an eye out she tried to mentally reckon up the time it would take for them to be missed they ought to start putting up some sort of signal if there was any chance that the white gryphon people might be looking for it we should have made our rendezvous today or tomorrow so by tomorrow or the day after the silvers were relieving will know theres something wrong they have a teleson they ii let judeth know but it would take a team of rescuers coming at full speed another two or three days to reach here so what does that make it another two or three days before help will have a chance of being here at best more likely a week so therewas no point in looking for a shelter and a place where they could set up a good signal fire shelter alone would do for today and tomorrow nothing presented itself for another markexcept the first signs she had seen yet of large animals on the forest floor she came across a place where a pig had clearly been rooting at the base of a tree searching for underground fungi and with regret she saw that the trail went off into the north and not the west a pig would have been very welcome to both her and tad but she was not going to risk going off in a different direction on just the chance that they might be able to bring one down the heat was oppressive when the rains came again she had every intention of soaking herself and her clothing if she didnt by tomorrow morning her tunic and trews would be able to stand by themselves they were so saturated with sweat she was grateful to tad for his subterfuge with the plant scent for more reasons than the obvious without the pungent aroma of crushed leaf hanging around her she would be smelling herself by now on the other hand maybe if i smelled bad enough our trackers would be offended and leave us alone hah sweat trickled steadily down the back of her neck and her hair itched unbearably for that matter so did her feet shins armpits any number of tiny forest insects were finding her tasty fare and she was covered with itching red welts something she had forgotten was that their original tent not only set itself up and took itself down the spells on it protected them from insects without that protection she seemed to be the only source of food for every bloodsucker for furlongs about except for the ones buzzing about poor tads eyes and ears her bruisemedicine eased the itching enough for her to sleep but she would have given a great deal to discover a plant that rendered her inedible to bugs every time she paused she found herself reaching inside her clothing to scratch at another itch she kept reminding her herself to rub not scratch if she broke the skin she opened herself up to infectionif she bled she added a particularly tasty scent to her own and one the plant juice would not cover something near her ear buzzed landed and bit she slapped and swore as tad crept into cover beside her we may not need stalking beasts to finish us off the insects may nibble us to death ants tad muttered in her ear is that what just got me she asked without turning her head no that had wings and a long nose i am reminding myself to lie on an anthill if we can find some of the small brown ones it will be irritating but they will rid me of any passengers i may be carrying their secretions when the ants are angered drive away mites and other small pests she felt a twinge of raw envy if only it could be that easy for her but lying on an anthill would do her no good since most of the bugs that plagued her were winged and the subsequent ant bites would be just as irritating as her current crop of bites and stings she couldnt wait for the afternoon rain sweat made the bites itch worse and standing in the pouring cold water gave her the few moments of complete relief she got from the incessant itching time to move maybe well find a stream today and i can go to sleep lying in it then again given our current luck if we found a stream it would be infested with leeches never mind the one thing they had to do was keep moving and cope with whatever came up it couldnt be more than a week until help came all they had to do was to survive that long six ah hells this isnt easy onehanded a bit offbalance because of her injured shoulder blade threw her final bundle of branches over the canvas of tonights shelter just as the first rumbles of thunder began in the distance ah damn that hurt blade doubled over despite herself her chest felt constricted as if cinched tight with rope thunder rumbled again nearer shed finished just in time though not too soon so far as she was concerned she was ready for the rain more than ready by now as she straightened up she had no doubts that she was ready for rest as well this shelter was both superior and inferior to the last one like last nights it was also based on the remains of a fallen tree but this tree had fallen quite recently the splintered wood of the trunk shone fresh and pale against the greenery which was how she had spotted it in the first place although there were no hollow places in the trunk or snag to shelter in the tree had taken down another right next to it in its fall and there was an intersection of the two trunks providing a triangular area with two manhigh walls of wood stretching the canvas over the top of this place made a roof piling branches on top of the canvas disguised their presence a further barricade of brush hid the entrance and they would even have the luxury of a small fire tonight screened from view by the brush more branchlets over a pile of big leaves made a springy floor giving them more comfort tonight than they had enjoyed since the accident now if only she could find something in her medicines to numb these damned insect bites thunder rumbled again overhead this time in the course of gathering their branches she had stirred up many tiny animals mice lizards snakes and frogs she had caught and killed as many of those as she could and tonight she and tad would supplement their dinner with these tidbits individually they werent impressive but she had collected an entire sack of them enough to give tad muchneeded supplements shed probably appropriate a couple of snakes to roast and give some flavor to her flavorless bread but the rest would go to tad she would be adding insects to her ration for she had found grubs of a woodborer that she recognized ant pupae and crickets all of which she could choke down so long as they were toasted when she had been going through survival training she had never really pictured herself putting any of her training into practice well i have this much revenge if the bugs are eating me im eating the bugs insects were really too small to do tad any good so by default they went to her tad was inside the shelter arranging things and getting the fire going and she thanked the stareyed that he had enough magic to light fires again with the help of magic even the greenest wettest wood could be coaxed to burn without ittheyd have a poor fire or none and she could not bear the thought of eating untoasted bugs id rather go hungry a bit i might get hungry enough to consider it but not now their shelter lay underneath a long slit of sky cleared by the falling tree it had shown gray when they first arrived here gray with those fat roundbellied clouds and had been growing steadily darker ever since as the inevitable afternoon storm gathered strength was it her imagination or were those storms coming earlier every afternoon she remained standing where she was watching the clouds overhead while the dark gray went bright white periodically and thunder followed the lightning as the sky darkened steadily the ambient light dimmed stealing the color from the leaves softening the edges of the shadows and painting the clearing in shades of indigo blue white light suddenly flooded the entire area not just the clouds lightning lanced across the raw sky and thunder cracked right overhead making her jump and yelp involuntarilyand jolting her shoulder again which made her swear she forced herself to hold still to wait for the pain to ebb iought to be used to this by now but she wasnt every time she jerked her shoulder the pain lanced down her arm and up her neck it wasnt getting any better she could only hope that she was just being impatient and that this didnt mean that it wasnt healing two breaths after the lightning came the rain as always it poured down in a torrent she held out her good arm and tilted her head up letting the sweet cool water wash away all the sweat and grime she had accumulated opening her mouth and drinking the fresh clean liquid it actually eased her thirst and did not taste of warm leather as sweat washed away and her skin cooled down her insect bites stopped itching with walls of trunk on either side of her she felt secure enough to stand out in the open and indulge herself the only thing that would have improved the situation would have been a bar of soap but even with nothing but water she was getting reasonably clean and that always made her temper improve she stood out in the downpour until the dark green stains on her tunic faded to match the others already there until she was as chilled as she had been overheated the moment before until the swollen welts of her insect bites stood out against her cold pallid arms and the bites themselves no longer bothered her at all there was something very exhilarating and elemental about standing out in a storm like this one powerful storms back home had always been too cold and dangerous to play in something that had disappointed her ever since she was a child but herethere wasnt much chance that she would be struck by lightning when everything else around her was so very much taller than she and to be able to stand out in rain so heavy that it literally stole the breath was an intoxicating experience it was enough to make her forget her pain almost enough to make her forget their danger is this what tad feels when he flies if so i envy him is this the way it feels to not face people not be in a building or cave and be encompassed by the elements to stand alone and alive as a living creature only and not as someones offspring is this the moment that makes all the pettiness of everyday living worthwhile only when she was so chilled she had begun to shiver did she duck her head and scuttle back to the heap of branches that covered their shelter she pushed past the brush and almost went back out into the rain when she encountered a thick cloud of eyewatering smoke whatwhat is this she demanded as coughing she fanned her hand in front of her face and dropped to the ground where the air was marginally clearer sorry tad said apologetically im trying to get rid of the bugs both in here and on me its working i certainly got rid of my little plague you almost got rid of me she grumbled crawling all the way inside to settle beside him more thunder punctuated her statement i suppose itll be worth it if this smokeweapon of yours allows us to get a good nights sleep then she laughed but if id known that this was how you were going to interpret my wish for an herb to repel insects i might have been more careful in what i asked for he gryphgrinned at her his beak gaping wide you didnt remember drakes favorite proverb be careful what you ask for i know i know she groaned tad had been snacking and the bag was almost empty but he had saved her two of the biggest snakesthough they werent very big being no longer than her forearm one was brown one was green and both looked vaguely orange in the uncertain light tad carefully scraped some hot coals to one side with a stick then added drier wood to the rest of the fire she skinned out the snakes with tads help then arranged her snakes along with her harvest of crickets grubs and pupae on the blade of their shovel and placed that on top of the glowing coals there wasnt much aroma but her bugs did toast quickly and she was very hungry by now she picked them gingerly off the hot metal and ate them trying not to think too hard about what she was doing they werent too bad though she could almost imagine that she was eating toasted grain if she didnt pay too close attention to the shapes the snake was better and made it possible to finish her rationbread tad meanwhile had placed his dried meat out in the rain to soak he wolfed it down with no expression of pleasure when it was soft enough to eat do you take first watch or shall i he asked she put a pan of water on the fire to steep her bruiseremedy in then made up her potion with the addition of a couple of recognizable foraged herbs known to numb sore throats if they soothed a sore throat perhaps they would make her bites stop bothering her id appreciate it if you would she replied im hoping this stuff will let me fall asleep without clawing my skin off but its bound to wear off before daybreak if im going to be itching i might as well be awake so i can control myself he nodded the smoke worked as well as an ant hill and my passengers are no longer with me to bother either of us at the moment im feeling fairly lively you might as well get to sleep while you still can by now her clothing and her hair were both dry though only her gryphonbadge was as pristine as it had been when they set out besides being stained her tunic and trews were torn in several places and the hems were beginning to fray ilook like a tramp she thought ruefully ihope ikala is not with a search party oh thats ridiculous he would hardly expect me to look like a court lady and i would be so happy to see a rescuer that the last thing i would be thinking of would be my clothing tad helped her wrap her herbsteeped bandages around the worst of her bruises and to dab the remainder of the mixture on her insect bites as best as his large taloned hands would allow at first she thought she was going to be disappointed again in her attempt to heal her bites but as the mixture dried she noticed that her itching had ebbed at least temporarily the tenderness of her flesh was perhaps in some way eased by the tenderness of the gryphons care of her as well tad looked at her disheveled feathers slightly spiked from the moisture with inquiry in his expression she sighed with relief its working she said ill have to make more of this up and keep it with me in one of the waterskins if i keep putting it on i might find it easier to freeze in place without being driven mad tad chuckled good now we just need to find something that will keep the bugs off us in the first placewithout driving us crazy with the smell with her mind off her itching she turned a critical eye on tad and without warning him what she was about to do reached over to feel his keelbone the prominent breastbone that both gryphon and bird anatomy shared that was the first place that a bird showed health or illness as musclemass was consumed by a gryphon or bird that was not eating enough it was a bit sharper the muscles on either side of it just a little shrunken not something an ordinary person would notice but tad was her partner and it was her job to do as much for him as she could youve lost some weight she said thoughtfully not a lot but it has to be either the short rations or the fact that youre using up energy in healing or both or that im building legmuscle and losing wingmuscle because im not using it he pointed out i dont remember walking this much before in my life much more of this and im going to look more like a plowhorse than a hawk she granted him a skeptical look and crossed her legs and rested her chin on her good hand i wish wed find the river she replied fretfully no matter what is following us if we just had the river we could fish id get some decent food into you even if theres something following us and scaring off the game i doubt that fish would be frightened off by a land predator the river the promise of the river it now seemed to embody the promise of everythingfood shelter and rescue as well perhaps she was placing too much hope on a strip of water but at the moment it was a good goal to concentrate on he heaved a huge sigh and scratched at one bugbitten ear i really have no idea where we are in relation to the cliff and the river he confessed and this kind of forest is very strange to me if this place were more like home i could probably find a river but i cant see the sky and the ground cover is ten or twelve layers thick here i know and im not blaming you she assured him hastily how could you know anything about this kind of forest we never trained here we expected wed be going to an established outpost with shelter a garden food stores and weapons emphasis on the food stores tad said hoarsely as if the momentary thought of all the food he was used to eating made him homesick he rubbed at his throat a moment and then swallowed hed been gulping more air for days than was healthy for him she frowned with frustration im sure there are plenty of things to eat growing all around us if only i knew what they were roots stalks leaveseven some things you might be able to eat too she waved her hand helplessly we havent the luxury of experimenting since we dont dare make ourselves sick so were stuck only a native would know how to find his way around a place like this a native like ikala tad replied shrewdly and chuckled when she blushed involuntarily well i wish he was with us i do too she began intending to change the subject quickly and probably for more reasons than one he teased not giving her a chance to change the subject and sounding more like his old self than he had in days i cant blame you hes a handsome fellow and he certainly accounted well for himself in training it wouldnt be a bad thing to get to know him better i suppose she said suddenly wary there was nothing that tad liked better than to meddle in other peoples love lives if wed had a chance to ask him more about forests like these we might be faring better now he saw what she was trying to do oh come on blade he coaxed stop being coy with me am i your partner or not shouldnt your partner know who youre attracted to he gave her a sly sideways look i know hes attracted to you its obvious if youre watching and you were watching i suppose she grumbled giving up on her attempt to distract him to something more serious he laughed im supposed to watch out for you arent i youd be happier with a male friend to share some hmmpleasant moments with and i know it would be easier dealing with you if you were happier he tilted his head comically to the side oh thank you she said sarcastically now you sound like both my parents they cant wait to get meattached into bed with someone you mean she thought sourly and tad knows it he should know better than to echo them he knows how i feel about that theyre obsessed with it and have built much of their lives around pleasures of flesh they think of it as a means to all happiness even if it is by a strange obscure path seeing you bedded with someone is not my goal i simply want to see you content in all areas of your life tad said persuasively hes certainly a fine prospect goodlooking intelligent and openminded enough that you wouldnt get all tangled up in haighlei custom with him good sense of humor too and thats important and being trained as a prince he knows that you have to be able to concentrate on your duty you cant just devote yourself slavishly to a man hmm blade fixed her partner with a stern and fierce gaze neither agreeing nor denying any of it youre matchmaking she accused dont try to deny it ive seen you matchmake before youre as bad as an old woman about it you want to see everyone paired off and livingwell if not happily ever after at least having a good time while the affair lasts of course tad replied smugly and why not she growled at him becausebecause its invasive thats why not i repeati get enough of that kind of nonsense from my parents why should i put up with it from you he only snorted im your partner i have to know these things and i have to try to help you get what you want and need whether or not you know what it is id tell you and id expect you to help me we both have to know if theres something that is going to have us emotionally offbalance because thats going to affect how we do our job right admit it she growled again but nodded with extreme reluctance he was right of course a silvers partnership was as close as many marriages and partners were supposed to confide in each other cooperate with each other in and out of the duty times and for some reason what seemed so invasive from her parents didnt seem so bad coming from tad perhaps it was because tad was a gryphon and not human despite the gryphons abilities to see things like a human did tad would always be one step removed from complete empathy with blade and that gave her a barrier of safety so tell your partner how you feel about it he settled his head down on his foreclaws what do you think of ikala then rain drummed down outside their shelter and pattered through the branches they had piled on the roof lightning made patterns of the branches screening the front of the shelter reflecting whitely off tads eyes and the silver gryphonbadge on her tunic as usual rain and thunder were the only sounds that could be heard outside insidethe smoke had finally cleared away and the fire burned brightly she was dry full and warm her shoulder didnt hurt too much and she was in a wellcamouflaged shelter with two very solid walls on either side of her and a cushioning of springy boughs between her and the cold damp ground in short there was nothing to distract her from her thoughts which were confused to say the least i suppose i dont really know she said slowly as tads dark eyes watched her with that intensity that only a raptor could display he is very handsome hes very charming hes quite intelligent but i just dont know part of the time i think i like him for himself part of the time i think im attracted to him just because hes so exotic and part of the time i think its because hes the only person in white gryphon that my father doesnt know everything about tad chuckled heartlessly there is that ive noticed that ikala has never once had the occasion to patronize a kestra chern amberdrake should find him more of an enigma than you do that would certainly be an improvement she said acidly it would be very nice for once to have a conversation with someone without the person wondering if father was going to tell me all the things hed really rather i didnt know and it would be very nice for you tad commented to talk to your father without wondering if he was going to tell you things youd rather not know blade nodded and tad shrewdly added i dont go to kestrachern so you are doubly safe talking to me about how you feel word will not reach your father may i give up all my hedonism if i lie blade smiled despite herself depend upon a gryphon male to count that as the ultimate oath hes under control she added hes a very controlled person i like that ilike it a great deal more than unbridled passion truth to tell tad coughed still he prompted helpfully some might say that argues for a certain coldness of spirit she snorted you know better than that youve worked with him he loses his temper about as often as anyone else he just doesnt let it get away from him andso far as not visiting a kestrachern and tads eyes sparkled with humor she blushed again and he hasnt exactly been wellchaste hes had female friends while hes been here they just werent kestrachern even if they were casual recreational and i could almost envy karelee i wish she hadnt been so enthusiastic about his bed abilities oh tad said archly he hasnt been chaste i suppose you were interested enough to find out about this she coughed and tried to adopt a casual tone well one does you know people talk i didnt have to be interested people gossip about that sort of thing all the time i only had to be nearby and listen she favored him with a raised eyebrow grateful to feel her hot face cooling winds know that you do enough talking so you ought to know me gossip his beak parted in silent laughter and he squinted his eyes i prefer to call it the gathering of interpersonal information for management of sources and receivers of pleasure well i call it gossip and youre as bad as any old woman she retorted you are just as bad when it comes to matchmaking and as for ikalahe is attractive and i dont deny it but i think youre getting way ahead of yourself to tie the two of us together in any way i dont even know how i feel so how could i even speculate about how he feels and anyway you and i have our missions to run and when we get out of here we have a long tour of duty at a remote outpost to take care of if we dont die of embarrassment at having to be rescued if we are rescued if we do get out of here the unspoken thought put a chill in the air of the tent that the fire could not drive away all frivolous thoughts faded this was the change in subject she had tried to make but not the new subject she would have preferred reflexively she glanced out through the screening branches it was getting darker out there and it looked as ifonce againthe rain was going to continue past nightfall that might not be so bad if it keeps our unseen friends away well she said as lightly as possible which was not very now youve got my brain going and im never going to be able to get to sleep ill just lie awake thinking he yawned hugely and i am warm and sleepy i always get worn out listening to peoples reasons why they wont be happy shall we switch watches he didnt wait for her to answer settling his head back down on his foreclaws she shrugged we might as well she replied and edged over until she was in a position where she could see through a gap between two of the branches hiding the front of their shelter she memorized the positions of everything in sight while the light was still good enough to identify what was visible through the curtain of rain the flashes of lightning helped if she concentrated on a single spot she could wait until the next lightning bolt hit to give her a quick brightlylit glimpse of what was there and study the afterimage burned into her eyes tad hadnt been lying about his fatigue within a few moments she heard his breathing deepen and slow and when she turned to look behind her she saw that his eyes were closed she turned back to her vigil trying to mentally review what she had done when she constructed the shelter she had tried not to take too many branches away from any one place she had tried to pile the ones she brought to the shelter in such a way that they looked as if they were all from a single smaller tree brought down by the larger with all this rain every trace of our being here should have been washed away no scent no debris smoke thoughthe smoke tad had used to drive out insects had been very dense and odoriferous and she wondered if the rain had washed all of it out of the air if nothow common would smoke be in a forest that experienced thunderstorms every day common enough she would think surely lightning started small fires all the time and surely they burned long enough to put a fair amount of smoke into the air before the rain extinguished them well there wasnt anything she could do about the smokeor the shelter itselfnow if there was anything looking for them she could only hope that she had done everything she needed to in order to cover their presence last night it would have been difficult for their possible followers to find them she hoped tonight it would be impossible the rain turned from a torrent to a shower and slowed from a shower to a mere patter then it wasnt rain at all but simply the melodic drip of water from the canopy above and the sounds of the night resumed she breathed a sigh of relief and checked the fire no point in letting it burn too high now the inside of the shelter was at a good temperature and with two walls being the trunks of trees it should sustain that level without too much work she rebuilt the fire listening to the hoots and calls from above tenting the flames with sticks of green fuel and banking the coals to help conceal the glow this should let the fire burn through the night without needing too much more fuel or tending it would burn slowly now producing a bed of deep red smokeless coals instead of flame that was precisely the way she wanted it with the level of light in the shelter down to the point where tad was nothing more than a large dark shape she turned her attention back to the outside nothing had changed the creatures of the canopy continued to go about their business with the accompanying noise and now the luminescent insects she had noted before began to flit about the foliage she allowed herself to relax a little further it just might be that whatever had been following them had decided to leave them alone but dont count on it she cautioned herself assume the worst assume that theyre still something moved out in the darkness just a shape a shifting of shadow but she knew that there should not have been a shadow in that place much less a moving one instantly she was on the alert whatever it was it was big bigger than the tame lion shed seen in shalamans menagerie she knew to within a thumbs breadth just how wide a distance lay between each bush how tall a young tree was the head of the shadow would rise a little above hers she thought though she had the impression of a very long slender neck the chest briefly obscured one bush while its hindquarters still lay behind another altogether that would make it about the size of a horse perhaps a little smaller she couldnt quite tell how bulky it was but the fluid way in which it moved and the fact that it melted in with the other shadows so well suggested that it had a slender build her view was a narrow one limited to the wedge of forest between the two long walls of logyet in a moment as she concentrated further she knew that there was more than one of those creatures out there one shadow flitted as another froze further flickering in the distance suggested that either they were incredibly fast or there might be a third two at least for certain but they dont seem to know were here the first of the shadows darted suddenly out of sight a heartbeat later and a bloodcurdling scream rang out into the night blades heart leaped into her throat and she felt as if she had been plunged into ice water tad only wheezed in his sleep it took all of her control to remain frozen in place she had an impression that those shadows possessed extremely sharp senses and that if she moved even obscured by branches as she was they might spot the movement or hear it silence descended as blade tried to get her heartbeat started again it was a good thing that she had heard the death scream of a rabbit before or she would have thought that one of those somethings had just killed a child now as if the canopy dwellers had only just noticed the shadows presence the silence extended up into the treetops only the insects and frogs remained unaffected chirping and trilling as calmly as they had a moment before she blinkedand in the time it took her to do so the shadows vanished at least from her view she did not breathe easier however from the silence she knew that they were still out there and she had no intention of letting them know her location ican only hope that they havent had the bright idea to come take a walk on top of the sheltering logs the very idea made her want to shiver the back of her neck crawled as she imagined one of those creatures sniffing around the brush piled above her head there was nothing between her and these hunters stronger than a layer of canvas and a pile of flimsy branches and leaves surely if one of the hunters got close no amount of brush and herb juice would obscure their scent surely the scent of the fire alone would tell the creature that they were here but im assuming that the thing is intelligent that it would associate a fire with us im assuming that its hunting usit could simply be here we could have wandered into its territory we havent seen any large predators nor any sign of them this could simply be the local equivalent of a lion and yet something about the way it had moved had suggested intelligence and purpose that could be her imagination but it might be the truth it was wary it moved carefully but when it did move it was quick and certain that was an indication of something that either had incredible reflexes or something that decided very precisely what it was going to do before it acted in any case there was no reason to take any chances and every reason to be painfully cautious no matter what else these creatures were hunters predators the behavior of the canopy dwellers showed that and demonstrated that the animals that lived in the treetops recognized these beasts and feared them even if those things are just the local equivalent of a lion theyre still big theyre still carnivorous and theyre hunting theres no reason to put myself on their menu a new thought occurred to her what if they were not dealing with one enemy but two one that had brought them down and a second that was hunting them in that case there were two possibilities the shadows were either wild hunters that had nothing to do with what brought them downor they were allied with it in the second case the shadow shapes out there could be the equivalent of a pack of hunting hounds trailing them for some unknown master it was not something that was unheard of that was the problem urtho wasnt the only mage that created living things maar did and so did others who never participated in the wars the ability to create a new species was a mark of prestige or a symbol of ability above and beyond the status of being an adept among the higher mages there were a handful that had created new creatures for centuries before the war with maar that gave her yet another possible scenario a mage who hunted other intelligent creatures and had chosen them for his next prey their chasers were his dog pack maar had been one such and shed heard tales of others both from her own people and from the haighlei that in fact was one of the reasons why the haighlei restricted magic use to the priests they had a tale of a sadistic powerful mage who captured men and brought them to his estate to hunt them like beasts a brave young priest had suspected what was happening and allowed himself to be taken thus giving his fellows an agent within the spellprotected walls through which they could channel their own power to destroy the mage that was how the story went anyway she grew cold all over again and restrained herself from running her hand through her hair nervously her imagination went wild again taking off all on its own she had never had any difficulty coming up with scenarios for trouble sosuppose that one of the neutral mages came down here to hide before the cataclysm even if he wasnt urthos equal he could have guardbeasts and birds to warn him when anything was in the area the haighlei never travel through the wilderness in groups of less than ten and that includes a priest but all hed have to do would be to stay quiet while they passed by unless they actually stumbled over him they wouldn t find him then he could hunt individuals at his leisure there was just one problem with that hypothesis no one had ever been reported missing from here unless a haighlei was so antisocial as to sever all familial and clan ties and go off wandering the wilderness someone would have raised a fuss by now if anyone had vanished wouldnt they woodcutters explorers trappers huntersthey all told friends neighbors and fellow workers where they were going what route they intended to take and when they should be back they did so especially if they were going off into poorlyexplored lands if something happened they would want others to mount a rescue as soon as possible perhaps there had been a few haighlei hermits who had wandered in here only to vanishbut not enough to provide sport for a maniacal manhunting mage well all right thenwhat if he came here to escape all the conflict what if he wants to be left alone and he brought us down to keep us from revealing his presence but that didnt make any more sense than the first hypothesis there had been others through here they had all flown overhead on the same route why hadnt they been brought down because we were the only gryphonhuman pair but there had been aubri and judeth oh winds i should be a storyteller she gave it up as a bad notion it was getting too complicated and usually the more complicated a hypothesis was the more likely it was that it was incorrect stick to the two possibilities that work best simple answers work best and are more likely first we hit some kind of accidentalthingthat brought us down and now were having to guard ourselves from the local predators which are following us because we re hurt and look like easy prey second something down here brought us down for reasons of its own and now is hunting us and the first is more likely than the second that didnt mean they were in any less danger wolves and lions had been known to trail wounded prey for days waiting for it to die and if her guess about the size of the shadowcreatures was right they were a match for tad which would make them formidable opponents indeed if the shadows knew that she and tad were hurt that might well put them in the category of wounded prey a bird called another answered and as if that tentative call had been meant to test the safety of the area or to tell other creatures that the menace had gone for the moment the canopy above began to come to life again she sighed and let her shoulders relax she cast a wry glance at her slumbering companion somehow tad had managed to sleep through it all tad yawned and stretched as best he could blinking in what passed for light in their shelter when blade woke him for his watch she had looked tired but that was to be expected she also looked nervous but how could she not be he would be nervous on his watch too nervous sentries remained living sentries relaxed ones had short epitaphs i saw something out there that might account for the way everything goes silent every so often she offered it was pretty big and i think there were two or more of them i didnt see anything more than a shadow though one of them caught a rabbit and every bird and beast in the canopy shut up and stayed that way for a long time well that accounts for the nerves and for the fact that she looks tired nerves wear you out and she didnt have much of a reserve when she began her watch huh he glanced out into the darkness but didnt see anythingand some of the local creatures were acting as if they were in the middle of a singing competition well if silence means that theres something out there we should be worried about id say you can sleep in peace until dawn im surprised i slept through it i must have been more tired than i thoughtor my medicine is stronger than i supposed she managed a ghost of a chuckle it got my hackles up i can tell you that much its quick very quick and i didnt hear a rustle of leaves or a single broken twig id say the one i saw was about the size of a horse which would make it a formidable predator in a fight it might have been my imagination but i thought that it acted fairly intelligent so do the big cats hunting he reminded her everything acts intelligent in its own realm drink your painkillers get some sleep well see whats out there in the morning i set some snares before the rain she chuckled again dont count on there being anything left i think you were robbed that may have been where our shadows found their rabbit he sighed probably but it was worth doing and well know how intelligent they are by how the snares were robbed if it was just snatchandeat then they wont be any more intelligent than the average lion good point she settled herself down at the back of the shelter he was certain she was going to get a good rest for the rest of the night so long as things stayed noisy up in the canopy the mattress of boughs and leaves hed made was very comfortable and she should be able to lie cradled in a way that permitted her to sleep soundly rather than fitfully with her shoulder supported so that pressure was off her collarbone she should be in less pain he had not wanted to mention it before this but he had already seen signs on their backtrail that something was following them it could have been anything and he hadnt seen any signs that their follower was particularly intelligentjust alert and incredibly wary the trouble with telling her now was that there was nothing to prove whether or not the shadowy creature that was following them was something they had just picked up today or if it had been following them all along and only now was feeling bold enough to move in where he might catch a glimpse of it it could certainly match the description that blade had given him of the creature she saw tonight that basically was all that he knew as a fact this of course had nothing to do with what his own imagination could conjure up in his imagination the sighting confirmed the fear that hed had all along that they were being followed for some specific purpose the only question in his mind now was if the purpose was a simple onekill and eat the preyor something more complicated than that if it was simple then these creatures were simple predators and relatively easy to deal with if however there was a larger purpose in their mindsif his imagination was right and in fact these creatures had something to do with their accidentthen he and blade were in very deep trouble such extreme caution combined with curiosity as these shadows had exhibited was very unlike most predators he was familiar with in general large predators tended to shy completely away from anything that was not familiar at the most watching it from a distance only if the unfamiliar object continued to remain in a predators territory would it gradually move in closer to investigate it predators are very nervous very jumpy they have a lot of competition and normally they can only take down large creatures if their prey is old sick very young or wounded prey that fights back is to be avoided because the predator cant afford to be injured in the struggle being a carnivore is an expensive business as i well know when your dinner can run away from you youre going to spend a lot of energy hunting and killing it vegetarians haveit easy their dinner cant move and they dont have to do anything other than walk up and open their mouths that meant that the predators following them were not following normal behavior the gryphon and the human were strange they might be dangerous hence there was no reason to follow them in fact there was every reason to avoid themunless he and blade were giving off signals that fit the profile of sick old very young or wounded or had become familiar enough for their pursuers to investigate either the territory these shadows claimed was so very large that he and blade had been within its boundaries all along or these creatures were something out of the ordinary the fact that one of them had killed and eaten a rabbit did not tend to make him believe that they would not attack him or blade wolves made very good meals of mice yet did not hesitate to pull down deer for that matter he was eating mice this very night no a predators prey on a given night did not necessarily define what it could take something as big as a horse could very easily consider something as big as a gryphon to be reasonable prey top predators often pulled down animals very much larger than they themselves were the only exceptions were birds of prey who would ideally not kill anything larger than they could fly off withgenerally much less than half the birds own body weight the only eagles that had ever carried off lambs were kaledainbred bondbirds who had the required wingspread and muscle mass and carried them off at the behest of their bondmates ithink we are going to have to set traps around our camps at night he decided reluctantly even if these creatures manage to escape from a trap there is a chance that we will make them hesitant to attack us by frightening or even injuring one or more if they are nothing more than animals the mere fact that one of them is hurt should make them give up on making us into dinner they would just have to also take the chance that in frightening or injuring one of those shadows they would not make an attack more likely well if we anger them at least weii know that they have the intelligence to connect a trap outside the camp with the people inside itand the intelligence to want revenge for an injury there was one point on which he felt blade was incorrect he was fairly certain that the creatures she saw had been very well aware of the presence of the camp and its precise location they had also probably thought that they would not be seen where they were they must have very keen senses to hunt at night and their sense of smell at least had clearly not been deceived by his subterfuges with the plant juices they must have been able to scent the fire where the fire was there the camp would also be and no matter how wellbanked the fire had been some hint of it was surely visible out there in the darkened forest no those creatures knew exactly where the camp was the only encouraging part was that they had not felt it necessary to surround the camp and place it in a state of siege nor had they decided to rush the camp to try and take the occupants by surprise so they dont feel ready to try and confront us yet i hope that their interest is only curiosity noise was priceless an indicator that the shadows had gone elsewhere to hunt for food at least i hope thats the case i hope the canopy dwellers are better at spotting these creatures than we are all this was enough to give a gryphon a headache wait until morning and ill see to it that were more careful and ill try and make the best time afoot that i can since im the slower of the two of us maybe we can lose them maybe well find a river and really be able to hide our scent and our trail and tomorrow night if they follow us again maybe we can find a way to discourage them from continuing to do so and maybe horses would fly and maybe they would stumble upon a lost enclave of amorous female gryphons and maybe this was all just a bad dream tad surveyed the remains of his snarepulled up out of the ground and left carelessly tangled but all in a heap as if it had been examined closely then dropped it looked very much the same as the debris back at the crash site that had been so carefully examined well as i warned you this is where our friends found their rabbit last night blade said with resignation see over there hed already noticed the few bits of fur and the drops of blood on a dead leaf i should have known better than to expect that anything would leave a snared rabbit alone he sighed it doesnt look as if they found any of the other snaresbut neither did any rabbits then again if any rabbits had theyd probably have gone the way of this one at least the shadows hadnt gone looking for other snares or had they theyd examined this one that had been sprung had they gone looking for others found them and left them alone once they saw how the snares were set or was he ascribing far too much in the way of intelligence to them he regarded the scraps of fur ruefully hardly fair to stalk me and then eat my breakfast he thought wistfully of how nice that rabbit would have tasted and resigned himself to a tasteless meal of dried meat but blade had been out and prowling before he was and had a surprise for him maybe your snares didnt work but my sling did she said with a tiny smile she pulled a decentsized rabbit out of the game bag at her side and his mouth watered at the mere sight of it thank you he said doing his best not to snatch it out of her hand he took it politely but his hunger was too great for more than that fortunately she was quite used to watching him eat for his growling stomach made it impossible for him to wait long enough for her to go elsewhere while he dined nor was he able to do anything other than devour his meal in a few gulps what about you he asked belatedly a moment later when the rabbit was a mere memory and a comfortable feeling in his crop at least i managed to resume civilized behavior without a rabbit leg still sticking out of my mouth im appropriating a bit of your dried meat she replied and i can eat that as we move lets get the packs on and get out of here i dont want to stay here a moment longer than we have to agreed he said firmly especially after last night luck permitting we should find the river today or tomorrow the canopy dwellers had gone silent once more on his watch although he had not seen anything that had given him a very strange feeling his hackles had come up as he wondered if the shadowy hunters had decided to take a walk on the great tree trunk and come at them from the rear hed never know until the moment that they came crashing down through the branches and canvas but they hadnt and the noises had resumed within a very short time remaining at a constant level until dawn blade had made another batch of her herb concoction and had poured it into one of her waterskins after dabbing her itching bites liberally with it he hoped it worked as well for her in the heat of the day as it had last night he put some effort into confusing their backtrail while blade set the course this time he laid some false deadend trails even taking one up a tree that made him think if they had trouble finding a place to shelter tonight perhaps they ought to go up a tree oh no blade cant climb with only one hand well so much for that good idea i could perhaps pull her up by rope if it came to that but the risk of hurting her further would be too great once again however they were in luck this time in late afternoon they came upon another good site to hole up it was another fallen tree but this time it was one with a large den dug out underneath it whatever had dug it originally wasnt home and from the look of things hadnt been resident for some time it did have some current occupants far too small to have dug the den originally and between them he and blade bagged the entire family of five he wasnt certain quite what they were something like a beaver with no tail and about the same size he didnt even know what species they were and it really didnt matter they had rodent teeth and that was enough for him rodents were always edible this bit of good fortune more than made up for the fact that blade had not been as lucky with her sling the rabbit she had gotten for his breakfast was the only kill shed made all day shed had targets but had missed her throws she was so crestfallen about it that he had done his best to reassure her that it was all right well tonight he would have a truly full stomach for the first time since the crash the fresh meat had made a great deal of difference to him he felt much more energetic and lively after having it with his help she made a fire outside their den while she built it up into something respectable he excavated the den quite a bit more his talons werent well suited to digging but he did have determination and the earth was soft when he finished he knew that it would be a tight fit for both of them but that they would manage to keep them off the raw earth he lined it with branches and packed the dirt hed dug out into a little dam to prevent water from coming in during the rain he took a torch and charred the underside of the log to prevent visitors then went out to collect a tangle of vines to conceal the entrance blade roasted her share of the catch made up her medicine then put out the fire and buried the ashes doing her best to obliterate any traces of their presence that might persist through the afternoon downpour like the hollow snag there would be no room in this den for a fire tonight as long as the den stayed dry he didnt think theyd need one need and want why are they so far apart sometimes by the time blade was done tidying things he was ready to eat she took over clumsily weaving the vines with one hand and both feet into a rough mat that they could pull over the hole last of all she collected a lot of leaves from that peppery plant and tucked them into the mat to kill their scent as soon as the rain started they would climb into this hole and pull the mat over the entrance there they would remain until dawn in his opinion this was their most vulnerable camp yet but he had an answer to that although she couldnt climb he could and since the den was barely big enough for the two of them without their packs he had an idea help me with this he said as soon as hed finished gulping down his meal i want to make some decoys he dragged in some more vines and began making them into bundles that resembled a human and something with four feet she was puzzled but gave him a hand as the clouds began to gather for the afternoon rain what are you planning on doing with these she asked as the bundles began to take shape they arent going to fool anything for long not if theyre on the groundbut what if theyre up there he nodded up at the canopy im thinking of taking the packs and these up to a good branch and tying them there maybe our trackers will see us up there and decide were becoming too much work to pursue provided of course that they cant climb somehow i dont think they can even though the canopy creatures are afraid of them i think theyre too big theres a maximum size that a treeclimbing predator can be and still hunt successfully and i think theyre bigger than that maximum size if you really want to its worth trying she didnt look convinced but at least she wasnt too negative he was just as glad that she didnt object to him taking the packs elsewhere to store although the tree he had in mind was a dwarf by the standards of the ones around him he was not looking forward to the climb and that was giving him enough qualms without having to argue with her he accomplished the feat by clamping all four sets of talons into the bark and hitching himself up like an inchworm this used an entirely new set of muscles as well as awakening a new set of pains in his broken wing and by the time he reached a suitable place to cache the packs and the two decoys he wished with a strength beyond telling that he would have been able to glide down instead of climbing he was not looking forward to retrieving the packs in the morning he had taken a rope with him rather than the packs and the decoys themselves once he got himself securely in place he dropped the end down and blade tied it to the first pack as best she could with one hand when he had hauled that up and tied it successfully in place he dropped the end back down the second pack came up next and following that the two decoys and now if there is a disaster blade will at least have a rope she can try to escape by if there is any time to escape i can come back up here and pull her up maybe it did not take long to secure the items in place but this was not the best of perches nor was it a place where he would have wanted to spend the night the packs would remain dry through the storm but not the decoys if they had been up here instead of the decoys it would have been a soggy and most uncomfortable night for them he lowered himself down inching backward and no doubt giving blade an interesting view all the while he dropped off the trunk the moment he thought that hed be able to land safely there he said more briskly and brightly than he actually felt now we have just enough time to rig a deadfall and a couple of other traps before the rain starts blade groaned at the idea of so much work but nodded they both knew that the more distractions they could offer the hunters the better and the more challenge we give to their intelligence the more weii learn about them he let her lead though so that she wouldnt see how tenderly he was walking his fear was rising again by the time the rain started their traps were in place and concealed placed in hiding around the tree rather than around their real den to lend verisimilitude to the decoys in the tree he and blade scrambled for their shelter as the first drops started falling but as was her custom she stayed outside long enough to get a good sluicing down by the rain before coming in she was soaking wet when she came in but since he had lined the den with branches they werent lying directly on the soil the water she brought in dripped through their bedding and from there into the earth there wasnt a lot of room to move and by the time he had snaked out a claw and pulled the mat of vines over the entrance there was even less by dint of much squirming she managed to anoint both herself and him with her bruisecumbugbite medicine he squinted his eyes at the bitter scent but decided that he could live with it with any luck they had to be getting near the river and he could wash it all off rather than attempting to preen it off tomorrow they had deliberately made the entrance as small as possible just barely large enough for him to squeeze inside that meant that there wasnt enough room for anyone to stand watch except blade because she was the one near the entrance and he was crammed so far back that he really couldnt see anything as thunder roared and the rain fell down mere handlengths away from their noses they looked at one another in the semidarkness theres no point in really standing watch he ventured i mean one of us should try and stay awake just in case one of us can hear something but theres no point in trying to look out we made that mat too well i cant see anything from where i am i cant see that much she admitted are you sleepy your ears are better than mine if you could take second shift i can take first i have a full stomach of course im sleepy he retorted forbearing to mention the fact that he was afraid that if he didnt try to sleep now his stiffening muscles would make sleep impossible in fact he fully expected to wake up about the time she was ready to sleep his sore legs and back would see to it that he didnt oversleep that was precisely what happened by that time she was ready for sleep warm and relatively cushioned with him curled around her she dropped off almost immediately while he concentrated on keeping his muscles relaxed so that they didnt go into cramps that was quite enough to keep him awake all by itself but the position he was in did not agree with his broken wing either it probably wasnt causing any damage but the wing twinged persistently he caught himself nearly whining in pain once reducing it to a long wheeze and shiver so he was fully awake and wary when the usual silence descended outside in the canopy signaling the arrival of the shadowy hunters of all of the nights so far this one was perhaps the most maddening and the most frightening he was essentially blind and he and blade were curled in an alltooaccessible hole in the ground if anything found them and really was determined to dig them out it could but as he strained his ears he heard nothing in the way of movement outside the mat of vines he hoped that if anything heard them their breathing and tiny movements might be taken for those of small animals that were too much effort to dig out and which might have a rear entrance to this den through which they could escape iwish id thought of that and dug one that might have been a smarter thing to do than rig those traps as the moments stretched out unbearably he became acutely sensitive to every sound more so than he ever remembered being before so when he heard the deadfall go it sounded as loud as a peal of thunder and what was more he clearly heard the very peculiar cry of pain that followed it wasnt a yelp and it certainly wasnt a shout there were elements of both a hiss and a howl in it and it was not a cry he had ever heard before in his life it startled him for he could not for a moment imagine what kind of animal could have made such a sound it cut off rather quickly so quickly that he wondered if he had managed to actually kill something with his trap possible but not likely not unless our friend out there was extraordinarily unlucky then he heard more sounds another thud tearing and breaking noises something being dragged briefly another hiss then nothing his skin crawled under his feathers more silence while his beak ached from being held clamped shut so tightly that his jaw muscles locked and then when he least expected it the canopy sounds returned he waited on fire with tension as the faint light of dawn began to appear in the tiny gaps in their covering when he couldnt bear it any longer he nudged blade with his beak she came awake instantly her good hand going to her knife i heard the deadfall go he whispered i think we got something whether it was one of them whether its still therei cant tell if it is still there i dont think its still alive though she nodded and cocked her head to listen to the sounds of the forest id say were safe to come out she said are you ready as ready as im likely to be theyd discussed this last night she was going to come out in a rushing attack just in case there was something lying in wait for them and he was supposed to follow it had all seemed perfectly reasonable and appropriate last night now with his muscles so sore stiff and cramped he wasnt certain he was going to be able to crawl out much less rush out she drew her knife and wriggled around until she was crouched in place with a yell she threw off the mat and leaped outinadvertently kicking him in the stomach as she did so his attackcry was considerably spoiled by this instead of a fierce scream of defiance all he could emit was a pitiful grunt remarkably similar to a belch but he managed to follow her out if not in a rush at least in a hurry there wasnt anything there which although an anticlimax was also a relief sorry she said apologetically my foot slipped what could he say it happens he managed as graciously as possiblenot very but he doubted that she blamed him at the moment for not speaking with an ambassadors tact and dissimulation lets go check that deadfall when they got close to where the trap had been it was quite clear that it was going to be empty for the remains of the vegetation they had used to conceal it were scattered all over the area the trap itself was quite emptythough there was a trace of blood on the bark of one of the logs we marked him blade said squatting down beside it to examine it further how badlywell probably not too badly maybe a scrape or a minor cut possibly a broken bone but we did hurt him a little she stood up and looked toward the tree where the decoys were hidden wed better go see how they reacted when they reached the base of the tree they finally saw something of what their trackers could do and some clues as to their nature persistent and possibly angry but not foolishly persistent there were scratches deep ones in the bark of the tree about twice as high up on the trunk as blade was tall so the decoys had worked at least for a while and the hunters had been unable to resist trying to get at the quarry when it was openly in sight or else they were so angry when one of their number got caught in the deadfall that they tried to get to us no matter how difficult it was going to be now they knew this much the hunters could leap respectable distances but they couldnt climb the tree trunk which at least meant that they were not great cats the ground at the foot of the tree was torn by claws either as the hunters tore at the ground in frustration or when they tried to leap up to drag their prey down out of the tree on the other hand there wasnt a lot of damage to the tree trunk itself the hunters had made several attempts but it didnt look as if they had tried mindlessly over and over until they were exhausted that meant that they were intelligent enough to know when their task was impossible or intelligent enough to recognize that the decoys were just that in that case they might well have reasoned that we would have to come back to get the packs before we left no matter where we hid ourselves overnight and if it had been anger that motivated their attack their anger did not overcome them for long blade looked around shivering as if some of the same thoughts had occurred to her lets get the packs and get out of here she urged fast they havent shown themselves by day before but that doesnt mean they wont now we might have given them a reason to he swarmed up the tree far more quickly than he had thought possible a few moments before and this time he didnt notice his sore muscles there was no need to concern himself with ropes on the way up which made things simpler he untied the packs when he got there and dropped them and the rope that held them in place down to the ground leaving the decoys stuck in the forks of the branches if the shadowlurkers were still deceived by the decoys they might linger giving him and blade that much more of a head start he went down the tree twice as fast as he had gone up every nerve in his body jumped whenever an unexpected sound occurred and the quicker they left the happier he would be there was just a moment more of delay during which they stowed the rope and donned the packs and then they were on their way without even a pause for a meal he wasnt hungry and he suspected that blade wasnt either his insides were all knotted up with tension and he kept hearing old gryphon proverbs in the back of his mind about wellfed gryphons and the inability to fly out of danger not that i can fly out of danger nowbut its better to run or fight on an empty stomach than a full one it was barely dawn by the light and the morning fog had not yet lifted the entire world was painted in dim grays and blues vague gray shapes and columns appearing and vanishing in white mist in a way that was all to the good for rather than using the trees as cover they counted on the fog itself for primary concealment they were able to make much better time that way and since they were taking their bearings from the northneedle rather than the sun it didnt matter that everything was obscured and enshrouded the fog itself had an odd bitter aftertaste to it nothing at all like the sea mists tad was used to the air felt heavier and thicker although that was probably his imagination the fog condensed on his feathers and he kept shaking himself so that it didnt soak in poor blade had no such ability her hair was damp and she would probably be shivering if they werent trotting along fast enough to stay warm from exertion he found himself trying to think what kind of creature the hunters could be those stories about maar and all the creatures he madewhat sort of things did he do father said that most of what he did was to make copies of the creatures that urtho developed the makaar had been analogs of gryphons had there been analogs of hertasi and kyree the tervardi and dyheli were natural creatures surely maar had not bothered to make analogous creatures to them why would he but then again why not maar had never hesitated to do or try anything he considered might give him an edge he made colddrakes and basilisks but those werent analogs of anything urtho made so there goes fathers theory there were smaller creatures but i cant remember anything that might correspond in size to the hunters did he do flightless makaar but why would he when a makaar on the ground would be more helpless than i am the shadowhunters cant be analogs of hertasi because im certain that what weve been seeing is fourfooted not twofooted had anyone else involved in the mage wars made a fourfooted hunter the size of a horse i just cant remember anyone ever going into a lot of detail about the magemade creatures maybe snowstar would know but hes rather effectively out of reach at the moment he kept his ears trained on the trail behind them and his eyes on blades back she was a ghost in the fog and it was up to him to keep track of her and not lose her her pale beige clothing blended in beautifully with the fogbut so would his own gray plumage for once it would probably be harder for the hunters to see them than vice versa whatever is behind us is clever very clever they werent deceived by my false trails and they either gave up on the decoys or recognized them as false and if they gave up temporarily theres no guarantee that they wont realize whats going on when they come back they didnt find us but they might not have bothered to look or they might have needed to hunt and feed and they couldnt take the extra time to figure out where we were why should they they knew wed come out in the morning and all they have to do is wait for us to come out and get on our way and they could trail us again they could even be hoping we will stay put in that campsite since it has been proven to protect us once he wanted rock walls around him a secure place that these shadowhunters couldnt dig into he wanted a steady food source that the shadows couldnt frighten away once they had both they could figure out ways to signal the help that must be coming and he wanted to see them he wanted to know exactly what was hunting them traps might give him more of a chance to see one provided that any injured or dead hunters remained in the trap and there was no guarantee of that either they freed the injured one from the deadfall that was what i heard last night they were freeing him that meant cooperation which meant more intelligence wolves might sniff around a trapped fellow might even try to help him gnaw himself loose but they would not have been able to remove parts of a deadfall trap except by purest accident and then only after a great deal of trial and error effort he had heard them last night it had not taken them long at all to free the trapped one and they had done so without too many missteps if there were any at all the snarethey didnt just chew the leg or head off the rabbit it caught and then eat the rest the noose of the snare was opened they killed the rabbit pulled the snare open and removed it then pulled up the snare and looked it over that was evidence of more intelligence and certainly the ability to manipulate objects what that evidence meant to their survival he couldnt yet tell but he had his fears and plenty of them he could only wonder right now if blade shared those fears maybe it was time to stop trying to shelter her and start discussing things maybe it had been time to do that a couple of days ago blade stopped in the shelter of a vinecovered bush is that what i think it is she frowned with concentration and motioned to tad to remain where he was so she could hear without distraction there was something in the distance underneath the chatter of the fourlegged canopy creatures and the steady patter of debris from a tree where some of the birds were eating green fruita sound tad shifted his weight impatiently shouldnt we he began hush a moment she interrupted and closed her eyes to concentrate better was that really what she thought it was she began to isolate it mentally from the rain of bits of leaf twig and halfeaten fruit i think i hear running water she said at last come on she abandoned all attempts at secrecy trotting as quickly as she could through the tangle of underbrush with tad hot on her heels if that was the longsought river she heard then their safety lay more surely in reaching it than in trying to hide themselves or their trail above them a few canopy creatures barked or chattered a warning but most of them seemed to regard her and tad as harmless well they would now were running openly not stalking we cant be hunting so were not a danger to them directly the sounds above kept on and the fruit eaters didnt even pause in their gluttony that was comforting it meant there was nothing else around that aroused the tree dwellers alarm if there had been something trailing them closely when they broke cover it would have had to do the same to a certain extent just to keep up with them and if that had happened the treetops should have erupted with alarm or once again gone silent or both there was sunlight pouring down through a huge gap in the trees off in the distance it shone greengold through the leaves white between the trunks of the trees the closer they got the clearer the sound of water running rapidly over rocks became they literally burst through the luxuriant curtain of brush at the rivers edge teetering on the rocks lining the banks she wanted to cheer but confined herself to pounding on tads shoulder enthusiastically the river at their feet was wide but so far as she could tell it was deep only in the middle more to the point across the river lay the cliff they had been looking for with a wide beach made of rocks and mud lying between the rock cliff face and the river caves waterfallseven a crevice that we can fortify any of those will do very nicely just now lets get across tad urged if theyre following us well be able to see them and theres going to be water between them and us water between them and us right now that was the best protection she could imagine tad was right with an open space of water between their enemy and themselves they would certainly be able to see the mysterious hunters coming we can look for a cave as soon as were across for the first time in four days they should be able to find a safe and secure place to wait for rescue a place too difficult to dig them out of with walls of rock instead of flimsy canvas and they might be able to actually see the creatures that were following themassuming that the shadowhunters were bold enough to go this far they might give up she wasnt going to count on it but they might this was certainly more trouble than most predators wanted to go through for a meal now she grinned and it was heartfelt lets go get wet she said we both need a bath anyway seven blade peered through the curtain of rain looking a few lengths ahead to see if there was anything like a cave in sight then looking back down at her feet to pick out her footing among the slippery mud and river rocks here out in the open the rain came down in sheets making footing doubly treacherous more rain sluiced down the cliff face washing across the rocks at her feet this time they hadnt gone to ground when the rains came they didnt even look for a shelter instead they continued to make their way along the cliffside bank of the river for one thing the only shelter from the rain lay back on the other side of the river and she didnt really want to take her chances back there for another every moment they spent in huddling away from the rain was a moment that they could not spend in looking for real cover the protection of a place from which they could not be extracted by force by now poor tad was a wet sodden mess and after this she was certainly going to have to figure out what they could spare to make him a new bandage for his wing the bandages he wore were soaked and coming loose and wouldnt be any good until after they had been rinsed clean and dried sacrifice some clothing maybe if we dont have enough bandages i could shorten the legs of my trews for cloth since they dont seem to be much protection against the bugs that and some rope might make a decent sling she was going to have to get him dried out before they slept allowing a gryphon to go to sleep wet was a sure prescription for illness we need a cave or at worst a cleft this rain is going to go on until nightfall and we wont be able to see anything then the water level in the river didnt seem to be rising much if any which suggested that it was probably as high now as it ever got except in the occasional flood and i hope we dont happen to be in the midst of flood season there was evidence aplenty for a flood in the form of flotsam mostly wood washed up and wedged among the rocks it would make admirable firewood if they could ever find a place where they could build a fire it would be just our luck to have pinned our hopes on finding this cliff only to discover that there is less shelter here than there was in the forest if they didnt find a place to hole up before dark they might have to spend the night exposed on this rocky shore where they would have the grim choice of lighting a fire and attracting attention or shivering cold and damp wrapped up in wet blankets all night the gods or fate were not to be so unkind however after a few more furlongs of picking their way across the rocks and sliding through the mud the cliff receded somewhat to her left and the river opened up before her a white roaring wall loomed up out of the rain as if someone had torn a hole in the clouds and let all the water out at once after a moment of blinking and trying to get her dripping hair out of her eyes she realized that she was not staring at a torrent in the midst of the downpour she was looking at a waterfall and just on their side of the waterfall there was a series of darker holes in the cliff wall that must be caves tad spotted them at the same time and shouted into her ear if any of these are deep enough this is where we should stop we may not be able to hear anything coming but whatever tries to come at us from ahead wont be able to get past the falls well only have to guard in one direction she winced at the bellowing since she was right beside the excited gryphon but saw at once that he was right that overcame her misgiving at camping in a place where the sound of an enemy approaching would be covered by the roar of the water and as if to emphasize just what a good spot this was a stunned fish came floating to their very feet to lodge among the rocks flapping feebly it had obviously been knocked silly by going over the falls and tad who was probably starving was on it in a heartbeat two gulps and it was gone and tad had a very satisfied look on his face see what else you can forage she shouted at him ill check out these caves wait a moment he shouted back picking up a milkywhite smooth pebble from the rocks at his feet tad stared at it in concentration that she found very familiar then he handed it to her gryphgrinning with open beak the pebble glowed with magelight she accepted it with relief at least he had enough magic back now that he could make a magelight again she didnt have to go far to find their new shelter the very first cave she entered proved to be perfect it went back a long way slanting upward all the time for a few lengths the floor was covered with soft dry sand then there was a pile of driftwood marking the highwater line that past floods had also left behind that was where the sand ended and dirt and rock began a thin stream of water ran down the center of the cave coming from somewhere near the back cutting a channel through the sand and rock alike she made her way past it holding the blueglowing rock over her head to cast the best possible light ahead of her without dazzling her eyes the cave narrowed the farther she went back then abruptly made a ninetydegree turn upward this was where the stream of water originated she put her head inside the hole and looked up besides getting a faceful of rain she clearly saw the cloudfilled sky a great distance above at one time a real stream of water perhaps a branchlet of the river that tumbled down the cliff further on had cut a channel through here forming the cave now except perhaps during rain that channel was dry but it formed precisely what they needed a natural chimney to carry the smoke away from their fire provided that nothing acted to funnel more water down that ancient outlet this would be a perfect shelter she could not have asked for anything better even the chimney was too small for anything threatening to climb down it except perhaps snakes and the like there were signs that other creatures had found this place just as congenial a collection of small bones from fish and other creatures and a cluster of bats toward the rear of the cave she did not mind sharing this cave with bats after her constant battles with insects she was altogether happy to see them they didnt seem disturbed to see her blade tad called from behind her and she realized that although the sound of the waterfall did penetrate in here it was much muted by the rock walls coming she responded turning her back on the chimney and climbing back down to the driftwood pile she smelled smoke and indeed a plume of it ghostlike in the blue light of the bespelled pebble drifted toward her and the chimney outlet a warmer light up ahead greeted her tad had already started a fire with the driftwood and she joined him there the fish around here must not be terribly bright he said cheerfully quite a lot of them ended up on the rocks a few moments ago i got you some he pointed with his beak at a pair of sleek shapes at his feet after you ate your fill i hope she admonished you need the food more than i do i manage quite well on that travelbread his nares flushed and she judged by that and the bulging state of his crop that he had been perfectly greedy not that she blamed him especially not after going on short rations for so many days you might as well put this under something so we can sleep she said handing him the pebble and shrugging painfully out of her pack if id ordered up a cave i couldnt have gotten a better one than this we can even make a really smoky fire back there she pointed to the rear of the cave theres a natural chimney thatll send it up without smoking us out the only thing we dont have is a nighttime signal we need to talk about that he ground his beak as he thought his good wing halfspread in the firelight to dry i cant imagine them flying at night he began then laughed well on the other hand since its me and you who are lost skandranon will have night flights out if he has to fly them himself she finished for him with a wry chuckle then her humor faded she could not forget even for a moment that they were still being hunted until they knew by what and for what reason they should not assume they would be here to rescue when rescue came yes they had good shelter now and it would be very difficult to dig them out of it but not impossible not forsaya renegade mage and his followers human or created tad however was going to take the moment as it came he shrugged out of his pack and nudged a fish over to her with one talon you eat he said theres enough wood in here already to easily last the night while you cook and eat that ill go back out and see what i can see she hesitated a moment then gave a mental shrug and bent to pick up the fish imight as well eat and make myself comfortable hes right about that while the rain fell it was unlikely that anything would try to find them if the creatures trailing them were semiintelligent they would assume that the two castaways had followed their usual pattern and had taken shelter before the rain started the hunters would probably be looking for them on the other side of the river first especially if the hunters had not traced them as far as the river when the rain began any trail would end short of the river itself and the mud and rock of the riverbank would not hold any scent or footprint through the rain the trail on the other side of the river would be completely obliterated and if they could keep their fire out of sight it was possible that they could keep their presence in this cave a secret for a day or more by the time smoke got up the rock chimney and exited above them it would be very difficult for anything scenting it to tell where it originated after that of course it would become increasingly harder to stay hidden every time they left the cave which they would have to do to catch fish wash and get firewood they stood a chance of being seen watchers on the other side of the river could spot them without being seen themselves but ill worry about that after i eat when i can think better she decided it was wonderful to be able to have enough space to properly open the packs and spread everything out once again though she found herself attempting a task onehanded that was difficult enough using two scaling and gutting a fish she wound up slipping off her boot and using a foot as a clumsy hand on the tail to hold it down she saved the head and the guts for later use as bait they could not count on having the kind of luck that sent a harvest of fish down over the cliff to their feet every day that was all right they had fishing line and hooks with them and if the fish guts didnt work she could try a bug a breadball or a bit of dried meat once again her shovel came into play as an impromptu grill it probably would have been better if shed had something to grease it with but at the moment she was too hungry for trifles like that the fish burned a little and stuck to the shovel but that didnt matter in the leastshe could scrape the fish meat off and eat and some blackened fish meat stuck to it wouldnt adversely affect the use of the shovel as a shovel she was hungry enough in fact that she very nearly burned her fingers picking flaky bits of meat off the hot carcass before it had properly cooled she alternately swore softly and ate making a happy pig of herself tad reappeared dripping wet again and regarded her thoughtfully clay he said next time wrap it up in clay and bake the whole thing when you break the clay open the skin comes off with it but the rest of the fish is fine where did you learn that one she asked looking up at him in surprise mother she loves fish and even though she likes it best fresh shes been known to accept baked fish if it wasnt straight out of the sea he gryphgrinned at her again and cocked his head to one side you know how she isunlike father shell wish for the ideal but not complain when it isnt given what do you want to do about the firelight move the fire back farther into the cave the cave bends enough that i think that will make it harder to see from across the river or does it matter so he had been thinking about their stalkers im not sure it matters sooner or later theyre going to see us or see signs of where we are id rather put some thought into defenses ive set up some simple line snares on the path so watch out for them he said not much theres not much i can do in the rain but some it should help i would think i can do better tomorrow so thats why youre wet she signed to him to sit beside the fire as she devoured the cooked fish it didnt taste like much a bit bland which in itself made it an improvement over the dried meat which tasted like old boots it was hot and satisfying and cooked which made all the difference and she ate every scrap using her knife to scrape the burned bits off the shovel and eat them too then she settled back on her heels sucking her slightlyburnt fingers to get the last of the juices and gave him all of her attention right then lets settle the shortterm first then the longterm first watch she asked yours he said promptly as full as i am im going to doze off no matter what i cant help it its the way im built and i have marginally better nightvision than you do i also have better hearing he added but with that waterfall out there that isnt going to matter i can run our fishing line from one of the snares into here and stack some stones over the light pebble to make a sort of alarm well that seems pretty reasonable to me good enough if i see anything tonight should i take a shot at it across the river is in the range of my sling and with all these rocks around i can afford to miss now and we wont have to go after my ammunition to get it back that was another source of easing tensions now she was no longer limited to the pouches of lead shot for ammunition the rocks might not fly as true but she could lob as many of them around as she needed to my vote is that we not provoke anything tonight he said instantly lets not give them the answer to the question of where we went if they cant find us tonight we might get lucky and theyll go away probably not but its worth giving ourselves the chance agreed do we trap the other side of the river that was another good question it might well be worth it to tryor it might make them targets when they crossed the river to check the traps the river wasnt all that deep even at its deepest barely chinhigh on blade anything energetic enough could cross it easily after all they had and neither of them was in the best of shape a stealthy swimmer could cross it and never betray himself by sound what with the waterfall out there pounding away he shook his head no we trap this side of the river but not the other wed be too vulnerable on that side and why bother we really dont want to catch these things do we he didnt look as if he did and she agreed with him after all what could they do with one if they did catch it alive or dead all that would do would be to tell them what the hunters looked like and there were easier ways to do that not unless we have to start whittling down their numbers she murmured thinking that this cave was both a good and a bad place to be they could defend itbut it would be hard for rescuers to spot and it would be very easy to place them in a state of siege from which there was no escape the narrowness of the chimney that made it impossible for anything to climb down also rendered it impossible for them to climb up right then tomorrow if it looks clear we go get some green wood and leaves from across the way to make a smoke signal with we get all the dry driftwood we can and stock it in here he cocked his head to one side and waited for her contribution water we have finally i might just as well start fishing and as long as were running a smokesignal fire it can do double duty and i can smoke what we dont eat that way if were trapped in here well have something to eat we ought to go back down the way we came in and decide what kind of traps we can lay at least one rockfall right at the entrance with a release one of us can trigger from in here he said promptly and yawned with a lot of work and cleverness we can even barricade the opening of the cave with wood and rocks were certainly clever enough so all we need is the work and that is about all of the thinking that im good for i have got to get some sleep i dont need a blanket its plenty warm enough in here next to the fire he winked at her i can even lie down on this nice soft sand so that im between the fire and the entrance and screen it with my body i shall sacrifice staying near the cold and water to do this duty big of you help me spread out the bedding so it can dry she responded dryly then you can sleep all you likeat least until its your turn on watch and may there be nothing to watch forexcept a search party and that soon she thought as he chuckled and moved to help her with the damp blankets by now theyll have missed us back home we didnt make the rendezvous and the other patrol should have sent word back with their teleson how long until were missing instead of overdue and will they look for us when they think were only late i wish i knew i only know one thing fathers going to go out of his mind when he hears of this im glad im not the one to tell him amberdrake stared at commander judeth for a moment her words made no sense then suddenly they made all too much sense theyre what all of amberdrakes hardwon equanimity deserted him he rose out of the chair in his office as if hed sat on a hot coal indeed that was very much the way he felt calm down drake the youngsters are only overdue by a day judeth told him she looked outwardly calm but he knew more than enough about her and the tiny telltale signals her body showed to know that she was seriously worried and yet that was simply not good enough the patrol they were relieving got to the rendezvous point expecting them to be there yesterday and they werent there shes worried shes only worried and she still hasnt done anything and they havent shown up yet he held both the arms of his chair in a strangle grip and stared at her with unveiled accusation in his eyes so why arent you doing anything you know those two are as bythebook as any trainees youve ever had they have never ever violated orders if they had a reason to be late if they knew they were going to be delayed theyd have sent a teleson message if they havent its because they cant because something happened to them his voice was rising and he knew it and what was more he didnt care that he was making a blatant display of his emotions for once in his life he wanted someone to know how upset he was judeth made soothing motions as if she thought he could somehow be propitiated by a few words as if she thought he could be reasoned out of his hysteria she was certainly going to try we are doing something drake the patrol has left the rendezvous and they are going on out to see if they cant find some sign of blade and tad its too early to get in a panic about this too early to get in a panic who does she think shes talking to he held himself back from exploding at her only by great effort of will you tell me that when its your child thats missing he snapped at her or have you gotten so wrapped up in being a commander that youve forgotten this isnt wartime instead of telling me not to panic i suggest you tell me what else youre doing right now and if you arent doing anything right now i am not interested in hearing why you cant ill pull in every resource i have to see that something does get done and without any nonsense about not getting into a panic because one person thinks its too early that was the closest he had ever come in his life to saying that he was actually going to use all the power and influence he held and had never used before for any reason and i will ill do it if i have to blackmail everyone in this city even her it was a threat a real one and he was not bluffing but he felt he owed it to judeth to warn her that lightning was going to fall on her before it came if he used all his influence it would be worse than lightning and judeths position as commander might not survive the storm her eyes darkened dangerously at his words but her voice remained calm and even which was something of a testament to her own control judeth did not like threats but she was a realist and she must know that he was not bluffing right at this moment the original patrol is flying out about a day in the right direction to see if they can find anything if they dont theyll go north of the track then south to see if they somehow went off course meanwhile were working on it were not just sitting around waiting to see what happens were trying to find some way of locating them from here andand she finally raised her own voice as he got ready to explode again and we are putting together search parties those will leave in the morning since we cant possibly get one together before then there is no point in grabbing unprepared people and sending them out at random now if you can think of anything i might have missed id like to hear it the truth was he couldnt but that didnt stop him from wanting some action right that very moment something besides merely readying a search party i cant think of anything but imthis is difficult its hard to think he admitted grudgingly does skan know yet aubris telling him poor aubri her tone said but poor skan was what he was thinking he was afraid of this he didnt want tad to go off on this assignment any more than i wanted blade to i know he thought about going to judeth and asking them to be reassigned to something else and didnt do it and now he must be wondering if he is to blame for them being missing ill tell winterhart he began his throat tightening at the thought gods how do i tell her this was my fault if it all comes down to it something i said or did made blade want to be in the silvers in the first place all my interference made her want to be assigned somewhere far away from hereif i hadnt tried to meddle in her life so much she would still be heremaybe even doing something else with her life and tad would have a different partner one that wouldnt have urged him to ask for assignment out of the city he desperately wanted someone else to take on the burden of telling her so that he did not have to face her accusing eyes cowardly yes but no ill tell her judeth said firmly i already know where she is and im silverblades commander thats part of my job you go to skan ill send her to you there there as everyone in white gryphon knew was kecharas nursery this time of the day skandranon spent at least an hour with her and the other children human and otherwise every afternoon he loved to spend time with them telling stories playing games once again amberdrake got to his feet and headed for the door this time judeth didnt stop him as soon as the white gryphon council hall was finished the spouses of every city official had demanded the addition of real offices to itwinterhart included were tired of you people bringing work home and were tired of having work follow you home she had said both in her capacity as spokesspouse and in her capacity as a city official herself home is where you go to get away from idiots who couldnt find the public latrine without a map and a guide and every official gets an office even if its no bigger than a closet she had added i dont care if the post of kleshya clan chief has never had a physical office before the kleshya clan chief has also never lived in anything other than a tent before and if he can break tradition by living in a cave he can break it a little more by having an office and regular hours and he can bar the door when his office hours are over she had glared at amberdrake and her eyes had said and that goes twice as much for you my dear and overobliging spouse since lionwinds wife had been standing behind winterhart nodding her head at every word and with one hand on her knife he and every other city official had readily agreed the offices were all built into the cliff behind the council hall small and private and close to the other public buildings the administrative building for the silvers was not that far away from amberdrakes office and in that building was the nursery they had made for kechara when she was still acting as the communication center for the silvers she shared it with the youngsters of anyone else in the silvers or in city administration who needed to have someone tend their little ones while they worked it was a good arrangement for everyone and it gave kechara a neverending stream of playmates who were all her mental age even if she was chronologically six or more times older even though kecharas powers were severely limited she could still talk to any gryphon within the city territory that alone was useful to the silvers and a very good reason to keep her right where she always had been as amberdrake hurried toward the building every muscle and nerve writhing with anxiety he couldnt even begin to imagine how judeth had thought that aubri could break something like this gently to skan she must have been so upset by the news that her ability to reason had flown right out the door aubri hasnt the tact of a brick when skan drake the bellow of a gryphon enraged could probably be heard all the way up to the farms and the gryphon that burst out of the door of the silvers headquarters looked perfectly ready to chew up iron and spit out nails burst was indeed the correct term the whiteandblack gryphon erupted from the door flying his head swiveling in all directions presumably looking for his friend as he gained altitude drake skan bellowed again from a height of about three lengths above him these idiots theyve lost i know i know amberdrake shouted back waving his hands frantically thats why im skan folded his wings and landed heavily as if he were pouncing on something every feather on end i want every mage in this city working on a way to find them he said wrathfully i dont care what theyre doing this is an emergency i want everybody pulled in off of whatever theyre doing and i want search parties out there now i want messengers sent to shalaman i want every man the haighlei can spare out there looking too i want we have to work this together or theyre not going to listen to us amberdrake seized his friends head in both hands hooking his fingertips into the gryphons nares he pulled skans beak down so that the gryphon was looking directly into his eyes i know he said forcefully believe me i feel the same we have to call the council to authorize this skan but i dont think anybody on it is going to disagree with us and if they do skan growled wordlessly at the very idea if they do wewe both know things they wish we didnt he pointed out we do and ill use that there it was skan agreed with him it wasnt right but it was better than arguing with shardcounters until it was too late to do anything but theres no point in scattering everybody like a covey of frightened quail drake persisted trying to convince himself as much as skandranon all right lets get things coordinated judeth told the original patrol to look for them right now thats all that anyone can do out there we have to organize and get people out there talk people into using gates again if we have to we have to get council backing for all that before anything else can be done and that isnt going to happen if were both standing here and wasting precious time screaming like outraged parents we are outraged parents the gryphon kicked clods of dirt in flurries of rage i dont want to have to follow procedure amberdrake put his fists on his hips and leaned toward skandranon we will get council approval by whatever means necessary ihate it but thats the case if we want to have more than just the usual effort from the silvers we have to get council authorization and thats where the threats of blackmail come in skan growled again but without as much force behind it damn it drake why do you have to be so right he snarled all right then ill go back in there and have kechara call in the council members so we can authorize all of this amberdrake wanted to add dont frighten her but he held his tongue of all of them skan knew best how not to do anything that would make kechara unhappy he was her papa skan and she loved him with all of her heartwhich was as large as her poor brain was small he would no more do anything to frighten her than he would allow blade and tad to languish in the wilderness unsoughtfor and unrescued he headed back toward the council hall certain that if winterhart and zhaneel were not already on the way there after kecharas call they would be skan came stalking in shortly after drake and within moments after that the rest of the council members came hurrying in judeth was one of the first looking very surprised and taken aback and just a little annoyed and although skan leveled an icy glare at her his tone was civil enough ive called this meeting he said since this is an emergency situation he waited only until there were enough council members present to constitute a quorum and until everyone was seated before nodding to judeth youre the commander of the silvers so i think it best that you explain the emergency to the rest of the council he said crisply judeth looked as if she wanted to say something scathing to him but held her tongue which was probably wise amberdrake had a good idea of what she was thinking however she was first and foremost a military commander and under any other circumstances the fact that two of the most junior members of the silvers were missingor overdueshould not have been considered an emergency the council should be concerned with only an hystericalbut powerfulparent could have thought that it was and amberdrake would have cheerfully throttled her for suggesting any such thing if she dared throttled her then revived her so i could throttle her again part of him was appalled at this capacity for violence within himself the rest of him nodded in gleeful agreement at the idea then id revive her so that skan could have a turn but she evidently knew betteror the threat of his influence made her think twice about suggesting any such thing judeth explained the situation coolly and calmly while the other members of the council listened without making any comments skan kept glaring around the table as if daring any of them to say that this was not the sort of emergency for which the council should be called no one did but snowstar did have something to say that put the entire situation into a perspective that amberdrake greatly appreciated has anyone ever gone missing this way before he asked without looking either at skan or at amberdrake i know that there have been a handful of accidents among the silvers but i dont ever recall any of our silvers on outpost duty ever disappearing before judeth you havent even had any fatalities in the silvers since we encountered the haighlei and all of those were on the trek to find the coast if this is a new development i think it is a very serious one aubri opened his beak then looked at judeth startled she was the one who replied actuallyyoure right she said sounding just as surprised as aubri looked the fatalities among young gryphons since we founded the city have all been among the hunters not the silvers and the accidents causing injuries among the silvers have all been just thataccidents usually caused by weather and not a single death from something like a drunkard or fight to date we havent had a single case of outpost patrols going missing theyve broken limbs theyve gotten sick weve had to send help out to them and one set of humans even got lost oncebut they had a teleson and we knew they were all right we just couldnt find them for a while weve never had anyone just vanish before her eyes were the only part of her that showed how alarmed this new observation made her but amberdrake was savagely pleased at the way that her eyes went blank and steely he knew that look that was general judeth suddenly encountering a deadly enemy where she had been told there was open ground with no threats i kept thinking this wassort of one of the hazards of dutybut that was under war conditions or while we were making our way here aubri muttered so shamefaced that his nares flushed a brilliant red snowstar youre right weve never lost a silver sincesince we allied with the haighlei you two have been making the mistake of thinking that the silvers were the extension of the old armybut they arent and our situation is completely different than it was before the wars and how could i have been so blind not to have seen your blindness then i believe this does qualify as a fullscale emergency snowstar said firmly when two highlytrained individuals drop completely out of sight for no reason and with no warning it seems to me that the danger is not only to them alone but possibly to the entire city what if they were removed so that they could not alert us to some enemy who is moving against us how can we know that if we dont mount a rescue in strength and numbers heads nodded all around the table and amberdrake exchanged stricken glances with winterhart who had come in just in time to hear that he felt cold all over and she had paled he could have done without hearing that he was perversely glad that snowstar had thought of it for it certainly swayed even the veterans on the council to their cause but he could have done without hearing it either snowstar really believes that or the selfproclaimed nondiplomat snowstar just made a shrewd play in our support or both a heavy and ominous silence filled the council hall and no one seemed prepared to break it skan was as frozen as a statue and beside him zhaneel simply looked to be in too much shock to be able to think winterhart stood beside her council seat unable to sit clutching the back of it her knuckles were as white as her namesake amberdrake himself felt unable to move every limb leaden and inert judeth cleared her throat making all of them jump right she said briskly silence broken we have the original pair flying a search pattern were putting together more search teams does anyone have any further suggestions skan opened his beak but snowstar beat him to it ill organize the mages and start distancescrying he said immediately were probably too far away but those who can scry for them should at least try well look for the traces of the magic on all the items they had with them even if something made them crash those traces will still be there ill also pick out mages for the search parties once again skan opened his beakthen glared around the table to make certain that he wasnt interrupted this time we should send a message to shalaman he said belligerently his people know that forest better than we do we should make himi mean ask himto send out parties of his hunters thats good judeth approved making a note of it i can put anyone whos been posted to that area on search parties but if we can field haighlei who are trained to hunt the forest in addition to our own people that will be even better anything else search parties magic the haighlei thoughts flitted through drakes head but he couldnt make any of them hold still long enough to be examined judeth looked around the table to meet shaking heads and nodded good weve got a plan she said firmly we should assume that whatever has happened to these silvers could endanger the city and make finding them a top priority lets get to it she stood up and was halfway to the door before anyone else was even out of his chair he didnt blame her if the situation was reversed he wouldnt want to be in the same room with four frantic parents either and he wouldnt want to face two people who had just threatened to blackmail him for not taking the loss of their children seriously enough everyone else deserted the hall as quickly only aubri paused at the door looking back with uncertainty in his gaze he opened his beak then swallowed hard shook his head and followed the others skandranon wanted nothing more than to rush off to the rescue of his son failing that he wanted to tear the gizzard out of those who were responsible for his disappearance right now so far as his heart was concerned the ones responsible were right here in white gryphon judeth and aubri it was all their fault if they hadnt assigned the children to this farflung outpost both his beloved son and his dear friend amberdrakes daughter would still be here i knew that this was a mistake all along he seethed at zhaneel as he paced the length and breadth of the council hall i knew they were too young to be sent off on outpost duty no one that young has ever been sent off alone like that before they should have been posted here like everyone else was judeths getting senile and aubri was already there to show her the wayand please zhaneel suddenly exploded stop he stared at her his mouth still open one foot raised stop it skan she said in a more normal tone it is not their fault it is not the fault of anyone and if you would stop trying to find someone to blame we would get something done she looked up at him with fear and anxiety in her eyes you are a mage i am not you go to work with snowstar and the others and i shall go to the messengermage and send a message in your name to shalaman asking for his help at least i can do that much and skandranonhe is my son as well as yours and i am able to act without rages and threats with that she turned away from him and left him still standing with his foot upraised and his beak open staring after her in shock alone for amberdrake and winterhart had already left stupid stupid gryphon shes right you know blaming aubri and judeth wont get you anywhere and if you take things out on them youre only going to make them mad at you the black gryphon would be remembered as an angry overprotective vengeful parent and what good would that do none of course what good would it do all at once his energy ran out of him he sat down on the floor of the council hall feelingold old tired defeated and utterly helpless shaking with fear and in the grip of his own weakness he squinted his eyes tightly closed ground his beak and shivered from anything but cold somewhere out there his son was lost possibly hurt certainly in trouble and there was nothing nothing that he could do about it this was one predicament that the black gryphon wasnt going to be able to swoop in and salvage icouldnt swoop in on anything these days even if i could salvage it im an anachronism ive outlived my usefulness it is happening all over again except this time there cant be a rebirth of the black gryphon from the white gryphon the body wears out the hips grow stiff and the muscles strain im the one thats useless and senile not judeth and aubri they were doing the best they could i was the one flapping my beak and making stupid threats that is all that is left for a failed warrior to do for a moment he shook with the need to throw back his head and keen his grief and helplessness to the sky in the faint hope that perhaps some god somewhere might hear him his throat constricted terribly with the weight of intolerable grief and pain on his shoulders he slowly raised his head as his eyes fell on the door through which zhaneel had departed his mind unfroze gradually coming out of its shock what am i what am i thinking i may be old now but i am still a legend to these people heroes dont ever live as long as they want to and most die young ive lasted thats all experience im a mage and more skilled than when i was youngerand if im not the fighter i used to be im also a lot smarter than i used to be and what im feeling iknow what it is i know it was what urtho felt every time i left every time one of his gryphons wound up missing i loved him so dearly and i breathe each breath honoring his memory but he was a great man because he accepted his entire being and dealt with it i am not urtho but i am his son in spirit and what i honor i can also emulate theres plenty i can do starting with seeing to it that snowstar hasnt overlooked anything he shook himself all over as if he was shaking off some dark cold shadow that was unpleasantly clinging to his back and strode out of the council hall as fast as his legs would carry him what i honor in urthos deeds others have also honored in me urtho could embrace every facet of a situation and handle all of them with all of his intellect whether it angered him personally or not that was why he was a leader and not a panicked target he could act when others would be overwhelmed by emotion if i think of this disappearance in terms only of how i feel about it then i will miss details that could be critical while i fill my vision with myself and that could cost lives let the historians argue over whether i was enraged or determined or panicked on this day i can still be effective to my last breath it was not clear at first where the adept had run off to and by the time skan tracked him down snowstar had managed to gather all of the most powerful mages together in his own dwelling and workshop skan was impressed in spite of himself at how quickly the kaledain mage had moved it was notoriously difficult to organize mages but snowstar seemed to have accomplished the task in a very limited amount of time there were seven mages at work including snowstar they had been divided into pairs seated at individual tables so that they didnt interfere with each other each pair of them scrying for something in particular one pair looked for the teleson one for the tent one for the basket snowstar was working by himself but the moment that skan came near him he looked up and beckoned im looking for tadrith myself he said without preamble i was waiting for you to help me the bloodtie he has with you is going to make it possible to find him if its at all possible you will both feel similar magically as you know if skan said growing cold all over is he saying that he thinks tad isdead you mean you feel he is already dead snowstar made a soothing gesture no actually i dont even if tadrith was unconscious or worse wed still find him under normal circumstances the problem is that im fairly certain that theyre quite out of our range the whitehaired kaledain adept shook his head but fairly isnt completely and under the impetus of powerful emotions people have been known to do extraordinary things before this as you should know better than any of us im more than willing to try if you are skan grunted in extreme irritation but reined it in stupid question snowstar id try until i fell over snowstar grimaced i know it was a stupid question forgive me fortunately that wont matter to the spell or the stone he gestured at a small table and the halfdome of volcanic glass atop it would you skan took his place opposite the chair behind the table hed done scrying himself before once or twice but always with another mage and never with snowstar each mage had his own chosen vehicle for scrying but most used either a clear or black stone or a mirror he put his foreclaws up on the table surrounding his half of the stone with them snowstar placed his own hands on the table touching fingertip to talontip with skan after that it was a matter of skan concentrating on his son and supplying mageenergy to snowstar while snowstar created and loosed the actual spell some mages had a visual component to this work but snowstar didnt it took someone who was not only able to see mageenergy but one who was sensitive to its movementlike a gryphonto sense what he was doing skan felt the energy gathering all around them and condensing into the form of the spell like a warm wind encircling them and then cooling he felt it strain and tug at the restraints snowstar held on it and he felt snowstar finally let it go thennothing it leaped outand dissipated it wasnt gone as if it had gone off to look for something it was gone as if it had stretched itself out so thin that a mere breeze had made it fragment into a million uncoordinated bits snowstar jerked as if a string holding him upright had snapped then sagged down his hands clutching the stone damn he swore softly as harsh an oath as skan had ever heard him give voice to its no good its just too far skan sagged himself his throat locked up in grief his chest so tight it was hard to take a breath tad a few moments later the others had all uttered the same words in the same tones of anger and defeat all except the pair trying to reach the teleson they simply looked baffled and defeated and they hadnt said anything finally snowstar stopped waiting for them to speak up for themselves and went over to them well he said as skan followed on his heels skan knew both of them one was a young kaledain called redoak the other a mercenary mage from urthos following named gielle the latter was an uncannily lucky fellow he had been a mere journeyman at the beginning of the magestorms following the cataclysm but when they were over he was an adept he was more than a bit bewildered by the transition but had handled it gracefullyfar more gracefully than some would have i cant explain it sir he said obviously working to suppress an automatic reaction to authority of snapping to attention and saluting when i couldnt reach tadriths device i tried others just to make certain that there wasnt something wrong with me ive been able to call up every teleson weve ever created including the one out there with the patrol looking for the missing silvers i got the one we left with the garrison at khimbata which is farther away than tadrith is i got all of themexcept the one we sent out with tadrith and silverblade its he shook his head its just gone its as if it was never there it hasnt even been retuned or broken that would leave a telltale ive been working with telesons most of my life as a mage and ive only seen something like this happen once before was that during the wars snowstar asked instantly gielle nodded yes sir and it was just a freak accident something youd have to have been an adept to pull off though some senile old fart who should never have been put in charge of anything was given an unfamiliar teleson to recharge and reversed the whole spell basically he sucked all the magic out of it made it just so much unmagical junk gielle shrugged the only reason he could do that was because he was an adept senile but still an adept we make those telesons foolproof for a good reason tadrith couldnt have done that even by accident and a thousand tries a day and even if someone actually smashed the teleson id still be able to activate it and get a damaged echoback if it had been shattered by spell the telltale would still mark the area magically i dont know what to think about this snowstar pursed his lips his forehead creasing as he frowned neither do i this is very peculiar skan looked from one mage to the other and back again he caught redoaks eye the kaledain just held up his hands in a gesture of puzzlement the signature of an adept is fairly obvious redoak said slowly all adepts have a distinctive style to even a moderatelytrained eye urthos was his ability to make enchantments undetectablehis mark was that there was no mark but as far as i know he could only veil spells he himself had crafted the haighlei would have seen something like this situation i wager by now an adept usually doesnt refrain from doing magic any time he can especially not one of the old neutrals they were positively flamboyant about it that was one of the quarrels that urtho had with them i have an idea snowstar finally said listen all of you ill need all your help on this were going to do something very primitive much more primitive than scrying he looked around the room redoak you and gielle and joffer put all the small worktables together ridesalone you know where my shaman implements are go get them lora greenwing come with me he looked at skan you go to the silvers headquarters and get me the biggest map of the area the children were headed into that you can find or bully out of them they might give me an argument you they wont dare theyd lose a limb skan growled and he went straight for the door he did his best not to stagger he hadnt used that much mageenergy in a long time and it took more out of him than he had expected all right gryphon remember what you told yourself earlier you have experience you may fall on your beak from fatigue and tear something trying to fly in and save the day but you have experience rely on experience when your resources are low and rely on others when you cannot when you want to vain gryphon work smarter think use what you have and dont break yourself stupid gryphon because you are running out of spare parts he saw to his surprise that it was already dark outside he hadnt realized that he had spent so long with the mages trying to find the children no wonder he was tired and a bit weak the silvers headquarters was lit up as if they were holding high festival inside which made him feel a bit more placated at least they were doing something taking this seriously now too bad snowstar had to convince them there was a threat to their own hides before they were willing to move they should have just moved on it wasnt that the way we operated in the old days he barged in the front door readied a foreclaw and grabbed the first person wearing a silver gryphon badge that he saw explaining what he wanted in a tone that implied he would macerate anyone who denied it to him the young human did not even make a token protest as the talons caught in his tunic and the huge beak came dangerously near his face sstay here ssir he stammered backing up as soon as skan let go of him ill ffind what you wwant and bbring it right here somehow tonight skan had the feeling that he was not beloved where ere he went that was fine in his current black mood he would much rather be feared than beloved people have been thinking of me as the jolly old fraud the uncle who gives all the children pony rides he thought grating his beak his talons scoring the floor as he seethed they forgot what i was forgot the warrior who used to tear makaar apart with his bare talons well tonight they were getting a reminder the boy came back very quickly with the rolledup map skan unrolled it just long enough to make certain that they werent trying to fob something useless off on him to make him go away then gruffly thanked the boy and launched himself out the door despite the darkness he flew back with his prize when he marched through snowstars door he saw at once that the workroom had already been transformed everything not needed for the task at hand had been cleared away against the wall other projects had been piled atop one another with no thought for coherence it was going to take days to put the workroom back into some semblance of order but skan doubted that snowstar was going to be thinking about anything but blade and tad until they were found at least we have one friend who took all this seriously without having to be persuaded the several small tables were now one large one waiting for the map he held in his beak the moment he showed his face at the door eager hands tooksnatchedthe map away from him and spread it out on the table redoak lit a pungent incense filling the room with smoke that just stopped short of being eyewatering the mage that snowstar had called ridesalone who came from one of the many odd tribes that urtho had won to his cause had a drum in his hands evidently he was going to be playing it duringwhatever it was they were going to do right snowstar stood over the table the only one who was standing and held a long chain terminating in a teardropshaped roughpolished piece of some dark stone redoak you watch what the pendulum does and mark what i told you out on the map ridesalone give me a heartbeat rhythm the rest of you concentrate ill need your combined energies along with anything else i can pull up out of the local node skan that goes for you too come sit opposite me but dont think of tad or blade think of me got that he was not about to argue this looked rather like one of those bizarre shamanistic rituals that urtho used to try now and again when classical spellcasting failed he simply did as he was told watching as snowstar carefully suspended the pendulum over the map at the location where the youngsters had last been heard from ridesalone began a steady drum pattern hypnotic without inducing slumber somehow it enhanced concentration how that was managed skan could not begin to imagine for a long time nothing happened the stone remained quite steady and skan was afraid that whatever snowstar had planned wasnt working after all but snowstar remained impassive and little by little he began to move the pendulum along a route going north and east of the point of the youngsters last camp and abruptly without any warning at all the pendulum did move it swung violently and abruptly away from the spot snowstar had been trying to move it toward and in total defiance of gravity it hung at an angle as if it were being repelled by something there snowstar gave a grunt although skan could not tell if it was satisfaction or not and redoak made a mark on the map with a stick of charcoal snowstar moved his hand a trifle the pendulum came back down as if it had never exhibited its bizarre behavior snowstar moved it again a little at a time and once again came to a point where the pendulum repeated its action the strange scene was repeated over and over as redoak kept marking places on the map and snowstar moved the pendulum back it took uncounted drumbeats and sweat was pouring down the faces of every mage around the table when snowstar finally dropped the pendulum and signaled to ridesalone to stop drumming there was an irregular area marked out in charcoal dots on the map an area that the pendulum avoided and which the youngsters flight would have bisected redoak connected the dots outlining a weirdlyshaped blotch i would lay odds that they are in there somewhere snowstar said wearily its an area in which there is no magic no magic and no magical energy whatever is given off in the normal course of things by animals and plants is immediately lost somehow and i suspect magic brought into that area is drained away as well i can only guess that is what happened to their basket when they flew over it so the basket became heavier and they couldnt fly with it redoak hazarded and whistled when snowstar nodded thats not good but how did you know what to use to find all this snowstar shrugged modestly it was gielle that gave me the idea to look for a negative and i remembered shamanic dowsing you can look for something that is there like metal or something that is not there like water urtho taught it to me we used to use it to make certain that we werent planting our outposts atop unstable ground he looked across the table at skan who was trying very hard to tell himself that it wasnt likely for all the magic infused into the basket to drain off at once he did not want to think about what that would have meant for poor tadrith if the basket regained its normal weight in a single moment while aflight take that map with you and tell judeth what weve found the adept told skan ill work with the mages im sending out with the search teams theres probably something about the area itself that we can shield against i doubt that a mage caused this it might just be a freak of nature and the haighlei would never have seen it because they were looking for magic not for its absence skan nodded and redoak brushed a quickdrying varnish on the map to set the charcoal the fumes warred unpleasantly with the lingering scent of the incense but the moment the map was dry the younger mage rolled it up and handed it to the black gryphon skan did not wait around to see what the rest of the mages were going to do he took the map and fled out the door for the second time that evening this time he went straight to the planning roomwhich judeth still referred to as the war room out of habit and it looked very much as if they were planning for a wartime situation judeth had a map spread out over the table there were aides darting everywhere aubri was up on his hindquarters tracing out a line with one talon when skan came in through the door snowstar thinks he has a general area skan said as silence descended and all heads but judeths swiveled around at his entrance thats what he wanted the map for here he handed the map to the nearest aide who spread it out on the table over the existing one at judeths nod whats that she asked pointing atthe blobby outline on the map its an area where there isnt magic skan replied he repeated what snowstar had told him without the details about shamanic dowsing that would be why we cant raise the teleson snowstar thinks that anything thats magical gets all the mageenergy sucked out of it when it enters that area and if the spell making the basket into something tad could tow lost its power judeth sucked in her lower lip as one of the aides coughed well no matter how they landed theyre stuck now no teleson no magictheyd have to hole up and hope for rescue aubri studied the map for a moment the only teams weve sent out there were gryphon pairs with one exception he pointed out you and me judeth we used a basket and our flight path took us over that area nothing happened to us so where did this come from maybe its been growing offered one of the aides maybe the more it eats the bigger it grows well thats certainly cheerful judeth said dryly and patted the girl on the shoulder when she flushed a painful red no you have a point and were going to have to find out whats causing this if youre right if its growing sooner or later its going to reach us i did without working magic long enough and im not in the mood to do it again thats a lot of area to cover aubri pointed out they could be anywhere in there depending on how far they got before they had to land land or crash skans imagination was all too clever at providing him with an image of the basket plummeting down out of the sky we can probably cover it with four teams including a base camp judeth said at last but i think were going to have to do a ground search in a sweep pattern those trees are bigger than anything most of us here have ever seen before and you could drop urthos tower in there and not see most of it gryphons may not do us a lot of good they can look for signal smoke aubri objected judeth did not say anything but skan knew what she was thinking since it was something that he was already trying not to think about the youngsters might be too badly hurt to put up a signal fire right then the two already in the area can look for signal smoke she said ill fly in a mage here to set up a matchgate terminus and ill call for volunteers for four teams who are willing to trust their hides to a gate i shall go said a deep voice from the doorway skan swiveled his head as ikala moved silently into the room with all respect commander i must go i know this forest your people do not forget my rank and my breeding my father would say that you should in a case like this these two are my friends and my sworn comrades and it is my honor and duty to help them you are more than welcome then im going you can count on it skan said instantly drake will probably want to go too judeth thatll give you one mage and a fieldhealer along with a fighter judeth sighed but made no objections probably because she knew they would be futile all right but these are going to be big teams i dont want tiny little patrols running around in unknown territory i want two mages so you have one for each night watch on each team and i want at least as many fighters ikala you go call for volunteers among the hunters and the silvers skan go back to snowstar and explain the situation and what we need she glared at both of them dont just stand there go skan went but he was a fraction slower than ikala and reached the door in second place by the time he was outside ikala was nowhere in sight but he was overjoyed that ikala was still willing to volunteer even with the need to trust to a gate for transport the young haighlei was precisely what they needed someone who knew the ordinary hazards of such a forest and how to meet them snowstar had already anticipated judeths decision about a gate as if any of us would be afraid to trust our own gates he replied scornfully weve been perfectly willing to use them for the last five years its been the rest of you who were so overly cautious about them not me skan protested but snowstar was already on to other things gielle will fly out with a gryphon as soon as its light ill have redoak head one of the other three teams after you all get through the gate the adept was saying i have more mages willing to volunteer than judeth needs but not all of them are suited to this kind of mission tell her ill be choosing combat experience over sheer power we cant take the chance that this dead zone is a freak of nature no matter what she thinks it might have a traceable cause and that cause might be one of the mages who escaped the wars skan nodded he was certain that judeth had already thought of that ill go find drake he said it was going to be a long night and one he was certain none of them would be able to sleep through they might as well start getting ready for deployment at least that was something useful aging and hedonistic you may be stupid gryphon but youre also effective eight amberdrake did not sleep that night despite the feeling that he was working at a fever pitch he got precious little accomplished most of what he did was to go over the same scenarios in his mind on paper in fevered conversation with whoever would listenusually the longsuffering gesten but no matter how tired he became the weariness was never enough to overcome him not even for a moment insomnia was only one of the physical effects he suffered he simply could not be still he would sit or lie down only to leap to his feet again as another urgent thought struck him the muscles of his neck and back were so tense that no amount of soaking would relax himnot that he stayed long enough in a hot pool to do any good he had not eaten since the news his throat was too tight to swallow his stomach a tight cold knot and as for his nervesif hed had a client as wrought up as he was he would have recommended immediate tranquilization by a healer but if he had submitted himself to a healer he would be in no condition to accomplish anything thereafter he could not do that amberdrake recalled zhaneels words of so long ago as if they were an annoyance who heals the healer skan and snowstar had not commandeered all of the mages in the citythere was always one whose sole duty was to oversee magical communications those communications were between both white gryphon and the silvers posted outside the cityin shalamans bodyguard for instanceand with shalaman himself via his priests there could be no speaking with shalaman directly of course there was no such thing in haighlei society as a dirept link to anyone important the messages would have to go through the priests who were the only people permitted the use of magic then to shalamans chief priest leyuet and only then to shalaman amberdrake tracked down the mage in question and had him send his own personal plea for help to the haighlei in addition to skansbut after that he was at loose ends there was only so much he could do he was no mage he could not possibly help skan in trying to locate the children he could pack and did for a trek across rough primitive country but that did not exactly take much time even with gesten coming along behind him and repacking it more efficiently he certainly couldnt do anything to help the rescue parties of silvers that judeth and aubri were organizing even if he could have it might only have made things worse he suspected that after his threats overt and covert judeth would not appreciate seeing his face just now aubri would be more forgiving but judeth had lived long under the comfortable delusion that she no longer had to cope with the vagaries of politics as with most true military leaders she had always hated politics even while she used political games to further her own causes she had thought that without a king a court or a single titular leader among them she was at last free to do what she wanted with a policing branch she tried to keep the silvers autonomous from the governing branch and that was largely what she had accomplished now amberdrake had made it very clear to her that there was no such thing as an environment that was free of politics that under duress even friends would muster any and all weapons at their disposal and she had just learned in the harshest possible way that no one is ever free of the politics and machinations that arise when people live together as a group no one likes to have their illusions shattered least of all someone who holds so few judeth would be very difficult to live with for some time he only hoped that her good sense would overcome her anger with him and that she would see and understand his point of view hopefully judeth would see amberdrake as having used a longwithheld weapon at a strategic time rather than seeing him as a friend who betrayed an unspoken trust to get what he wanted if nothe had made an enemy and there was nothing he could do about that now nor if hed had the chance to reverse time and go back to that moment of threat would he have unsaid a single word he had meant every bit of it and judeth had better get used to the idea that peopleeven the senior kestrachernwould do anything to protect their children that was one thing she had never had to deal with as a military commander before because a military structure allowed replacement or reassignment of possible mutineers parental protectiveness was a factor that was going to be increasingly important as the children of the original settlers of white gryphon entered the silvers perhaps it was for the best that the precedent had been set in this way and no matter what happens knowing myself i will have simultaneous feelings of justification as a concerned and desperate parent as well as guilt over not having done better and had more forethought so there was nothing more he could do really except to wait wait for morning wait for word from shalaman and from the mages wait wait wait just as it was when he had served in urthos ranks waiting was the hardest job he had ever held he had been in control of at least part of the life of this city for so long that like judeth he had gotten accustomed to being able to fix problems as soon as they arose without anyone offering opposing force now as the number of emergencies died down and new people came into authority his control was gone all of his old positions of influence were in the hands of others and he was back to the old game of waiting finally he returned home since it was the first place where anyone with news would look for him as he paced the walkway outside the house unable to enter the place that now seemed too confining and held far too many memories of his lost daughter his mind circled endlessly without ever coming up with anything new only the circling anger and fear fear and anger anger at himself at judeth at bladeit wasnt productive but it was inevitable and anger kept his imagination at bay it was all too easy to imagine blade hurt blade helpless blade menaced by predatory animals or more nebulous enemies and once again he would be one of the last to know what others had long since uncovered he was only blades father as he had only been a kestrachern yet hanging about in the hope that someone would take pity on him and tell him something was an exercise in futility so he alternately paced and sat staring out into the darkness listening to the roar of the waves beneath him in the light falling gently down onto the harbor from the city the foam on the top of the waves glowed as if it was faintly luminescent a wooden windchime swung in the evening breeze to his right and a glass one sang softly to his left how often had he sat here on a summer evening listening to those chimes caught between glass and wood that which breaks and that which bends that which sings and that which survives so our lives go winterhart joined him long after the moon had come out he turned at her familiar footstep to see her approaching from the direction of the council hall the moonlight silvering her hair in the soft light there was no sign of her true age she could have been the trondiirn of urthos forces or the first ambassador to the haighlei so many years ago only when she drew close were the signs of anxiety and tension apparent in her face her eyes the set of her mouth theyre putting together the last of the supplies she said before he could ask skan and the mages havent come out of snowstars work area yet and shalaman hasnt replied dont worry he will before the night is over remember how long his court runs at night he did remember in the tropical heat of the climate around khimbata shalamans people all took long naps in the afternoon and then continued their court ceremonies entertainments and duties until well after midnight and he had no fear that shalaman would refuse help the emperor could send off a hundred hunters or more from his forces and they would never be missed no the only question was how soon the hunters could be somewhere that they could do some good first the priests would have to approve the departure then they would have to travel across many leagues of forest before they were anywhere near the place where the children had vanished all that would take time precious time blindly he held out his arms and winterhart came into them they held each other seeking comfort in one anothers warmth and presence there was no point in talking they would only echo one another each saying what the other was thinking they both knew that and knew that talking would ease nothing soothe nothing so they simply sat down on the smooth cool stone bench outside their home and held each other and waited beneath the stars neither of them were strangers to waiting that did not make waiting any easierexcept that it removed the additional pain of loneliness judeth must have gotten over her own anger by dawn for she showed no signs of it when a messenger summoned both amberdrake and winterhart to what the young silver called a planning session the two of them had bathed and changed clothing hoping that clean bodies would restore their minds a little amberdrake had shunned his usual finery in favor of something very like winterharts practical working garb hoping that there might possibly be something he could do once the sun rose when the summons came both of them had been sitting over a breakfast neither of them had been able to touch and it was a relief to rise and follow the youngster back to the council hall skan and zhaneel and their other son keenath were already there showing just as much strain as amberdrake felt although only someone who knew gryphons well would have recognized the signs of strain in overpreened feathers plumage lying flat against the body posture that showed their muscles were as tense and knotted as amberdrakes he doubted that they had slept but the sight of keenath made a moment of intense anger flash through amberdrakes heart he still has a child and if his other had not been so intent on leaving the city mine might not have gone either but that was irrational and entirely incorrect and he knew it he suppressed it immediately and he and winterhart maneuvered through the group crowded in here so that they could form a united block with the other set of parents judeth did not look as if she had slept either deep shadows touched the swollen pouches under her eyes and she looked twice her real age aubri didnt even pretend to be calm he chewed incessantly on one of his old shed feathers presumably to keep from shredding his current plumage there were thirty or forty people in the group amberdrake noticed that at least six of them were mages and he winterhart skan keenath and zhaneel were the only nonsilvers ikala was among the silvers gathered here and amberdrake was irrationally pleased to see him as if the tall young man represented more than just a local expert on the rain forest the council hall was the only room large enough to hold all of them and judeth had completely taken it over strewing maps and other documents all over the table it looked as if she had been here for some time snowstar and the mages have uncovered something damned peculiar she said when they had all gathered around the mapcovered table she tapped a darkened irregularly shaped blob on the map in front of her this area here has no signs of magic none and they tell me thats practically impossible the missing patrol was due to pass along this line she drew a swift mark with a piece of charcoal which crossed the southern end of the irregularshaped area and if theres something in there thats negating mageenergy you can imagine for yourself what that would mean for both their carrybasket and their teleson amberdrake was all too able to imagine what that would do to a carrybasket and from the way winterhart suddenly clutched his arm her fingers digging into the muscle so was she in his mind he saw the two figures he had watched fly off into the distance suddenly stricken for a moment then plummeting to their deaths on the unforgiving ground below that means were going to have to come in somewhere near the edge and walk in judeth continued without any hint that she had envisioned the same disaster that had played itself out behind amberdrake s eyes our gate probably wont work inside this area and well have to suppose for now that nothing else magical in nature will work either well have to operate by the old rules of working without magic although yes we will be taking mages just in case magic does work after all thoughif theres no local magepower available snowstar tells me that the mages will be just like journeymen and apprentices and limited to their own personal power thats going to put a serious crimp in their activities and any mages that go along had better start thinking in terms of budgeting themselves before they act she leveled a sharp glance across the table to the point where the mages of the silvers had bunched together what about the gryphons someone wanted to know cant they just fly overhead and scout the way they always do she closed her eyes for a moment and sighed if i wanted a sign that our luck has turned truly wretched i could not have conjured up one more certain this is the rainy season for that part of the worldand the weathermages tell me that storms will be unceasing over this particular area for the next several days to a week thunderstorms have already grounded the original pair that was out looking for our missing silvers they are on the ground and we know where they are it might well be a side effect of the loss of magic over the area we just dont know for certain but what that means is that there wont be any flying going on im not going to ban any gryphons from the searchparties but theyll be strictly on foot unless the weather improves drastically im still going and so are zhaneel and keeth skan spoke up firmly judeth nodded as if she had expected as much in that case since im going to divide the searchers into three parties each gryphon can go with one ive already sent out a gryphon with a gatemage but hell be coming straight back and so will the two still out there while weather cooperates judeth cocked an eyebrow at skan as if she expected him to object to this but he didnt amberdrake could certainly understand why a gryphon on the ground was severely handicapped skan zhaneel and keenath would be as much a hindrance as they were a help the two who had been on patrol would be exhausted and the one who had ferried the gatemage even more so judeth continued now heres the current plan well gate in herethats the closest i want to get to this area with anything that depends upon magic she stabbed down with her index finger here the point where her finger indicated was on the line that blade and tad had been expected to fly the gatemage and a small party will stay here at a base camp holding the area for the rest of you well divide up the party with skan and drake in it will go north up to the top of the area and then in the one with ikala leading it including keenath will go straight in the one with winterhart and zhaneel will go south then in that way well cover the maximum area in the shortest possible time judeth straightened and looked straight at skan again and in case youre wondering why i havent put you two in on the expected line its because the two gryphons out there already flew that line and didnt see anything before weather forced them down so either the missing patrol didnt fly that line or its going to take an expert in that kind of territory to find signs of them thats ikala not you hell be leading a party of people all used to moving quickly and after he scouts the line on the ground hell be covering the areas north and south of that line im putting you two on the likeliest alternate track tad always had a tendency in training to stay on the northern side of a given flight line my guess is if theyre anywhere off the line its in the north but thats just a guess skan stated they could be south she nodded and the gods know ive guessed wrong before thats why the third party the parties are going to number eight one gryphon one healer or trondiirn or whatever comes closethats you draketwo mages and five fighters all experienced silvers any smaller is dangerous any larger is unwieldy dont bother to pack at all youll be taking standard silver kits including medical supplies and you arent going to have time to change clothing besides by the time you make a camp at night you and your clothing should be sluiced clean her stare at amberdrake said as clearly as words and if you dont like that you dont have to go he stared right back at her try and keep me from going and youii have a fight she waited for him to say something staring into his gaze with challenge in her stance but it was she who finally dropped her eyes this is an inandout mission the faster the better as of this moment consider yourself facing a real enemy a powerful one if he can drain all the mageenergy out of a place i dont know whats caused magic to leach out of that area but i have to assume its a hostile and it isnt going to like having twentyfour people traipsing all over its territory as soon as the mage gets to the gatepoint well be bringing it up and i dont want it up for longer than it takes to pitch all of you through it is that understood once again she stared at him as if her words were meant for him alone her tone of voice implied that given the opportunity she would pitch amberdrake through the gate he simply nodded as did everyone else good from now until you leave you are all sleeping eating and everything else right here she smiled thinly at their surprise thatll be quicker than trying to gather all of you up once the mage gets into place i dont intend to waste a single minute on any dallying ill have sleeping arrangements brought in the mage i sent out is being carried by darzie so i expect to hear that theyve made their landing within the next full day amberdrake was impressed as much by the identity of the gryphon as by the speed with which the duo expected to reach their destination he wondered what judeth had promised to get darzie to fly a carrybasket at all much less try to do so breaking a record and in bad weather darzie was not a silver he was one of a new class of gryphons who were primarily athletes whether as acrobats fast couriers or actual racers these gryphons earned a very fine even luxurious living by serving the haighlei appetite for speed and spectacle darzie was the best of the fast couriers and one of the fastest racershe was a more consistent flyer than gryphons who actually clocked the occasional faster time it was hard to imagine what hold judeth could have over him to induce him to risk injury and strain in this way but maybe he was being uncharitable maybe darzie had actually volunteered not without blackmail it didnt matter so long as judeth had gotten him whether it was through bribery or blackmail or a combination of both maybe shes following my example the gods know she has enough power of her own to leverage just about anyone in this city into doing her bidding at least once any questions judeth asked and looked around the room no right fall out and for those of you who havent slept im calling tamsin in to make you sleep there was no doubt who she was targeting with the daggers of her gaze and both amberdrake and skan flinched but she wasnt finished that includes me we wont be any good to anyone if we arent rested when the call comes right drake her question came as a surprise and he was doubly surprised to sense the compassion and sympathyand worry of her ownbehind the words it penetrated even his defensiveness ah right he admitted sheepishly relaxing just a trifle so she does understand and shes forgiven us he had not hoped for it so soon but he welcomed it as a tiny bright spot of hope in the midst of too much grief good glad you agree because youre going to be one of the first to go to sleep a commotion at the door proved to be bedding food and tamsin all arriving simultaneously now stand down all of you and get yourselves taken care of ill be watching to see that you do and she did standing over them all like a slavemaster to see that every member of the three search parties ate drank and submitted to tamsins touch as judeth had warned amberdrake was one of the first and after one look at judeths expression he knew better than to protest so he crammed down a few mouthfuls of food as dry and tasteless as paper drank what was given him and laid himself down on a standard militarystyle sleeping roll he closed his eyes as tamsin leaned over him and that was the last thing he knew until the rallycall awakened him rain why did it have to be rain even snakes would be better skandranon tried to keep his thoughts on his purely physical discomfort but try as he might he couldnt his skin crawled and the rain had nothing to do with it if skans feathers hadnt been plastered flat to his body theyd have been standing up in instinctive alarm he did not like this place and his dislike was not connected in any way whatsoever with the miserable weather it could have been that this bizarre claustrophobic forest had swallowed blade and tad without a trace but that wasnt the reason his soggy hackles were trying to rise either the other mage of the party felt the same and if there had been any choice in the matter hed have gone back to the base camp because it just plain felt wrong here the two of them after some discussion last night before the human took the first sleep shift had decided that the problem was that lack of mageenergy in this place presumably an apprenticelevel mage or journeyman would not be affected in this way they were not used to sensing and using energies outside themselves unless those energies were fed to them by a mage of greater ability but a master as skan and the human silver filix were was as accustomed to the allpervasive currents of mageenergy as a gryphon was to the currents of the air skan could not remember a time in his adult life that he had not been aware of those currents even when the magestorms had caused such disruptions in magic the energy had never vanished it just hadnt worked or felt quite the same but having no mageenergy aboutit felt wrong very wrong it had him disoriented and offbalance constantly looking for something that simply wasnt there it feels as if ive suddenly lost a sense something subtle like smell nevertheless a quick trial had proved to his satisfaction that magic still worked here and furthermore those magical items that they had brought in with them were still empowered further checks proved that at the moment at least there was no ongoing drain of mageenergy the power that built up in any area naturally was slowly rising back up so whatever was wrong in this forest whatever had caused this anomaly it had not completely negated magic just removed it whether that drainage had been gradual or all at once was anyones guess and there must be something coming along to drain mageenergy again as it built up or there would be some areas that had at least a little power available as for what that could be he had no idea he did not care to think about what must have happened if the basket had also had all of its empowering mageenergy drainedall at once skandranon mentally worked on a few new phrases to use when he finally complained about it all to someone whom he could corral into listening sympathetically he had a reputation forcolorfullanguage to maintain after all he would much rather concentrate on that than how miserable his soggy feathers felt how cold he was how sore his muscles were after two days of walking that was something he simply hadnt considered and it was galling to realize that drake was in better physical shape than he was drake had been climbing the stairs and ladders of white gryphon for almost twenty years he had only been flying he could not think of more than a handful of times that he had actually climbed up rather than down and none of those times had been in the last three years at least keeth had been working out on the obstacle course lately and winterhart had made certain that all muscles were exercised poor zhaneel must be as miserable as he but she has the best trondiirn in the city to tend her keeth is a trondiirn ionly have drake who does his best but still hes preoccupied rain dripped into his nares and he sneezed to clear them shaking his head fiercely he and drake were at the rear of the party with his keener sense of hearing than the humans possessed it seemed a good idea to have him at the back where he might be able to detect something following them now he wished he had thought to ask judeth for a couple of kyree scouts for each party they would have been much more effective than any of the humans rain poured down out of the sky as it had since the fog lifted that morning this was a truly lovely climate fog from before dawn to just after followed by rain until well past darkness followed by damp chill until the fog came again in the morning judeth had been absolutely right in grounding them and he would have grounded himself once he saw the weather there was no way for a gryphon to fly safely in this muck even if he could get his wings dry long enough to take off darzie had managed to bring his mage in safely only because he was insanely selfconfident and lucky enough for four gryphons and because the weather changed abruptly to something more like a normal rainy season outside of the nomagic area that and darzie is young enough to think hes immortal and good enough to fly as if he were like another stupid stupid gryphon i used to know in spite of the fact that the rainy season was normal back at the basecamp normal still meant a raging thunderstorm every afternoon darzie had flown and landed in one of those thunderstorms blithely asserting that it was all a matter of timing and watching where the bolts hit his passenger had been whitelipped but remarkably reticent about discussing the flight drake had found out what had tempted darzie into making the trip a challenge judeth had asked the young gryphon if he knew of anyone who might be persuaded and had hinted broadly that she didnt think he could do it that had been enough for darzie who had insisted that he and only he could manage the trip and he had in recordbreaking time and without damaging himself or his passenger for sheer speed audacity and insane courage that flight had surpassed even some of the black gryphons legendary accomplishments some but not all darzie will just have to take his own time to become a legend and if he is wise he will do it in his own way and not try to emulate me i think that my life must have used up the luck of twenty gryphons skan the basecamp crew and the other twentythree rescuers had piled through the gate in a recordsetting time of their own although no people had been pitched through all the supplies had been hurled in a mass by a small army of judeths support crew not even during a resupply had skan ever seen a gate go up and down again so quickly darzie flew home to receive his justlyearned accolades and the admiration of every unattached female in the city the results of that would likely be more exhausting for him than the great deed itself the gatemage and his helpers and guards remained to set up a base camp the rest of them had shouldered packs and moved out under the beginnings of a rainstorm no one had told them however that they were going to have to climb down a cliff to get into the forest where the children were lost the three gryphons had shaken themselves dry and flown themselves down but the humans had been forced to get to the bottom the hard way that experience in a worsening thunderstorm had been exciting enough to age even the most hardened veteran in the lot absolutely everything they touched was slippery either with mud water or substances they were probably better off not knowing about once at the bottom the three parties had formed up and gone their separate waysand skan had been amazed at how quickly the forest had swallowed the other two search parties in an amazingly short period of time he couldnt even hear the faintest sound of the others only the steady drumming of the rain and the whistles chirps and calls of creatures up in the tops of the trees each day had been much like the one before it only the navigator knew for certain that they were going in the right direction and not in circles the only time that skan was ever dry was just before he slept the moment he poked his beak out of the tent he shared with drake and the other mage he was wet either fog condensed on his feathers and soaked into them or he got soaked directly by the usual downpour just at the moment the downpour had him wet to the skin and he was depressed though he would have been depressed without the rain how can we ever hope to find any sign of them he asked himself staring up at the endless sea of dripping leaves and around at the dizzying procession of tree trunks on all sides tangled with vines or shrouded with brush there wasnt a sign of a game trail and as for game itselfwell hed had to feed himself by surprising some of the climbing creatures in the mornings while he could still fly they could be within shouting distance of us and we would never know it this forest was not only claustrophobic it was uncannily enveloping one of the fighters swore that he could actually see the plants growing and skan could find it in his heart to believe him how long would it take until vines and bushes covered anything left after a crash a few days a week it had been a week since the children went missing maybe more than a week he lost track of time in here and they could have been down for three or four days before that gloomy thoughts as gloomy as their surroundings and yet he could not give up as long as there was any chance however minuscule that they would find the children he would search on no matter what he had to know what had happened to them the uncertainty of not knowing was the worst part drake looked like skan felt the kestrachern was a grimfaced taciturn sodden muddy mess most of the time he spoke only when spoken to tended to the minor injuries of the party without being asked but offered nothing other than physical aid which was utterly unlike him he hiked with the rest of them or dealt with camp chores but it was obvious that his mind was not on what he was doing it was out there somewhere and skan wondered if drake was trying to use his limited empathic ability as a different kind of northneedle searching for the pole star of pain and distress hidden among the trunks and vines with the blood tie between himself and his daughter he should be especially sensitive to her if she were alive he might be able to find her where conventional methods were failing more power to him hes never tried using it that way but that doesnt mean it wont work skan only wished he had a similar ability he could exercise as it was he was mostly a beast of burden and otherwise not much help he couldnt track he couldnt use much magic without depleting himself and as for anything elsewell his other talents all involved flying and he could only fly for a short time in the mornings regin the leader in their party held up a hand halting them as he had done several times already that day there didnt seem to be any reason for this behavior and skan was getting tired of it why stop and stand in the rain for no cause the more ground they covered the better chance they had of finding something he nudged past filix and splashed his way up to the weatherbeaten silver judeth had placed in charge regin just what exactly are we waiting for he asked none too politely fortunately the man ignored the sarcastic tone of his voice and answered the question by pointing upward skan looked just in time to see their scout bern sliding down the trunk of a tree ahead of them with a speed that made skan wince berns been looking for breaks in the trees ahead regin said as bern made a hand signal and strode off into the trees we figure if the basket came down it had to make a hole that holell still be there he gets up into a tall tree and looks for holes all around especially if he can see theyre fresh you might not believe it with all these clouds around but if theres a break in the trees more light gets in and you can see it from high enough in the canopy thats what were waiting on bern reappeared a moment later and rejoined the party shaking his head skan didnt have to know the silvers signals to read that one no holes he and regin had a quick conference with the navigator and the scout headed back off into the forest on a new bearing the rest of the party followed in berns wake so far there had been no sign of anything following or watching them much less any attacks skan was beginning to think that judeths insistence on assuming there was a hostile entity in here was overreaction on her part there hadnt been any signs that anything lived in here but wild animals surely whatever had drained off all the mageenergy here must be a freak phenomenon maybe that was what had caught the two children skan dropped back to his former place beside amberdrake but with a feeling of a little more hope brought on by the knowledge that at least they werent totally without a guide or a plan drake still seemed sunk into himself but he revived a bit when skan returned and explained what the lead members were up to ive heard worse ideas he said thoughtfully wiping strands of sodden hair out of his eyes and blinking away the rain its not a gryphon eye view but its better than nothing once again the leader signaled a stop skan peered out and up through the curtains of rain but he couldnt see anything wherever the scout was this time not even skans excellent eyes could pick him out i have no idea how bern is managing to climb in this weather much less how hes doing it so quickly skan moved up a few feet and ducked around a tangle of vines but the view was no better from the new vantage he must be as limber as one of those little furry climbers that shalaman keeps at his palace as pets for all we know this sort of place is where those come from drake shrugged dismissively as if the subject held no interest for him i hoy skan looked up again startled and just caught sight of the tiny figure above waving frantically he seemed to be balanced on a thick tree limb and clung to the trunk with only one hand the other hand waved wildly and then pointed hoy the call came again fresh break that way fresh break the same thought occurred to all of them but the silvers were quicker to react than skan or drake they broke into a trot shoving their way through the vegetation leaving the other two to belatedly stumble along in their wake skans heart raced and not from the exertion he longed to gallop on ahead and probably would have except that it was all he could do to keep up with the silvers and much to his embarrassment just as he developed a sudden stitch in his side bern the scout who had been up in the tree burst through the underbrush behind them overtook them and plunged on to the head of the column showoff another shout echoed back through the trees muffled by the falling rain the words werent distinguishable but the tone said all skan needed to know there was excitement but no grief no shock theyve found something something and not someoneor worse bodies from some reserve he didnt know he had he dredged up more strength and speed and turned his trot into a series of leaps that carried him through the underbrush until he broke through into the clearing beneath the break in the trees he stumbled across the remains of a crude palisade of brush and onto clear ground a camp that was his first elated thought if the children had been able to build a camp they could not have been too badly hurt then he looked at the kind of camp it was and felt suddenly faint this was no orderly camp this was something patched together from the remains of wreckage and whatever could be scavenged regin looked up from his examination of the soggy remains of the basket as skan halted inside the periphery of the clearing they crashed here all right he pointed upward at the ragged gap in the canopy theyre gone now but they did hit here hard enough to smash two sides of the basket they both survived it though i cant guess how maybe there was enough in the way of branches on the way down to slow their fall the medical kits gone theres signs they both used it they were here they were hurt now theyre gone but why why arent they still here he asked speaking his bewilderment aloud now that is a good question regin poked through a confusion of articles that looked as if they had just been tossed there and left standard advice is to stay with your wrecked craft if you have an accident id guess they started to do that were here for maybe two days then something made them leave it looks to me as if they left in a hurry and yet i dont see any signs of a fight they could have been frightened away amberdrake ventured orwell this isnt a very good camp its a disaster of a camp thats what it is regin corrected bluntly but if all i had was wreckage and i was badly hurt i probably wouldnt have been able to do much better its shelter though and that isnt quite enough i wish i knew how much of their supplies got ruined and how much they took with them he straightened and looked around frowning theres no sign of a struggle but no sign of game around here either they might have run out of food and it would be hard to hunt if they were hurt theres no steady water source amberdrake coughed politely were under a steady watersource he pointed out regin just shrugged were taught not to count on rain sono game no water and an indefensible camp gryphons eat a lot if their supplies were all trashed theyd be good for about two days before they were garbage unfit to eat after that theyve got to find game for tadrith alone my guess is they stayed here just long enough to get back some strength and headed back in the direction of home theyre probably putting up signals now he grimaced i just hope their trail isnt too cold to followbut on the other hand if they headed directly west we should stay pretty much on their trail thats where id go back to the river its a lot easier to fish if youre hurt than to hunt skan groaned you mean we could have just followed the river and we probably would have found them regin grinned sourly thats exactly what i mean but look on the bright side now we know theyre alive and theyre probably all right skan nodded as regin signaled to bern to start hunting for a trail but as bern searched for signs skan couldnt help noticing a few things for one thing the piles of discarded material had a curiously ordereddisordered look about them as if they had been tossed everywhere then gathered up and crudely examined then sorted for another there were no messages notes or anything of the sort to give a direction to any rescuers granted the children might not have known whether anyone would find the camp but shouldnt they have left something and last of all there was no magic none at all left in any of the discarded equipment so the surmise had been correct something had drained all of the magic out of their gear and from the signs of the crash it had happened all at once and yet none of the searchparty gear had been affectedyet so what had done this in the first place what had sorted through the remains of the camp and what had made the children flee into the unknown and trackless forest without even leaving a sign for searchers to follow was the answer to the third question the same as the answer to the other two tad entered the cave sloshing through ankledeep water at the entrance carefully avoiding blades three fishing lines blade held up some of her catch neatly strung and he nodded appreciatively waters higher he told her in places it covers the trail here that was to be expected considering how much is falling out of the sky well blade said with resignation at least we have a steady water supply and we dont have to leave the cave to fish anymore it had not stopped raining for more than a few marks in the middle of the night ever since they had arrived here shed wondered what the rainy season would be like well now she knew the stream of water running down the middle of the cave had remained at about the same size only its pace had quickened the river had risen and now it was perfectly possible for them to throw lines into the river itself without going past the mouth of the cave with a reasonable expectation of catching something that was just as well since they were now under siege although they still had not seen their hunters clearly the flitting shadows espied in the undergrowth had made it very clear that there was no getting back across the river without confronting them tad nodded spreading his good wing to dry it in front of the fire he had gone out long enough to drag in every bit of driftwood he could find and there was now a sizable store of it in the cave hed also hauled in things that would make a thick black smoke and they had a second extremely nasty fire going now it stood just to one side of the stream at the rear of the cave putting a heavy smoke up the natural chimney whether or not there was anyone likely to see it was a good question this was not the kind of weather anything but a desperate or suicidal gryphon would fly in on the other handhow desperate would skandranon or tads twin be by now desperate enough to try blade both hoped so and hoped that they would have more sense their pursuers were getting bolder and she hadnt particularly wanted tad to go out this afternoon the stalkers were still nothing more than menacing shadows but she had seen them skulking through the underbrush on the other side of the river even by day yesterday and this morning i think they might try something tonight tad said far too casually i know i was being watched all the time and i just had that feeling as if there was something out there that was frustrated and losing patience i got the same feeling blade confessed she hadnt enjoyed taking her shields down and making a tentative try at assessing what lay beyond the river but it had felt necessary in part she had been hoping to sense a rescue party but the cold and very alien wave of frustrated anger that met her tentative probe had made her shut herself up behind her shields and sit there shivering for a moment itried using that empathic sense and i got the same impression you did they would like very much to get a chance at us she hoped that tad wouldnt make too big a fuss about that confession hed been at her often enough to use everything she had now shed finally given in to his urgings she was not in the mood for an i told you that was a good idea she wasnt certain that it was a good idea what if those things out there had been able to sense her just as she sensed them then again what would they learn that she was hurt and scared spitless of them they already knew that fortunately for him tad just nodded its good to know that its not just my own worry talking to me he said and sighed now i dont feel so badly about setting all those traps what she began at that moment one of her fishing lines went tight and she turned her attention to it long enough to haul in her catch but after rebaiting the hook and setting the line again she returned to the subject what other traps do you think would work she asked on our side of the river that is where could we set more thus far they hadnt had any luck with deadfalls like the one that had marked one of the shadows before it was as if having seen that particular sort of trap the hunters now knew how to avoid it large snares hadnt worked either but she hadnt really expected them to since there was no way to conceal them but perhaps now with water over the trail tripwires could be hidden under the water i tended to that during my walk earlier theres only one good place really he told her the rivers gotten so deep and fast that theres only one place where i think they might try to crossthats downstream past where we crossed it when we first got here i didnt set a trap right there thoughwhat i did was rig something thats harmless but looks just like the rockfall i rigged later on he gryphgrinned at his own cleverness and she could hardly blame him so theyll see the harmless decoy and then walk right into the rockfall he nodded looking very proud of himself its a good big one too if they actually try coming after us at least one of them is going to be seriously hurt or killed unless theyve got lightning reflexes and more luck than any one creature deserves to have just as long as you dont hurt someone coming to rescue us she warned yesterday she might have argued with him about the merits of setting something meant to kill rather than discouragebut that was before she had opened herself to the creatures across the river she still might not know what they looked like but now she knew what they were killers plainly and simply with a kind of cold intelligence about them that made her wish for one good bow two good arms and three dozen arrows she would debate the merits of permitting such creatures the free run of their own territory some other time and if they gave up and left her alone she would be perfectly happy to leave them alone but if they came after her or tad she would strike as efficiently and with the same deadly force as they would there was still the question of whether or not these creatures were the hunting pack of someone or something else she did not have the ability to read thoughts even if these creatures had anything like a thought but she hadnt sensed anything else out there with them all of the creatures had been of the same type with a definite feeling of pack about them which could simply mean that their master was off lounging about at his ease somewhere watching all of this in a scryingmirror that would certainly fit the profile of a sadistic adept she couldnt picture maar for instance subjecting himself to mud and pouring rain if that was so if there was an adept behind all this and she ever got her hands on him that wasnt the only trap i built tad continued proudly oblivious to her dark thoughts i have triptangles under the water that will throw them into the stream i balanced boulders to roll at a touch and trap feet and legs and i put up some more snares between all that and the rock barricade we have across the front of the cave i think we can feel a little safer just as long as we can continue fishing from in here she corrected and as long as you can stand to live on fish all i have to do is think about eating any more of that dried meat and fish takes on a whole new spectrum of delight he countered im learning to tell the difference between one fish and another raw some are sweeter one has more fat and they all taste the same to me fine i believe you she interrupted hastily listen i wonder if we could rig some kind of a net or something to haul in driftwood as it comes down over the falls theres a lot of stuff getting by us that we could really use there was nothing that tad liked better than trying to invent a new way to do something and the idea of a driftwoodnet kept him happily occupied for some time and more importantly it kept him restfully occupied no matter how cheerful and energetic he seemedor tried to appearhe was tired and so was she the everpresent roar of the falls would cover the sounds of anything approaching them and most especially would cover the sounds of anything bold enough to try swimming across the river at this point they both knew that and she suspected that he was staying halfawake even through her watch as she was staying through his not especially bright of either of them but neither of them were able to help themselves their imaginations supplied the creatures out there with every kind of supernatural attribute especially in the dark of the night it was easier to dismiss such fears by daylight except that she kept reminding herself that just because their hunters hadnt done something yet that didnt mean they werent capable of a particular action it was hard to strike a balance between seeing threats that didnt exist and not being wary enough especially when you didnt know everything the enemy could do not long until dark tad observed after a long discussion of nets and draglines and other ways of catching runaway driftwood he pointed his beak toward the river she nodded although it was difficult to keep track of time without the sun being visible the light did seem to be fading another one of her lines went taut this fish was a fighter which probably meant that it was one of the kinds tad liked best any fish seemed pretty tasteless to her wrapped in wet clay to bake and without any herbs to season it with shed thought about using some of the peppery leaves just to give her food some spice then thought better of the idea although they had not had any deleterious effect rubbed on the skin there was no telling if they were poisonous if eaten you could rub your skin all day with shadowberries and not get anything worse than a purple stain but eat a few and you would find yourself retching up your toenails she fought the fish to exhaustion and reeled it in hand over hand taking care not to tangle the line that was enough for tonight she pulled in the other lines and by the time she was done there was no doubt it was darker out on the river she took the fish back behind the rock barrier to the fire where tad still basked each day they added a few more rocks but they were rapidly approaching the point where they wouldnt be able to use river clay as mortar anymore it just wasnt strong enough there was another advantage to this cave no bugs enough smoke hung in the air from their signalfire to discourage insects of all sorts her bites had finally begun to heal and didnt bother her too much anymore in fact if it hadnt been for those watchers out there she would be feeling pretty pleased with the state of things they had fire excellent shelter and plenty to eat and sooner or later someone from white gryphon or even khimbata would see or smell the signalfire and they could go home and in the meantime while they were not comfortable they were secure she took one of the big sluggish bottom feeders from her string gutted it wrapped it in wet clay put it in the firepit and raked coals and ashes over it the rest she handed to tad as they were no longer as famished as he was when they first got here he ate them with gusto and if he lacked fine table manners she was not going to complain about the company ican think of worse people to be stranded with hows the wing she asked as she did at least once a day it doesnt hurt as much as it did yesterday but i still dont want to unwrap it he replied whenever i move in an unusual way it hurts in tadlanguage that meant it hurts enough that my knees buckle and i almost pass out she knew shed seen it happen tad was so stoic he tried very hard to be cheerful and it was likely for her benefit alone by moving very carefully she had managed to keep the same thing from happening to her but that meant a lot of restriction on her movement if only she had two good handsor he had two good wings if either of them could manage to get to the top of the cliff she was sure they could think of a way to bring the other up afterward up there they wouldnt have to worry about pursuit anymore if the hunters couldnt climb a tree they sure as stars couldnt climb a cliff might as well wish for three or four experienced silvers with longrange bows she thought grimly ihave the feeling that there is something about all of this that im missing completely something that should be obvious but isnt i just wish i had a clue to what it is do you really think theyre going to try something tonight she asked more to fill the silence than because she thought hed changed his mind for an answer he nodded toward the cave entrance rains slackening early the current isnt bad in that one wide shallow spot not that hard to wade across if youve got claws to hang onto the rock with and we already know they do have claws she wondered if she ought to try opening herself up to them a second time then decided against it they could be waiting for her to do exactly that silence fell between them again and she just didnt feel right about breaking it with small talk she checked her fish instead and found the clay rock hard that was a good indication that the fish inside was done so she went ahead raked it out of the coals and broke it open the skin and scales came away with the clay leaving the steaming white flesh ready to eat without all the labor of skinning or scaling she made fairly short work of it as usual it tasted likenot much of anything visceral memories of hot fresh bread smothered in sweet butter spicy meat and bean soup and that incredible garlic and onionlaced fish stew that jewel made taunted her until she drove them from her mind after that they let the fire die down to coals and banked them with ashes to reduce the amount of light in the cave if the hunters were going to try something tonight there was no point in giving them the advantage of being able to see their targets clearly silhouetted she moved toward the barricade by edging along the side of the cave to keep herself in the shadows as much as possible tad did the same on the other side the rain had indeed slackened off early for once instead of illuminating a solid sheet of water in front of her nose the intermittent flashes of lightning showed the other side of the river with the churning rolling water between there was no sign of anything on the other side of the river and that wasnt good up until now there had always been at least one lurking shadow in the bushes over there now there was nothing that was just one more indication that tads instincts and her reading of the hunters impatience were both correct they were going to try something tonight she glanced over at tad when lightning flickered she could see his head and neck clearly although he was so still he could have passed for a carving he kept his eyelids lowered so that not even a flicker of reflection would betray his presence to anything watching his natural coloration blended beautifully with the stone behind him and the lines of his feathers passed for rockstriations it was amazing just how well camouflaged he was his eartufts lay flat along his head but she knew better than to assume that meant he wasnt listening the eartufts were largely decorative tufts of feathers that had nothing to do with his hearing no he was listening all right she wondered how much he could hear over the roar of the waterfall beside them but when the noise of his trap coming down thundered across the river it was not at all subtle in fact it was loud enough that even the rock of the cave mouth vibrated for a moment she jumped her nerves stretched so tight that she went offbalance for a moment and had to twist to catch herself with her good hand she regained her balance quickly and moved to go outside he shot out a claw catching her good wrist and holding her where she was wait until morning he advised in a voice just loud enough for her to hear it over the roaring water that killed something and they arent going to be able to move the body how much rock did you pile up she asked incredulously how had he been able to pile up anything with only a pair of talons instead of hands and with one bad wing enough he replied then chuckled with pardonable pride i didnt want to boast until i knew it had workedbut i used a little magic to undermine part of the cliffface that was ready to go i honestly didnt know how much was going to come down i only knew it would be more than i could manage by stacking rocks from the sound of it a lot came down she answered in awe what a brilliant application of a very tiny amount of magic did you feel it through the rock he nodded there could be a problem though he added i might have given them a bridge or half a bridge across the river there was that chance that the rock would fall that way but she shrugged philosophically if he had he had it might well be worth it to find out just what precisely had been stalking them all this time and the cliff could have come down by itself doing the same thing she answered theres no point in getting upset until we know i doubt that were going to see any further trouble out of them for tonight anyway she was quite right the rest of the night was as quiet as anyone could have wished and with the first light they both went out to see what if anything tads trap had caught when they got to the rockfall they both saw that it had indeed come sliding down into the river providing a bridge about halfway across though some of it had already washed farther downstream but as they neared it and saw that the trap had caught a victim blade was just as puzzled by what was trapped there as she had been by the shadows there had been some effort made to free the creature that much showed in the signs of digging and the obvious places where rubble and even large stones had been moved off the carcass but it was not a carcass of any animal she recognized if a mage had taken a greyhound crossed it with a serpent and magnified it up to the size of a horse he would have had something like this creature a deep black in color with shiny scaled skin just like a snake or a lizard and a long neck it had teeth sharper and more daggerlike than a dogs its head and those of its limbs not crushed by the fallen rock were also doglike they couldnt tell what color its eyes were the exposed slit only showed an opaque white she stared at it trying to think if there was anything in all of the stories shed heard that matched it but tad had no such trouble putting a name to it wyrsa tad muttered but the colors all wrong she turned her head to see that he was staring down at the thing and he seemed certain of his identification whats a wyrsa she asked sharply he nudged the head with one cautious talon one of the old adepts before maar made things like this to mimic kyree and called them wyrsa he meant them for a more formidable guard dog or hunting pack but they couldnt be controlled and got loose from him oh a long time ago long before maar and the war aubri told me about hunting them said that they ran wild in packs in some places his eyes narrowed as he concentrated but the ones he talked about were smaller than this they were white and they had poison fangs and poison talons she bent down carefully and examined the mouth and the one exposed foot for poison sacs checking to see if either talons or teeth were hollow she finally got a couple of rocks and carefully broke off a long canine tooth and a talon to examine them more closely finally she stood up with a grunt i dont know what else is different on these beasts but they arent carrying anything poisonous she told him as he watched her actions dubiously neither the teeth nor the claws are hollow they have no channel to carry venom and no venom sacs at the root to produce poison in the first place venom has to come from somewhere tad and it has to get into the victim somehow so unless this creature has poisonous saliva aubri distinctly said that they were just like a poisonous snake tad insisted but the color is different on these things and the size something must have changed them they exchanged a look a mage she asked or the storms she might know venom but he knew magic the magestorms if anything at all tad said flatly if a mage had changed wyrsa deliberately he wouldnt have taken out the venom hed have made it worse ill bet it was the magestorms i wouldnt bet against it blade knelt again to examine the head in detail it was as long as her forearm and most of it was jaw tad these things dont need venom to hurt you she pointed out look at those canines theyre as long as my finger and the rest of the teeth are in proportion what else do you know about wyrsa he swallowed audibly aubri said that the bigger the pack was the smarter they acted as if part of their intelligence was shared with every other one in the pack he also said that they were unbelievably tenacious if they got your scent theyd track you for daysand if you killed or hurt one they would track you forever youd never get rid of them until they killed you or you killed them all how comforting she said dryly standing up again and weve hurt one and killed one i wish wed known this before tad just shuffled his feet looking sheepish they might not connect us with the rockfall he offered tentatively well its done and cant be undone she caught something a hint of movement out of the corner of her eye and turned her head and froze as if now that she and tad knew what the things were and the wyrsa saw no reason to hide a group of six stood on the bank across from them snarling silently tad let out his breath in a hiss of surprise and dismay then before she could even blink or draw a breath they were gone she hadnt even seen them move but the only thing across from them now was a stand of bushes the branches still quivering as the only sign that something had passed through them i think we can safely assume that they do connect us with the rockfall she replied a chill climbing up her spine and i think we had better get back to the cave before they decide to try to cross the river again dont run tad cautioned turning slowly and deliberately and watching where he placed his feet aubri said that would make them chase you even if they hadnt been chasing you before she tried to hide how frightened she was but the idea of six or more of those creatures coming at her in the dark was terrifying what charming and delightful creations she replied sarcastically anything else youd like to tell me he shook his head spraying her with rain thats all i remember right now she concentrated on being very careful where she walked for the rain was getting heavier and the rocks slicker it would do no one any good if she slipped on these rocks and broke something else well no one but the wyrsa has anyone ever been able to control these things she asked just out of curiosity the navigable part of the track narrowed he gestured to her to precede him which she did if the wyrsa decided to cross the river he did make a better rear guard than she did as soon as he got turned around not that ive ever heard he said from behind her i suppose that a really good mage could hold a coercionspell on a few and make them attack a target he chose but that would be about the limit of controlling them he wouldnt be able to stop them once they started and he wouldnt be able to make them turn aside if they went after something he didnt choose i certainly wouldnt count on controlling them so at least we probably dont have to worry about some mage setting this pack on our trail after bringing us down she persisted and stole a glance over her shoulder at him his feathers were plastered flat to his head making his eyes look enormous well not that i know of he said hesitantly but these arent the same wyrsa i know theyve been changedmaybe they are more tractable than the old kind maybe the poison was removed as a tradeoff for some other powers or it contributed to their uncontrollability and a mage could have brought us down in their territory for amusement without needing to control them just letting them do what they do youre just full of good news today arent you she growled then repented i shouldnt be taking our bad luck out on him never mind im sorry im just not exactly in a good frame of mind right now neither am i he said softly in a voice in which she could clearly hear his fear neither am i tad kept a watch all day as blade concentrated on fishing once or twice a single wyrsa showed itself but the creatures made no move to cross the river to get at them of course not night has always been their chosen huntingtime and that should be especially true of wyrsa with this new coloration swift silent and incredibly fierce he would not have wanted to face one of this new type much less an entire pack iwonder how big the pack is anyway six ten more were they the sportoffspring of a single female wyrsa wereonly supposed to litter once every two years and they didnt whelp more than a couple at a time if these are all from twin offspring of a single litter back when the storms changed themhow many could the pair have produced four years to maturity then two pups every two years there could be as few as the seven that they had seen and as many as thirty or forty the true answer was probably somewhere in between he and blade ate in silence then she banked the fire down to almost nothing while he took the first watch as soon as it was fully dark he eased several rocks into place to disguise his outline then pressed himself up against the stone of the floor as flat as he could he hoped he could convince them that he wasnt there that nothing was watching them from the mouth of the cave if he could lure one out into the open out on the slippery rocks of the riverbank he might be able to get off a very simple bit of magic if he could stun one long enough to knock it into the riverwell here below the falls it would get sucked under to drown nothing but a fish could survive the swirling currents right at the foot of the falls that would be one less wyrsa to contend with he didnt hear blade so much as sense her after a moments hesitation she touched his foot then eased on up beside him couldnt sleep she mouthed into his ear he nodded stupid maybe but she had good cause for insomnia she pressed herself even farther down against the stone than he had anything that spotted her from across the river would have to have better eyesight than an owl the rain is slacking off that was both good and bad news he had an idea that the wyrsa didnt much care for rain and that they were averse to climbing around on rainslick rocks like him they had talons but he didnt think that their feet were as flexible as his those talons could make walking on rock difficult on the other hand as the rain thinned that made visibility across the river better especially if the lightning kept up without any rain falling something moved on the bank across from his position he froze and he felt blade hold her breath lightning flickered and the light fell on a sleek black form poised at the very edge of the bank peering intently in their direction and now he saw that the white glazing of the dead ones eyes had been the real color the wyrsas eyes were a dead opaque corpsewhite the very look of them as the creature peered across the river in their direction made his skin crawl he readied his spell hoarding his energies no point in striking unless everything was perfect he willed the creature to remain to lean forward more lightning flickered again it was still there still craning its neck peering stay stay now he unleashed the energy saw the wyrsa start its eyes widening but instead of dropping over stunned it glowed for a moment blade gasped so tad knew that she had seen it too as a feeling of faintness and disorientation that he had experienced once before came over him he wheezed and blinked a few times dazzled refocusing on the wyrsa the wyrsa gaped its mouth then as if recharged the creature made a tremendous leap into the underbrush that nothing wholly natural could have duplicated and was gone and with it went the energy of the spell if the wyrsa had deflected it the energy would still be there dissipating it hadnt the spell hadnt hit shields and it hadnt been reflected it had been inhaled absorbed completely and what was morean additional fraction of tads personal mageenergy had gotten pulled along behind it as if swept in a current oh my gods he breathed feeling utterly stunned now he knew what had hit them out there over the forest and now he knew why the wyrsa had begun following them in the first place the wyrsa were the magicthieves not some renegade mage not some natural phenomena they ate magic or absorbed it and it made them stronger blade shook him urgently what happened she hissed in his ear whats the matter whats going on he shook off his paralysis to explain it to her she knew enough about magic and how it worked that he didnt have to explain things twice goddess she lay there just as stunned for a moment as he was and then in typical fashion she summed up their entire position in a two sentences they have our scent they want our blood and now they know that you produce magic on top of all that she stared at him aghast her eyes wide were going to have to kill them all or well never get away from here nine tad hissed at the cluster of wyrsa across the river the wyrsa all bared their formidable teeth and snarled back they made no move to vanish this time and tad got the distinct impression that they were taunting him daring him to throw something magical at them well of course they were they had no reason to believe he had anything that could reach across the river except magic and they wanted him to throw that throw us more food stupid gryphon throw us the very thing that makes us stronger and make it tasty hed already checked a couple of things in their supplies the stone he had made into a magelight and the firestarter he had reenergized were both inert again if hed needed any confirmation of the fact that these were the creatures that had sucked all of the mageenergy out of the carrybasket and everything in itwell he had it iwonder what father would do in a situation like this but skan would not likely have ever found himself in a situation like this one nor would his solution necessarily have been a good one since it likely would have involved a great deal of semisuicidal straighton combat and highenergy physical action which he was not in the least in any shape to perform skandranon was more known for his physicality than his raw inventiveness when it came right down to facts oh tad not you toonow you are even comparing yourself to your father the real question is not what my father would do the real question is what am i going to do in this situation he raised himself up as high on his hindquarters as he could get and gave a battlescream presenting the wyrsa with an open beak and a good view of his foreclaws they stopped snarling and eyed him warily with a little more respect he thought he hoped i wish you wouldnt do that blade emerged from the back of the cave where shed been napping hair tousled and expression sour its a bad way to wake up thinking that your partner is about to engage in mortal combat they dont seem to like the look of my claws he replied trying to sound apologetic without actually apologizing i was hoping i could intimidate them a little more he studied the knot of wyrsa which never seemed to be still for more than an eyeblink they were constantly moving leaping bending twining in around over and under each other hed never seen creatures with so much energy and so much determination to use it it was almost as if they physically couldnt stay still for more than a heartbeat they had come out of the underbrush about the time that the fog lifted and the rains began if the rain bothered them now it certainly wasnt possible to tell then again why should it bother them that it did had been an assumption on his part not a reflection of what was really going on in those narrow snakelike heads they had neither fur nor feathers to get wet and matted down the only effect that rain had on their scales was to make them shiny on first blush id say they dont look very intimidated blade pointed out but her brows knitted as she watched the wyrsa move and her eyes narrowed in concentration on the other handthats a very effective defensive strategy isnt it tad gazed at the stalkers glistening hides the way it moved and flashed the patterns they moved in knotted and reknotted like a decorative interlace is it but it bunches them up all in one place shouldnt that make it easier to hit one he watched them carefully then suddenly shook himself as he realized that the creatures constant movement was making him go into a trance he glanced over at blade she lifted an eyebrow and nodded not bad if you can put your attacker to sleep hmm she asked then smiled slyly which put tad instantly on the alert hed seen that smile before and he knew what it meant trouble usually for someone else well lets see if we can take advantage of their bit of cleverness shall we stay there and look impressive why dont you i need something to keep them distracted she retreated into the cave the wyrsa continued their hypnotic weaving as tad watched them this time prepared to keep from falling under their spell glancing away at every mental count of ten duck came the calm order from behind him he dropped to the floor and a heavy lead shot zinged over him through the space where his head had been across the stream one of the wyrsa squalled and bit the one nearest it the second retaliated and tad had the impression that it looked both surprised and offended at the unprovoked attack the weaving knot was becoming unraveled as the two offended parties snapped and hissed at one another another lead shot followed quickly and a third wyrsa hissed and joined what was becoming a melee that seemed to be more provocation than the others could resist and the knot became a tumbling tangle of quarreling wyrsa with nothing graceful coordinated or hypnotic about it now most of the knot was involved in the fight except for a loner who extricated itself from the snarling hissing pack this creature backed up slowly eying the others with what was clearly surprise and blades third shot thudded right into its head it dropped in its tracks stunned while the rest of the group continued to squabble squall and bite blade stepped back into the front of the cave and watched the wyrsa with satisfaction i wondered just how cohesive that pack was i also wonder how long its going to take them to associate a distanceweapon with us i doubt that theyve ever seen or experienced one before at just that moment another one of the creatures emerged from the bushes and uttered a cry that was part hiss part deepthroated growl the reaction to this was remarkable and immediate the others stopped fighting instantly and dropped to the ground groveling in submission the new wyrsa ignored them going instead to the one that blade had brought down sniffing at it then nipping its hindquarters to bring it groggily to its feet id say the packleader just arrived tad said the new wyrsa swung its head around as he spoke and glared at him from across the river the deadwhite eyes skewered him holding him in place entirely against his will while the wyrsas lip lifted in a silent snarl the eyes glowed faintly and his thoughts slowed to a sluggish crawl tad felt exactly like a bird caught within striking distance of a snake unable to move even to save his own life it was a horrible feeling of cold dread one that made his extremities feel icy at just that moment blade stepped between them and leveled a malevolent glare of her own at the packleader in a calm clear voice she suggested that the wyrsa in question could do several highly improbable athletically difficult and possibly biologically impractical things involving its own mother a few household implements and a dead fish tad blinked as his mind came back to life again when the wyrsa took its eyes off him hed had no idea blades education had been that liberal the wyrsa might not have understood the words but the tone was unmistakable it reared back as if it were going to accept the implied challenge by leaping across the riveror leaping into it and swimming acrossand blade let another stone fly from her sling this one cracked the packleader across the muzzle breaking a tooth with a wet snap the creature made that strange noise of hiss and yelp that tad had heard the night one got caught in his deadfall it whirled and turned on the others driving them away in front of it with a ragged squeal and a heartbeat later the riverbank was empty blade tucked her sling back into her pocket and rubbed her bad shoulder thoughtfully i dont know if that was a good idea or a bad one we arent going to be able to turn them against each other again but at least they know now that we have something that can hit them from a distance besides magic and you certainly made an impression on the leader tad observed cocking his head to one side she smiled faintly just making it clear which of us is the meanest bitch in the valley she replied lightly or hadnt you noticed the leader was female uh actually no i hadnt he felt his nares flush with chagrin at being so caught in the creatures spell that he had completely missed something so obvious shes really not my type her grin widened makes me wonder if the reason shes keeping the pack here has less to do with the fact that we killed one of her pups than it does with her infatuation with you or rather with your magnificent physique her eyes twinkled wickedly whether or not she realizes it shes definitely recovering but i wonder if i ought to break something else just for the sake of a little peace he coughed i think not he replied flushing further with embarrassment oh no but blade let it drop this was hardly the time and place to skewer him with further wit although when they got out of this he had the feeling that she would not have forgotten this incident or her own implications you know she continued if we had even a chance of picking her off the pack might lose its cohesiveness at the very least theyd be spending as much time squabbling over the leadership position as stalking us he scratched the side of his head thoughtfully she had a good point we have to be able to see them to pick one particular wyrsa he pointed out and traps and rockfalls are likely to get the least experienced not the most but it does account for why theyre being so persistent and tenacious uhhuh we got one of her babies probably blade sank down on the stone floor of the cave and watched the underbrush across the river he turned his attention in that direction himself and was rewarded by the slight movement of a bit of brush since there wasnt a breeze at the moment he concentrated on that spot and was able to make out a flash of dark shiny hide before the creature moved again interesting blade chewed on a nail and regarded the brush with narrowed eyes i dont think were going to see them out in the open again they learn quickly that quickly that was impressive but he called to mind what aubri had told him about the packs collective intelligence if there were many more than just the knot that hed seen it would mean that as a group the pack might be as smart as a makaar and that was pretty smart regardless of what father claims the bushes moved again and he caught another glimpse of slick black hide a cross of greyhound and snake i cant imagine anything more bizarre but then blade would tell me that my imagination isnt very good wonder what kind of vision they get out of those strange eyes can they see in the dark could that white film be a screen they pull across their eyes to protect them from daylight can they actually see magic or scent it i wonder what we look like to them he said musing aloud blade shot him a sharp glance i suppose i looked fairly harmless until i whipped out my sling she replied but i suspect that you look like a movable feast after all you are burdened with a magical nature and it might be rather obvious to them you meanthey might be more interested in me than you as prey he choked she nodded probably as someone theyd want to keep alive a while so they could continue to feed on your magic as it rebuilt theyre probably bright enough for that he hadnt thought about that it did not make him feel any better amberdrake stood beside the leader of their party and wrung more water out of a braid of hair he waited for the fellow to say something enlightening fog wreathed around them both and shrouded everything more than a few paces away in impenetrable whiteness i wish i knew what was going on here regin muttered staring at the pair of soggy decoys wedged up in the fork of a tree theres no trail from the camp which looks as if the silvers were trying to conceal their backtrail but there isnt a sign of anything hunting them either and nowwe find this the ground beneath the tree was torn up as was the bark of the lower trunk but there was no blood there was a deadfall rigged of wood that had been tripped but there was no sign that anything had been caught in it they might have passed the site by thinking that it was just a place where some large forest creature had been marking his territory except that there was a humanshaped decoy and a gryphonshaped decoy wedged high in a tree that isnt very enlightening they might have run into some sort of large predator drake pointed out just because we didnt see any sign of a hunter that doesnt mean they werent being trailed that would account for why they tried not to leave a trail maybe thats even the reason why they left their camp in the first place this was the first sign of the children that any of them had come across in their trek toward the river amberdrake took it as a good omen it certainly showed that the duo had gotten this far so their own party was certainly on the right track and it showed that they were in good enough health to rig something like this maybe but why decoys regin paced carefully around the trunk of the tree examining it on all sides most forest predators hunt with their noses and even in this rain the trail from here to wherever they did spend the night would be fresh enough to follow i wonder what we can learn from this i dont know im not a hunter amberdrake admitted and let it go at that skan didnt however whatever tore this place up is an animalor at least it doesnt use weapons or tools he pointed out it might just be that thethat blade and tad wandered into its territory and they built the decoys to keep it occupied while they went on their way maybe regin shook his head whatever it was i dont recognize the marks but that doesnt surprise me i havent recognized much in this benighted forest since we got into it and im beginning to wonder how anything survives here without gills with that he shrugged heading off into the forest in the direction of the river amberdrake followed him but skan lingered a moment before hurrying to catch up lest he get left behind and lost in the fog i dont like it he muttered fretfully as he reached drakes side i just dont like it it didnt look right back there but i cant put my finger on why i dont know enough about hunting animals to be of any help drake replied bluntly he kept telling himself that the children weremust bestill fine that no matter how impressive the signs these unknown creatures had left were the children had obviously escaped their jaws all i know is that whatever made those marks must be the size of a horse and if i were being chased by something that size i probably wouldnt be on the ground at night maybe they put the decoys up one tree and then climbed over to another to spend the night unless of course theyre too hurt to climb trees but in that case how did the decoys get up in one illusion skan said suddenly his head coming up with a jerk thats it theres no illusion and no traces of one on those decoys tads not a powerful mage but hes good enough to cast an illusion and if i were building a decoy id want to make it look as much like me as possible so why didnt he put an illusion on it because he couldnt drake said flatly if mageenergy got sucked out of the basket and everything else it could have gotten sucked out of him and it might not have built up enough yet for him to do anything oh skan was taken a bit aback but finally nodded his acceptance of drakes explanation amberdrake was just as glad because he could think of another tad cant work a simple magic like an illusion because hes hurt too badly on the other hand those decoys were soggy enough to have been here for a couple of days so that meant that the children made fairly good progress for two people trying to hide their backtrail so that in turn meant that they couldnt have been hurt too badly didnt it he also didnt want to think about how having mageenergy drained from him might affect tad in other more subtle ways would it be like a slowlydraining wound would it affect his ability to work magic at all what if he simply was no longer a mage anymore gryphons were inherently magical for good reasons and urtho would not have designed them so otherwise although the mage of silence had made many mistakes the gryphons were considered his masterpieces magic collected in their bodies with every breath and with every stroke of the wings it stabilized their life systems cleaned their organs helped them fly amberdrake had never heard of what would happen if a gryphon were deprived of mageenergy completely for an extended amount of time would it be like fatigue poisoning or gout or something even more insidious like a mental imbalance the rescue party was moving along in a tightlybunched group to keep from getting separated in the mist were on the right track at least the children certainly came this way amberdrake reminded himself theyre moving right along thinking planning if theyre in trouble the best place for them is the river theres food there thats easy to catch and maybe caves in the cliffs theyre doing all the right things especially if theyre having to deal with large predators maybe this was why the rescuers hadnt found much in the way of large game theyd tried to send on their findings by teleson so that the other two parties out searching knew to turn back to the river the mage filix thought hed gotten everything through clearly but without local mageenergy to draw on he couldnt be certain that all the details had made it over still whether the children went north or south when they encountered the river someone should run into them now their own party was going to try to the north mostly because they did know for certain that ikalas would be coming up from below them also heading north this damned fog it makes me more nervous than the rain ifwhenwe all get out of this i am never leaving the city again i swear it not unless its to visit another city so far as im concerned you can take the wilderness experience and bury it in a hole hed never forgotten the hardships of the trek to white gryphon and he had been all too well aware of what this mission would involve he thought hed been prepared for it except for one thing id forgotten that now im not as limber as i used to be for this sort of thing judeth and aubri certainly didnt volunteer to traipse through the woods and now i see why they probably think im a fool forcing myself to go along on this rescue trying to do a young mans job maybe letting me go was judeths way of getting revenge upon me for threatening her but blade wasnt judeths daughter nor was tad aubris son no id rather be out here at least i know that im doing something this way zhaneel and winterhart must feel the same or they wouldn t have insisted on coming either but the fog was doing more than just getting on his nerves he kept thinking that he was seeing shadows flitting alongside them out there he kept feeling eyes on him and getting glimpses of skulking shapes out of the corner of his eye it was all nonsense of course and just his nerves getting the better of him but drake skan whispered carefully were being paced i dont know by what but theres something out there i can taste it in the fog and ive seen a couple of shadows moving youre sure that was regin who had signaled for a halt and dropped back when he heard skan whispering bern thought he might be seeing something too then count me as three because i saw large shadows moving out there and behind us drake said firmly could it be whatever tore up the ground back there if it is i dont want to goad it into attacking us in this fog regin replied though i doubt it will as long as we look confident most big hunters wont mess with a group bern confirmed nodding they like single prey not a pack drake must have looked skeptical because regin thumped him on the back in what was probably supposed to be an expression of hearty reassurance it drove the breath out of him and staggered him a pace theres too many of us for it to want to contend with regin pointed out with confidence and we arent hurt i dont care if it paces us as long as it doesnt come after us and it wont im sure of it amberdrake got his breath again and shrugged youre the leader he said keeping his uncertainty to himself regin grinned as if to say thats right i am but wisely kept his response to a grin and waved them on again drake continued to feel the eyes on his back and kept thinking about beings the size of a horse with talons to matchthe kinds of claws that had torn up the earth to the depth of his hand would a party of seven humans and one gryphon look all that formidable to something like that and what if there was more than one of those things out there the way the ground had been dug up certainly suggested that there were several you wont like this skan gryphonwhispered which was as subtle and quiet as a humans normal speaking voice the gryphon glanced from side to side apprehensively drake i think weve been surrounded all the muscles in amberdrakes neck went tight and he shivered reflexively he no longer trusted regins selfconfidence in the least at just that moment regin signaled another halt and bern took him aside to whisper something into his ear the leader looked straight at skan bern says were surrounded are we i think so skan said flatly and i dont think whatever it is out there is just curious i also dont think its going to let us get much farther without a fight regins face darkened as if skan had challenged him but he turned his eyes to the shrouding fog before replying the general always says the best defense is a good offense he replied in a growl but theres no point in lobbing arrows against things we cant see well lose ammunition without impressing them the rains are going to begin as soon as the fog lifts sir bern pointed out we still wont be able to see whats out there and you cant shoot with a wet bowstring regin leveled his gaze on filix next is there something you can do to find out whats following us maybe scare it away i dont want to waste time better spent looking for silverblade and tadrith the mage shrugged maybe i can try the best thing would be to try to stun one so that we can see what it looks like i dont have to see something to stun it i just have to know in general where it is the leader spread his hands indicating his full permission youre the mage try it see what happens amberdrake opened his mouth to object but closed it again after all what did he know nothing about hunting predators or being stalked if their stalkers were only curious after all stunning one wouldnt hurt them if they were thinking about making a meal of the rescuers well having one of their lot fall over without a mark on him should make them back off for a while at least it certainly seemed to him that it should work out that way and by the time the hunters regained their courage the rescue party would probably be long gone skan opened his beak and amberdrake thought he was going to object as well but it was too late filix had already spotted something or thought he had and had unleashed the spell the result was not what any of them had expected a dark shadow in the fog glowed suddenly amberdrake got an odd unsettling feeling in the pit of his stomachand filix and skan cursed together with heartfelt fluency what regin snapped looking from one to the other what it ate my spell filix began but skan interrupted him waving the teleson hed been carrying around his neck it ate the teleson the gryphon roared damn whatevers out there is what pulled blade and tad down and you just fed it everything it wanted skan was just glad that they had alerted the other parties that they had finally found signs of the missing children before the teleson became a pretty piece of junk by the time they camped that night it was evident that not only had the creatures out there eaten the telesonor rather drained away all of its mageenergybut theyd eaten the energy from every other magical device the party had why theyd waited so long to do so was a matter of conjecture at this point maybe theyd been screwing up their courage to do so maybe they had just been biding their time until they had a certain number of their lot in place maybe the things were staying in hiding until something was thrown at them as a form of cover it wasnt my fault filix kept protesting how was i going to know he couldnt have known that some bizarre animals were the cause of the trouble of course but since they had known there was something out here that ate magic it seemed to skan that lobbing spells around indiscriminately was obviously a bad idea he had been about to say just that when filix had lobbed the first one well what the search party had to deal with now were the results in the short term that meant the tents had to be put up by hand and using freshlycut poles and ropes fires had to be started with the oldfashioned firestriker and any number of other problems both inconvenient and possibly hazardous suddenly arose to confront them in the long termhaving gotten a taste the strange and possibly hostile creatures that had stalked them through the fog and rain might now be looking for a meal the tents were keeping the rain out but were not precisely dry anymore they werent keeping bugs out either skan wondered how long it would take until it occurred to regin that the waterproofing and bugprotections on their rations might also have been magical serve him right if he had to eat soggy weevilridden rationbread the two tents shared a canvas porch it lacked a canvas floor and one wall but gave protection to their fire they gathered in the two tents on either side of the fire with the flaps tied back regin called them for a conference as the light began to dim in the forest outside rain drummed down on the canvas but regin had pitched his voice to carry over it were doing fine regin decreed as they sat crowded into the two tents meant for a total of four not eight at least this way they all had space to get in out of the wet even if it was not completely dry beneath the canvas we have nothing to worry about canvas still keeps out rain wood still burns and we still have the northneedle which is thank the gods not magical weve found the river and its only a matter of time before we either run into the missing silvers or one of the other parties does if they do theyll try and notify us realize what happened when they dont get our teleson and come fetch us if we find them first well just backtrack along the river until we meet one of the other parties then get back to the base camp not a problem skan was hardly in agreement with that sentiment but regin was the leader and it was poor form to undermine confidence in your leader when it was most needed by others this is not a wartime situation and now we know that the magic stealers are just some kind of strange wild animal not an enemy force if were just careful we should get out of this intact and with the children at least that was what he was trying to tell himself for tonight i want a double watch set four and four split the night a mage in each of the two watches regin looked around for volunteers for the first watch and got his four without skan or drake needing to put up a hand skan did not intend to volunteer but filix seemed so eager to make up for the mistake that cost them all their magic that it looked as if the younger mage had beaten the gryphon to volunteering skan wondered what the young man thought he was volunteering for he was hardly a fighter and the idea of throwing magic at something that ate magic did not appeal to the gryphon iam not lobbing a single spell around until we lose these menaces he resolved if these things eat magic it stands to reason that magic makes them stronger and the stronger they are the more likely they are to attack us physically well filix could use a bow at least even if he didnt possess a gryphons natural weaponry he might do all right at thatprovided he thinks before he acts he wanted to take filix aside and caution him but an earlier attempt had not been very successful filix clearly thought that skan was overreacting to the situation one of the biggest problems with the younger magesyoungsters who had come along after the cataclysmwas that they thought magic could fix everything they had yet to learn that magic was nothing more than another tool and one that you could do without if you had to maybe things wouldnt be as convenient without it but so what snowstar ought to force them to spend a year not using magic regin nodded with satisfaction at his volunteers right close up the watch right around the camp theres no point in guarding a big perimeter tonight if you get a clear shot take it maybe if we make things unpleasant enough for whatever is out there itll get discouraged and leave us alone and maybe youll provoke them into an attack skan reminded himself that he was not the leader and kept his beak clamped tightly shut on his own objections but he resolved to sleep with himself between drake and the tent wall and to do so lightly somehow he managed to invoke most of the old battle reflexes get himself charged up to the point where nerves would do instead of sleep and laid himself warily down to rest with one eye and ear open in his opinion regin was taking this all far too casually and was far too certain that they were only dealing with a peculiar form of wild animal and he was so smug about the fact that he had brought nonmagical backups to virtually every magical piece of equipment except the teleson that skan wanted to smack him into good sense again bringing backups isnt the point he seethed as he positioned himself to best protect drake in an attack the fact that there is something out here that can eat magic and is clearly hostilethats the point what good are our backups going to do if these things decide that they want more than just a taste of us from a distance the rains slowed then stopped the fire died leaving them with nothing but glowing coals for a source of light just as the camp quieted down for the night the wild animals proved that they were not intimidated by a party of eight skan came awake all at once with the sound of someone falling to the ground followed by cursing and a bowstring snapping practically in his ear but it wasnt filix taking the shotthe mage was lying on the ground just outside the canvas wall nearest skan gasping for breath the other three humans not on watch scrambled up but skan was already on his feet ready for trouble a moment later regin hauled the halfconscious mage into the tent what happened skan asked harshly as the other two fighters scrambled outside leaving himself regin and drake alone with the disabled mage amberdrake went to the young mages side immediately and began examining him the leader shook his head i dont know the young man admitted looking pale and confused in the light from the single lamp that drake had lit he saw something out there and i think he was going to work some magic on ithe muttered something about his shieldsand then he just fell over i took a shot at something moving but i dont think i hit it hes been drained amberdrake said flatly looking up with his hand still on filixs forehead i saw this once or twice in the war when mages overextended themselves i remember that it was on the orders of an incompetent commander the only difference is that this time filix didnt overextend himself he was drained to nothing by means of the spell he cast drake continued my guess is that those creatures out there were able to use his previous magic to get into his shieldcastings and then just pulled everything he had out of him the way they pulled the mageenergy out of the teleson and probably tadrith and silverblades basket as well stupid son of regin bit off what he was going to say is he going to be all right maybe probably as long as he doesnt give whatever is out there another chance to drain him drake looked angry and a little disgusted and skan didnt blame him ill do what i can for him but you should be aware that it isnt much lady cinnabar herself couldnt do much for something like this what he needs is rest rest and more rest were going to have to carry him for the next few days he probably wont even regain consciousness until tomorrow and his head will hurt worse than it ever has in his life for several days well well go short one this shift regin shook his head again stupid he glanced at skan who drew himself up with dignity i know better than to try anything magical he retorted to the unspoken rebuke ill use a more direct method of defending this camp if i have to use anything stupid fool thought that if he cast shields hed be safe against this skan fumed never bothered to remember that magical shields are themselves magical did he and since shields are spun out from your own power they are traceable directly back into your own mageenergies he probably didnt think it was necessary to cast anything more complicated and figured his shields would block anything coming in the result had clearly been immediate and had certainly been predictable he pulled drake back into the tent they had been trying to sleep in well stay here he told amberdrake leave him in the other tent with regin with just one man to watch him amberdrake asked skan shook his head does it matter he replied theres nothing you can do for him and if something comes charging in here were going to have more important things to think about than defending an unconscious mage there it was hard cruel wartruths this was a war whether or not regin realized it yet evidently drake did he grimaced but didnt protest any further he remembered he knew that the two of them must make their priority that of finding the children and he knew all about cutting losses which was just as well because a few moments later the second attack came there was no warning they hadnt even blown out the lantern or tried to lie down again the rain must have covered any sounds of approach for there certainly was nothing outside the tent walls to indicate anything was wrong all that skan knew was that bern shouted then screamed and something dark came ripping through the canvas of the tent knocking over the lantern in the process plunging them into darkness until the spilled oil flared up he knocked drake to the ground and stood over him slashing at whatever came near in the darkness he ignored anything outside the tent to the point where it simply didnt exist for him concentrating fiercely on tiny currents of air sounds movement and what little he could see reflecting from the burning spilled oil his talons connected several times with something that felt like snakeskin tearing through it to the flesh beneath and he clenched any time he was able to so that he might rend away a chunk of meat but his opponents uttered nothing more than a hiss and they dashed away through the double rents in the tent canvas as if his fierce opposition surprised them the fight couldnt have lasted for very long for not only was he not tired he hadnt even warmed up to full fighting speed when the attacks ceased and the attackers vanished silent shadows sliding between the raindrops he stood over drake a while longer the kestrachern had the good sense to stay put and not move the entire time when amberdrake finally moved it was to pat the flame out with the edge of a bedroll and then right the lantern are they gone came the voice from between his feet i think so skan replied shaking his head to refocus himself only then did he hear the moans of wounded and the sound of bern calling his name were here drake answered for him as he relit the lantern with a smoldering corner of the bedroll were all right i think thats more than the rest of us can say the scout replied grimly wheezing and coughing can you get out here and help me if i let go of this rag around my leg im going to bleed myself out drake swore scrambled for the medical kit in the darkness and pushed through the ruined tent wall skan followed slowly when the lantern had been relit so that drake could see to treat wounds and everyone had been accounted for they discovered that regin and filix had been killed by more of the things they had probably died instantly or nearly so amberdrake reached for the bodies and could only locate so many pieces at the very least they got the mercy of a quick death there wasnt much left of them blood was spattered everywhere and it was difficult to tell what part belonged to whom he left the tent quickly reminded all too forcefully of some of hadaneliths victims and of maars im supposed to be hardened to this sort of thing but maybe ive just seen too much death too much suffering maybe i am not as tough as i thought i was or wish i could be even after all this time it was one thing to think about cutting losses another thing to lose people like this we were caught unprepared despite my hopedfor lessons of experience amberdrake remained for a few moments longer and when he came out he surprised skan by the thoughtful look of concentration he wore finally as the other men bundled the two bodies hastily in the remains of the tent he drew skan aside are these things animals or not he asked skan blinked they certainly fought like it he replied cautiously extremely efficient predators they didnt have weapons just talons and teeth and and speed i dont think ive ever seen anything that fast since the last makaar died fierce predators no wonder we havent seen much game and all of it small they must have emptied out the forest around here of groundbased game at least he shook his head we should have figured that out and assumed theyd attack us for food they must be halfmad with hunger by now they cant live long on rabbits snakes and bugs not as big as they are drake nodded as if he had expected skan to say that in that case tell me this why didnt they drag their prey off with them to eat why didnt they try and kill more of us skan opened his beak to reply and shut it with a click why didnt they if theyre just big hunters with an incidental ability to eat mageenergy maybe we dont taste good he suggested lamely maybe but that hasnt stopped lions from becoming maneaters when theyre famished shalaman showed us that remember amberdrake chewed on his lower lip a moment i have a feeling that these things are planning something and that they dont intend to let us get away skan theyre a lot worse than they seem they seem bad enough already to me skan grumbled but i see your point he didnt have time to think much more about it however for bern as acting leader decreed that there would be no more rest that night they spent the rest of the dark hours in the open sitting in a circle with their backs together facing the forest with weapons in hand it was a long cold and terrifying night every time a drop of water fell from a leaf someone started every time a shadow seemed to move they all got ready to defend their lives skan had never spent a night as frightening as this one not even during the war and he prayed no one else would ever have to either stelvi pass had been a summer day compared to this unending wet cold waiting he didnt know how amberdrake was managing to bear up it was bad enough to endure this knowing that he could if there was no other choice escape by flying into the treetops even in a fight he could defend himself against fairly stiff odds but drake couldnt escape and he wasnt a fighter and in his place skan knew hed have been babbling with fear as soon as there was any light at all beneath the trees bern ordered them to move out down to the river that they had heard all night long the floodswollen river which roared at their feet with nothing on the other side but a rocky cliffface and a scrap of path you two arent fighters so you get across the river and hold it for us so we can cross he ordered drake and skan skan took one look at the swollen raging waters and seriously considered mutiny but amberdrake just picked up a coil of rope from the wreckage of the camp and gestured to him to follow down to the rocks at the edge there he rigged a harness of rope for himself while bern and the rest stood nervously with their backs to the water facing the forest bows and swords ready soon enough the fog would rise and when the shadowcreatures came back the besieged rescuers wouldnt be able to see them until it was far too late drake the expert in ropes and knots moved far more quickly than skan would have thought possible under the circumstances his fingers fairly flew as he put together a harness it would be impossible to get out of without undoing at least half of the knots it must have seemed to the four injured fighters that he was taking a ridiculous amount of time however he was even making sure that it would fit over his packthe precious pack that had what was left of their medical kit and the oil and oil lamp hurry up bern shouted his voice pitched higher with strain and nerves drake ignored them and turned to skan you cant carry me over but you can tow me through the water he pointed out theres no way im going to slip out of this he fastened the loose end of the rope to a tree at the waters edge without elaborating anything but his plan was obvious to skan the harness was rigged so that drake could swim freely but could also be towed along easily which is what he meant skan to do flying above the river once he got drake to the other side the kestrachern could fasten his rope to a boulder or spike of rock and the others could plunge in and drag themselves across providing of course there werent more of those things on the other side waiting somewhere if that last thought occurred to amberdrake he didnt hesitate for a second once he had the end of the rope tied off he plunged immediately into the river almost before skan had hold of the end fastened to his harness caught offbalance for a moment skan held on against the tug of the current then launched himself into the air amberdrake sputtered and submerged once then steadied he called out its drier in here than in the forest once there he was utterly grateful that drake was a good swimmer and he allowed himself a brief tensionrelieving smile at amberdrakes quip his friend was able to keep his own head above water so that skans only task was to pull him onward only this is like playing tugofwar against five teams of draft horses it was obvious within a few moments that this was going to be a great deal more difficult than it looked they werent even a single length from the shore and skan wanted to quit the gryphons wings beat laboriously the muscles in his back and chest burning with pain as he pulled against the current and the weight of drakes body below him amberdrake labored against the current trying to pull him under and occasionally lost the battle but he had honed his swimming ability in the powerful surf below white gryphon between his own strength and skans his head always popped back above the surface again long enough for him to get another lungful of air ten heartbeats later they were out of time hurry bern shouted again his voice spiraling upward in fear theyre coming skan ignored him as best he could concentrating every fiber on getting a little more strength out of his wings drake was not doing well down there the treacherous currents kept pulling him under and each time he rose to the surface it took a little longer they were about halfway across when the sounds of battle erupted behind him short screams and cries that echoed above the roaring river he ignored those too as best he could his world narrowed to the face of his friend in the water below the rope in his front talons the pain of his laboring body and the farther shore his lungs were on fire his forelimbs ached with all the tortures of the damned from the strain of holding drake and pulling him onward his vision fogged with red as it had only a few times in the past when he had driven himself past his limits the bank was only a few lengths awaybut he was out of energy running out of strength and just about out of endurance he wasnt going to make it he could drop the rope and save himself or they would both be dragged under no he was not going to surrender with the goal so close come on gryphon if he can do this so can you youre a team remember hes counting on you not to let him drown think of what winterhart would do to you if you did think of what gesten would do amberdrake has been with you all your life gryphon all your life hes had his hands in your guts and your blood in his hair putting you back together from pieces he didnt leave you then he wouldn t leave you from somewhere came another burst of strength and with a cry that was half a scream of defiance and half a moan of agony he drove himself at the bank he made it by mere talonlengths dropping down on it with all the grace of a shot duck and landing half on the bank half in the water with a groan he grabbed the rope in his beak and dragged himself and drake talon over talon onto the bank and safety he wanted to just lie there panting but there were still four more people on the other side somehow he pulled himself up to a standing position on shaking legs just as drake got to his hands and knees and both of them turned toward the far bank at the same time all they saw was torn foliage the slashed end of the rope hanging off the tree drake had tied it to splashes of red that werent likely flowersand the empty shore they watched panting and slumping down against each other until the fog closed in leaving them staring at blank whiteness they were alone it could not be much longer before whatever it was that had attacked them found a way to cross unless it took a long timeto eat for a moment he felt stricken numb frozen with shock but he had been in too many fights and lost too many comrades for this to paralyze him now mourn later find safety now drake looked at him from beneath a mat of hair that had become a tangled dripping mess his clothing half torn from his body by the fight of last night and a strange look of hope in his eyes for one stark moment skan was afraid that hed gone mad blade he began hoarsely then coughed huge racking coughs that brought up half a lungful of river water skan balled his talons into fists and pounded his back until he stopped coughing and waved skan off blade he began again his voice a ruin he looked up and pointed north along the riverbank shes that way i can feel her i swear it skan with one accord they dragged themselves to their feet and stumbled northward over the slippery rocks and wet clay of the bank below the cliff face northwhere their children must be tad inspected the last of the traps with no real hope that he would find anything at this one that differed from all the rest the first wyrsa they had killed had been the last none of the traps worked a second time in fact the wyrsa seemed to take a fiendish delight in triggering the damned things and leaving them empty so far they had not dared the last one another rockfall that he or blade could trigger from inside the cave he suspected though that it was only a matter of time before they did on the other hand they would not be able to disarm it without triggering it so perhaps they were all even as he had expected this snare lay empty too he decided that the rope could be better used elsewhere and salvaged it it certainly would have been nice if this one had worked though his nerves were wearing thin and he was afraid that the wyrsa might be able to drain mageenergy from him constantly now since they were so close he didnt dare try shielding against them shields were magical too and they could surely be eaten like anything else magical when they had first found the cave he had thought that the noise of the river and the waterfall would cover the sounds anything approaching made but over the past few days he had discovered to his surprise that he had been wrong to a limited extent he had actually gotten used to the steady roaring and was able to pick out other noises beyond it but the very last sound he had been expecting was the noise of someone a twolegged someone scrambling over the rocks at a speed designed to break his neck and panting especially not coming toward him those were not wyrsa sounds either not unless the wyrsa had acquired a pair of huntingboots and put them on he had barely time to register and recognize the sounds before the makers of the noise burst through the fog right in his face he hadnt heard the second one because he had been flying and his wingbeats had not carried over the sound of the falls tadrith looked up to find his vision filled with the fierce glorious silhouette of the black gryphon father he exclaimed in mingled relief and shock amberdrake no time skandranon panted as amberdrake scrabbled right past him without pausing run were being chased no need to ask what was chasing them skan landed heavily then turned to stand at bay to guard amberdrakes retreat tad leaped up beside him despite his handicap witjh two gryphons guarding the narrow trail there wasnt a chance in the world that the wyrsa would get past but they certainly tried the fog was as thick as curdled milk and the wyrsa nothing more than shadows and slashing claws and fangs reaching for them through the curtain but they couldnt get more than two of their number up to face skan and tad at any one time and without the whole pack able to attack together their tactics were limited they were fast but tad and skan were retreating step by careful step and that generally got them out of range before a talon or a bite connected step by step and watch it slip and you end up under those claws thank urtho for giving us four legs they retreated all the way to the shelf of rock in front of the cave and that was where their own reinforcements stepped in duck came the familiar order and this time when he and his father dropped to the ground not only did rocks hurl over their heads but a pair of daggers hummed past tads ear like angry wasps they both connected too and one was fatal the wyrsa nearest the water got it in the throat made a gurgle and fell over to be swept away by the rushing torrent the second was lucky he was only hit in the shoulder but gave that familiar hissyelp and vanished into the fog skan and tad took advantage of the respite to turn their backs in turn and scramble into the cave itself there they turned again prepared for another onslaught but the wyrsa had evidently had enough for one day tad sat down right where he was breathing heavily heart pounding his father was less graceful and more tired than that and dropped down into the sand as if hed been shot himself panting with his beak wide open i always knew those throwingknives were going to come in handy some day amberdrake observed he looked nothing like the amberdrake that tad had known all his life his long hair was a draggling tangled watersoaked mess his clothing stained torn muddy and also sodden he wore a pack that was just as much of a mess at least externally at his waist was a belt holding one long knife a pouch and an odd sheath that held many smaller flat knives exactly of the kind that had just whizzed over tads head yes butyou had tolearn howto throw themfirst skan replied panting you and your bargains they were a bargain amberdrake said indignantly a dozen of them for the price of that one single fightingknife that you wanted me to get but youknew how touse thefightingknife blade brought her father and skan a skin of water each and they drank thirstily she looked from one to the other of them and carefully assessed their condition i dont think im going to ask where the rest of your group is she said quietly im pretty certain i already know a tiny oil lamp cast warm light down on amberdrake and his patient blade sat at her fathers feet while he examined her shoulder as skan and tad kept watch at the mouth of the cave you did a fine job on tadriths wing amberdrake murmured i only wish he had done as good a job on your shoulderblade well that certainly explained why it wouldnt stop hurting youre not going to have to rebreak it are you she asked trying not to wince he patted her unhurt shoulder comfortingly and it was amazing just how good that simple gesture felt not hardly since it was never set in the first place immobilized yes but not set im astonished that youve managed as much as you have he placed the tips of his fingers delicately over the offending bone its possible that it was only cracked at first and not broken and that somewhere along the line you simply completed the break hold very still for a moment and this will hurt she tried not to brace herself since that would only make things worse she felt his fingers tighten sensed a snap and literally saw stars for a moment it hurt so much when she could see again she was still sitting upright and he still had his hands on her shoulders so she must have managed not to move she sagged gratefully against the rock he was sitting on and wiped tears from her eyes weakly now stay still a moment more he urged i havent done this for a long time and im rather out of practice she obeyed and a moment later felt the area above the break warming the pain there vanished all but a faint throbbing in time with her pulse id forgotten he still has some healing ability not enough that he ever acts as a healer anymore but enough that he could in the war in fact he was first sent by his family off to train as a healer but his empathic senses got in the way in the war he was supposed to have been very good even on gryphons amberdrake finally lifted his hands from her shoulder and sighed im sorry dearheart i cant do as much as id like it was far more than shed had any hope of before they arrived you did a great deal father believe me i hope you saved plenty of yourself for tad she said especially since you did specialize in gryphontrauma during the war i did he replied as she twisted around to look up at him he combed his hair out of his eyes with one hand and grimaced ill keep working on you two as i recuperate too but i never was as competent at healing as id like and accelerating bone growthwell its hard and i never did learn to do it well maybe if id gotten the right training when i was younger then youd have been a healer lady cinnabar would have been your lady and apprentice instead of tamsins and i wouldnt be here she interrupted i love you just the way you are father i wouldnt change a thing and suddenly she realized that she meant exactly that probably for the first time since she had been a small child she knew that he had needed to extend his empathic sense in order to heal and he still hadnt barricaded himself he felt that and his eyes filled with tears he wanted to hear that from me as much as i wanted his approval she thought with astonishment how could i have been so blind all this time thinking only the child could want approval from the parenthow stupid of methe parent wants approval from the child just as much blade he said she didnt let him finish she reached up for him as he reached down for her and they held each other while his tears fell on her cheeks and mingled with hers it was he who pulled away first not she rubbing his nose inelegantly on the back of his hand as he sniffed and managing a weak smile for her well arent we a pair of sentimental idiots he began no youre a pair of sensible idiots if that isnt contradictory skandranon interrupted you two were overdue for that if you ask me and if you dont ask me ill tell you anyway and i am right as usual drake what can she do now if anything ive strengthened and knitted the bone a bit amberdrake replied looking at her although he answered skan and ive done something about the pain i wouldnt engage in handtohand but you can certainly throw a spear use a sling or do some very limited swordplay no shields sorry it wont take that kind of strain we dont have any shields with us so that hardly matters she replied dryly nor bows either we had to concentrate on bringing things we could use well i know how to make a throwingstick and the spears to go with it if you know how to use one amberdrake admitted that should increase your range there ought to be some wood in here straight enough for spears he knows how to make a weapon she throttled down her surprise and just nodded yes to bothnow let me go replace tad at the front and you can work your will on him she almost said magic but stopped herself just in time since the wyrsa hadnt come calling when her father began his healing evidently they did not eat healingenergy which was just as well under the circumstances perhaps it was too localized or too finelytuned to be sucked in from afar she stood up hefted a spear in both hands marveling at her new freedom from pain and smiled with grim pleasure at the feel of a good weapon tad retreated to the back of the cave and she took her place beside his father so what exactly are those nightmares skan asked have you any idea she stared out into the rain the rain had begun early which meant that the fog had lifted early that was to their advantage with four enemies in the cave she didnt think that the wyrsa would venture an attack in broad daylight tad thinks theyre some kind of wyrsa maybe changed by the magestorms she told him theyre about the size of a horse and theyre black and i suppose you already know that they eat magic only too well skan groaned well to counter that advantage they seem to have lost their poison fangs and claws she said i dont think theyre going to try entrancing us again after the first time but if they start weaving in and around each other they can hypnotize you if you arent careful the wyrsa i used to hunt were better at it than that skan observed watching the bushes across the river tremble so theyve lost a couple of attributes and gained one could be worse one touch of those claws and you were in poor shape and that was with the houndsized ones a horsesized one would probably kill you just by scratching you lightly i suppose that counts as good news then she sighed i think this is a pack of youngsters led by one older female probably their mother we dont know how many there are two less than when they started though i dont know if you saw it but father got one tad got one a couple of days ago with a rockfall the problem is no trap works twice on them wyrsa the size of a horse skan muttered and shook his head terrible id rather have makaar i wonder what other pleasant surprises the magestorms left out here for us to find she shrugged right now this is the only one that matters its pretty obvious that the things breed and breed true so if we dont get rid of them one of these days theyll come looking for more magicmeals closer to our home she turned her gaze on skandranon for a moment and what did happen to your party other than what i can guess skandranon told her as tersely as she could have wished she hadnt known any of the silvers well except bern who had been her tracking teacher but it struck her that they had all acted with enormous stupidity and arrogance was it only because when they didnt meet with any immediate trouble that they assumed there wasnt anything to worry about between you and me my dear skandranon said in an undertone im afraid the late regin was an idiot i suspect that he assumed that since you were a green graduate probably hurt and female to boot you got into difficulties with what to him would have been minor opponents he was wary at first but when no armies and no renegade mages appeared he started acting as if this was a training exercise she tried not to think too uncharitably of the dead silver well we dont have much experience and it would be reasonable to think that we might have panicked and overreacted she said judiciously still id have thumped that filix over the head and tied him up once i found the wreck and knew there was something that ate magic about why attract attention to yourself good question skan replied i wish now id done just that his mournful expression filled in the rest she could read his thoughts in his eyes or was that her empathic sense operating if i had they might still be alive i should have pulled rank on them she turned her attention back to the outside for she felt distinctly uneasy having the black gryphon confess weakness even tacitly to her and yet she felt oddly proud he would not have let her see that if he were not treating her as an adult and an equal well what it all comes down to is this she said grimly no one is going to get us out of this except ourselves we have no way to warn anyone and what happened to you is entirely likely to happen to them unless theyre smarter than regin was oh that goes without sayingthe closest team to us is led by ikala skan saidrather slyly she thought and she clutched her hands on the shaft of the spear as her heart raced a little ikalaif i was going to be rescued by anyone she shook her head this was not some fanciful haighlei romance tale theyre still in danger and we cant warn them she repeated remember these damned things get smarter every time we do something i think they may even get smarter every time they eat more magic i doubt that theyre native so ikala wont know about them the best chance we all have to survive is if we four can eliminate these creatures before anyone else runs afoul of them if they do get nastier every time they eat something everyone out there could become victims for all we knowif they share intelligence as aubri saidthey may share their power among each other as they die off the fewer there are the more powerful the individuals might become she was afraid that skan might think she was an idiot for even thinking the four of them could take on the wyrsa pack as illequipped as they were but he nodded are you listening to this drake he called back into the cave to every word and i agree came the reply its insane of course to think that we can do that but were used to handling insanely risky business arent we old bird we are skan had actually mustered up a grin but amberdrake wasnt finished yet and whats more im afraid that trait runs in both families right tad a gusty sigh answered his question im afraid so the young gryphon replied with resignation like father like son skan winked at her the basic point is we have four excellent minds and four bodies to work on this well between your broken bones and our aching ones we probably have the equivalent of two healthy bodies rather than four but thats not so bad it could be worse blade thought about just a few of the many many ways in which it could be worse and nodded agreement of course there are many many ways in which it could be better too so while those two are back there involved in patching and mending let me get my sneaky old mind together with your resilient young one and lets see if we cant produce some more cleverer tactics he gryphgrinned at her and to her surprise she found herself grinning back thats it sir tad said from back in the cave thats all the weapons we have blade there was surprise in her fathers voice i thought you said that you didnt have a bow i did she left skan for a moment and trotted back to the fire to stare at the short bow and quiver of arrows in surprise where did that come from i brought it in my pack tad said sheepishly i know you said not to bring one because you couldnt use it buti dont know i thought maybe you might be able to pull it with your feet or something and if nothing else you could start a fire with it well she still cant use it but i can amberdrake said appropriating it he looked up at skan and his son you two get out there and start setting those traps before the sun goes down well get ready for the siege there would be a siege blade only hoped that the traps that the other two were about to set would whittle down the numbers so that the inevitable siege would be survivable if the mother wyrsa had been angry over the loss of a single young what would she be like when she lost several tad and skan were going out to set some very special single trapsand do it now while the wyrsa were at a distance they knew that the wyrsa had withdrawnprobably to huntbecause blade and her father had used their empathic abilities to locate the creatures it had been gutwrenching to do so but it had at least worked they hoped that the wyrsa would be out of sensing range of small magics because that was what they intended to use the bait and the trigger both would be a tiny bit of magic holding the whole thing together that was why it needed skan and tad to do the work they were physically stronger than blade and her father when the wyrsa ate the magic holding everything in place deadfalls would crush them sharpened wooden stakes would plunge through them nooses would snap around their legs and the rocks poised at the edge of the torrent would tumble in pulling them under the water and for the really charming trap another huge rockfall would obliterate the path and anything that was on it they would have to be very very clever the magic had to be so small that the wyrsa would have to be on top of it to sense it otherwise it would eat the magic from a distance triggering the trap without its killing anything meanwhile blade and her father gathered together every weapon in their limited arsenal for a last stand it has to be now she kept telling herself the wyrsa are nibbling away at tad and theyll do the same to skan the more they eat the stronger they get we have to goad them into attacking before theyre ready and keep them so angry that they rely on their instincts and hunting skills instead of thinking things over if we wait theres a chance the next party will bumble right into them that would be ikala and keenath and the idea that either of those two could be in danger made a fierce rage rise inside her along with determination to see that nothing of the kind happened spears the long ones and the short crude throwingspears that amberdrake was making with points of sharpened firehardened wood those were hers those and her fightingknife which was just a trifle shorter than a small sword amberdrake would take the bow his own fightingknife and his throwingknives she still had her sling and that could be useful at the right time there wasnt much but it was all useful enough when she had divided it into two piles hers and her fathers she sat down beside him at the fire to help him with the spears he made the points she firehardened them until the pile of straight wooden stakes was all used up then she took a single brand from the fire and he put it out she went all the way to the back of the cave and started a huge new fire there one of the objects being to make the wyrsa believe that they were farther back there than they actually were she piled about half of their wood the wettest lot around it this wood was going to have to dry out before it caught and she thought she had that timed about right its too bad this cave is stable she thought wistfully it would be nice to arrange to get them inside then drop the ceiling on them well in a way they were going to do that anyway she helped her father drag all of the rest of the driftwood that they had collected to the front of the cave and arrange it along the barricade there was quite a lot of it more than she remembered tad had certainly been busy and this had better work because we are using up all of our resources in one attempt what was it that judeth always told us never throw your weapon at the enemy i hope we arent doing that now but being cautious certainly hadnt gotten them anywhere strange how it was the younger pair that was so cautious and the older willing to bet everything on one blow periodically she or her father would stop close their eyes and open themselves to the wyrsa to check on their whereabouts it was amberdrake s turn to check when he cut his search short and put his fingers to his mouth to utter the earpiercing whistle they had agreed would be the call in signal skan came flying back low over the river with tad running on the trail a little behind him at that point the gloom of daylight had begun to thicken to the darkness of night and they were all ready to take their positions blade sent up a petition to the stareyed one that this would all work the stareyed only helps those who help themselves and those who have planned well dont need the stareyeds help always remember that blade if you havent done your best you have no reason to hope for the stareyeds help if it still goes bad she crouched down behind a screen of rock and dead brush away from their safe haven of nights past and waited her spearthrower in one hand three spears in the other she hadnt had time to practice and she only hoped that she could hit somewhere in her targets instead of off to one side of them from where she crouched she wouldnt have to make a fatal hit just a solid one and they would probably go into the river there was nowhere for them to hide even in the darkness because it wasnt going to be dark not completely skan had made a quick sortie across the river before they went off to set traps and had returned with rotten wood riddled with foxfire any time she saw one of the chunks of foxfire vanish she was supposed to throw they had planned as well as they could now it was just a matter of waiting and i never was very good at waiting she kept quiet tried not to fidget and listened for sounds up the trail skan had an advantage over all of the others he knew where each trap was because he felt the mageenergy and he would know as they were triggered because he would sense that too under any other circumstances the tiny bits of energy he and tad had invested in the triggers would have vanished in the overall flows of energies but with nothing around to mask them they glowed to him like tiny fires in the distance and he tensed as he felt the first of them go out that was the stranglingnoose he wished he had drakes empathic ability as well it would be nice to know if their trap had gotten anything they had been careful to set things that worked differentlythough hopefully the pups would venture over here slowly and would be so greedy to get at the bits of magic that none of them would realize that the magicbits and the traps had anything to do with each other the next one is the set of javelins and if theres a group it should take out several and theyll be cautious after they spring that one the javelins hidden under brush were far enough away from the trigger that he was fairly certain that the pups would make no connection between the two and there it goes in his minds eye another little glowing fire went out two down two to go one trap working from above one from in front one takes out a single pup one takes out several no pattern there and nothing in the way of a physical trigger to spot the next trap would take out a single pup again and it worked from the ground that would be the footnoose he felt his chest muscles tighten all over as he watched that little spark of energy and waited for the pups to regain their courage he knew that at least he and tad were safe from detection tonight theyd used up all but a fraction of their personal energies making the traps there was nothing to distract the pups from the bait time crawled by with legs of lead and he began to wonder if he and tad had done their work a little too well had he discouraged the pups or would the loss of several more goad them into enough rage to make them continue only blade and amberdrake knew the answer to that question and only if they had opened themselves up empathically again just when he was about to give upwhen in fact he had started to stand taking himself out of hiding the third spark died he crouched back down again quickly they all heardor rather feltthe fourth trap go it was the one that had originally been set with a crude stringtrigger that went into the cave when it went it would not only take several wyrsa with ithopefullybut it would have the unfortunate sideeffect of spreading rock out into the river widening the shelf in front of the cave but that couldnt be helped the rocks under him shook as the wyrsa triggered the last trapand he didnt need to be empathic to know that this final trap totally enraged them unlike the cries that they had uttered until now their earpiercing shrieks of pure rage as the remaining members of the pack poured over the rocks were clearly audible over the pounding water more than four but it was too late to do anything other than follow through on their plan with a scream of his own he dove off the cliff right down on the last ones back the head whipped around and the fangs sank into his shoulder just below where the wing joined his body he muffled his own screech of pain by sinking his own beak into the join of the creatures head and neck the thing wouldnt let go but neither would he it tried to dislodge him but he had all four sets of talons bound firmly into its shoulders and hindquarters in desperation it writhed and rolled and sank its fangs in up to the gumline he saw red in his vision again but clamped his beak down harder sawing at the things flesh as he did so he jerked his head toward his own keel digging the hook of his powerful beak even further through hide then muscle then cartilage the spine he had to sever the spine amberdrake stood up on his tiny shelf of rock and fired off arrow after arrow into the one wyrsa that had been unfortunate enough to cross his blob of foxfire the arrows themselves had been rubbed with phosphorescent fungus so once the first one lodged he had a real target hed throttled down any number of emotions as the wyrsa came closer and closer butstrangely enough now that he was fighting he felt a curious detached calm his concentration narrowed to the dark shape with an increasing number of glowing sticks in it his world constricted to placing his next arrow somewhere near the rest of those spots of dim light sooner or later he would hit something fatal he knew that he had when the shape bearing the sticks wobbled to the edge of the water wavered there for a moment then tumbled in he chose another as it crossed a blob of foxfire and began again tad was close enough to his father that he saw the difficulties skan was in at that point it didnt matter that it was not in the planhe surged out of hiding and pounced sinking his beak into the wyrsas throat and his foreclaws into its forelimbs a gush of something hot and foultasting flooded his mouth and the wyrsa collapsed under skans weight he let go spitting to rid himself of the taste of the wyrsas blood as skan shook himself free of the creatures head and staggered off to one side tad guarded him as he collected himself keeping the other wyrsa at bay with slashing talons then he wasnt alone anymore his father was fighting beside him good job skan called i owe you one then take the one on the left tad called back feeling a surge of pleasure that brought new energy with it only if you take the one on the right skan called back and launched himself at his next target tad followed in the same instant as if they had rehearsed the maneuver a thousand times together blades weapon was not as suited to rapid firing as her fathers and she had to choose her targets more carefully than he he had a great many arrows she had a handful of spears and not all of them flew cleanly but when she did connect her weapon was highly effective she sent three wyrsa tumbling into the river and wounded two more making them easier targets for skan and tad just as she ran out of short spears she sawand sensedthe moment that they had all been waiting for the bitchwvrsa was herding her remaining pups before her into the cave the two humans and two gryphons had abandoned she obviously intended to reverse the situation on her attackers by going to ground in what should have been their bolthole shes going in blade shouted she seized the longer of her two spears and jumped down to the ground a moment later her father joined her and with tad and skan they formed a halfcircle that cut off the wyrsa from escape the pups had clearly had enough now that they were all in the cave they were silhouetted clearly against the fire at the rear the pups about three of them milled about their mother they didnt like the fire but they didnt want to face the humans and gryphons either the wyrsabitch however was not ready to quit yet she surged from side to side in the cave never presenting a clear target and snarled at her pups it looked to blade as if she were trying to herd them into something she and amberdrake edged up farther into the cave following the plan in theory with the two weakest members of the party in plain sight the bitch should do what they wanted her to shes trying to goad them into a charge amberdrake shouted get ready blade grounded the butt of her spear against the rock hoping against hope that she wouldnt have to use it now drake shouted as the bitch herded her pups up onto the brush and rock barrier and at that signal skan and tad used the last of their mageenergy and ignited the oilsoaked wood of the barricade with a simple small firespell with the fire already going at the back of the cave there was a good draft going up the chimney the flames swept back and merged with the second fire at the rear the cave was an oven and the wyrsa were trapped inside the wyrsabitch turned and heaved herself at the barricade nearest blade her deadwhite eyes blazed rage as she stared at the human and blade felt her hatred burning even without being open empathically amberdrake dropped his spear it clattered to the ground as he seized his head in both hands his knees buckled and he fell in a convulsing heap without hesitation blade picked up her own spear aimed and threw the bitchwyrsa took it full in the chest and continued forward screaming defiance she heaved up into the air towering above all of them for a momentand blade was certain she was going to come over the barricade anyway blades heart pounded in her earsonly that sound and the sound of the wyrsa s scream louder than anything she had felt before the wyrsa fell forward but didnt leap the spear jutted from her chest only a quarter of its length in she stumbled forward in shock her forelegs crumpledand the butt of the crude spear struck the ground and drove itself in deeper blade fell into a crouch without hesitation and groped for her fightingknife but she could not take her eyes off the vision of the black wyrsa pitching backwards to be consumed in flame we won tad said for the hundredth time as the rain washed wyrsa blood from the rocks he locked his talons into another body and dragged it to the river to roll it in blade hoped that something in there would eat wyrsa and that the blasted things wouldnt poison the fish after the flames had died down they had all moved back into the cave to see what was left not much was recognizable compared to the bodies out side the cave but the skulls of the charred wyrsa were easily broken off for later cleaning the families of those people the creatures had killed were entitled to them perhaps for a revenge ceremony during mourning so the grisly task was done with solemn efficiency inside the rock was nicely warmed and the two exhausted fathers had a good comfortable place to lie down and get some rest meanwhile she and tad dragged their own weary bodies out into the rain again to clean up the mess this is the last one thank the gods blade said as she hauled the last of the beheaded bodies to the rivers edge together she and tad shoved it in and together they turned and walked back to the cave drake is burning some fish for you blade skan greeted them as they climbed over the rock barricade zhaneel would not approve by the way both the other rescueparties are near enough for mindspeech with me so we wont have to eat fish much longer blades heart surged with joyand then her throat tightened as she realized just how close the others must have been last night they could have walked right into the same kind of trap that my father did she thought soberly she had been wondering ever since yesterday evening if they were doing the right thing by trying an allornothing laststand now she knew they had been when will they get here tad asked eagerly as blade accepted fish from her father with a smile of thanks tomorrow probably your mother is thrilled blade tad your mother and brother would be flying in here now if it werent raining skan gryphgrinned at all of them i promised them that we would do our best not to melt before they got here that was probably safe blade agreed did you tell them anything other than that we were all safe skan ground his beak and dropped his head i confess i told them everything while they were still far enough away that your mothers couldnt flay us alive for risking all our necks last night he coughed i know my zhaneel and i suspect winterhart will react the same weary by the time they reach us they will be so grateful that we are all right that they will probably have forgotten that we took on all those wyrsa by ourselves amberdrake winced maybe zhaneel willbut winterhart wont he said guiltily and shell never forgive me for acting like a hotheaded young fighter and standing on a ledge in the dark firing arrows into the damned things and if i actually admit that iwelli was good at it blade patted his knee and smiled as a rush of love filled her heart dont worry father she said fondly ill protect you for the first time in days if not weeks tad lay on a ledge in the open sunning himself finally finally the rains had lessened last night and although the fog had appeared on schedule the rain had not chased it away it looked as if the weather was getting back to normal tad whooped and leaped off his ledge to gallop toward his brother keeth arrowed in for a landing down on the recentlyadded stretch of rockandgravel beach in front of the cave a moment later as tad and his brother closed on each other for the gryphonic equivalent of a backslapping reunion the mothers party appeared around the curve of the trail now it was blades turn to launch herself off her ledge and run straight into the arms of her mother while amberdrake brought up the rear tad grinned to his twin as they watched his silver partner hugging her mother and even shedding a few tears she was acting just as any normal human would in the same situation and about time too things settled down a little and winterhart paused to wipe a couple of happy tears as the second party rounded the bend with a gasp blade broke off her conversation with her mother to run straight for the leader of the party ikala looked surprised but extremely pleased when she threw her arms around himand it would have taken an expert to determine if she kissed him first or he kissed her tad took a quick look at amberdrake and winterhart they looked stunned but gradually the surprise was being replaced byglee probably now theyre finally going to get their wish after all what is that all about keeth gurgled shes never done that before tad laughed oh it has been a complicated mess but i think i can explain it drake sees her as a real person nownot just as his daughter his child theyve fought alongside each other now sheswell now she knows who she is that shes not a reflection of drake or her mother and that she doesnt have to work so hard at being their opposite itswell shes free free to be herself and you keeth asked shrewdly tad laughed after seeing father in action i cant say i mind being the son of the black gryphon anymore and now he has fought beside me and he knows there is more to me than obstacle courses and fatherly pride word will get around and then he will have to cope with being referred to as the father of that brave silver i guess thats justice keeth grinned and leaned against his brother that should give us all some rest and freedom freedom he thought with content thats what it is all right freedom
