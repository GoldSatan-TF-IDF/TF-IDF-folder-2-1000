jack du brul vulcans forge may the moon was a millimetric sliver hanging in the night sky like an ironic smile a gentle easterly breeze smeared the acrid feather of smoke that coiled from the single funnel of the ore carrier grandam phoenix the pacific swells rolled the ponderous ship as easily as a lazy hammock on a summer afternoon as she cruised two hundred miles north of the hawaiian islands the tranquility of the night was about to be shattered the grandam phoenix was on her maiden voyage having slipped down the ways in kobe japan just two months earlier her final fitting and sea trials had been rushed so that she could begin paying off the massive debts incurred by the company during her construction built with the latest technological advances in safety and speed she was an example of the new breed of specialized cargo ship the second world war had taught that the efficiency of a specialized vessel far outweighed the cost in its design and construction the owners maintained that their newest ship would prove that these principles worked as well for civilian craft as they did for the military the footlong ore carrier was to become the flagship of the line as the shipping business greedily expanded into the booming pacific markets soon after taking command of the grandam phoenix captain ralph linc learned that the owners had a very different fate in store for their newest ship from the one proposed to her underwriters not long after the development of maritime insurance unscrupulous owners and crews intentionally began scuttling their vessels in order to collect often substantial claims the underwriters had no recourse but to pay out unless someone usually a crew member feeling twinges of guilt came forward with the truth for sinking the ore carrier the crew of the grandam phoenix would receive bonuses large enough to ensure their silence if the swindle worked and there seemed no reason it wouldnt the owners were looking at a settlement not only for the twentymilliondollar value of the vessel but also that of her cargo listed as bauxite ore from malaysia but in reality worthless yellow gravel captain linc held true to his genre a tough man with a whiskey and cigarettetortured voice and fargazing eyes standing squarely as his ship rolled with the seas he ground out his lucky strike and lit another linc had served in the us merchant marine all through world war ii with losses rivaled only by the marine corps the merchant marine seemed to be the service for maniacs or suicides yet linc had managed not only to survive but flourish by he had his own command running troops and material to the hellfires of the pacific theater unlike most of his contemporaries he never once lost a vessel to the enemy at wars end he like many others found that there were too many men and too few ships during the late forties and early fifties linc became just another yankee prowling the far east taking nearly any command offered to him he ran questionable cargoes for shadowy companies and learned to keep his mouth shut when first approached by the phoenixs owners linc had thought he was being offered the opportunity of a lifetime no longer would he have to scrounge for a ship prostituting his integrity to remain at sea they were giving him a chance once again to be the proud captain the master of their flagship it wasnt until the contracts had been signed that the company told linc about the predestined fate of his vessel it took two days and a sizable bonus for his bitterness to give way to acceptance now stationed on the bridge a cup of cooling coffee in a weathered hand linc stared at the dark sea and cursed he hated the corporate people who could arbitrarily decide to scuttle such a great ship they didnt understand the bond between captain and vessel for the sake of profit they were about to destroy a beautiful living thing the idea sickened linc to the bone he hated himself for accepting for allowing himself to be part of such a loathsome act position ralph linc barked before the position could be given a crewman stooped over the radar repeater and said in a remote voice contact twelve miles dead ahead linc glanced at the chronometer on the bulkhead to his left the contact would be the rendezvous vessel that would pick up the crew after the phoenix was gone they were right on time and in position good work men he had been given very specific and somewhat strange orders concerning the location course and time that he was to sink his ship he assumed the north pacific had been chosen because of her unpredictable weather patterns the weather here could turn deadly without a moments notice building waves that could swamp a battleship and whipping up winds that literally tore the surface from the ocean when the time came for the insurance inquiry the rendezvous vessel would corroborate any story they manufactured you know the drill gentlemen linc growled lighting a cigarette from the glowing tip of his last engines all stop helm bring us to ninetysevenpointfive degrees magnetic this precise but inexplicable positioning of the vessel complied exactly with lincs final orders from the head office they had given no reason for this action and linc knew enough not to pry the engine speed was reduced the rhythmic throb diminished until it was almost imperceptible the ships wheel blurred as the young seaman cranked it around helm were coming up on ninetyseven degrees sir as ordered range eleven miles linc picked up the radio hand mike and dialed in the shipboard channel now hear this weve reached position all crew not on duty report to the lifeboats engineering emergency shutdown of the boilers and open the seacocks on my mark prepare to abandon ship he looked around the bridge slowly his eyes burning every detail of her into his brain im sorry sweetheart he mumbled ten miles the radar man called open the seacocks abandon ship linc replaced the mike and pressed a button on the radio a klaxon began to wail the cry of a dying woman linc thought linc waited on the bridge while the crew filed out to the boat deck he had to spend a little time alone with the ship before he left her he grasped the rung of the oaken wheel the wood was so new that he felt slivers pricking at his skin never would this wheel achieve the smooth patina of use instead it would become so much rot on the bottom of the ocean goddamn it linc said aloud then strode from the bridge gone were the days of men scampering down cargo netting into boats bobbing on the surface of the sea ocean freight and cargo had spared no expense in outfitting their flagship with every modern safety device one lifeboat was already full of men and up on the davits the winchman waited for a curt nod from linc before lowering the boat to the sea below the warm night breeze blew smoke from lincs cigarette into his eyes as he climbed into the second lifeboat the other men in the boat with him were subdued ashen they didnt talk or look each other in the eye as linc nodded to the winchman the winchman threw a toggle switch and the pulleys that lowered the lifeboat began to whine the boat hit the calm surface with a whitefrothed splash instantly two men stood up to detach the cables that secured them to the sinking ore carrier captain linc took charge of the lifeboat grasping the tiller in his right hand while applying power to the idling engine the boat motored away from the grandam phoenix the crew craning their necks to watch their sinking ship the klaxon echoed emptily across the waves it took fifteen minutes for the ships list to become noticeable but after that she went quickly the stern lifted from the water her two ferrobronze propellers gleaming in the low light the watching men heard her boilers let go of their mounts and slam through the engine room bulkheads the screeching hiss that followed was the sound of thousands of tons of gravel pouring across the vessels gunwales into the ocean linc refused to watch his ship die he kept his eyes trained ahead steering toward the dim lights of the distant rendezvous ship yet every time he heard a new sound from the grandam phoenixs death throes he cringed the rendezvous ship was not large a ninetyfoot general cargo freighter the type referred to as a stick ship by seamen because her decks were studded with a forest of cranes and derricks her boxy superstructure stood amidships her straight funnel atop it as the two lifeboats approached linc could make out about a dozen men on her port rail he guided his boat toward them captain linc i presume a voice called down cheerily im linc the reply was the rapid fire of ten sovietmade ppsh submachine guns the snail drums of the weapons could hold fifty rounds and the gunmen emptied them all into the lifeboats the cacophony of shouts and screams shots and ricochets was deafening blood pooled on the floorboards of the boats its sweet smell mingling with the cloud of cordite smoke linc looked up at the ship bloodied and dazed astounded that he was still alive anger fear and pain boiled in his mind but the emotions and sensations were being driven back by darkness the gunmen lowered their weapons one by one as the bolts slammed into empty chambers the lifeboat was a charnel scene of blood and mutilation the water pouring in through the holed floor sloshed in a pink froth in moments both lifeboats capsized spilling corpses into the ocean packs of sharks circled eagerly the lone unarmed man on deck had watched the massacre with flat appraising eyes though not yet thirty he carried an air of authority held by only a few even twice his age when the lifeboats capsized he nodded to the commander of the gunmen and went into the freighters superstructure minutes later he ducked into the ships hold the lights of the computing and sonar equipment packed into the cramped hold gave his skin an alien pallor depth of the target ship he snapped at one of the technicians bent over a sonar scope the target ship was of course the grandam phoenix as she plunged to the distant bottom the sonarman didnt look up from his equipment six thousand feet sinking at a thousand feet every seven minutes the man glanced at his watch and jotted down some numbers on a pad after a brief pause he looked at his watch again two minutes from my mark the hold was noisy the sound of the ships diesel generators filtered in through the steel walls and the air conditioners necessary to cool the computers sounded like aircraft propellers yet the seven men in the room could have sworn that during those two minutes there was not a sound in the world they were too focused on their jobs to notice any distractions mark the young man said with a casualness that was not forced another crewman flipped several switches nothing happened the civilian counted down under his breath four three two one the shock wave started nearly seven thousand feet below the surface and had to travel a further ten miles to reach the ship yet it struck only five seconds after detonation billions of gallons of water had been vaporized in a fireball with temperatures reaching degrees the main wave rushed to the surface at miles per hour and threw up a dome of water half a mile across the dome hung in the air for a full ten seconds gravity fighting inertia then collapsed thunderously filling the sixthousandfoot deep hole in the pacific ocean caught in a manmade charybdis the freighter tossed and pitched as if she were in a hurricane her hull nearly out of the water one moment and almost swamped the next the young man the architect of such destruction feared for a moment that he had cut the margin too thin placed his ship too close to the epicenter before his concern could crack the glacial facade of his face the sea began to calm the huge waves leveled out and the gale wind created when the ocean fell back on itself dissipated it took the young man a few minutes to reach the deck of the freighter for she still rolled dangerously on the horizon a blanket of steam clung to the sea and glowed luminously in the weak moonlight i have laid the foundation of vulcans forge washington dc present day the only thing that the president really enjoyed about his new job was his chair in the oval office it had a high back and soft seat and was made of the most supple leather he had ever felt often he would sit in that chair after all of the staff had gone home and remember his simpler youth he had achieved the most powerful office on the planet fulfilling his lifelong ambition but sometimes he thought the price had been too high the college sweetheart he had married had been turned into an emotionless automaton by the pressures of her husbands career the vast network of friends he had built during the years had become sycophants groveling for favors and his once perfect health had deteriorated so he felt ten years older than his sixtytwo he would sit some nights with all the lights off so the network watchdogs across the street wouldnt think the president was burning the midnight oil and he would think about his younger days growing up outside of cincinnati he missed guzzling beer with his hotrodding friends shooting trick pool to impress overly madeup plump girls and saying whatever came to mind when someone pissed him off a perfect example of why he longed for that puerile freedom was seated opposite him in full african splendor robes and headband and sandals he was the ambassador to one of the new central african nations a tall man with sarcastic eyes and a complacent attitude about nearly everything that they had discussed the ambassador was saying with a dismissive wave of his hand that the intelligence gathered by the red cross the united nations and the cia was all false that his government was not involved in any type of tribal genocide through starvation or the intentional spread of disease he insisted that his government was committed to all tribes under their care and all the people suffered not just the smaller less politically influential tribes bullshit the president wanted to shout and slap the smug smile off the ambassadors face but convention stopped him instead he would have to spout some platitude such as we havent seen your situation in just that fashion but it bears further investigation a glow under the lip of his desk caught the presidents eye the situation light a signal from his chief of staff in the six months of his term this was the only time other than routine weekly tests that the light had been switched on the last time the light had been used officially was during the soviet coup in august of the president stood up quickly his professional smile masking his consternation he extended his right hand and the ambassador knew that he was being dismissed we havent seen your situation in just that fashion but it bears further investigation thank you mr ambassador thank you mr president for being so generous with your time the ambassador replied sourly hed been promised another half hour they shook hands briefly the ambassador turned in a whirl of robes and left the oval office the president sat back down and had time to rub his temples for a second before the other door to the oval office opened expecting the angular figure of his chief of staff catherine smith the president was surprised to see richard henna dick henna was the new director of the fbi one of the only important presidential appointees that congress had so far approved as always selfserving political squabbling in the house was holding up the work of the federal government and costing the taxpayers tens of millions of dollars henna was a career snoop who had managed never to step on the wrong toes he had plodded his way through thirty years in the bureau never grabbing headlines but always garnering respect he had an exemplary family life a modest slice of suburbia to call home and absolutely no skeletons in any closet knowing of his reputation the opposition party in congress had not bothered with any serious investigation into his past the president who liked henna for his unshakable integrity smiled when he saw the director enter his office the smile faded when he realized that henna never a neat man looked terrible his eyes were puffy and bloodshot the jowled lines of his face were blurred behind thick stubble his suit was rumpled his shirt looked as if it had been slept in and his tie was cocked off and stained you look like you could use some coffee dick the president tried to put cheer into his voice to penetrate the air of gloom that had permeated his office his effort was as effective as a candle in a dark forest i could use something a bit stronger sir the president nodded toward the regency table which acted as a bar and henna helped himself to a triple scotch henna slumped into the seat opposite the president the one formerly occupied by the african ambassador settling his attache case on his lap henna opened it and withdrew a thin violet file the file was stamped peo presidents eyes only whats going on dick the president had never seen henna so morose sir henna started shakily this morning just after midnight the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration ship ocean seeker was reported missing about two hundred miles north of hawaii search planes have been dispatched and found only debris in the water a nearby freighter is assisting in the search but so far it doesnt look promising the president had gone slightly pale his fingers clenched he had not obtained this office by being overly emotional and his mind was clear and sharp thats a terrible tragedy dick but i dont see how it concerns you or the fbi henna would have been surprised had the president not asked that question he handed the file across the desk and took a sip of scotch please read the top sheet the president opened the file and began to read seconds later the blood drained from his patricians face and tension lines around his eyes tightened so that he squinted at the paper before he finished reading henna spoke that was brought to my attention two days ago after it was proven to be ohnishis handwriting and not written under duress when i received it i checked with the coast guard and the navy they didnt have any scheduled traffic to or from the islands so i figured we had a little breathing room hennas voice broke i didnt check with noaa i forgot all about them i had been warned that any government ship steaming outward from hawaii would be destroyed i had a goddamn warning those people didnt have to die the president looked up pain and guilt and failure were etched into hennas face take it easy dick how many people know about this three besides the two of us a mailroom clerk my deputy director marge doyle and a handwriting analyst the president glanced at his watch ive got lunch with the speaker of the house and if i cancel it i dont want to think about the consequences the rest of my day is booked solid well keep things normal here in washington but ill have all naval traffic to and from hawaii suspended just like this letter demands im not about to give in to ohnishi but we need the time im also going to put the military at pearl harbor on full alert theyve been on standby ever since the rioting started two weeks ago but i think it prudent to up their readiness status lets meet tonight at nine in the situation room to discuss the situation and our possible responses use the tunnel from the treasury building so you dont arouse suspicion yes sir is there anything you want me to do in the meantime henna was regaining his composure i assume youve already started a full background check on takahiro ohnishi henna nodded find out what hes all about were all well aware of his racial views but this is an outrage also i want to know where he got the capability to destroy one of our ships someone is supplying him with arms and i want it stopped yes sir henna replied and left the office the president touched the intercom button on his desk joy craig his personal secretary answered instantly joy set up a meeting in the situation room for nine oclock tonight call in the chairman of the joint chiefs the directors of the cia nsa and noaa the secretary of state and the secretary of defense most of those men were only acting heads until their confirmation but this crisis warranted trusting them as if they were already sworn into their respected offices the president sank back into his chair his face blank and stared at the gold braidtrimmed american flag near the office door in his lap his hands trembled the rain looked like christmas tinsel in the headlights of the taxi parked outside an arlington virginia brownstone the passenger gave the driver a crisp fifty and told him to keep the change the back door opened and in the glow of the domelight the man grabbed the handles of his two soft leather bags and exited the cab philip mercer had always believed that international airports were a type of stateless limbo sovereign nations allied only to each other with no allegiance to their host countries his flight had touched down at dulles an hour and a half earlier yet he only now felt that hed returned to the united states although the cool rain soothed his dried sinuses mercer still groaned as he inevitably tried the wrong key on the baldwin lock of the front door he no longer wondered why he always tried the wrong key when his arms were full yet chose the right one when they were empty home at last mercer thought as he stepped into the foyer of his house then chuckled in the five years he had lived here this was the first time that he had ever thought of the brownstone as home must be settling down he chided himself mildly from the outside the brownstone was as innocuous as the fifteen others on his side of the block yet once through the door any similarity to the other sconstructed row houses ended mercer had gutted the threestory building and completely redesigned the interior from a thirtyfoothigh entry that took up the front third of the seventyfivefootdeep building mercer could see up to the secondfloor library and further up to his master bedroom an ornate curved staircase salvaged from a nineteenthcentury rectory connected the three levels all of the furniture was in place yet the house still lacked many of the personal items that would make it a home tables and shelves were empty of mementos and the walls were barren of pictures the design of the house showed much of the character of its sole occupant but many of his subtleties lay hidden in cardboard boxes mercer dropped his bags near the front door and walked across the little used formal living room toward the back of the house passing an oakpaneled billiard room and the kitchen he went into his home office and slid his slim briefcase across the wide leathertopped desk he used the back stairs to climb to the second floor and on the landing he swore under his breath the television in the rec room was on the volume barely a mutter the lights around the mahogany bar had been muted to an amber glow snores rose from a blanketed lump on the couch mercer walked behind the bar and placed a clapton disc into the player with a wicked smile he pressed play and turned the stereo to maximum volume the carver speakers rattled the bottles and glasses behind the bar harry white woke with a sudden jerk mercer turned off the stereo and laughed i said you could use my house when i was away you bastard not move in harry looked at mercer with owl eyes his withered face still scrunched up with sleep he peered around at the overflowing ashtray on the coffee table the plates of congealed food and the two empty jack daniels bottles welcome back mercer i didnt expect you till tomorrow harrys voice sounded like a rock crusher with a thrown gear obviously not mercer smirked nice party harry ran his fingers through his gray crew cut i dont really remember mercer laughed again an infectious laugh that despite what must have been a powerful hangover made harry smile mercer pulled two heinekens from the circa locklevered refrigerator next to the stereo rack and opened them with the brass puller tucked under the ornately carved backbar he drained one in four long gulps and started to sip the second how was the trip harry asked lighting a cigarette good but exhausting i did seven lectures in six days all over south africa plus met with a couple of top engineers from one of the rand mining firms rain rattled the darkened windows philip mercer was a mine engineer and consultant according to those in the industry he was the best in the world his ideas and advice were sought by nearly every corporation in the business the fees he charged were astronomical but the companies never balked at the bills because their return on his input always paid off over the years dozens of firms had tried to hire mercer exclusively but he respectfully declined always replying the same way my answer is also my reason no thank you he liked the freedom to say no whenever he wished his abilities and independent status gave him latitude to live his life by his own eccentric standards and to tell the occasional executive to shove it when the need arose of course that freedom had been hard won he had started out working for the united states geological survey just after receiving his phd for two years he did mostly routine inspections of mining facilities which were cooperating with the usgs as seismic centers the work was dull repetitive and pointless mercer began to feel that his sharp intellect was being blunted by the ponderous weight of the federal bureaucracy fearing some kind of brain atrophy he quit recognizing that the independent streak which more or less dominated his personality would never allow him to work for any one organization for an extended period mercer decided to go into business for himself he saw himself as a hired gun to help out in difficult situations but many others in the industry saw him as an unwanted interloper it took seven months and countless phone calls to former instructors at penn state and the colorado school of mines before he landed his first consulting job confirming assay reports on a sizable alaskan gold strike for a swiss investment consortium the threemonth job paid twice what his annual government salary had been and he never looked back from that point the next job had been in namibia and the mine had been for uranium within a few years he had built up the reputation he now enjoyed and commanded the fees to which he had grown accustomed ironically he had just accepted a temporary position at the usgs as a private sector consultant to liaise with major american mining concerns for the smooth implementation of the presidents new environmental bill and discuss this plan for possible adoption by some foreign companies his career was coming full circle in a way but this time through the governments grist mill hed be walking away in two months with no strings attached you look like shit harry observed mercer glanced down at his wrinkled hugo boss suit and clammyfeeling shirt two days of dark beard shadowed the decisive line of his jaw you spend twenty hours on an airliner and see how you look harry swung his leg off the couch and grabbed a fleshcolored piece of plastic from the floor with three deft movements that his nearly eightyyearold hands didnt seem capable of he strapped the prosthetic leg on just below his knee and flexed the articulating ankle much better he tugged down the cuff of his pants stood and walked casually over to the bar without the slightest trace of a limp mercer poured him a whiskey ive seen you do that a hundred times and it still gives me the creeps you have no respect for the physically challenged i think that is the new politically correct term youre a decrepit old man who probably had his leg shot off by a jealous husband as you leapt from his wifes boudoir the two men had met the night mercer moved into the area harry was a fixture at the neighborhood bar tinys a place mercer discovered to be a sublime distraction from unpacking ten years of eclectic junk collected from all over the world the unlikely pair became best friends that night in the five subsequent years harry no matter how drunk had never told mercer how hed lost the leg and mercer had enough respect to never pry youre just jealous that your body doesnt make a good conversation piece in bed harry i dont pick up women at the exit to circus freak tents mercer retorted harry conceded the point and asked for another drink if anyone had been listening the next hours conversation would have seemed as if it were between bitter enemies the sarcastic remarks and biting jokes sometimes got downright vicious but both men enjoyed this verbal jousting which was often the main source of entertainment at tinys a little after midnight age and whiskey forced harry to a tactful retreat to the couch where he promptly fell asleep mercer despite the jet lag and beer still felt refreshed and knew any attempt to sleep would be futile he decided to get some office work done his home office was all rich leather and oiled woods forest green carpet and polished brass other than the bar it was the only truly finished room in the brownstone he knew that the decor was somewhat cliche but he liked it just the same the numerous prints on the walls were of heavy mining equipment walking draglines huge dump trucks and skeletal drilling derricks that towered eight stories each print was signed with a thanks from the president or owner of some company that mercer had helped on the credenza discreetly lighted from below was a large chunk of opaque blue stone mercers hand caressed it as he walked to his desk he had phoned his secretary at the usgs from jan smuts airport in johannesburg and had asked her to fax all of his memos and messages to his house knowing that insomnia always followed an international flight there were at least fifty sheets of paper in the tray of the fax machine the majority could be ignored for at least a few days only a couple had any urgency at all working through the pile quickly he almost missed the significance of one sheet from the deputy director of operations at the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration it was an invitation dated six days earlier to work aboard the noaa research vessel ocean seeker in an investigation of an unknown geologic phenomenon off the coast of hawaii the deputy director had requested mercers presence because of the paper he had written two years earlier on the use of geothermic vents as possible energy sources and rich mining areas mercer had heard of the tragic loss of the ship with all hands it had made the newspapers even in south africa the invitation itself was not the cause of his racing heart or shallow breathing at the bottom of the invitation was a list of the specialists already assigned to the survey the first name was dr tish talbot marine biologist mercer had never met tish but her father was a good friend a man to whom mercer owed his life following a plane crash in the alaska range mercer had been returning from his first private consulting job when his plane had suddenly lost power the pilot had been killed landing in a rockstrewn field and mercer had broken a leg a wrist and a bunch of ribs jack talbot a grizzled tool pusher on the north slope fields at prudhoe bay had been camping near the crash site on a oneweek leave talbot had reached mercer within ten minutes of the crash and tended him overnight until he could signal a rescue copter with a flare salvaged from the wrecked plane the two men had seen each other infrequently in the years since then but their friendship lasted and now jacks only daughter was dead a victim of a terrible accident mercer empathized with his friend feeling hollow inside when he imagined the pain that jack must now be facing mercer had known such pain losing his parents when he was only a boy but no parent ever thinks that they will outlast their child many say that that is the worst kind of agony mercer turned off his desk lamp he left harry on the couch in the rec room not wanting to kick his friend out at two in the morning mercers huge bed didnt really look inviting but he made the effort anyway his sleep was fitful hawaii jill tzu eased on the brake of her honda prelude and slipped the transmission into neutral her car slowed to a stop about twenty yards away from the main gates of takahiro ohnishis estate she tilted the rearview mirror downward until her mouth was in sight and deftly applied another slick layer of lipstick she pursed her lips flashed a professional smile to herself then opened her mouth wide satisfied that the makeup was perfect she canted the mirror back as a female reporter she knew the necessity of a glamorous appearance on camera despite her abhorrence of such sexism she was pragmatic enough to know that she alone wasnt about to change the custom yet it wasnt her stunning beauty or her dancers legs that got her this interview today it was her heritage takahiro ohnishi was easily the wealthiest man in hawaii in fact he was the twelfth richest man in the world with interests as diverse as real estate medical research shipping and mining he had offices on six continents seven palatial homes and nearly thirty thousand employees despite the global aspects of his holdings he remained rooted in one tradition that of japan he had built his empire on an ethnic pyramid with himself a native born japanese on top and his key managers at least pure japanese regardless of their country of birth the next level down had to be threequarters japanese or more and so on until only the lowliest of workers had no japanese blood at all ohnishi employed two entire law firms to battle the hundreds of cases of discrimination filed against his companies to date they had not lost a single case his obsession with his japanese heritage consumed his personal life as well ohnishi had never married but the numerous mistresses who had come and gone during his seventy years were all japanese if he found even the slightest trace of any other heritage the affair would end on the spot all the servants in all his homes were japanese and even his rare press interviews had to be conducted by reporters who were at least half japanese and that brings us to me thought jill tzu the daughter of a hong kong chinese banker and a japanese interpreter she eased her car into gear and approached the wrought iron gates of ohnishis principal american residence the house twenty miles northwest of honolulu was isolated by acres of sugarcane fields and pineapple plantations once asked why he remained so secluded ohnishi responded honestly everyone i need is brought to me why should i scurry around a lean guard approached her car jill lowered the window getting a delightful mixture of cool auto airconditioning and hot lush air the first thing she noticed was the automatic pistol slung from the guards hip and the quality and cut of his uniform this was no simple rentacop yes he said courteously jill tzu from khna im here to interview mr ohnishi of course the guard replied he pressed a button on one of the pillars supporting the gates and they slid open silently jill accelerated surprised that she hadnt been asked for identification the crushed limestone drive leading to the house was a pristine white trail through a vast emerald lawn the drive curved around stands of trees and shrubs artfully placed so the house was hidden until she rounded the last bend when she saw the building she was stunned jill had expected traditional japanese architecture on a grand scale yet what was before her was unlike anything she had ever seen before takahiro ohnishi lived in a glass house modeled somewhat like the entrance to the louvre designed by i m pei but much much larger tubular steel struts supported small panels of glass in a framework that could only be described as obtuse spheres cones and slabsided rectangles melded together in a multisided building that was not displeasing to view jill could see completely through the home to the shallow valley which stretched beyond still not over her initial shock jill drove up to the portecochere and slid out her heels clicked against the white inlaid marble as she walked toward the glass front doors just as she reached them they were opened by a servant miss tzu mr ohnishi is waiting for you in the breakfast garden would you please follow me the butler was japanese of course wearing a somber black livery reminiscent of the early part of the century thank you she replied slinging her purse over her shoulder the interior spaces of the house were broken by stark geometrical walls the structures were not bound by any normal parameters of construction some hung ten feet or more in the air and others were mere ripples across the floor the foyer was a massive open space domed by a delicate lattice of steel and glass that cast a spiderweb shadow on the white marble floor stairs landings and balconies cantilevered into the foyer as if defying gravity having no basis of comparison jill simply assumed that the decidedly oriental watercolors and paintings on the walls were priceless the butler led her through several rooms some traditional japanese and some western in style at the open doors of an elevator the butler indicated that jill was to proceed alone mr ohnishi is waiting to the right as you exit the elevator there was a discreet chime and the doors slid closed feeling like an ant in the bottom of a kitchen sink jill smoothed her cream skirt against her legs as the brushed stainless steel elevator sedately ascended when it stopped jill stepped onto a breezy loggia forty feet above the ground she turned to her right and saw a table set for two people the silver glinting in the early pacific light i am delighted to be able to share my breakfast with you miss tzu takahiro ohnishi said as he stood i am delighted that you invited me jill replied walking toward the table she extended her hand which ohnishi ignored pissed at herself jill remembered whom she was dealing with and bowed deeply ohnishi replied with the barest nod of his head wont you sit down ohnishi did not look like an industrialist he was thin and frail with a voice made tenuous by the years his snowy hair was sparse revealing red blotches of scalp his face was cadaverous sallow and drawn his hands were darkly liverspotted and bony like the claws of a small bird miss tzu i did not invite you i merely caved in to your persistence one hundred and fourteen calls and seventyeight letters are enough to make any man capitulate jill believed the comment was meant to be charming but his flat delivery made her uncomfortable in fact ohnishi made her uncomfortable he looked like a corpse that refused to stop moving she smiled her best reporters smile im glad you did any longer and the station was going to make me pay for the stamps i was using a servant appeared and poured coffee into her cup adding one spoonful of sugar jill looked at him queerly wondered how he knew she took her coffee this way i know much more than that miss tzu otherwise i would have never let you on the grounds ohnishi said reading her expression possibly her mind for all she knew is that why no one asked to see my id or search me when i came here she meant the question to be friendly but it sounded almost defensive i had you followed from your home at blossom tree court in the muani condominium development in fact ive had you followed every day since granting this interview ohnishi said so casually that jill could not respond for a moment did you learn anything interesting she said sarcastically her anger now beginning to rise yes a lovely successful woman like you needs to get out more jills anger evaporated at his reply thats the same thing my mother tells me much later jill realized his use of her mothers exact words was no coincidence i am sorry if my actions make you uncomfortable but a man in my position must be cautious i understand i dont particularly like it but i understand the servant reappeared and placed a bowl of fruit in front of jill again he gave nothing to ohnishi as my aide kenji told you on the phone i do not allow cameras on my property nor is this conversation to be recorded it wont be i assure you jill said setting her coffee cup into its saucer fearful of spilling anything on the crisp linen cloth or cracking the translucent porcelain she did not realize that she had been xrayed twice since entering ohnishis home once at the front door and again in the elevator her verbal assurances were superfluous i must say this is an amazing home jill remarked to break the silence believe it or not this structure was designed in by an obscure tokyo architect long before the technology was available for its construction he took his own life only a few months after completing the drawings knowing that his genius would never be appreciated in his time it is supposition on my part but i believe he thought his suicide would give his work the immortality it would never receive through construction i did not know that you were such a student of history everything we know miss tzu is history just because it is not taught in schools from dusty texts does not lessen any informations importance i dont think i understand allow me to explain the latest piece of information no matter how current is already history i can look at a stock ticker as the trading goes on and already the information im seeing is history maybe its only a second old but the events have already happened and nothing in my power can change them if i decide to buy or sell based on that information i would be basing that choice on history all knowledge is like that and all decisions are made that way what if i decide to do something on a whim such as i dont know say quit my job in that case you would have a history of job dissatisfaction a knowledge based on past performance that you could find another job and confidence that you have put sufficient money in a bank to ensure security until you begin working again all of these factors make your decision not whimsical at all but rather calculating in fact i never thought about it in that way jill said intrigued that is why you are not worth eight billion dollars and i am ohnishi remarked not boastful just stating the truth i asked your assistant if there were any taboo subjects for this interview and he assured me that you would be candid about anything i asked that is true the servant cleared jills fruit plate and brought a silver salver of raw fish and thinly sliced beef he placed some on her plate along with rice and several varieties of seaweed arent you eating mr ohnishi jill asked after the servant vanished again leaving his plate empty my stomach and some of my small intestine were removed several years ago after i was diagnosed with cancer miss tzu im afraid i must eat intravenously i may sample some of these dishes later but i cant swallow them it is an unpleasant sight i assure you jill was thankful he did not get more graphic i know your basic biography mr ohnishi jill began the formal interview a waterman pen poised over her notebook you were born in osaka but your parents immigrated to the united states with your two older sisters when you were an infant your father was a chemical engineer working for uc at san diego correct ohnishi interrupted my family all died during world war two when roosevelt imprisoned all japanese nationals my sisters died of typhus they were barely into their teens my mother died soon afterward of the same disease the day he took his own life my father told me to never forget them i was seventeen years old you had an uncle who became your legal ward yes his name was chuichi genda if i read this correctly jill said looking through her notes he was released from an internment camp in january arrested one week later released again at the end of the war and spent the remainder of his life in and out of prisons on various charges yes my uncle had very strong beliefs about america and her treatment of our people both during the war and after he often led violent campaigns against various policies he was charged with inciting riots three times and convicted twice he was without a doubt the most influential person in my life in what way his ideas on race principally and what are those jill asked uncrossing her long legs she knew that this was the most important part of her interview you are a journalist surely you are aware of my views i know youve been called a racist by nearly every social group in the united states and that your hiring policies resemble nazi purity laws ohnishi laughed a high thin note that startled jill for lack of a better word miss tzu you are very naive there is no such thing as racism before jill could voice a protest ohnishi continued according to anthropologists there are only four races on this planet asian negro caucasian and aboriginal yet there is tension and fighting between hundreds of different groups correct he did not wait for a reply if race is a motivating factor as you in the press imply why is there so much fighting in the nations of africa why do the english and irish bomb each other on a regular basis why did the nazis gas six million jews the answer is not racism its tribalism there may be only four races but there are hundreds of different tribes maybe thousands many groups still maintain a tribal name such as the apache or zulu but numerous groups no longer have distinct names the white anglosaxon here in america the northern irish protestants or the upper class of brazil each group is fighting to maintain the integrity of their tribe the french and germans are two separate tribes of people culturally and religiously different yet each falling into the caucasian race there is only one way to account for the four wars they have fought since the middle of the last century tribalism the need to protect and ensure the security in perpetuity of ones immediate group just because interracial strife makes good press does not make it the most common form i will deny until my death that i am a racist i care nothing for race i am a tribalist and my tribe the japanese is all that i care for tribes are basically extended families so when i give a top position to a fellow japanese i am merely helping one of my kin that is no different than a man turning over his business to his son a common practice all over the world i have fought nearly three hundred court cases defending my right to hire and promote who i wish and to date no one has been able to deny me if you have such a projapanese view of the world why is it you recently took up residence in the united states jill asked trying to remain calm and professional despite her revulsion i had this home built six years ago ohnishi pointed out yet you only moved here three months ago jill retorted i feel that i am most needed here as you know the japanese are now the largest ethnic group in hawaii and if youll pardon my arrogance i believe that they need my help your help i wish to see japanese prosper wherever their work takes them while the media focuses on material trade imbalances they completely ignore the amount of brain power that japan exports each year we send only our brightest people to work in foreign countries strengthening our position overseas year by year let america send wideeyed college students to build huts in africa we send ceos to build corporations i just want to do my part and ensure the success of this program and do you see your help extending to hawaiis native population they have suffered under the yoke of a white government far longer than we so of course i wish to see them gain more power here on the islands after all tribally speaking they are closer to us japanese than to their current white overlords surely you exaggerate when you use a term such as overlord to describe the state government jill said a little nervously on the contrary how else would you describe a governing body that does not speak your language does not understand your culture or religion and has done nothing to bridge the socioeconomic gap if the true hawaiians are so satisfied with the current system why do you think the island of niihau with its strict language and culture laws is attracting so many natives to their traditional way of life but primarily my assistance is to those who are of japanese descent miss tzu does your help include aiding mayor takamora some consider his acts treasonous i have not hidden my support of mayor takamora i believe in his programs for ensuring the prosperity of hawaii it is time that the true owners of this state come forth and claim what is theirs without paying undue taxes to washington ohnishi was referring to the takamorasponsored referendum now being discussed in the state house that would make foreign owners of honolulu real estate exempt from paying most taxes if they agreed to place the money in social programs solely beneficial to japanese and japaneseamerican residents if passed the law would put tens of millions of tax dollars into the hands of the japanese residents of the island some political analysts called it votebuying while others saw something deeper statebuying the campaigning for referendum was at a crucial stage with the vote only a week away as with any controversial law emotions across the state ran high and already had turned violent the number of attacks against tourists and white residents had skyrocketed in the past few weeks roving gangs of japanese youths prowled the city streets at night like modernday ninjas striking fear by their very presence what about the increase in violence miss tzu of course i dont condone those people who use violence to achieve their aims but i do understand their commitment hawaii has special needs and considerations that only we understand and it is paramount that we gain more control over our lives some people see this as an attempt at secession jill said referring to the vice presidents speech of the night before some people would ohnishi smiled but his dark eyes remained impassive the interview is over miss tzu you must leave jill was startled at her abrupt dismissal but she knew better than to protest she tossed her pen and pad into her bag and stood thank you for your time mr ohnishi jill said formally i wonder miss tzu ohnishi remarked absently which part of your racial heritage makes you the most uncomfortable with yourself your chinese half or your japanese which allows the chinese to have any influence later jill was amazed how easily her reply had rolled off her tongue the chinese its given me the patience to put up with all the freaks i meet on the job her only memory of leaving the house was the echo of her heels against the marble foyer as she strode to the front door apart from her physical charms what do you think of miss tzu ohnishi asked after the elevator doors had closed behind her a dark shape split from the shadows of the loggia as if by mitosis it padded across the terrace silently and eased into the recently vacated chair with the ease of a predatory cat i believe that she is dangerous the shadow replied kenji you are a worrier she is nothing more than a voice in the wind she will report what every other journalist writes some diatribe full of halftruths and hyperbole that will be lost among the juicy murder stories and baseball scores yet yet nothing the people i mean the real people of this state the ones who matter wont care what she says the mayor and i have been whipping them into such a frenzy that her little report wont make a bit of difference you and david takamora may be creating a situation that you cannot control and one i am sure has no bearing on our true objective you sound like ivan kerikovs lackey ohnishi accused kenjis black eyes went flat that is not what i meant but we have a responsibility to him that you may be jeopardizing by financing the youth gangs and talking to reporters like jill tzu you have been in my employ since you were a boy kenji you have only known the simplicity of one master i on the other hand have known many my conscience first and foremost and now that pig kerikov i know how to serve both kerikov will get his precious concession but only at the price i dictate this uprising is proceeding too quickly that is not part of your bargain with him but it is part of my plan kenji and that is all you need to know and believe ohnishis tone of finality subdued his aide i am wondering about your loyalty kenji you no longer act like my hachiko ohnishi was referring to a muchbeloved japanese dog from the s who waited each afternoon at a train station for his master to return from work one day the master did not return for he had died at his desk at tokyo university the faithful dog returned every day to the very train platform for ten years waiting for a master who would never come the name hachiko is still synonymous with loyalty in japan two days ago you disappeared for the night without telling me ohnishi continued and now you are questioning my orders forget about jill tzu and concentrate on your other duties tonight we shall begin the bombings nothing serious just a small show of force directed at those who oppose the referendum kenji stood his body flowing from the chair as if made of quicksilver yet tensed as only a martial arts expert can be i will see to it personally he glided off the terrace his tabishod feet merely brushing the tile once out of sight of ohnishi any trace of subservience evaporated and his handsome face took on an even keener edge he mumbled you feebleminded old fool you have no idea who or what youre dealing with he went back to his private office to ensure that jill tzu never filed her interview with takahiro ohnishi jill raked her fingers through her thick hair in utter frustration she pursed her full lips forming a seductive kiss then blew a loud raspberry her feet were up on the control console of the studios editing room her long legs stretched almost to the bank of monitors she swung them down ignoring the fact that her culotte shorts had just given her technician a view hed brag about for a week this isnt working ken she muttered darkly give me a break will ya jill weve been at this for six hours its not like youre going to get a pulitzer for this the scragglybearded techie said in his defense yeah but just maybe itll be my ticket to the network just think about it ken if i leave you wont have anyone bitching at you at all hours of the day or night keep wearing those shorts and you can piss and moan all you want ken teased watch it i know a good sexual harassment lawyer jill smiled for the first time in an hour all right lets go through this one more time this day in the editing room was the culmination of three months work on takahiro ohnishi jill had begun hunting down her story shortly after the reclusive billionaire had moved to hawaii and referendum had first been proposed at thirtytwo she was already too cynical to believe in coincidences and shed begun looking for a connection between ohnishi and honolulus controversial mayor david takamora and his even more polemic actions shed found just through her own television stations financial and scheduling records that takamora had purchased more advertising space during his campaign than his public files showed hed had the money for at just her station there was a discrepancy of nearly one hundred thousand dollars and she knew hed campaigned just as heavily on the other channels where had the secret funds come from jill lacked any concrete evidence that ohnishi had privately funded the majority of takamoras campaign but she was damned sure that was what had happened ohnishi with his billions had bought himself a city a journalism professor had once told her that only prosecutors in courtrooms needed proof a reporter never needed to prove anything all she had to do was implicate and wait for the selfincriminating defense a few years later an aging editor said at his drunken retirement party that news never happened it was created jills piece on ohnishi was nearly ready in fact this mornings interview had really been unnecessary shed just wanted to meet the man to get a better sense of what made him tick she and ken watched in silence as the first half of the piece ran stock footage of ohnishi david takamora and the violent street gangs currently preying on white tourists in the city were interspersed with closeup shots of jill doing commentary in front of city hall as the scenes began focusing more on the gangs especially one violent image of four asian youths beating an elderly white woman jill reached for the goosenecked microphone and began laying in a new voiceover one not from the contrived script she had written but one from her heart hawaii is the aloha state the word means love as well as goodbye in the native tongue and in these times it means both simultaneously goodbye to love goodbye to everything that our island paradise has stood for since captain cook first came here two hundred years ago and goodbye to the traditions that reigned on the islands since the first inhabitants years before that where once we melded and blended into one people neither all caucasian nor all polynesian nor all asian today we stand divided from our neighbors and friends now all it takes is having eyes a little too round or skin a little too light and anyone on the street can become a target racial hatred has grown here like some cancer some dread disease without cause whose cure seems equally elusive fostered by men like takahiro ohnishi with his wellpublicized views of racial purity and vanguarded by youth gangs bent on violent expression the state has been galvanized into two intractable camps those who want referendum and those who fear it as many have feared tyranny before last night the vice president called referendum the beginning of a secessionist movement and perhaps hes right the last time america faced a crisis like this the southern states withdrew from the union because they believed in their way of life one built on the conviction that people of other races are inferior today a segment of hawaiis population believes they have a mandate to control everyones lives because there is a little more japanese flowing in their veins they say that their samurai ways are superior that they can calm the streets once again if we agree to live under a system that stifles freedom of expression and the belief that every one is created equal in this reporters opinion that sounds an awful lot like extortion as the ronin scour the streets for white faces to victimize their emperor sits inside his glass and steel home safe behind a wall of hatred and bigotry since his arrival a darkness has descended a black veil that no one seems able or willing to lift today the hotels along the beaches the condos near diamond head and the cruise liners are all empty people are afraid to come to hawaii i spoke with one hotel manager yesterday who told me that tourists are already canceling reservations for next year a selfgenerating downward spiral has been created by the actions of those who now seem to control our streets as more tourists are frightened away more people will lose their jobs and seek the security and fraternity represented by the gangs thus increasing their ability to terrorize only this morning the president placed the troops stationed at pearl harbor on full alert in order to protect the federal governments interests on the islands who is going to protect our interests mayor takamoras police force does not act to control the gangs will he ever ask for the national guard to step in and take control of a situation he can no longer handle for surely we face a crisis as dire as any these islands have faced since the first time a japanese force descended in jill angrily pushed the microphone aside as she watched a monitor displaying david takamoras announcement four weeks earlier that he wanted to run in the gubernatorial elections in the fall ken was too stunned to speak for an instant and when he caught his voice he stammered jesus jill you cant run that of course i cant its the truth and right now were not allowed to report the truth she said bitterly the inhouse phone rang the unit was built into the console next to where jills feet were propped back up against the complicated machine she snatched it up tucking her hair behind her right ear as she swung the receiver to her head i know i know fortyfive minutes to air only her producer would disturb her in the editing room youve got five what in the hell are you talking about hank we dont air for an hour you know the rules jill every piece that chronicles the violence must be cleared by hiroshi hiroshi kyato was the stations news director thats bullshit and you know it you can shove your fiveminute deadline im not some secondclass citizen wait i didnt mean anything by it i mean i dont mean any disrespect for who you are its just well you know his voice trailed off the producer backpedaled so fast that it truly stunned jill race was polarizing the station too jill was halfjapanese and hank was a caucasian from new jersey and he was now deadly afraid that hed offended her hold on hank jill said quickly what i mean to say is that im not a cub reporter on her first assignment i know what the boundaries are i dont need hiro and his thought police telling me what to say on the air im sorry jill hank said tiredly ive been on edge ever since hiro agreed to help mayor takamora reduce tensions in the city by running tamer pieces on the situation so far you are about the only reporter who hasnt called me a graduate of the josef goebbels school of broadcast journalism havent you talked to hiro about this sure did he told me to hand over every segment about the violence or hand in my resignation all right listen my piece isnt done yet or well it is but im not going to let that son of a bitch cut it up im going to take it home tonight tone it some if anyone is going to censor my work itll be me i wont be the person to cost you your job jill you cant do that your story belongs to the station its not your private property try and stop me hank jill set the phone back in the cradle and popped the tape from the editing machine slipping it in her handbag slung across the back of her chair she stood what are you going to do ken asked from behind his thick glasses i dont know yet she left the darkened room the subtle chirping of cicadas was a rhythmic accompaniment to the moondrenched night the air was warm but charged with the humidity of a recently passed thunderstorm jill sat on the lanai of her condo her bare feet propped against a patio table and a glass of zinfandel idly twirling between her long fingers shed been home for a couple of hours but the long bath and half bottle of wine had done little to calm her frayed nerves three months shed been working on the ohnishi piece three fucking months and it would be chopped up into tiny pieces on the cutting room floor and run as a human interest story no doubt if shed ever questioned the connection between ohnishi and takamora she had her proof now and the links ran even deeper to her own news director was no one immune to this racial factionalism other than her she was really wondering if it was all worth it all the sacrifices shed made in her life all the thought shed put into her career and here she was about to have her accomplishments hacked apart because they cut too close to the truth son of a bitch despite herself she was almost in tears everything in her life had been built around journalism shed let almost everything else go in order to reach the upper echelons of her profession few boyfriends lasted more than a month or so of her eightyhour work weeks shed spent her last vacation working as a temporary secretary at a sewage treatment plant tracking down allegations of groundwater contamination her infrequent talks with her mother invariably turned to jills lack of a husband and children every time jill bragged about a breaking story her mother would ask where her grandbabies were jill would always end the conversation angrily defending her career but would always be racked with guilt knowing that her mother was partly right jill did want a husband and children but she also wanted to be a journalist there was a balance between the two that she just couldnt seem to find how much of her career should she give up for a family how much family should she forego for a career and now her career might be about over she could refuse to hand in her story and face probable dismissal or she could cut the piece herself destroying every shred of her integrity she wondered if she should send the story directly to new york she had a few friends in the network maybe she could get someone to watch it see if it was worth running on the national feed lord knew nothing like it had been sent from hawaii in a long time her phone rang jill got up from the lanai to answer it but as soon as she put the receiver to her ear the line went dead crank call or wrong number she didnt care she finished the last bit of wine in a heavy swallow and put the empty glass in the dishwasher leaning against the tiled counter shed exhausted two of the three traditional female relaxation techniques the bath and the wine and there werent any stores open this late so she couldnt go shopping she decided on a masculine diversion shed go out sitting at home and brooding wasnt her style anyway she could do the voiceover in the morning but tonight she wanted a diversion something to get her mind off her job off her parents off everything there would be a vast assortment of eligible bachelors at the tourist hotels near the beach before heading into her bedroom she put an aerosmith cd into the player and cranked the volume to seven the heavy bass and pounding tempo immediately made her feel better defiantly badgirl music for a badgirl type of night she spent over an hour choosing her outfit and makeup finally she was dressed to kill from black tap panties to a hiphugging nina ricci dress six hours a week in a gym ensured that she had a body that would turn even a blind mans head just as she was resettling her breasts in the strapless dress there was a crash of breaking glass she whirled toward the sliding glass bedroom doors as a darkly dressed figure burst through the gauzy curtains the first man was quickly followed by two more their booted feet crushing the shards against the teal carpet jill screamed shrilly for an instant her panic overcame the natural urge to flee and that hesitation cost her two of the men raced toward her guns clamped in their gloved fists jill began backing away but a pistol whipped out and caught her on the jaw snapping her head around and knocking her to the floor she was unconscious before her diamond pendant necklace settled in her cleavage the man who had struck her peeled off his black ski mask it was takahiro ohnishis assistant kenji tie her he ordered he searched the house until he found the room jill used as an office two walls were lined with expensive video equipment the type used for highquality editing work more than likely her piece on ohnishi was here kenji rifled the filing cabinet and desk with professional adroitness but turned up nothing in disgust he went back out to the living room on a small geometric lucite table near the front door rested a thick manila envelope he tore it open and a videocassette slid into his hand he returned to the office and slid the tape into a vcr jill tzus story ran for the first and only time as kenji had suspected it documented his employers known violations of civil employment laws and ohnishis support of honolulu mayor david takamoras gubernatorial election bid for the fall jill had also managed to slip in several references to the escalating violence surrounding the campaign and the possibility that ohnishi was financing that as well popping the tape from the vcr kenji slid it into the inside pocket of his dark windbreaker he returned to the bedroom where jill was laid across the bed hands cuffed behind her and a gag stuffed into her lipsticked mouth she was still unconscious nevertheless kenji whispered into her ear an excellent piece of reporting miss tzu you are correct on all charges mr ohnishi is financing the violence in honolulu though not for much longer i assure you he turned to his henchmen lets go they bundled jill into the bedspread and carried her from her home as if she were a rolledup carpet the cicadas paused as the party ducked through the bushes toward their hidden vehicle twenty miles away thunderous applause swept across the honolulu convention center as mayor david takamora took the stage sending a palpable compression wave echoing through the cavernous hall twelve thousand people filled the room many waving placards in support of honolulus controversial mayor the air was charged with the energy of the massed throng as their hero raised his arms over his head in recognition of the crowds adoration under the glare of the television crews klieg lights takamora appeared much more handsome than he did in person the lights and makeup hid the pocks of adolescent acne on his face and darkened the thin strands of silver that wove through his thick hair he held his body erect and confident showing off a lean stomach that was nothing more than a girdle and a continual holding of his breath the effort would inevitably cause severe back pain after the speech such small hoaxes can be forgiven in most men in their fifties if they did not go deeper than the surface in takamoras case it would take more than a little makeup to hide the flaws in his personality and morals pathologically ambitious takamora had turned to the darker side of politics to gain his current office from the very beginning of his career as a board member of the citys building commission he had made it clear to any developer who cared to listen that he would almost joyfully take bribes to help a project gain quick approval he amassed several hundred thousand dollars in just a few years and used that money as a war chest to battle for the mayors office some said that he cut so many deals to get on the ballot that he kept a knife on his desk rather than a pen he waged one of the ugliest campaigns for mayor of any american city in history his main opponent a councilwoman of excellent standing withdrew from the race when her daughter was brutally raped after leaving a honolulu nightclub takamora didnt know if the rape was coincidence or the act of an overzealous assistant now he stood poised to go far beyond his own ambition he was the last of the speakers at this proreferendum rally and the crowd was already roused to a fever pitch ladies and gentlemen takamora said quieting the crowd with hand gestures he spoke in japanese ladies and gentlemen a little over a year ago you gave me a mandate when you elected me to help this city prosper to create new jobs and security for our way of life since then i have done everything in my power to make this happen but ive found myself limited by the very office with which you entrusted me while weve been able to attract japanese companies to our city state and federal regulators have stalled our efforts when ohnishi heavy industries wanted to build a computer assembly plant in honolulu the government in washington refused to allow import permits for the machinery needed to set up the plant when i wanted to privatize our police force with the blessing of you the voters the supreme court called that an unconstitutional act because it might be construed as a private militia now i want to see our tax dollars stay here on hawaii rather than disappear into the federal cesspit and im being called a secessionist referendum does not equal secession it means parity our state is now wholly selfsufficient we trade more with japan than we do with california so why shouldnt we be entitled to keep the tax revenue from our own labor i no longer see any benefits from washington just inept meddling i see us helping to prop up a system that has simply gotten away from itself and i say dont take us with you while the mainland sinks into a bottomless pit of crime and drug abuse where driveby shootings no longer make the news where teenage pregnancy accounts for thirty percent of the children born where welfare assistance has turned into a crutch for those too lazy to work we have prospered do you think it fair we should pay for their corruption the frenzied crowd shouted a defiant no is it right that we must pay for their excesses again with one hatefilled voice the crowd screamed no last night the vice president of the united states branded me a secessionist the crowd was transmuting into a mindless mob barely kept in check by takamoras voice i say dont tempt me takamoras last words were spoken in a low hiss then he ducked from the stage wearing the adulation of the crowd like a cloak an aide handed him a bottle of beer and a towel he took a quick swig and wiped the greasy makeup from his face listen to them he said to the assembled aides theyre ready for anything as takamora leaned into the sound of the crowd beyond the maroon curtain an aide slid a ringing cellular phone from his pocket listened for an instant then handed it to takamora yes congratulations david a rousing speech thank you mr ohnishi im pleased you were able to hear it the microphones in the convention center had been wired into a transceiver and the signals sent to ohnishis house can you still hear the crowd sir yes you are certainly the man of the hour only with your help mr ohnishi takamora replied honestly acknowledging the massive support given to him by the aging industrialist i think now is the time to step up our campaign dont you ohnishis comment was not really a question it was a command i agree sir takamora replied keeping the pretense of a free will what do you have in mind a few bombings better arms for the youth gangs and a little more selectivity to their targets our day is rapidly approaching so we must be more organized kenji will contact you in the morning with all the particulars but the vote for referendum is still a week away arent we jumping the gun slightly some unforeseen contingencies have arisen that may force me to abandon the subterfuge of referendum who cares if the people wont be allowed their vote we will give them what they want anyway what i want to know is if your national guard troops will maintain their loyalty throughout our campaign you can count on them sir at least those units that ive personally built up since taking office as you know the crack units here in honolulu are made up of japaneseamericans young men and women who feel the same as we do it is only a matter of time until the governor calls them out unwittingly putting more of our people on the streets i guarantee that they will not interfere with your gangs and if the president calls out federal troops takamora hesitated for an instant the guardsmen will be willing to take them on remember the military presence on the island represents the greatest source of antagonism among our people it is the same here as it was on okinawa following the rape of that little girl in good and david never question me again ohnishis tone was saccharine but hard edged takamora shut off the phone with a snap angered that his euphoria of a few moments ago had been chilled by ohnishi he tried to look composed as he handed the phone back to his assistant but failed miserably arlington virginia the faint chime of the tiffany alarm clock woke mercer instantly his hand snaked out from under the tangle of sheets and blankets and silenced the antique piece he pushed aside the bed coverings and swung his legs to the floor his deep gray eyes were already bright and clear mercers eyes reacted to light much quicker than the average persons he barely squinted at bright lights and adjusted to darkness with the speed of a cat it was an ability he fully exploited in the subterranean world of hardrock mining he shaved and took a quick shower before heading down the circular stairs to the rec room passing through the library on the way the builtin dark oak shelves were full of plain beige boxes containing his vast collection of reference books for the thousandth time mercer promised himself hed unpack the books and place them properly on the shelves he also wanted to hang the dozens of pictures and paintings he had collected over the years which currently lay crated in one of the brownstones two spare bedrooms cup of coffee in hand he went to the front door and grabbed the morning washington post he was just turning to the stories beneath the fold as he made his way to the bar in the rec room a story on the left corner riveted him to the stool survivor found from noaa ship hawaii dr tish talbot a specialist on the illfated noaa research vessel ocean seeker was rescued by a finnish freighter at local time this morning she is so far the only survivor of the ship which sank three days ago the ocean seeker was investigating the mysterious deaths of twelve gray whales found beached last month on hawaiis north coast dr talbot is said to be in stable condition suffering from dehydration and exposure she is being flown to george washington university hospital this morning for observation the rescue ship ss september laurel had been assisting the coast guard and navy search for survivors since the mysterious sinking the article went on but mercer really didnt see the rest of the words he was stunned the sense of loss that he felt the night before slipped away replaced by joy and relief harry wake up mercer had to share the news harry came awake slowly groans and yawns followed by scratches and stretches what time is it quarter of six mercer replied glancing at his tag heuer watch christ my mouth feels as if i just frenchkissed an angora sweater mercer poured him a cup of coffee harry moved from the couch to the bar and slouched onto one of the stools a cigarette already smoldering between his lips remember me telling you about jack talbot the guy who saved my life in alaska mercer didnt wait for harry to answer last night i found out that his daughter was on board that noaa ship that sank in the pacific christ mercer sorry to hear it harry said seriously i was meaning to ask you last night if you had heard about that mercer held up the front page of the paper and harry read it through stillbleary eyes well ill be goddamned how about that for luck no shit i wonder if your friend knows yet he probably didnt even know about the accident last i knew he was working aboard an oil rig off the coast of indonesia harry looked at mercer for a second then stood up i better get home harry was through the door before mercer could say another word mercer puzzled about his friends abrupt exit for a moment then went back to reading his paper at mercer strode into his office at the us geological survey his secretary jennifer woodridge tried to smile and say hi with a mouth full of cherry danish mercer marveled at her ability to eat her desk was nearly always covered with halfeaten junk food mangled bags of chips and at least three empty soft drink cans yet she weighed around one hundred pounds and had a figure that made him wish half the rumors in the office were true morning jen i see nothings changed in my absence she swallowed hard and took a sip of coffee welcome back i was so relieved that you were in south africa and not aboard that noaa ship you have no idea trust me youre not half as relieved as i am jen woodridge had not always cared so much for her temporary boss two months earlier when mercer had started consulting at the usgs jen had prepared an extensive list of the things she would and wouldnt do in the course of her job she read through the list at a staccato pace about two seconds after their introduction mercer had listened to her calmly without comment when she had finished all mercer said was okay what do you want me to do now she asked thinking she had the upper hand with him go back and sit at your desk and and nothing just sit at your desk dont answer the phone dont fill out any papers dont do anything it took only forty fidgety minutes before jen caved in and returned to mercers office her blue eyes glazed with boredom point taken and im sorry usually the consultants around here treat the staff like slaves since you are the first secretary excuse me assistant ive ever had i really dont know how to treat you mercers honesty had begun a great working relationship now he asked did you read about that woman rescued last night yes isnt that fantastic strange thing is i know her or rather i know her father mercer said heading for his office come on and fill me in on whats been happening while ive been gone mercer struggled out of his jacket and threw it carelessly over the leather sofa he laid his briefcase on the desk and settled into his chair jen hung up his jacket with a maternal scowl and sat in the chair in front of the desk to help him pore through the mountain of papers around noon jennifer went to lunch mercer stayed in his office catching up on the paperwork treadmill a security guard knocked quietly at his office door a few minutes after jen left are you dr philip mercer the guard asked confirming the name from the slip of paper in his hand mercer winced inwardly he hated to be called doctor he grinned at the security officer so you boys finally caught me stealing toilet paper from the mens room the guard looked at him puzzled then realized that mercer wasnt serious so much for a sense of humor thought mercer sir western union delivered this telegram to the front office its addressed to you the guard handed mercer the envelope and left without another word the telegram had been sent from jakarta mercer knew instinctively that it was from jack talbot for some reason he felt a sense of foreboding as he unfolded the paper tish is in mortal danger help her ocean seeker intentionally destroyed will try to get to dc soonest it was signed jack mercer spent no more than ten seconds making up his mind the jack talbot he knew was not prone to fantasy or hysteria if jack said that his daughter was in danger and that the noaa ship had been purposely destroyed mercer believed him unequivocally mercer stood quickly his gray eyes hard and set his lean body already slightly tensed for the unknown he grabbed his jacket and strode to the elevators within six minutes of reading the telegram his black jaguar xjs convertible was bulling its way through downtown traffic toward the gwu hospital the nurse at the hospitals front desk informed him that tish was in room but that no visitors were allowed the nurse also told mercer that the room was being guarded by the fbi the fact that the sole survivor of a shipwreck was under guard gave some credence to jacks warning that his daughter was in danger and that the sinking of the ocean seeker had ominous overtones well that takes care of that mercer said and gave the nurse a smile that made her blush where can i find a cup of coffee to the right and up the stairs sir she responded patting her mousy hair the cafeteria is on the second floor mercer thanked her but once in the stairwell he climbed quickly to the fourth floor the fluorescent lights yellowpainted walls and hospital smell were enough to cause nausea in the most healthy person after a few minutes he found the wing which contained room the two beefy nonecked men sitting at an impromptu security desk eyed him like sharks looking at a wounded mullet dr mercer to see tish talbot mercer said casually flashing an id card one guard looked him up and down noting the stethoscope protruding from his coat pocket mercer had picked it up at an empty nurses station the other guard saw the gwu logo on the card and noted that the photo of dr mercer matched the man in front of him whats your business dr mercer the mans voice was flat and lifeless im a urologist mercer replied and stifled a small yawn i need to check for renal damage due to extended dehydration the guard waved him through without a second thought the id that mercer flashed had in fact been issued by gwu hospital but it merely signified that he was a recipient of the hospitals health coverage anything more than a cursory examination would have gotten him a quick trip to the j edgar hoover building so much for the vigilance of the fbi mercer looked over his shoulder and saw one of the guards bury his face in a nearempty bag of corn chips and pour the remainder in his mouth since tish was in possible trouble there was no way that he would let these two idiots look out for her tish was sitting up in bed a magazine resting on her bent knees though she looked fatigued from her ordeal she was a beautiful woman on the easy side of thirty with shortcropped dark hair arresting red lips and high cheekbones her skin was burned dark by the sun but did not appear permanently damaged she looked up at him with her fathers eyes impossibly clear blue and impish miss talbot im philip mercer im a friend of your fathers in fact i owe him my life maybe he told you the story her smile was warm and open ive heard that story about a million times dr mercer and i must say its good to have a friend here better than you know mercer said under his breath how do you feel tired and sore but okay i really dont know why im being kept here there was annoyance in her voice believe it or not youre a pretty hot item right now do you know that youre under guard i wasnt aware of that what the hell for she was plain speaking just like her father i was hoping you could tell me i received a telegram about an hour ago from your father in jakarta he asked me to look after you tish stared at him he felt that the ocean seeker was intentionally destroyed and if thats true i dont think that youre safe here i was in south africa when all of this happened so i dont know any details but for now ill trust your father and assume that your life may be in danger tish continued to regard him blankly does any of this make sense to you do you remember something or did you see something that could cause this stir in the first place dr mercer before she could continue a man opened the door a lab coat covered his suit good afternoon im dr alfred rosenburg your urologist his smile was crooked and his teeth stained tobacco yellow mercer took one look at the mans shoes and reacted instantly the punch was powered with a full twist of his body the instant before his fist smashed into the mans face mercer bent his arm and his elbow connected solidly with rosenburgs cheek tish muffled a scream in her hands as the doctors head whipped around and he slammed into the wall mercer turned to her get dressed now im getting you out of here rosenburg was already regaining his feet a sixinch stiletto in his hand mercer bent at the knees and torqued his body around extending one leg in a sweep the man fell back his body shaking the wall when he hit mercer planted a foot squarely in his stomach then kicked up into his face as he doubled over rosenburgs head snapped back and crashed into the wall he slumped over unconscious mercer looked at tish who was still in bed he wont be alone now get dressed she flew from the bed and was dressed in jeans and a tshirt within moments though not before mercer stole a glimpse of exquisitely long legs and a white silkpantied backside mercer opened the door slowly and looked toward the guard station the pool of blood under the desk told him that both fbi agents were dead oh jesus tish moaned as mercer led her past the desk pausing for an instant he found an automatic pistol and a spare clip inside one of the dead mens jackets he held the weapon discreetly under his own coat and slipped the clip into a pocket mercer took tishs hand as they went down the stairs to the lobby a quick scan of the faces there confirmed that the killer upstairs was indeed not alone three men stood just outside the automatic door while another trio peered at a glasscovered bulletin board their eyes watching the room in its reflection the fugitives turned away from the lobby mercer led tish through a set of doors marked no admittance and out onto a loading dock the man standing on the dock looked at tish just a bit too critically so mercer smashed his knee into the mans groin if he was an innocent bystander where better to get treated for his injuries and if he was an assistant to the assassin upstairs screw him mercer and tish ran to his car the jaguar v burst into life instantly mercer had hoped to get away without being seen but two men were already running toward them from the loading dock mercer jammed the gearbox into drive and smoked the pirelli tires pulling out onto the street a few cars pounded their horns in anger and a pair of nurses jumped back to the sidewalk for safety three identical bmws were already in pursuit as mercer turned onto rd street heading toward washington circle mercer took the car around the circle twice trying to snarl his pursuers in traffic before tearing off down k street the maneuver gained him only a second or two mercer put the borrowed pistol a heckler and koch vp on his lap as he jinked around a metrobus the deadly mm germanmade gun had eighteen rounds inside its wide grip he clicked off the safety then pressed the button that lowered his window the sounds of the city whipped into the car mercer wished that he had taken the top down to give him better visibility but there was nothing that he could do about that now the first chase car was pulling up on mercers left the driver was intent on the road ahead but the passenger had his eyes glued on mercer he threw a sardonic wave and pulled a beretta model into view the little italian submachine gun could fire a blanket of mm bullets at a rate of a minute just as the man brought his weapon to bear mercer lifted his pistol over the windowsill and let loose he fired as fast as he could the first five rounds tore up the body of the gunman his torso and head jumped at every impact as he slumped over the next five rounds pulverized the head of the driver the bmw slowed and began to veer off the road it careened off one of the huge trees that lined k street and shot back into traffic in the rearview mirror mercer saw the bmw fly into the other lane and slam into the front of a parked garbage truck the windshield exploded outward as the two bodies smashed through it tish had turned almost white and kept biting her lower lip mercer took one hand off the wheel to grasp her reassuringly on the shoulder he wished he could do more but there were still two cars chasing them mercer ignored a red light as k street turned onto pennsylvania avenue and so did the pursuers they had just passed the world bank building when the first bullets smashed into the jaguar tish slid to the floor and mercer began weaving the car but the bullets continued to find their mark traffic was getting thicker once mercer was forced to stop completely but luckily the two bmws were stuck several cars back as they approached the busy intersection at th street with the jag doing about forty mph the light turned yellow mercer jammed the transmission into second ignoring the tachometer needle as it arced across the gauge and mashed the gas pedal to the blackcarpeted floorboards the engine revs peaked with an earsplitting whine before mercer eased the car back into drive they passed the point of no return as the light changed to red and the mass of cars started down th street like a steel avalanche mercer cut the car wide to the right the tires squealing on the asphalt pedestrians dove out of the way as he took the car up onto the sidewalk for a few yards before veering back onto the road nearly in front of the white house one bmw had tried to follow him but had smashed into the thick concrete antitank barricades that protected the presidential residence the other was stuck in traffic mercer stopped the jag at the corner of penn and th take my wallet he said handing it to tish my address is on the license and theres enough money for a cab he yanked the house key from the ring dangling in the ignition and handed it to her theres a security panel to the right of the door will deactivate it ill be there as soon as i can will you be okay tishs eyes were huge with fear dont worry just go she nodded then leapt out of the car and immediately blended with the flow of people on their lunch breaks the moment the door slammed shut mercer took off down th street past the hotel washington he cut back onto pennsylvania in front of the department of commerce building he glimpsed the bmw in the rearview mirror they were still following him so he figured tish was safe for now the willard hotel and the post office pavilion blurred past as mercer used the power and control of the jaguar to snake through the thick traffic suddenly he heard the unmistakable sound of automatic fire again the first fusillade mangled the coachwork of the jag and punctured the rear windscreen about a dozen times the next burst blew out the left rear tire the car flew out of control the steering wheel like a slippery living creature in mercers hands he knew the jaguar was doomed the cars mad lurching had cleared the road quickly and mercer exploited this by driving into the oncoming lane bouncing off stationary cars like a billiard ball he finally came to a stop at the entrance of the archive metro station in the relative silence following the crash he could hear the fast approach of police sirens racing from all across downtown mercer jammed a fresh clip into the pistol and leapt from the car he flew down the escalator shouldering people aside as he raced toward the citys modern subway system commuters gasped or complained as he pushed through the crowd and jumped the turnstile the metro guard in the glass booth was the last of his worries as he reached the platform mercer was dismayed to see that the two sets of parallel tracks were empty and that there was not enough of a crowd to conceal him he whirled around to see three men running toward him weapons barely concealed under their jackets the floor lights lining the near track began to flash indicating that a train was about to arrive the station began to rumble as the train approached pushing a wall of air ahead of it the far track was still clear mercer knew that if he boarded the train he would be cut down instantly these men obviously had no compunctions about a public murder the noise in the station reached a tactile level as the train burst from the tunnel in a whoosh of air and a squeal of brakes mercers pursuers were only twenty yards away and already one was reaching into his jacket for his weapon mercer had only one chance for escape and he took it without thought he ran for the edge of the track and leapt barely two yards in front of the oncoming train the engineer blasted his horn and jammed on the brakes but mercer didnt even notice he was too intent on the tenfoot jump if he overshot he could fly into the next track land on the current rail electrocute himself and save his attackers the trouble he landed safely on the low platform between the two tracks as his body rocked forward from the momentum he was stunned to see another train rushing toward him from the opposite direction he windmilled his arms trying to regain his balance and almost succeeded the oncoming train glanced into his shoulder sending him flying back so that he bounced off the first train which had ground to a halt mercer lay between the nowstationary trains for a moment or two recovering his senses finally he stood and ignoring the shocked faces of passengers on both trains levered his back against one of the trains and his legs against the other to shinny up to the roof of the far carriage over the shouts and police whistles that echoed through the station he heard the quiet double ping that indicated the train doors were closing a shot rang out and the roof next to mercers head exploded he flipped onto his back extending the h ampk toward the assassin who stood on the pedestrian bridge which spanned the tracks mercer fired just as the train lurched forward his shot shattered concrete far to the left of his target the assassin lined up another careful shot mercer rolled across the roof until he nearly slipped off dodging the bullet an instant later the metro car slid under the bridge and mercer rolled back across the roof holding the pistol by his head arms tucked close to his body there was a fourfoot gap between the bridge and the entrance to the subway tunnel as mercer passed through the gap he spotted the assassin mercer pulled the trigger and saw the gunman fall back just before the metro plunged into the darkened tunnel the ride through the tunnel was a nightmare though the trains speed was nearly forty miles per hour in the dark it felt like four hundred the rattling car threatened to shake mercer off the roof and he had the constant fear of being smeared against the low ceiling the noise and vibration were maddening but he grimly held on jaw clenched tightly to keep his teeth from jarring loose after a couple of minutes that seemed like an eternity the train thundered into lenfant plaza the next station on the yellow line mercer moved forward until he was under the pedestrian bridge no doubt that there would be a backup team in this station by now and probably in all the stations on the line they had him boxed in whoever they were the wait in the station dragged on as passengers left and entered the train in the confused ballet called commuting mercer feared that the train would be held because of the body he had left in the archive station but a moment later the bell chimed and the pneumatic doors hissed closed the train began to inch along and in a second mercer was exposed to another gunman standing on the bridge mercer raised the vp to take aim just as the other man swung the barrel of a beretta toward him neither man had time to fire before mercer disappeared into the blackness of the tunnel mercers raised hand the one grasping the pistol smashed into the concrete wall instantly numbed fingers sprang open and the weapon slid from his grasp it bounced against the roof once twice then slipped over the edge lost forever mercer flipped back onto his stomach cursing the pain and his own stupidity he was now unarmed and facing an unimaginable number of enemies as the metro climbed above ground just south of the jefferson memorial mercer realized that he had a chance to escape while the train was crossing the potomac river he swore at himself for even thinking it but knew he had no other option as soon as the train reached daylight he sat up and kicked off his shoes the train sped onto the truss bridge that spanned the sluggish river rattling and clanging like an old steam locomotive mercer stood the wind whipping his jacket around his body he shed it quickly and peered at the river below it was a sapphire blue mercer jumped the jarring vibration of the metro vanished as he arrowed toward the water and for a moment all was quiet except for the wind in his ears the impact as he hit the choppy water nearly knocked him unconscious but the cold brought him back quickly he was deep under the rivers surface with lungs emptied by the blow the swim upward was agonizing he finally broke the surface and coughed the water from his lungs he looked up at the bridge but the train had already vanished from sight twenty excruciating minutes later he dragged himself onto the shore welcome to virginia he gasped the pacific by its very nature a modern nuclear submarine makes an optimal platform for sensitive intelligence gathering with its ability to remain submerged for extended periods and its absolute silence a sub can maintain station near an unfriendly coast for weeks or even months with relative impunity the sub now lying in wait two hundred miles northwest of hawaii had been there for seven months and apart from one minor incident had not once come close to detection there was only about another week or two left of this patrol so morale which had been dismal was finally picking up the crew mostly northerners no longer snickered at the captains thick georgian accent the bickering which had become an almost daily occurrence even among this highly disciplined crew had ceased the men knew that very soon they would feel the warm sun breathe unrecirculated air and have the company of their families once again the captain an unlaughing hawkfaced man in his midfifties scanned the control room slowly the red lights of battle stations which had glowed continuously since the beginning of the mission stained the faces of his men and hid every corner of the room in shadow he too was looking forward to going home though he had lost his wife years before he did have a daughter a daughter who would have given birth to his first grandchild in his absence a boy or a girl he mused and if it was a boy will she name him after me or that idiot husband of hers captain contact bearing twoohfive degrees range fifteen miles the sonar operator barked the bridge was galvanized with anticipation each pair of eyes riveted on the captain he checked his watch and decided that this might be the ship they were expecting sonar scrub the targets signature please the old man said calmly range too far sir we have to wait range thirteen miles single screw turning thirteen knots the captain picked up the hand mike fire control plot a solution to target and give me a lock torpedo room flood tubes one and two but do not open outer doors even on the bridge thirty yards from the torpedo room the captain could hear the water flooding into the tubes he just hoped that there was no one else out there to hear as well sonar can you scrub the signature yet affirmative sir working now the boats multimilliondollar acoustical computer was analyzing the sounds coming from the approaching ship digitally washing out the grinding rotation of her screw the liquid friction of her hull cutting through the waves and the omnipresent background noise of the living sea until we have our target her signal is coming in strong repeat she is our ship amid the ambient noise of the vessel an ultrasonic generator pulsed a signal through the water to be picked up by only those listening for it it was this signal for which the computer searched and the captain waited the captain picked up the microphone again torpedo room stand down shit the sonarman screamed and ripped off his headphones what is it the captain demanded there was a thin trickle of blood from the mans ears he spoke unnaturally loudly another underwater explosion sir much more powerful than any other you are relieved the captain said the sensitive sonar gear was designed with a failsafe acoustical buffer to shield the hearing of the men who listened in yet his four top operators now suffered permanent hearing damage due to the buffers inability to screen out the nearby subsurface explosions the equipment simply wasnt designed for this kind of abuse and neither were the men arlington virginia mercer tapped the cabdriver on his shoulder and handed the young african immigrant a twenty keep the change and im sorry about the seat the clothbacked seat of the yellow ford taurus was soaking wet just like mercers suit he walked toward his house in stocking feet his socks making an obscene sound against the concrete with every step the front door of the house was unlocked mercer breathed a heavy sigh once the door was closed behind him it had taken him nearly an hour and a half to get home after hed pulled himself from the river near the pentagon his first act after wringing the water from his clothes behind a derelict bus was to phone a friend with the metro police the friend promised that mercers shotup jaguar would be towed to an auxiliary lot in anacostia not to the citys main impound he also assured mercer that the paperwork on the car would be lost for at least a couple of days it would take some time to trace him through his destroyed car he now had a little breathing space to figure out what in the hell had just happened and why mercer heard the sound of the television and knew that tish talbot had made it here safely he walked through the house not caring about the water he was getting on the tile or the antique stairs tish was asleep in the bar stretched out on the couch under a steamer rug that mercer had bought in an auction of ocean liner memorabilia the name ss normandie was embroidered in gold silk on the thick dark wool tish woke slowly extending her hands over her head in a decidedly feline gesture how do you feel mercer asked making a quick decision between keeping his floor dry and his need for a drink he gingerly stepped behind the bar im not sure tish responded then noticed his appearance my god are you okay lets just say im not ready to do that again mercer pulled two beers from the antique fridge and popped the lids no thanks tish said i took the liberty of opening a bottle of wine she indicated the halffilled glass on the coffee table i wasnt offering mercer replied as he tilted the first bottle to his lips the beer vanished in seven heavy swallows i need a shower and a change ill be back in a few minutes he left the empty on the bar ten minutes later mercer returned wearing jeans and a pittsburgh penguins jersey tish had folded the blanket and was sitting at the bar your home is beautiful i made the mistake of going for cute rather than practical when i bought my condo in san diego my whole unit is smaller than this room one of these days ill finally admit that i live here and decorate some of it i did notice a definite lack of decorating skills tish smiled warmly oh my god your hand mercer looked down at the back of his right hand where the skin had been scraped off by the rough subway tunnel in the bathroom hed awkwardly wound a bandage around it but the selfministrations had come apart and the angry cuts had opened again they were painful and still bled freely but werent serious he grabbed for a clean bar towel but tish snatched it from him let me do that she said and began wiping the blood from his skin as soon as her hand touched his she gasped as if shed touched something hot she turned mercers hand over slowly inspecting it like the scientist she was his hands were exactingly sculpted by labor and pain his palms were horny callused pads and the backs were crisscrossed with the raised white ridges of old scar tissue the nails though neatly tended were scored and pitted and one nail on his pinkie was cracked all the way to the cuticle despite the damage they were beautiful hands rugged like a new mountain chain yet with a tapered masculine elegance tish released his hand and looked into his eyes searchingly i work for a living he grinned and these are my tools then i guess this scrape doesnt bother you much hell yes i just wont admit it tish looked away and when she spoke her voice had a serious timbre i want to thank you for saving my life today she chuckled christ does that sound like a cliche mercer smiled at her its the least i can do since your father once saved my life how is jack my father died about a year ago you didnt know mercers face went ashen i tried to tell you back at the hospital but that man came in mercer managed to croak how he was killed on an oil platform near indonesia it capsized in a freak typhoon a numbness started at the base of his skull and raced through his body in seconds he almost had to hold onto the bar for support without a word mercer ran up to his bedroom and returned a moment later holding a soggy scrap of paper the telegram sent by jack talbot he held it out to tish but she seemed reluctant for a moment fearful of even touching the page finally she took it and read it quickly bewildered she looked up at him i dont understand neither do i mercer said slowly neither do i but someone wants me involved in this whatever this is and they were right about you being in danger he finished the beer and pulled another from the fridge you said at the hospital that you had no idea why you were under guard or why your father or whoever sent this telegram might think youre in danger thats right listen im just a marine biologist who would want to kill me and by the way how did you know that man in my hospital room wasnt a real doctor for one thing he said he was a urologist which was the same line i used to get past the fbi guards one of them would have come to recheck my credentials also no doctor making rounds would wear shoes as uncomfortablelooking as his mercer shrugged as to why someone is trying to kill you that is what we have to find out its obvious that it has to do with the last voyage of the ocean seeker why dont you tell me about it tish was almost at the point of tears and had to slow her breathing before she could speak do you think all those people were killed because of me she sobbed once mercer came around the bar and took her into his arms she sagged into him gratefully her hair smelled like hospital soap and was smooth and slippery against his skin he let thirty seconds go by before straightening up looking deeply into her eyes he spoke softly i dont think anyone was supposed to survive that trip now tell me about the last voyage tish took a moment to compose herself a few weeks ago seven gray whales were found beached just west of hana on maui they were all dead a biologist from the university of hawaii performed a necropsy a what mercer interrupted necropsy an animal autopsy tish replied as if everyone should know the word he found that their digestive tracts were clogged with minerals about fiftyfive percent silica with some magnesium calcium and iron plus traces of gold youre describing lava thats what the biologist thought as well his theory was the whales had been attracted to the huge schools of plankton that would surround a new undersea volcano for its warmth the whales while feeding would also ingest the particles of lava suspended in the water eventually their digestive tracts would fill with the minerals and they could no longer feed so what happened then well noaa was called in to investigate an aerial search of the waters north of maui showed nothing no new island no clouds of ash or even steam then some sonar buoys were dropped and within twelve hours we had found our new volcano about two hundred miles from the hawaiian islands the ocean seeker was sent out late last thursday night tish stopped speaking for several seconds twentyfour hours later the ship exploded when i was first rescued i just assumed that it had been some sort of accident but now i dont know what to think mercer poured her another glass of wine and opened another beer for himself the adrenaline rush from a few hours ago was wearing off leaving him thirsty why are all those pins in that map tish said changing the subject and referring to the map of the world hung behind the bar it was studded with numerous pushpins in several different colors mercer felt that the distraction would let tish calm down enough to answer the dozens of questions he still had for her its a map of places ive been the different colors indicate why i was there green is for pleasure like most of the caribbean islands red is for work overseas for the us geological survey mostly meetings in europe and africa and blue is for private consulting work that ive done for various mining companies tish noted that this last category included some pretty exotic places thailand namibia south africa alaska new guinea and at least fifteen others why is there a clear pin in central africa i cant tell which country mercer looked pained as he replied the pins in rwanda i was there for six months in when the world looked on as tutsi tribesmen were slaughtered by the hutu majority i was on a consulting job when the violence erupted and rather than run away i joined a band of soldiers trying to defend fleeing villagers my god why would you do something like that i heard that the fighting was absolutely savage i was born in that part of the world my parents and i lived in rwanda during the early days of independence i was too young to remember the massacre of but ive never lost my sense of loyalty to the tutsi friends i had growing up tish knew he was keeping something from her but she didnt press and what about the clear pin in iraq mercer smiled i was never there and even if i was i cant talk about it she threw him a cheeky grin real james bond hush hush sort of mercer still carried scars from that mission the information he had brought back had been the trigger for operation desert storm now tell me about your rescue tish spoke quietly the ship exploded late friday night i was on the fantail rigging some acoustical gear i didnt hear or even see the explosion one second i was standing there and the next i was in the water there were a lot of flames i remember that i couldnt hear anything i think i had gone deaf for a moment the concussion stunned your ears its common go on there was an inflatable raft near me and i swam to it mercer interrupted again it was already inflated yes it was come to think of it thats awfully strange theyre usually stowed in big plastic cylinders maybe the explosion released the co used to inflate it that sounded a little farfetched to mercer and he made a mental note to come back to it later i was in the raft all of the next day until the september laurel rescued me thats the freighter yes a couple hours later a helicopter from the navy came to pick me up the doctor on board gave me a shot and when i came to i was in dc can you describe the freighter i dont know it was just a ship i dont know the length or anything like that it had a bunch of cranes and booms there was a black circle with a yellow dot on the funnel which was near the back of the ship what else can you tell me tish paused her smooth forehead furrowed there was something she wanted to say mercer could tell but he didnt think she was sure of the facts herself i heard russian she blurted out russian are you sure well no not really when did you hear it when i was being pulled aboard the freighter the crew were shouting orders to each other in russian how can you be sure it was russian some of the scandinavian languages sound similar a year ago i was part of a research team in mozambique investigating the ruin that the government there has made of the prawn beds just off the coast it was a joint venture between noaa woods hole the mozambique government and a team of soviets i well i became involved with one of the soviets when we were alone together he would always speak to me in russian i dont think ill ever forget the sound of that language she looked at mercer as if defying him to judge her okay so you heard russian could be they had some expatriate russian crewman or something like that what happened when you were in the life raft nothing i was unconscious until just before i was rescued you dont remember anything i had just been blown off a ship what the hell am i supposed to remember fatigue was taking its toll on her im sorry you must still be exhausted mercer glanced at his watch it was fourthirty in the afternoon why dont you get some sleep ill wake you at seven im sure youre dying for a nonhospital meal yes that would be wonderful mercer led her to one of the two guest rooms he showed her the bath and gave her several towels he heard the water running even before he returned to the rec room mercer pulled two more beers from the fridge and went to his home office he switched on the desk lamp and grabbed the phone a moment later a female voice chirped berkowitz saulman and little david saulman please tell him its philip mercer of the dozens of lawyers that mercer had dealt with in his life david saulman was the only one he liked saulman had been a ships officer during the late s and early sixties but an engine room accident had scalded his left hand so badly that it had to be amputated forced out of the merchant marine he put himself through law school and within just a few years he was the man to talk to about maritime law thirty years later his office in miami had over one hundred associate attorneys and his counsel rated five hundred dollars an hour at seventyfive saulman was still sharp and his knowledge of ships and shipping was voluminous mercer how are you i havent heard your sorry voice in months tell me youre in miami and ready to get into trouble sorry dave im in dc and im already in trouble dont tell me the cops finally picked you up for flashing the tourists in front of the white house hell no one even notices when i do it dave what do you know about a ship called the september laurel an official call is it yeah charge it to noaa noaa huh do they know not yet but if im right they wont mind the september laurel was the ship that rescued that woman from the noaa research vessel last night right thats the one the laurels owned by ocean freight and cargo head office in new york but all of their ships are registered in panama and have italian crews shes just a tramp freighter usually runs the north pacific let me think about four hundred feet thirty thousand gross tons only notable thing about her is this rescue dave i want you to check her out normal cargoes big contracts also i want the lowdown on her parent company dig deep also could you get me any information on all the ships that have sunk in the same waters as the ocean seeker whats going on in that paranoid mind of yours im not sure yet and i cant really talk about what i suspect do you happen to know the design on her stack yeah a bunch of laurels you sure yes its of ampcs trademark their ship august rose has a bunch of roses on the stack and the december iris has irises on hers so theres no way that her stack could be painted with a black circle surrounding a yellow dot not unless the company has changed a fortyyear tradition thanks dave i owe you just fax the info to my home and ill take it from there are you up for a trivia challenge saulman asked this had been a tradition since theyd first met in at a reception honoring the few remaining titanic survivors fire away who was the last person to own the queen elizabeth and what did he change her name to c y tung and he called her seawise university mercer just barely heard saulman call him a bastard before he hung up mercer flipped through his rolodex for a second searching for a number at woods hole oceanographic institute time to call in another favor he muttered as the phone began ringing yo answered a familiar deep baritone mercer instantly recognized the easy negligence of the greeting the voice was pure harlem spook whatever happened to hello only one man dare call me that is that you mercer no this is the massachusetts chapter of the kkk soliciting donations so it is the rock jock how the hell are you three years earlier mercer had been contacted by a pennsylvania mining firm about a piece of property they had just purchased in upstate new york the company was hoping to reopen a hardrock anthracite mine first excavated in the s while doing the first exploratory trips into the halfsubmerged mine mercer and a small team from the mining company had come across a school of swift but blind fish not recognizing them as a normal subterranean species mercer had called in woods hole to investigate the mutated specimens they sent over two marine biologists and several assistants the mine was never reopened but the research had given a young grad student named charles washington his phd thesis and a guaranteed tenure at woods hole mercer had given washington the nickname spook not because of his black skin and innercity manner but because of his love of stephen king novels and the frightening stories hed tell to keep the crew entertained while working in the dark mine tunnels another day older and deeper in debt shit man you aint seen debt until you see the payments on my new bmw whatever happened to scientists with leatherelbowed jackets untrimmed beards and beatup saabs thats for old white farts not us lean and mean black brothers sides which last i knew you was drivin a jag just to prove im not an old white fart thats all bullshit but i love ya anyway this aint no social call what up a year ago woods hole sent a team to mozambique to look at shrimp beds you know anything about it no but hold on i know someone who does mercer could hear him shout to someone else in the room a few minutes later a frail female voice came on the line hello this is dr baker good afternoon doctor my name is philip mercer im a geologist with the usgs mercer thought it best to sound formal im trying to get some information about an expedition to mozambique that woods hole was involved with last year thats what charley said i was on that expedition as lab director do you happen to remember any of the russian scientists a youngish man in particular im sorry i dont have his name probably youre referring to valery borodin supposedly he was a biologist but he knew more about geology than anything else he spent most of his time with one of the women from noaa lucky girl whys that i may be sixtysix years old mr mercer and have four delightful grandchildren but these old eyes can still appreciate a handsome man and valery borodin was a very handsome man so you say he knew more about geology than anything else huh thats right if you want to know more about him i suggest you contact the woman from noaa i cant think of her name right off the top of my head but if you give me a second i can get it thats okay dr baker youve been more than kind thank you and please thank dr washington mercer hung up and leaned far back into his seat he reviewed the information hed gathered a bunch of dead whales an explosion on a research vessel an assassination attempt on the only survivor a telegram from a dead friend one freighter with two different designs on its stack an italian crew that speaks russian a russian biologist that doesnt know biology and probably has nothing to do with whats going on and mercer looked ruefully at the empty beer bottles on his desk the beginning of a good buzz in other words ive got nothing he said aloud and switched off the desk lamp bangkok thailand while many of the pacific islands are described as sparkling jewels by those who visit them anyone seeing the spratly islands would agree that they are nothing more than a handful of gravel tossed haphazardly into the center of the south china sea the spratlys are spread across an area the size of new england yet comprise a total land area of less than two square miles the more than one hundred islets coral outcroppings and atolls are completely unremarkable except that they are claimed as sovereign territory by no less than six nations these countries in a bid to legitimize their claims have gone so far as to set up gun emplacements on some of the larger islands and garrisons on the smaller ones islands so small that high tide obliterates them and leaves the troops standing thigh high in the sea vietnam has occupied twentyfive of the islands while china claims seven the philippines eight malaysia three and taiwan one the sultan of brunei wants to claim one island in particular but that tiny speck is underwater for more than six months of the year at first many western observers scoffed at the conflicting claims calling them a poor mans imperialism a naval engagement between china and vietnam in march which claimed the lives of seventyseven vietnamese and an undisclosed number of chinese changed their attitudes these two vehemently communist countries did not come to blows for merely territorial reasons nor national pride the motivation for the battle was the basest of interests greed since oil was discovered off the coast of southern vietnam in the mids the nations ringing the south china sea have shown a keen interest in what other natural resources might lie beneath the warm waters hydrocarbons huge fishing banks and the spratlys location in the middle of the shipping lanes between the pacific and indian oceans have made them one of the most contested spots on the globe to open a dialogue between the disputing parties the government of indonesia invited them all to bandung about sixty miles east of jakarta in for several weeks ministers met to discuss their aims china promised to consider joint economic development of the spratlys provided that all other claimants relinquished their territorial interests in response malaysia purchased two guided missile corvettes from great britain the meeting broke up with nothing resolved since then the situation had continued to deteriorate vietnam began shelling vessels that strayed too close to the island of amboyna cay and malaysia further solidified her position by building an airfield on terumba layanglayang taiwan grabbed two more islands setting up manned outposts the taiwanese also faced down a threat from a chinese gunboat an act that almost brought the two nations to war taiwans new aggressiveness coupled with a massive infusion of money from american and european oil companies prompted the government of thailand to make a new attempt to bring about a peaceful settlement thus ministers from the six rival nations plus binding representatives from the united states and russia were meeting in bangkok at the invitation of the thai foreign minister the meetings were held at the shangrila hotel just off sathon road along the banks of the chao phraya river the river which runs through the sprawling city of bangkok the way the aorta runs through the human body behind closed teak doors in the hotels new convention center the eight representatives plus their coterie of aides and translators had been hard at work for six straight weeks meeting ten hours a day and it was beginning to look like the conference would be a success the chinese representative minister lujian was willing to forgo total sovereignty of the islands if his nation was granted a continuation of most favored nation status from the united states in return the united states representative undersecretary of commerce kenneth donnelly received guarantees that several american oil companies would be allowed exploratory rights to a couple of areas in the spratlys all of the assembled delegates agreed to this yet the taiwanese and russian representatives continued to bring up fine points of law that served only as delaying tactics the bangkok accords as they were to be known were ready yet minister tren and ambassador gennady perchenko continued to delay the final signing ambassador perchenko had been mostly silent during the preceding weeks of negotiations yet a week earlier he had taken his customary place at the round table in the richly tapestried room with a new set to his shoulders he had begun to speak and had rarely stopped since at first minister lujian thought perchenko and tren were buying time for a taiwanese military buildup but satellite images and hard data from spies around the naval bases at kaohsiung and chilung showed no increase in activity kenneth donnelly finally assumed that these tactics were a way for the russians to gain some sort of economic interest in the spratlys in exchange for a timely settlement drawing on his twentyfive years of adroit statecraft experience perchenko had changed his role from observer to dominator ready to dictate terms with a discreet click a member of the kings personal bodyguard closed the heavy doors to the conference room and took up station just to their left a gleaming m hanging from his thin shoulder the thai foreign minister prem vivarya paused for a few moments to let the men in the room settle down before opening the morning session set before the asian delegates were cups of delicate porcelain decorated with ermine lotus blossoms filled with steaming tea the americans and the russians drank thick coffee from institutional white cups the type found in hotels all over the world through the partially shaded plateglass window minister prem could see the gleaming concrete tower of the hotel beyond it the green torpid river was choked with powerboats barges water taxis and longtailed skiffs caught in the midst of the citys rush hour he hoped that this day would not become as deadlocked as the river traffic gentlemen at yesterdays meeting prem intoned and the assembled translators began whispering to their charges the representative from the russian federation ambassador perchenko was beginning to outline several concerns that his government had for the treaty that we are all considering even through the cumbersome translations prems annoyance at the russian was plain perchenko a heavy rumpled man in his late fifties smiled tightly as an aide perchenko had attended the landmark united nations convention on the law of the sea in caracas with more than nations represented it was the largest gathering of its type in history a truly global event it took nine grueling months to write the final document it pertained to every aspect of the oceans from environmental protection to the harvesting of their bounty from the free passage of vessels to undersea mining in the end every representative signed it yet the convention was killed soon after its birth because the united states congress refused to enact it into law though unclos had miscarried it had given gennady perchenko one of the finest educations possible on maritime law now he was using that knowledge for the bangkok accords or more precisely to stall the bangkok accords after minister prems opening remarks perchenko launched into a tenhourlong monologue interrupted only by a onehour pause for lunch this speech though informed was entirely irrelevant perchenko chronicled sovereignty issues dating back more than a century and although the conflict over the spratlys was based on such historical clashes they had been reviewed ad nauseam during earlier meetings there was no logical reason for the wily russian to bring them up again as soon as the other delegates realized that perchenko was stalling once again they quickly tuned out the voices of their translators and blankly watched the shadows progress around the room as the hours passed this was the third straight day of perchenkos monologues and this one was as pointless as the preceding two at six in the evening minister prem politely interrupted perchenko ambassador perchenko the hour once again grows late the hotels chef informed me earlier that his dishes cannot be held long so it is in our best interest if we pause here and resume again in the morning of course minister perchenko smiled mirthlessly his voice was still controlled and level after hours of speaking and unlike the other men in the room he showed not the slightest trace of discomfort or boredom the delegates stood quickly and shuffled from the room perchenko remained seated and made a show of lighting a thin dutch cigar undersecretary of commerce donnelly clapped perchenko on the shoulder in a friendly gesture but the big texans hand dug deeply into the russians soft muscles see ya at dinner pardner perchenko waited until the room was empty before wincing at the pain in his shoulder and attempting to massage it away fucking cowboy he muttered perchenko left the hotel quickly forgoing the dinner as he had most evenings exiting the gleaming concrete tower on the river side he called over one of the hotels river taxis perchenko told the bellman his destination and he in turn informed the liveried boat driver the russian stepped lightly onto the taxi a riva twentyfour footer and settled himself into the wide backseat just forward of the crafts idling engine the driver eased the boat into the teeming river traffic heading north and passing the classic victorian elegance that was the oriental hotel like its brethren shepherds in cairo or the mount nelson in cape town the oriental stood as a reminder of the once mighty and farflung british empire the riva drove north cutting a quick stroke through the river dodging other boats with the agility of a thoroughbred bangkok tumbled down to the edge of the river in urban sprawl barges sat tied to the banks four and five deep forming cluttered neighborhoods of their own the numerous canals that once sliced off into the city and earned bangkok the title venice of the east were all but gone turned into automobilechoked streets but all of bangkoks diversity could still be seen from the river the wealth stacked up in glittering highrises and the abject poverty living in stick and sheet metal shacks crammed between warehouses on the river the sharp water smell almost masked the reeking cloud of pollution which shrouds the city ejected from sweatshops and cars in a pall that rivals los angeles or mexico city the boat sped along under the memorial bridge where cars and the threewheeled jitneys called tuktuks were strung like beads they shot past the arun wat the temple of dawn a squashed cone that typified thai religious architecture the dying rays of the sun shone hard against its gilded facade the taxi passed the royal palace the temple of the emerald buddha and wat po as they pounded northward the city became older the buildings more tumbled the western influence not nearly as strong the houses and tenements were so jammed together that they leaned against one another it seemed as though if one were torn down whole neighborhoods would tumble like dominos finally they came to the royal river hotel the only major hotel on the western bank of the river a new hotel it was immensely popular with european and australian tour groups tourists clustered around white tables on the hotels landing their shorts and opennecked shirts garish splashes of color that clashed sharply with their sunburnt skin gennady perchenko stood and shuffled to the rivas gunwale ignoring the proffered hand of a bellman he stumbled to the dock and told the driver to wait in both english and mangled thai he approached the waterside bars host a tuxedoed man with a deeply pocked face and slicked back hair as the maitre d led perchenko to the only unoccupied table he spoke quietly from the side of his mouth his thin lips barely moving there is no word yet you should wait perchenko bristled at the order from this man who was no more than a cutout in the spy trade a disposable piece of garbage whose worth was so small it was uncountable yet he knew the man was right he must wait as a slim waitress set a rum collins on his table perchenko thought as he had every night since coming to bangkok about how he had gotten into his current situation he had been a successful diplomat under the old soviet regime a functionary of some standing who might have one day reached a cabinet position the coup the collapse of the soviet government and the subsequent formation of the russian federation had all but crushed his career in the sweeping changes that washed across his homeland like a tsunami wave perchenko had found himself tumbling in the swirling black eddies former allies in the politburo vanished others switched loyalties so fast that even they had no idea in what they believed gennady watched assignment after assignment pass him by the old cronyism had been replaced by a tougher but more subtle system of political patronage that left him idle while other men flourished it was at that time that a hand reached out and dragged him back onto the crest of the wave later he realized that that hand belonged to the very devil himself colonel ivan kerikov director of department kgb scientific operations kerikov was a shadowy figure in the stygian world of espionage a man no one claimed to know yet the list of those who feared him was lengthy a full month before the bangkok accords were announced kerikov had invited perchenko to his offices in a nondescript building near the moskva hotel far from kgb headquarters he was told about the upcoming meetings and given a choice attend as kerikovs agent or never receive another posting in the foreign service perchenko did not question how kerikov knew of the impending meetings nor did he question the meaning of the word agent he simply accepted and began making preparations five weeks later gennady was told by his superior in the foreign office that he would represent the federation in thailand gennady innocently asked if kerikov had any final orders his superior shot him a scathing look then sharply denied that hed ever heard of kerikov the full extent of kerikovs power became apparent in bangkok when the taiwanese ambassador took gennady aside and explained that he too was working for kerikov and would follow perchenkos orders at that moment perchenko began to fear for his life engineering his posting to the conference was one thing but kerikov seemed to control people outside of the russian federation perchenko couldnt nor did he wish to understand that level of dominion at first perchenko simply had to attend the rounds of meetings and pay attention but a week ago the situation changed kerikov contacted gennady through the maitre d at the royal river and instructed him to delay the final signing of the accords no explanation was given and the fear that gennady had built of kerikov had prevented him from ever asking for one if ivan kerikov wanted the bangkok accords stalled that was exactly what gennady would do so gennady stalled and waited for some sort of inquiry from his superiors in the foreign office their silence he assumed was another sign of kerikovs influence perchenko could easily handle the pressure put on him by the other delegates and the assistance given by the taiwanese ambassador made the situation even easier still he wanted some sense of kerikovs final plan how long would he have to delay the meetings and what was the ultimate goal as perchenko watched the maitre d wend his way through the crowded tables to seat a group of dutch tourists he knew the answers wouldnt be found here yes he muttered i must wait moscow colonel ivan kerikov dragged his hard flat gaze from the face of the man across his desk and lined up the glowing tip of the nearly spent cigarette to the fresh one pressed between his thin lips as soon as the smoke filled his lungs he ground the old cigarette into an overflowing ashtray and stared again at his guest the man seemed to shrink under kerikovs scrutiny through the cloud of acrid smoke kerikov continued his assessment of his guest though he had never met the man before he was cut from the same mold as so many other bureaucrat accountants that kerikov seemed to know the man intimately the accountant wore the uniform of a kgb major but the tailoring was poor so it hung loosely across his thin shoulders and sunken chest the few decorations seemed to be more apology than a statement of valor his skin was pasty white and had soviet doctors not perfected cheap ocular surgery kerikov was sure that this man would sport thicklensed glasses kerikov remembered with distaste that the auditors handshake was limp like squeezing a plastic bag of entrails kerikov had not been surprised when this man had presented himself to his secretary an hour earlier in fact he had been expecting a general audit from the kgbs central bureau of which this man was the vanguard here merely to pave the way for the dozen or so other little ferrets who would tear through kerikovs budgetary reports with the anticipation of hounds tracking a fresh scent this audit was a long time coming after the collapse of the old soviet union every sector of the government had been reevaluated the budgets once lavish under brezhnev and andropov had dwindled under gorbachev and yeltsin and accountability had risen every ruble and kopek now had to be tracked and disbursed financial discrepancy was unacceptable it was an indication of the power of the kgb that they were the last of the major organizations to fall victim to the auditors slashing pens kerikov had known a full six months earlier that the auditing teams were interested in the affairs of his particular division of the kgb department scientific operations it was only a cruel quirk of fate that this interest coincided with a massive amount of new spending which he was now forced to justify to the thin major sitting on the other side of his oak desk as the auditor busied himself in his imitation leather expandable briefcase kerikov reflected on the easier times scientific operations had once enjoyed born in the tumult of the great patriotic war against the nazis department had been established by stalin himself to help assimilate captured enemy technology into the soviet army as the russian forces advanced into germany and liberated various factories and laboratories members of the newly formed scientific operations were there to see that secret works were preserved and brought back to a huge facility near the black sea port of odessa if a site was deemed important to the members of department they gave the order and whole buildings were dismantled packed up and shipped back to russia oftentimes with the original staffs kept as virtual slave labor in this fashion a deuterium plant was taken from outside berlin and reestablished giving russia her first source of heavy water a critical component in the building of fission bombs a factory outside of warsaw that produced zyklonb the nerve agent used in the death camps was shipped to a remote site in the ural mountains and began stockpiling gas weapons by the summer of officers of department seized a heinkle workshop just as the staff were destroying their accumulated research the papers and models captured from that raid led to the development of the mig the soviets first jet fighter since the strategic rocket site at penemunde was liberated by the western allies department lost out on that windfall of missile technology yet still managed to secure many top scientists and designs for their homeland by far their greatest boon came during the occupation of berlin while the western allies busied themselves searching the city for war criminals the soviets searched for secrets a safe in the home of a messerschmitt engineer yielded the formula for a synthetic oil necessary for turbine engines the diary of a krupp manager held the key to the metallurgy of the exhaust nozzle of the v rocket in this fashion department brought secrets home to russia and gave soviet scientists the facilities they needed to adapt them to the red army by the summer of all of the captured german technology had been evaluated much incorporated and some abandoned with its primary mission complete the head of department boris ulinev decided to change the objective of his section scientific operations had been a passive agency it had no agents in the popular sense nor did it create anything original ulinev set out to change all that because scientific operations had always dealt with technology that was ahead of its time ulinev began setting up operations that would only come to fruition far into the future spending millions of rubles supplied by the soviet government ulinev directed the eight hundred scientists on his staff to concentrate their efforts leapfrogging current technology and developing devices far more advanced than anything on any drawing board in the world like kelly johnsons skunk works at lockheed which developed the sr spy plane long before the materials were available to build it scientific operations began designing and testing rudimentary multiwarhead ballistic missiles even before sputnik was conceived a department theoretician came just a couple of molecules away from discovering carbon fiber and a team of experts began working on circuit boards for computers while the rest of the world still marveled at the power of the vacuum tube one project in particular became the pet of boris ulinev and subsequently the potential triumph of ivan kerikov presented to ulinev by an intense young geologist named pytor borodin the project was as audacious as anything yet attempted by department in fact it might rival the greatest feats of mankind the undertaking codenamed vulcans forge had its genesis on bikini atoll on july when the united states conducted the first underwater nuclear test as part of operation crossroads it took four years until for the data from that test to reach department stolen by a female agent who seduced a lab technician at the white sands testing grounds in new mexico where the volumes of information and tons of samples were warehoused pytor borodin became involved due to a happenstance comment from a colleague who mentioned that a hitherto unknown alloy had been created by the bikini explosion borodin quickly became obsessed going so far as to request a clandestine submarine reconnaissance to bikini in late in order to collect additional samples of sand water and debris from the seventyfour ships the us intentionally sank as part of the test for eighteen additional months borodin labored at his task until he was able to present a farreaching plan to boris ulinev it seemed tailormade for the new direction scientific operations was to take the opening phase of vulcans forge called for the detonation of a nuclear weapon deep under the pacific ocean because all atomic materials were under the direct control of the army ulinev had his team secretly build one this alone took more than a year department also established a large dummy corporation and secreted money in various accounts in europe and asia all in all vulcans forge wasnt ready to commence until the spring of once the opening gambit had been played the only thing left to do was wait for nature to take her course for forty years the waiting dragged by through the height of the cold war through the opening of eastern europe and through the collapse of the soviet union herself during this time boris ulinev died and was replaced and his replacement was himself replaced and so on until ivan kerikov reigned as the head of a much diminished department of all the plots and projects launched by ulinev in the s only vulcans forge remained viable unfortunately its raison detre had vanished the mighty struggle between communism and capitalism was all but over the massive arms race during the s had brought the soviet union to her economic knees though gamely trying to keep pace in conventional and nuclear forces reagans gamble on star wars technology had chimed the death knell for russia the soviet union had no response to sdi but capitulation america paid for the arms buildup with a fouryear recession but russia paid with her very existence bit by bit russia began withdrawing into herself aid to cuba was slowed to a trickle then shut off completely troops were pulled from the fiftyyear occupation of berlin aeroflot suspended most international flights within russia programs and departments began to vanish the staterun diamond mines at aikhal in central siberia were surreptitiously sold to a london consortium linked to the consolidated selling system the blackjack bomber the mig fulcrum and russias aircraft carrier program were all shelved officers began committing suicide because they were worth more to their families dead than alive the staff of the kgb was cut by more than fifty percent bold projects like vulcans forge had no place in the new world order during his first four years as head of scientific operations before the collapse of the soviet union kerikov had guarded and nurtured vulcans forge for pure patriotism and duty but now the very fabric of what he believed had torn through and kerikov started to protect the project from the auditors for simple greed he planned to steal vulcans forge for himself in a coup as brilliant as the original plan laid down by pytor borodin forty years before time once so abundant had run incredibly short for kerikov the bangkok accords had seemed a providential gift when first proposed but now it had become necessary to delay them at a substantial cost in bribe money paid to the ambassador of taiwan and to gennady perchenko and perchenkos superior in the foreign office department could ill afford the huge payoffs kerikov had been able to dodge the auditors for months but now they were here in his office asking questions that he was unwilling to answer ah here we are the ferret said pulling a sheaf of notes from his briefcase it seems that your department paid for the refitting of a refrigeration ship called the august rose four years ago at a cost of twentyseven million dollars an affidavit from a shipyard foreman in vladivostok states that the sonar system installed on the ship is far superior to anything hes seen on our strategic submarines would you care to comment on that kerikov felt a pressure building behind his eyes a force that threatened to blow apart his entire head security concerning the refit of the august rose had been airtight yet here was the entire story being laid out before him the constraint of time hed felt a moment ago had just tightened with the relentlessness of a garrote kerikov opened the top righthand drawer of his desk i happen to have something here that is very pertinent to that the accountant leaned forward in his chair eyes bright with anticipation there was only one round in the makarov semiautomatic pistol the one round kerikov had planned to use on himself if the need ever arose it blew a perfectly round hole through the accountants forehead then splattered the contents of his skull onto the wall and door behind his slumping body kerikov rummaged through his desk until he found a flimsy cardboard box of ammunition he loaded one round into the pistol and slipped it back into the drawer he pressed the intercom button on his black telephone yes mr kerikov his secretary answered there has been a slight change in my plans anna kerikov lit another cigarette inform evad lurbud that i want him in cairo as soon as possible i believe he is still at my dacha also i want you to get me the earliest flight to bangkok ill travel on the johann kreiger passport what about the kgb accountant anna asked kerikov assumed from her tone that she had heard the shot hell be resting here for a while as soon as youve reached lurbud and booked my flight leave the building when youre questioned tell them that you took an early lunch and know nothing good luck anna and goodbye i understand if she was disappointed that their fouryear affair was ending she gave no indication kerikov took some time going through the secure files in his wall safe pulling out a select few that might one day prove useful or profitable he knew after he boarded the flight to bangkok hed never again return to russia the pacific valery borodin bolted upright in his bed a muffled gasp clutched in the base of his throat his lean body was slick with nervous sweat his dark hair plastered to his neat head his chest heaved and his heart pounded as he fought to regain control of himself it took nearly two minutes to realize he was no longer the frightened sixyearold boy of his dream being told by faceless uniformed men that his father had died in a laboratory accident he was a man now a respected scientist in his own right yet the haunting sobs of his mother still lingered in the quiet of his cabin aboard the motor ship august rose that dream had tortured him since the day those events actually occurred it woke him most nights but he had always remained silent because his mother was grieving in the room next to his in the small kiev apartment that the department of scientific operations had allowed them to retain as recompense after the accident to valery that had been the worst stifling the scream that always rushed through him suppressing it crushing it so he would not disturb his mother to russians grief was something to be worn openly passionately yet he could not express it he did not believe that his pain was worth encroaching on his mothers years later retelling this story always evoked sympathy from the listener but never understanding somehow he got the feeling that people thought there was something wrong with him some flaw it wasnt until last year in mozambique that valery found someone who finally understood an american girl who was herself a victim of losing a parent young he swung his legs off the narrow bunk of his private cabin had the soviet government not developed a keen interest in his mind valery surely would have found a career in the ballet there was not an ounce of extra flesh on his frame muscled plane blended with supple joint in the perfect symmetry that comes not from hours spent in gyms but the blessing of genetic inheritance he raked his fingers through his hair pulling it back from his forehead and at once a thick cowlick sprang up and hung over his right eye the dream which had haunted his childhood had returned just last year in the office of ivan kerikov a man whom valery had never heard of but who seemed to know everything about him valery learned that this man was the current head of the department that had employed his late father kerikov calmly explained that scientific operations had watched valery with interest over the years and in fact helped him along at times as valery incredulously tried to digest this piece of information kerikov dropped another bombshell he pressed a signal buzzer on his desk and a man walked into the room valery barely heard kerikov introduce dr pytor borodin thirty years had aged his father filling out his body and silvering his wild hair and beard but he was still the man who stared from the photograph hanging over the dinner table in his mothers apartment that night valery had the dream for the first time since his early teens it wasnt until their next meeting that valery had recovered enough to actually listen to the things his father and kerikov were discussing the elder borodin had faked his own death so many years ago as a security precaution his work at the time had been so secret that only such drastic measures would ensure protection after most of borodins coworkers were summarily executed in the summer of borodin had worked alone monitoring his secret project nurturing it along to its now fast approaching conclusion kerikov explained that they needed a new staff of scientists to see the project concluded would valery be interested in joining as secondincommand at the time valery was working for the state energy bureau investigating the potential of russias tremendous methane hydrate reserves which were locked in the permafrost of western and central siberia his background in geology was as strong as any of the new breed of russian scientists men and women whose worth was valued by results rather than the ability to regurgitate party dogma valery only agreed to join after being assured that his consideration was based on his merits not on the family connection pytor borodins casual dismissal of such a notion was terribly painful as if borodin wasnt even acknowledging his own son two weeks after those early meetings valery was given a holiday in mozambique under the cover of a marine biology mission a chance to defrost his body after so many months in siberia and prepare himself for the work ahead since then the work had been nothing short of incredible kerikov had managed to assemble some of the sharpest minds in the russian federation and place at their disposal the latest cutting edge technology valery pulled on a pair of american denim jeans and a military green tshirt it was just past midnight but he knew trying to go back to sleep would be futile the ships galley one deck below his cabin was deserted but a large urn of coffee was kept warm on a side table valery filled a white mug and took a cautious sip of the strong bitter brew he nodded to the kitchen hand noisily cleaning pans in the scullery before leaving for the nerve center of the august rose built as a bulk carrier designated ut by hitachizosen in she had been converted to a refrigeration ship in when she had been bought by ocean freight and cargo the million cubic feet of bulk storage area had been reduced by nearly thirty percent to make room for massive carrier refrigeration units and the special cargohandling equipment needed to transport frozen goods that refitting was well documented by the japanese shipyard that carried out the work by continental insurance and by the finnish bank which floated most of the loans held by ocean freight and cargo the august roses next refit was kept much more secret she spent seven weeks in a secure drydock in vladivostok in the spring of cosmetically she still resembled the vessel she had always been deadweight tons and feet long with a sharply raked bow and an aftpositioned superstructure that resembled a fourstory steel box but within her steelplated hull she was transformed into the most unique scientific vessel ever built the cavernous main hold was turned into a geophysics laboratory augmented by smaller labs offices and data storage rooms the refrigeration units were left in place but now they worked to keep the sophisticated computer system at a constant temperature the computers themselves were huge taking up nearly two thousand square feet of space for the mainframes and half again as much for the peripherals there was more computing power aboard the august rose than at baikanor russias equivalent of cape canaveral enough cargo space remained for the august rose to operate under the cover of a refrigerator ship though she could no longer haul enough frozen goods to ever turn a profit yet the ruse allowed her to sail the pacific unimpeded valery reached the main laboratory through a torturous maze of bulkhead doors and narrow companionways the final door was secured by a magnetic keycard lock a guard noted his time of entry on a log sheet and took custody of his card which would have been erased by the magnetic fields created by the equipment in the lab it was past midnight but nearly a dozen scientists technicians and assistants were at work monitoring the numerous sensors that hung from two towed arrays beneath the vessels keel a large metal plotting table dominated the center of the room above it on an articulating arm a holographic laser projector hung down like some monstrous dentists drill bundles of fiberoptic cables ran from the projector to the mainframe computer and to the table itself pytor borodin was seated at the console nearest the projection table his slim body hidden under a voluminous white lab coat valery took a deep breath of the filtered sterilized air and strode across the rubbertiled floor working late again father he might have been the oldest member of the scientific team by twenty years but pytor borodin kept a pace that far surpassed that of all his staff including his secondincommand he usually spent thirtysix hours in the computer room before taking a grudging sixhour break for sleep his crumpled appearance alarmed his son father have you been taking your medication no the elder scientist fired back irritably that coumadin is nothing more than rat poison and vasotec the beta blocker affects my breathing because of the airconditioning now dont bother me again about my heart have a look at this weve gotten the cameras back on line valery glanced at the monitor and saw a close approximation of hell on earth dangling from a kevlar cable and encased in carbon fiber with a thick artificial sapphire lens cover the camera hung directly above the central vent of the fastest growing volcano in the world molten rock forced upward by the tremendous heat engine of the earths core poured through the narrow rent in the crust in a neverending stream amid billowing clouds of noxious gas and dissolved minerals there was no microphone attached to the camera but valery could almost hear the protesting moans as the earth vomited up her guts the rate has increased again valery remarked and the flow is forming more westerly now right its caught in the north equatorial gyre just as id predicted but that current only moves maybe three miles per day surely that cant cause a shift in the formation of the cone it wouldnt normally no but the rate of ejection from the volcano is so great that the two forces create a skew in the lava flow its a simple matter of vectors im glad youre here valery the computer is about finished with the past days data and is ready for a growth projection because of the massive amount of raw data gathered by the sensors and the inherently chaotic movement of anything within natures realm the august rose needed huge computers in order to create a reasonable prediction of the volcanos future growth even with the gigabytes of power the computers needed a full twentyfour hours to remap down to the millimeter the thrusting cone below the ship and then to predict where the cone would broach the surface of the pacific ocean the countdown clock on one computer screen indicated that the holographic projection would be complete in one minute and twenty seconds valery and his father waited in silence both preferring to stare at the camera images than fake inane conversation pytor borodin didnt seem to notice the tension between them but valery was well aware finally the counter ran down to zero and pytor borodin activated the holographic imager the model projected against the plotting table began as just a hazy conical outline but quickly sharpened crags radiating dikes and smaller vents were easily distinguished the projection looked as solid as a plaster cast but was composed entirely of laser beams activating the extrapolation logarithms the computer had already done the tens of billions of calculations necessary to predict the growth of the volcano so the image began to change immediately a shimmering blue plane representing the oceans surface appeared and the volcano quickly rose through it tiny simulated waves pounding against the bleak basalt shores borodin pressed several more buttons on his console and longitude and latitude lines were added to the projection accurate to the second of a degree with a note of satisfaction pytor borodin remarked this is the third straight test where the summit has broached more than a thousand meters outside of hawaiis twohundredmile exclusionary limit i think it is now time to inform kerikov he turned to a female assistant tell the captain that i wish us to remain on the site for an additional twentyfour hours she nearly bowed as she left the lab borodin strode back to his console and called to the room at large reset the sensors and the computers i want to run another simulation immediately just as valery turned to go his father grabbed him lightly by the arm you have yet to see the latest from the gas spectrometry lab the two left the lab together borodins hand still on his sons arm as if he expected him to bolt at any moment the spectrometry lab was crammed with gleaming stainless steel equipment and several computer monitors slaved to the mainframe the gas spectrometer itself was as large as an automobile but infinitely more complex it used the spectrum of light given off by vaporized material to decode its chemical composition the system was also paired with a seismic wave echo sounder as a backup vassily show our secondincommand what you showed me earlier this evening borodin never called valery his son the sheets of paper the scientist thrust into valerys hands were covered in bands of rainbow hues broken up by black lines of varying thicknesses the lines corresponded to the wavelengths of light absorbed by the vaporized materials as easily as a geographer deciphering the myriad lines on a topographical map valery leafed through pages noting no deviations from the normal composition of asthenospheric magma until he came to the last set of spectrographic images he recognized the lines denoting basalt silica and ferromagnesium but there was also a series of conspicuous lines indicating the presence of vanadium and next to that a jumble of alternating thick and thin lines that he had never seen before the earliest writings on alchemy date from the midfifth century and have been found in arab and chinese codices as well as european pytor borodin said softly looking over his sons shoulder at the printout for the following twelve centuries alchemists represented the best scientific minds of their time and gave rise to modern chemistry and pharmacology yet they all failed at their selfappointed task not one was ever able to transmute lead into gold now in the age of supercomputers satellites and atom smashers we have returned to the very roots of science we have done what thousands of people have wasted generations trying to accomplish at the time of the great alchemists gold represented the true power of the world today power in the literal sense is what drives the planet we have done something that mankind had given up as hopeless we have turned base earth into the most precious substance in the universe not some gaudy metal with only limited use but a power source that can recreate itself even as we use it up with that kind of strength valery no one will ever have the strength to challenge us uncomfortable with his fathers words valery silently let the papers slide to the desk and walked out of the lab he was reminded of a quote from hindu mythology in which shiva announced i am become death the destroyer of worlds they were the same words used by robert oppenheimer after his creation vaporized a portion of the new mexico desert arlington virginia mercer woke just before six in the morning the jet lag hed expected burned away by the previous days adrenaline overdose he rose stiffly gently fingering the livid bruises on both shoulders he shaved and showered before descending to the rec room with a cup of thick black coffee in hand he tried unsuccessfully to concentrate on the morning papers throughout the night his sleep had been interrupted with new questions about tishs story but there were no answers he resigned himself to waiting for the information from david saulman in miami by quarter of seven his coffee cold in the cup mercer impatiently folded the newspapers and slid them down the length of the bar behind the bar between a bottle of remy martin and one of glenfiddich lay a onefoot section of railroad track half of it was rustcolored and pitted the other burnished to an almost mirror finish mercer retrieved the heavy rail and set it on a towel on the bar beside it he placed a shoe box containing a metal polishing kit usually stored next to the antique fridge he began polishing the rail with a remarkable amount of concentration as if when the steel was beneath his fingers nothing else in the world mattered as the rust and grime slowly dissolved under the chemical and physical onslaught he silently thanked winston churchill for giving him the idea for such a meditative device when the british prime minister found himself under even greater stress than his legendary constitution could handle he would build brick walls in the courtyard behind number downing street the repetitive act of mortaring setting and pointing allowed his mind to disengage from the frantic pace of the second world war and focus on one particular problem when a solution was thrashed out in this fashion an aide would tear down the wall chip the mortar from the bricks and stack them neatly for the next crisis emulating this idea but adapting it for apartment life mercer had begun polishing railroad track while attending the colorado school of mines he would polish a section for an hour or so before a big exam clearing his mind and focusing his energy on the upcoming challenge he graduated eleventh in his class and swore that this ritual was the key of course he chuckled as he worked on the rail a near photographic memory didnt hurt since school mercer estimated that hed polished nearly sixty yards of track he was still polishing when tish entered the rec room a little past nine good morning she said mercer laid his polishsoaked rag in the shoe box feeling no need to explain his actions good morning to you i see they fit tish pirouetted in front of him the thin black skirt twirling around her beautiful calves her top was a simple white tshirt from armani mercer had bought the clothes for her at a local mall while she had slept through the previous afternoon i assumed that youre not a transvestite and these were for me tish grinned smoothing the skirt against her thighs no i gave up drag years ago are the sizes all right right down to the c cup thank you for noticing she threw him another saucy grin is that coffee i smell yes but let me make a new pot this is my own blend brewed especially to wake the dead sounds fine to me she took a tentative sip and winced mercer started a fresh pot why didnt you wake me last night for dinner i figured you needed sleep more than you needed my cooking ive found that most bachelors are excellent chefs not this one im afraid i travel so much that i never took the time to learn how to cook i live by the principle that if it cant be nuked it cant be edible mercer saw tishs eyes dart to the map behind the bar ive only been on a few field trips most of my time is spent in a lab in san diego it must be exciting all that travel i mean at first it was now its cramped airline seats cardboard food and dull meetings tish scoffed but didnt press do you have any new clues as to whats going on before answering mercer glanced at his watch it was well past his personal cutoff limit of he strode around the bar and pulled a beer from the fridge i placed some calls yesterday after you went to bed we should be hearing something soon until then i think it best that you stay here is there anyone you need to contact boyfriend anything like that no good i hope by this afternoon well know something that will lead us in a direction but right now all we can do is wait dont you have to go to work mercer laughed im consulting for the usgs they expect me to be irresponsible they talked for the next hour or so mercer deftly turning the conversation away from himself so that tish spoke most of the time she had an infectious laugh and mercer noticed several charming freckles high on her cheeks she had never been married just engaged once when she was younger she was a democrat and a conservationist but she didnt trust her partys candidates or the mainstream environmental groups she never knew her mother which mercer already knew and idolized her late father which hed guessed she enjoyed her work for noaa and wasnt ready to settle down into a teaching job just yet her last serious relationship had ended seven months before so right now the only thing she needed to worry about were several house plants that her neighbor promised to look after when she had gone away to hawaii around eleven a phone rang in mercers office he made no move to answer it a few seconds later the fax machine attached to that phone line began to whirr when it finally stopped mercer excused himself and retrieved the dozen sheets from the tray he walked slowly back to the bar eyes glued to the first page as he finished each page he handed it to tish they read for twenty minutes occasionally mercer would grunt at some piece of information or tish would gasp i dont understand that question at the end of the report its a trivia challenge between dave and me goes back years i have to admit he has me stumped tish read the question aloud who was the captain of the amoco cadizo ive never even heard of that ship she was a fully loaded supertanker that ran aground in the english channel in march of ill be damned if i can remember her captains name tish regarded him strangely but changed the subject what do you make of this information im not too sure yet mercer opened another beer ocean freight and cargo the company whose ship rescued tish was headquartered in new york city but the corporate money came from a finnish consortium headed by a company once suspected of being a kgb front slicker than air america was david saulmans assessment their ships sailed mostly in the pacific running fairly standard cargos to established ports of call saulman did find that of ampc had a weasel clause his words written into all of their contracts concerning the august rose the clause allowed the fivehundredfoot refrigerator ship to break contract with only twelve hours notice provided that cargo had not already been onloaded in all of saulmans years of maritime law he had never seen such a stipulation and couldnt even guess its purpose since of ampc had evoked this clause several times refusing to load cargo onto the august rose in the states the clause was odd saulman concluded but certainly not nefarious her present position was north of hawaii hoveto because of engine difficulties saulmans sources said that she would be under way within fifteen hours and that the company had not requested outside help for their idle ship her cargo of beef scheduled to be picked up in seattle was currently being loaded onto a lykes brothers vessel mercers request for information about vessels sunk in the same waters as the noaa ship ocean seeker had opened quite a pandoras box no less than forty ships had sunk in that area in the past fifty years although sinkings had been less frequent since the s mercer assumed this was because of new weathertracking technology he noted that most of the vessels lost were charter fishing boats pleasure craft or day sailors he checked off the notable exceptions with a black waterman fountain pen ocean seeker noaa research vessel june this year one survivor oshabi maru japanese longline trawler december no survivors philipe santos chilean weather ship april no survivors western passage american freighter converted to cable layer may no survivors curie french oceanography research ship october no survivors colombo princess sri lankan container ship march thirtyone survivors baltimore american tanker february twentyfour survivors between the loss of the baltimore in and the sinking of an ore carrier named grandam phoenix in no large ships had sunk north of hawaii any large vessel lost before could be attributed to world war ii i dont know what to make of it either tish added well if the ship that rescued you is somehow connected to the kgb that would explain why you heard russian as you were being rescued mercer scanned the pages again but kept returning to the list of sunken ships noting that the grandam phoenix had been lost with all hands there was something jesus what tish said he hadnt realized hed spoken aloud i have to go to my office what for i have a hunch mercer reached for the phone a second after dialing harry whites bleary voice rasped hello harry mercer i need you over here to keep an eye on a friend of mine no dont bring a guest and yes i do still have some jack daniels right see you in a few mercer hung up and turned to tish a friend of mine will be here in a few minutes i want you to stay here with him i cant trust you out on the streets just yet not until i know more there was a pleading look in tishs eyes mercer couldnt tell if she wanted reassurance or more information ill be back in a few hours if what i suspect is true well have this cleared up by tonight and youll be on a plane home in the morning besides harry is better company than i am ten minutes later the doorbell rang and harry let himself in when he entered the rec room a few millimeters of unfiltered cigarette dangled from his lips christ mercer no wonder you called me over this girl is too pretty to be here of her own free will you must have kidnapped her actually i did tish talbot this pathetic creature is harry white harry tish harry ran a hand through his hair if i were twenty years younger id still be old enough to be your father but its good to meet you anyway mercer could see that tish was immediately charmed the old lecher still had it he admitted she would be in good hands while he was away ill be back in an hour or two take your time harry responded im free all day and im sure that the lovely lady is eager for some good company harry youre a paragon tish i wont be too long try not to encourage him bad heart you know leave us harry barked and turned to stare into tishs eyes mercer heard tishs rich laughter before the front door had closed behind him jennifer woodridge looked up in shock as mercer entered his outer office and where have you been since yesterday i took a long lunch jen and just lost track of the time right next time you do that let me know first so i can cover for you richard has been frantic trying to reach you as if by mystic perception the phone rang it was richard harris howell the corpulent whiney deputy director of the usgs mercers immediate boss dr mercer i need to see you in my office right away i have a list of travel vouchers in front of me that we need to discuss howell was more accountant now than scientist it seems that you abused government money on that south africa trip mercer held the receiver away from his ear while howell continued in this vein for another minute youre right rich mercer knew that howell hated that nickname listen ive got some stuff to clear up here ill be in your office in ten minutes mercer hung up the phone forestalling any complaint im sure hell waddle right over tell him i went to the bathroom where are you really going mercer sat on the corner of her desk and affected a mock serious tone jen i cant implicate you in this what if howell resorts to torture she giggled as soon as the little toad leaves take the rest of the day off ah hell take the week off i dont think ill be around much is there anything i can help you with just keep howell off my back he grabbed his briefcase from his inner office and descended to the basement of the usgs building where the extensive data archives were stored although mercer had not met the usgs chief archivist chuck lowry he had heard about him most people who fought in the vietnam war agreed that their tour had changed them in some profound way the staff at the usgs believed that two tours in nam had perhaps made chuck lowry a little more sane but by no stretch of the imagination was lowry a normal man he wore eighthundreddollar sports coats and tattered jeans his face was hidden behind a beautifully manicured beard but his hair was a gnarled mess the black eyeglass frames perched on his squat nose had no lenses and he swore like a truck driver but possessed an amazing vocabulary when mercer entered the computer room of the usgs archive lowry was seated behind his desk a trashy romance novel in his hand a brass plaque next to the telephone read eschew obfuscation i purchased this yesterday lowry said holding up the garishly covered book along with a packet of condoms and an economysize jar of vaseline fucking cashier didnt even bat an eye the times are fecundating a truly preternatural disinterest between people the book though is delightful except the authoress constantly describes the heroines breasts as supple and the heros torso as glistening under a sheen of manly sweat if she does it once more i will track her down and truncate her who are you philip mercer im a temporary consultant oh jen woodridge works with you you know her just as a potential stalking victim mercer hoped lowry was joking youre the guy thats busting howells balls right lets just say he and i dont get along thats been his problem since he first darkened our door he doesnt play well with others hes also a vexatious little dilettante with a permanent fecal ring environing his mouth from so much asskissing what brings you to my danteesque nook mercer ignored the fact that he understood only about a quarter of lowrys words i need to see the seismic records of hawaii during may of somewhat obtuse request but i can oblige come back tomorrow ill have everything you need sorry chuck this cant wait ive got howell breathing down my neck again so i have to get out of here asap in any way will this research piss off that cockinthemouth only to the effect that it has absolutely nothing to do with my contract with him good enough walk this way lowry hopped off his chair and shuffled into a back room doing a perfect impression of lon chaneys igor lowry seated himself in front of a computer terminal that was hooked into the data retrieval mainframe and lifted a heavy data reference book from the drawer beneath the keyboard he thumbed through it slowly whistling the theme from gilligans island several minutes passed before he put the book aside and began hammering at the keys i always type fortissimo rather than pianissimo lets the fucking machine know who is maestro around here mercer could not suppress a grin at lowrys antics after a few minutes at the keys the computer chirping whirring and beeping lowry pushed himself away from the terminal there seismic records of the hawaiian islands for may of why the fuck you want it ill never fathom now ill return to bimbo st trollop and her hero the redoubtable major tough roughman lowry left the room and mercer took his seat at the computer because of the tremendous volcanic activity in and around hawaii the records even for a single month would take days to assimilate but he had a specific date in mind twenty minutes later mercer shut off the computer and thanked lowry for his help lowrys response was a quote from the romance novel tough tore the bodice from her young flesh exposing her supple breasts to the pirate crew lowry looked up this bitch writer is going to die mercer chuckled and closed the door to the archive he took the stairs directly to the street because the jaguar or what was left of it was still impounded he was forced to take a cab back to his house tish and harry were not home but a note taped to the television screen in the rec room stated they had gone to tinys bar mercer was furious for a moment but realized that tish would be just about as safe there as at the house before he could join them at tinys he had to place a call to new york city to set up what he hoped was the beginning of a plan ocean freight and cargo the kgb or whoever was behind all of this had gotten mercer into the fight now it was time to return the favor the white house our mans name is mercer dr philip mercer dick henna announced as he entered the oval office about fucking time paul barnes the acting head of the cia said there was no love lost between the two men also in the office with the president was admiral c thomas morrison the second africanamerican to be chairman of the joint chiefs in us history and a man who didnt play coy about possible political aspirations who is he dick the president asked hes a mining consultant currently working for the usgs the reason it took so long to id mercer was that a cop friend of his impounded his jaguar at the anacostia auxiliary lot if i hadnt put extra men on the case we never would have found him henna took a seat i can only assume the woman is with him why does that name sound familiar to me the president said more to himself than the men seated around him sir barnes spoke up he was involved in a cia operation just prior to the gulf war im sure his name was mentioned during a briefing by my predecessor thats right i was serving on the senate armed services committee then yes sir dr mercer accompanied a small team of delta force soldiers into iraq to investigate their capabilities of mining weaponsgrade uranium the international atomic energy agency confirmed that the iraqis hadnt obtained any from foreign sources but we needed to know if the uranium ore mined near mosul was pure enough to be enriched into plutonium the data mercers team brought back guaranteed that our troops would not face a nuclear threat that was the last piece of intelligence president bush needed before commencing operation desert storm as i recall there were some losses during that mission the president commented yes there were four of the commandos were killed in an ambush at the mine site in the debriefing afterward we learned that dr mercer took charge of the remaining force and led them safely out of iraq he seems to be a capable man the president remarked thats true but were still left with the question why did he kidnap tish talbot killing a halfdozen men in the process including two agents of the fbi sent to protect her he did not kill my men henna snorted the man found dead in the hospital room had blood under his fingernails it matched the blood of my men on guard down the hall then who the hell was the man in the hospital room admiral morrison asked hes not in our files henna replied but interpol thinks they have a match they also might be able to identify the bodies found on the street and in the metro i should know in an hour or so we still dont have a why yet gentlemen barnes said acidly his scalp an angry red well have mercer in custody shortly henna snapped we just missed him at his office but i have agents planted around his house in arlington as of ten minutes ago when we have him we will get our why oh there is one more thing noaa received a bill from a maritime law firm in miami for information that was faxed to philip mercers house what was the information asked the president we dont know sir we got the runaround from the law office a court order is being rushed through right now to search their files we should know what mercer wanted by late today i must say that so far dr mercer has been a lot smarter than any of us the president spoke softly a sure sign that he was keeping his temper in check and if dr talbot is with him she is probably in more capable hands than ours so far he has saved her life at least once and managed to elude our best efforts to find him now hes launched an investigation of his own which seems to have more direction than ours am i right the presidents accusation was met by silence when dr mercer is found i want him brought to me there will be no charges filed against him perhaps he can shed more light on whats happening in the pacific does anyone have anything else to add since our briefing yesterday admiral morrison said i have put our pacific fleet on standby alert two carrier groups are steaming toward hawaii from the coral sea the kitty hawk is in position right now along with the amphibious assault ship inchon both vessels and their support ships are three hundred miles south of hawaii i dont know if theyll be needed but its a good idea to have some firepower standing by the president rubbed his hands against his temples gentlemen we are right now facing a puzzle with no clues if ohnishi is behind the sinking of the ocean seeker dr talbot may be the only person who can provide any evidence against him we must find out what she knows until then were playing blindmans bluff with an enemy who has surfaced twice but has yet to be seen that is all the president asked dick henna to stay and dismissed barnes and morrison dick since this whole episode is taking place within our borders you are the man in charge i want to know right now what your opinion is henna took a few moments to think then said truthfully i dont know he let the statement hang in the air for several seconds that note we received a couple days ago wasnt any different from hundreds of crank letters sent to us every week until the ocean seeker went down that is then we stood up and took notice two days later the only survivor was kidnapped by a man who i think is a patriot he leaves a trail of bodies across the city requests some type of maritime information from miami and requests the seismic records of hawaii during may of from the usgs archives please dont ask me why my top people cant even come close to figuring that one out hes on to something i have no doubt why though why is he even involved his motivation may be revenge he was asked to join the noaa survey crew aboard the ocean seeker but he was out of the country i asked paul barnes for the background check the cia did on him before the mission to iraq maybe theres something there thatll help and what about the letter from takahiro ohnishi look at any newspaper today and it seems that every small ethnic group in the world is declaring their independence no matter how long they have coexisted with their neighbors africa europe even asia whos to say were immune the majority of the people of hawaii are of japanese ancestry most of whom have never seen the continental states maybe we dont have the right to govern them with our western ideas i dont know dick do you know what youre saying i do mr president i dont like it but i do know what im saying you might be confronted with a situation only once before faced by a president henna stood to go but sir that situation started a war that lasted five years and caused more deaths than all the wars in american history combined lincoln walked away a hero but maybe only because he was martyred hawaii takahiro ohnishi scraped a frank lloyd wright designed stainless fork across the limoges plate piling rich bernaise sauce around a cut of kobe beef he brought the food to his mouth and chewed thoughtfully honolulus mayor david takamora watched the elderly industrialist with wellhidden distaste ohnishi chewed for several more seconds then leaned over and spit the thick mass of meat into a silver wine bucket already a quarter filled with his chewed but indigestible meal ohnishi patted his lips delicately and waved a butler over to clear the plates tell the chef that the asparagus was a bit wilted and the next time it happens hell be fired there was no malice in his withered voice but a man of his position needed none to ensure that his orders were carried out i cant believe you didnt eat more david that beef was flown in this morning from my farm in japan my appetite isnt what it used to be takamora shrugged i hope my condition doesnt upset you not at all the mayor denied too quickly its just the pressure im under right now planning a silent coup isnt all that simple you know at home ohnishi usually used an electric wheelchair to get around easier now he wheeled away from the mahogany table takamora tossed his napkin onto the table and followed silently cursing the revolting spectacle of ohnishis eating practices though still in his fifties takamoras face was developing the languid cast common to many elderly japanese men his eyes had begun to retreat behind permanent bags his body once slender and toned from years of exercise had paunched and bowed so his trunk now appeared too large for his thin legs to support warm light glinted off the frames of the paintings and brought out the beautiful burnish of the cherry wood paneling of ohnishis private study takamora took the leather wingedback chair as ohnishi wheeled behind his broad ormolutopped desk smoke if you wish ohnishi invited takamora wasted no time lighting a marlboro with a gaily colored disposable lighter what have you to report from behind a bluegray cloud of smoke takamora spoke slowly to mask the tension he felt whenever he was in ohnishis presence we are nearly ready to send the ultimatum to the president i have two full divisions of loyal national guards ready to blockade pearl harbor and the airport the governor will return from the mainland next week we will detain him as soon as he lands our senators and representatives can be called back from washington with only a moments notice if they resist our plans they too will be detained however senator namura has already expressed an interest in joining us i have full assurances from all the civic organizations involved that they are prepared to do their part with the strikes and marches the press too is ready there will be a full blackout for fortyeight hours after the start date the news will be broadcast as usual but will make no references to the coup i have here takamora reached into his jacket pocket and removed a sheet of paper the names of the satellite technicians on the islands who could broadcast unauthorized stories i will have them detained or their equipment destroyed whichever is necessary and the phone service the main microwave transmission towers and the mainland cable junction will be taken and controlled by our troops its inevitable that some news of the coup will escape before were ready for our own broadcasts but it will be largely unconfirmable you have done well david all seems to be in order but there is a slight problem what is that takamora asked leaning forward in his chair the study door opened and the menacing form of kenji ohnishis assistantbodyguard moved to stand behind the mayors chair his steelhard hands held at his sides and what is that problem takamora repeated a bit more nervously after a glance at the newcomer the letter i had written as an ultimatum to the president has been removed from my office i can only assume it has been sent to washington takamora couldnt hide his surprise we still need more time why did you send it i did not say david that i sent the letter i said that it had been removed from my office the only person to know of this letter and to have spent time in my office alone is you therefore i must ask if you sent the letter to the president without my authorization i have only seen that letter once i swear takamora quickly realized the danger he was in i would never take it from you i want to believe you david i really do but i find that i cant i dont know what you wished to gain from your action but i assure you that i know its results i swear i didnt take the letter sweat beaded against takamoras waxen skin you are the only person to have any access to this room and to know the location of my safe i must congratulate you on your safecracking abilities most impressive there was no admiration in ohnishis voice if you think your act will cripple my efforts in any way you are very wrong as we speak arms are being readied for transit here i have made arrangements for a highly motivated mercenary army of course it would be easier to use your national guard troops but i will manage without them david you could have been the president of the newest and possibly most wealthy nation on the planet if you hadnt become greedy and crossed me i didnt desperation edged takamoras voice up an octave i find it admirable that you retain your innocence even to the end ohnishi said sadly with those words kenji struck he whipped a thin nylon cord around david takamoras neck in a lightningquick maneuver with amazing strength he torqued the cord into the mayors throat takamora clawed at the garrote as it bit deeper and deeper his tongue thickening as it thrust between his tobaccostained teeth his chokes came as thin reedy gasps as the life was pulled from him ohnishi sat neutrally as the grisly murder took place his wrinkled fingers laced perfectly on the cool desktop kenji pulled tighter as takamoras struggles diminished after a few moments all movement ceased mayor david takamora was dead kenji slipped the cord from around the corpses neck revealing a razorthin line of blood where the skin had parted under relentless pressure he cleaned his garrote on takamoras suit coat coiled the weapon and slipped it into the pocket of his baggy black pants im relieved that his bowels didnt void ohnishi remarked sniffing delicately feed the body to the dogs and return to me kenji returned from his gruesome task after nearly thirty minutes despite a change of clothing ohnishi noted that the stench of death still clung to his assistant as always it is done kenji said what is it ohnishi asked knowing something was bothering this man whom he considered a son dont let takamoras ambition upset you it is not his ambition that upset me it is yours dont start that again kenji ohnishi warned but his assistant continued i have followed your orders concerning this operation but i do not agree with them what you planned with takamora was only a sideshow for our true aims yet you treat it with your full attention our priority lies elsewhere takamoras betrayal should be a sign to stop this foolish coup which was meant as a contingency plan in the first place it cannot succeed you must realize that and it puts into jeopardy what we are really working for has our russian friend so intimidated you kenji that you no longer trust in me no ohnishisan kenji replied but we must first concentrate on our obligations to him let me tell you something about our russian ally he will cross us just as quickly as we do him we are merely tools to him our first loyalty must be with the people of hawaii not some white taskmaster bent on our control but we made promises they mean nothing now takamoras ambition has changed everything when i first wrote that letter declaring our independence i knew that it would be sent whether kerikov ordered it or not what we are doing must proceed takamoras betrayal has merely pushed up our deadline im certain that the president is planning some sort of reprisal that is why we must strike now the coup can be successful without takamora we can control his people kenji was silent for a moment his dark eyes downcast and the arms you spoke of i dealt directly with an old friend for those an egyptian named suleiman elaziz suleiman and the mercenary army suleiman is also arranging for them hard currency is a powerful tool in such matters the mercenaries will augment takamoras national guard troops or replace them if they refuse to follow me i did not realize kenji said dejectedly you are like my son but even a father must do things without his sons awareness it changes nothing between us kenji do not be hurt i am not good ohnishi said with a thin smile i wish to celebrate tonight are you in the mood yes of course kenji answered the rhetorical question ohnishi wheeled out from behind the desk and toward his bedroom on the top floor of the glass mansion once there kenji helped him undress and reclothe himself for bed kenji easily lifted his frail form into the wide fourposter propping several pillows behind his back ohnishi laid a withered hand on kenjis cheek and thanked him with a smile his eyes shining as if in fever you are like a son to me you must know that i do kenji replied stroking the old hand gently please allow me a few minutes to prepare as kenji strode from the room ohnishi turned to a control panel near his bed and pressed several buttons in quick succession the electrochromic panels in the glass ceiling of his bedroom darkened blocking out the rich tropical moonlight throughout the house the walls and roof also darkened enclosing the mansion in a blackened cocoon on the far wall past the foot of the bed heavy velvet drapes parted revealing a twoway glass wall and a small bedroom beyond a nude woman lay supine on the bedspread her small breasts peaked with long erect nipples because of his age takahiro ohnishi could no longer enjoy intercourse but his sexual drive had diminished little over the years rather than give in to his bodys inability to respond he had devised a method of voyeurism that partly slaked his still healthy urges he was incapable of erections let alone emission but he could still enjoy the act in his own way he patiently waited for kenji to make his entrance enjoying the lithe body of the sleeping girl when kenji finally entered the room his muscled body was bare and his arousal was plainly evident he crossed to the sleeping woman girl really since she was not yet fifteen and woke her by rubbing his erection against her parted lips she had been well schooled in her responses according to the script that ohnishi had provided pretending to be still asleep she took kenji into her mouth and began a gentle fellatio ohnishi pressed a button on the console and the sensitive microphones in the other room broadcast the subtle noises of the girls lips and mouth she moved a hand up from her side and began massaging one of her nipples softly quickly picking up the rhythm as if coming awake ohnishi leaned forward in his bed as the japanese girls eyes fluttered open and she began sucking in earnest he could feel a slight tightening near his prostate muscles and smiled kenji reached down and toyed roughly with her other breast and the speakers in ohnishis bedroom sounded with her moans of building passion ohnishi resisted the temptation to touch himself knowing he would be disappointed at his bodys lack of response kenji spread the girls legs revealing her still hairless mons slipping one thick finger into her body he thrust through her virginity so that blood slicked his hand and her inner thighs the girl winced but did not cry out he crawled onto the bed and positioned her so ohnishi would have the best possible view before he entered her he mounted her roughly thrusting sharply into her still undeveloped pelvis despite the pain she must have felt the girl writhed and moaned clenching kenjis torso with her coltish legs and lifting her firm buttocks from the bed arching her back higher and higher ohnishi could not resist the temptation his hand snaked under his blankets to find himself semierect he grasped it and began pumping in time with kenji his erection lasted only a few moments and there was no emission but it was more than hed had in years as soon as he lost it he lost all interest in the performance still being played out behind the glass he pressed the button to close the curtains and lay back on his bed the sounds of kenjis lovemaking still filled the room he made a mental note as he settled into sleep to use this girl again she had been in the room for only twentyfour hours but already jill felt as if shed been imprisoned for a year she had gone through the classic steps taken by nearly every person who is locked up against their will first she had raged at her captors screaming and pounding against the solid steel door that kept her from freedom when she had exhausted herself she spent the next several hours going over her cell in minute detail exploring the cement block walls the ceiling that was too far over her head to reach the empty pegboard rack with the outlines of tools still painted on its brown glossy surface the twentysquarefoot room smelled of fertilizer old gasoline and oil jill assumed it had once been a gardeners supply shed after shed paced her cell for another hour jill had finally settled on the concrete floor next to the dripping spigot shed watched dully as the tiny drops pooled then snaked to the rusted drain in the middle of the room eventually she slept her body overriding her minds racing questions when she woke a tray of food rested next to the door there were a couple of oranges half a loaf of crusty french bread and a quarter stick of butter along with a waxed paper cup of cool coffee jill noticed immediately that nothing on the tray could provide her with a weapon no glass or tin cans no utensils that could be sharpened by scraping them against the floor the waste bucket in the far corner of the room had been removed during the night and replaced with a fresh one much to her relief now jill sat quietly stoically like a twentyyear veteran of prison taking the time as it came with neither expectations nor hope for a while shed tried to understand why someone had kidnapped her but she realized that knowing the truth wouldnt do her any good she suspected that takahiro ohnishi was behind her abduction but the knowledge was worthless to her in her present circumstances her only interests were in survival since ohnishi had gone through the trouble of snatching her from her home he must not want to kill her he wanted something from her something that only she could give it had to be her credibility as a reporter if she was correct about ohnishi and mayor takamoras attempt to break hawaii away from the rest of the union then they would need the legitimacy that only the media could give the soothing voice and face on the television assuring the people that everything was all right and under control it would be simple to coerce her into giving false reports and no one whod placed their trust in her as a reporter would ever know that they were being deceived it was the same question of ethics and integrity that shed faced before storming out of the studio but this time the stakes were much higher yesterday it had been a question about her job her career today it was her life at risk jill had thought about all of this throughout the long morning but by late afternoon and into the evening her mind dulled and lost focus she had settled into a torpor she was just thinking about falling back asleep her back was already pressed against the wall her head held only limply by her slender neck the door opened without warning jill jerked out of her lethargy edging along the wall to gain distance between herself and the dark figure that entered her cell she noted idly that night had fallen once again though she didnt know the time since shed been stripped of her watch and shoes when shed been left in the cell i did not mean to startle you miss tzu my apologies the mans voice was flat and lifeless echoing inside him like a distant whisper i know you dont i jill had gotten to her feet we have not formally met but we have spoken on the phone several times i am kenji i knew ohnishi was behind this there was little triumph in her voice kenji slid further into the room his feet gliding on the floor with the ease of quicksilver there was a dangerous elegance about him it was the charm of the serpent slow seductive evil he eased himself to the floor hunching down in the very place where jill had been a moment earlier you are a very perceptive woman and an excellent reporter i watched your latest piece and i must say you made a bold and accurate assessment of my employer and his involvement with mayor takamora you are correct in assuming that they both want hawaii to be an independent nation albeit one with strong ties to japan however you are wrong in guessing that ohnishi is behind your abduction you kenji nodded why you are intelligent enough to know why you were kidnapped you want me to report some sort of propaganda jill said accusingly correct in fact the propaganda as you call it will not be that far from the truth you can even air that piece you just finished jill was startled and confused why would you want that it fully exposes your little plot not my plot miss tzu ohnishis plot i dont understand despite herself jill couldnt help slipping back into her comfortable role as a reporter digging for facts kenji gazed off into the middle distance for a moment as if he could see the words he was thinking watch them ricochet around like billiard balls after a strong break i have worked for takahiro ohnishi almost my entire life i owe him everything he is my master and i am his slave i have killed for him and i have raped little girls for him in fact i did both again tonight there is nothing i would not do if he asked but there is something about me that he does not know something that i myself didnt acknowledge for many years he paused for a moment then chuckled quietly given his concept of honor i actually believe he would understand my betrayal my parents met only twice in their lives the first time was when my father raped my mother when he was stationed in korea during the second world war she was a comfort girl an unwilling prostitute like so many other young women who had the misfortune of being poor and attractive during the japanese occupation her own father had sold her into prostitution so the family could survive the second time my parents met was six years later when my father returned to korea to buy me from her an injury during the war had left him impotent so i was to be his legacy his only chance at immortality until his death he worked for ohnishisan i inherited his position for most of my life i saw myself as pure japanese i hid my korean side in shame but something has happened in the last few months something that has given me reason to feel proud of my korean heritage surely you understand this you are half japanese and half chinese i am an american jill stated firmly kenji turned to her his face both handsome and cruel let us hope that you can see beyond that or our relationship and your life will end very quickly very soon it will become necessary for ohnishis coup attempt to fail mayor takamora is dead and soon ohnishi will follow him when this happens we will need you to use your influence to calm the people and put an end to the violence im a reporter i report the news i dont make it even as jill spoke she remembered the words of her former colleague kenji said a journalist can sway more opinion and change more policies than every politician alive today you have a power that most people dont even recognize they have given to you when the time comes a few days from now a week at most you will divulge everything you know about ohnishi and takamora since they will be dead whatever you say will not be refuted i will provide you with many more details people must be focused on the coup attempt it must remain the top story for several weeks at jills questioning look kenji shook his head the reasons for this do not concern you once this is done i promise that you will never be bothered again and your complicity never revealed and if i refuse jill asked with more bravery than she felt refuse now and i will kill you immediately kenji said matter of factly but i dont need an answer yet i want you to think about it as he left he added i chose you because i believe you will actually have a hard time making your decision do not disappoint me arlington virginia tinys bar was of course named after its owner on his first visit to the pub four blocks from his house mercer had expected to see a huge man behind the bar yet tiny paul gordon was tiny no more than four foot eight about ninety pounds with his pockets full of bricks the bar was small only eight stools and six fourperson booths the linoleum floor looked as though it hadnt been swept in years the walls were decorated with horse racing pictures and trophies from saratoga belmont park and yonkers raceway just a few of the tracks where paul had raced as a professional jockey he had never reached the status of willy shoemaker but he was a consistent rider with proven ability but he gambled and went on a particularly long losing streak to pay back the debt his loan shark ordered him to throw a certain race explaining it once to mercer tiny had said that the horse was too much of a true winner to allow any other to beat her he didnt have the heart to rein her back and come in second that night he was treated to a sumptuous victory banquet by the horses owner the next morning the loan sharks enforcers broke both of tinys kneecaps with a steel wrecking bar during the following months of painful rehabilitation tiny cursed the stupid nag for being so swift he finally forgave dandy maid only after he opened a bar in his native washington when mercer entered the bar tiny waved one small arm and immediately poured a vodka gimlet easy on the roses lime thanks i need this mercer took his drink to the red leatherette booth occupied by tish and harry white apart from two workers from the industrial laundry around the block the bar was empty sorry i had to take tish out of your house mercer but you ran out of jack daniels i have a fresh bottle under the back bar had mercer you had a fresh bottle under the back bar besides who the hell would look for her in this hole in the wall i agree no harm done mercer turned to tish how are you doing im fine she giggled slightly drunk but i must say im not used to drinking in the afternoon stick with harry and me well show you the ropes mercer smiled warmly perhaps a little buzz would be good for her brace her for what he was going to ask her to do what did you find in your office more clues i think theres one more thing i want to check tonight and then ill turn us both over to the authorities what do you mean turn us over tish you were under the protection of the fbi when i nabbed you and im sure they want you back also i have to answer for the corpses i left in the gutters downtown oh hey harry i see two suits coming in tiny said peering out the filthy front window mercer turned to harry one eyebrow cocked in question tish told me the story about yesterday so i took the precaution of having tiny keep an eye out good thinking mercer held out his hand to tish come on he led her out of the barroom and into the small kitchen in the back they paused in front of a pane of glass set into the tiled wall and tish realized that the mirror behind the bar was a twoway mirror she looked over tinys shoulder as two beefy men strode through the front door and flashed badges fbi not local cops was mercers guess philip mercer tiny responded to their question yeah i know him i havent seen him in a week or more he travels a lot tinys thin voice raised a notch if i had seen him he wouldnt owe me eighty bucks in old bar tabs tiny thrust a wad of chits under one agents face mercer winced hoping the agent didnt look too closely those tabs all belonged to harry harry stood up and staggered one step steadying himself on the back of the booth mercer wondered if his friend was acting i seen mercer harry nearly shouted spit spraying from his lips acting for sure where one of the agents asked eagerly it was he was a cook for my battalion couldnt cook worth a damn gave us all food poisoning on tarawa or maybe it was iwo jima harry downed a heavy slug of bourbon if it was on iwo that must have been poor frank merker bought it on okinawa no its philip mercer were looking for dont recall any philbert mercy harry said slowly his eyes glazed over and he slumped into his seat i once knew a stripper named phyllis mmmm his head hit the table with the sound of a fallen coconut snores following a moment later the two agents left after warning tiny to call if philip mercer showed up tiny and harry played their roles for a few minutes more until they were satisfied that the fbi men had moved on as mercer led tish out of the kitchen he noted that he had not let go of her hand during the whole episode the simple touch was comforting harry you should get an oscar for that harry sat up and smiled brightly i did once know a stripper named phyllis phyllis withluv she called herself hot little redhead i met in baltimore what are we going to do now tish interrupted before harry could begin some lurid story we cant go back to my place thats for damned sure mercer said sipping a fresh gimlet if you need to you can stay with me harry volunteered no im allergic to roaches seriously i have other plans were going to new york tish looked at him sharply what tiny call us a cab have him meet us at the safeway the giant grocery store was a couple of blocks away harry thanks for your acting job mercer pulled a hundred dollar bill out of his wallet and slapped it on the bar this should clear your tabs he led tish through the deserted kitchen and out the back door why are we going to new york tish asked as they walked up the street when we read those faxes you must have seen that david saulman suspects that ocean freight and cargo may be a soviet front if thats true and i believe it is because you heard russian then checking out their offices is our next logical step you mean we just waltz in there and make accusations not at all mercer laughed were going to break in tonight tish stopped to look at him his gray eyes were hard as flint and just as sharp youre serious his voice was soft when he responded but his conviction stung the air deadly youse guys sure youse want to do dis the hat asked yeah hat were sure mercer said evenly they were sitting in a latemodel plymouth on lower fifth avenue about ten blocks from the brownstone that was the of ampc headquarters my scags could hit it in no time lift any swag you want and be out before nobody knew nottin youse dont need ta go in atall thats the whole point hat we do need to go in and i want them to know that they were hit for the first time mercer had a vent for the anger that had begun the moment tish entered his life until now he had been simply reacting to the actions of his unknown enemy now he was about to act to take the fight to them as he had promised babes in da woods hat said with a wave of his hand the ember of his cigarette was like a comet in the dark car danny the hat spezhattori was a professional thief his gang of burglars were responsible for making new york citys wealthiest denizens several million dollars poorer over the years the hats fourteenyearold son had once made the mistake of trying to pick mercers pocket in front of the united nations building rather than turn the boy over to the police mercer had forced him to tell him who his father was mercer and the hat met an hour later in a world where more business is done through people owing each other favors mercer had decided that a favor owed to him by a man in the hats position might someday be worthwhile he was right tonight that threeyearold debt would be paid off hat give us an hour to get in position and then send your boys in all right mercer once we hit da doors and dalarms trip dey will station a guard in da building im counting on that youse aint gonna murder no one are you cause if ya do ill have nottin ta do wit it hat we had a deal mercers voice was like ice no questions asked your boys do what theyre told and they will be in their pajamas in no time no risk to any of them i just gots ta say dis mercer what kinda swag can be worth it man youse got money we bote knows it its a fuckin shippin office even their payroll will be shit its none of your business hat just do your job and were square adrenaline sang in mercers veins like the heroin injection of a career junkie i know what im after mercer looked at tish in the backseat her face was very white framed by shimmering black hair her blue eyes were wide but trusting mercer looked into them searching for a sign of weakness but saw none ready yes her voice was a whisper but her eyes were hard they left the car the dome light had been broken so there was only the soft click of the door latches to give away their exit in seconds they had both blended into the shadows of the steamy new york night one hour later a little before one in the morning a camaro its body work covered with more bondo than paint streaked down eleventh street just off fifth avenue a dog barked at the noise of the racing engine on the quiet street the driver was intent on the road a slight drizzle had made it slick but his passenger was enjoying and savoring the moment the shotgun in his hand was cool and heavy the wind blowing through the open window was hot and humid but fresh in his nostrils the adrenaline in his body had heightened all of his senses hat owed mercer a great debt the driving he could trust to a lieutenant in his organization but he would do the shooting himself four doors away from the target the driver pounded his hand against the horn and shouted like a comanche hat thrust the barrel of the remington pumpaction gauge out the window he had loaded the ammo himself and was pleased with the result when he fired the first shot obliterated the window of one ground floor apartment the explosion of the cartridge and the shattering glass one continuous sound the second shot blew in the door of another brownstone the thick oak splintered under the charge of lead another shot and another window vaporized the driver was still yelling and the horn continued to blare but hat heard none of it his eyes were locked onto his next target he fired pumped the gun and pushed his body nearly out the window to fire again the door of the ocean freight and cargo building was much stouter than others on the street but it couldnt withstand the shock of the double blast the door as if mauled by a predatory animal dangled from its top hinge the hardened lead shot had shredded the wood completely immediately an alarm began to shriek within the brownstone piercing the night even above the din of the camaros horn hat shot out one more window before lowering his weapon the driver released the horn and the car raced out of the area anonymous after only a couple of blocks two police cars reached the scene within six minutes the officers made a cursory search of the area and began taking statements from panicstricken residents already the cops had figured that the shooting was just a joy ride by a couple of kids random violence in a city that was renowned for it greg russo knew that nothing that happened to of ampc was random he arrived as soon as possible after the alarm company had phoned him according to company records he was the vice president in charge of the head office in new york but ocean freight and cargo had no company president the swedish group named as the directors of the corporation was nothing more than a stockholm post office box the only person above russo was ivan kerikov the head of department scientific operations kgb russo spoke to the police officers for several minutes getting the details of the incident but not really listening to their explanations twenty years in the kgb had taught him to take nothing at face value again mr russo one of the cops was saying i dont think you have anything to worry about this is like no breakin ive ever seen its just kids out for a night of terror ill make sure that this area is heavily patrolled tonight there wont be any more disturbances our company pays a great deal in city taxes sergeant i expect that you will provide ample protection russo spoke in a flat accentless english im sorry but i cannot place men here to guard your office if you want the name of a private security firm i can give it to you they could have men here in ten minutes the sergeant moonlighted for them on saturdays when his wife visited her mother in trenton that is all right russo acted mollified im sure that its just my imagination whoever hit this street didnt seem to be targeting our offices you are probably right that it was just kids just to make you feel better mr russo i called in a helicopter it should be here in about a half hour theyll hit the back of your building with a spotlight and make sure nothing is goofy back there you did go back there yourselves didnt you yes sir we did nothing in that courtyard but a couple of winos and a heap of trash well having that helicopter coming is a relief a few minutes later both cop cars left the few people out on the street the type attracted to all police activity slowly made their way back to their apartments the excitement over for the night russo whose real name was gregory brezhnicov waited until the street was deserted before giving a signal to the driver of the van that had arrived only moments after him two men dressed in black leapt from the back of the van they marched toward brezhnicov thick arms held stiffly by their sides chests puffed as if on parade their eyes continuously scanned the street never resting on one object for more than a fraction of a second but seemingly missing nothing no matter how long they remain in the west brezhnicov thought a kgb assassination team never loses the discipline drilled into them during years of training they were some of the best trained men in the world capable of killing with nearly every weapon conceived as well as with their bare hands they stopped in front of brezhnicov grimfaced men with lifeless eyes search the entire building look for anything out of place then take up guard duties also check the courtyard out back there are two derelicts there get them out no one enters the building until after nine in the morning i will be the first here there was no reason for brezhnicov to stay these men were more than capable of handling any situation there was a slight squeak in mercers miniaturized earphone before a voice came through mercer two of the baddest dudes ive ever seen just entered the building seems the bossman is heading back home mercer clicked the button on the transmitter acknowledging the information from hats son called cap standing on a roof across the street get ready he whispered to tish who was lying next to him they should come back here first a minute later the two assassins eased out the back door of the of ampc building pistols held competently their eyes searched the dark courtyard checking the back windows of the buildings opposite penetrating the shadows created by the single street lamp before resting on the two winos lying next to an overflowing dumpster one guard came across the courtyard hugging the shadows mercer watching knew this man was a true professional the other man stayed hidden near the doorway his gun covering his partner mercer tensed the first man approached a wino and without warning jerked the derelict to his feet mercer winced as if physically struck he could only imagine the strength it took to pull a man from the ground and onto his feet and make the action look effortless hats decoy stood limply in the mans grasp babbling incoherently the other wino also part of hats team slowly started to waken as if from a lifelong binge get out of here now the guard hissed shaking hats man in his grasp he kicked at the other wino you too get out of here before i break your fucking necks mercer noted from his vantage in the dumpster that the mans english was thickened by a heavy accent we aint done nothing the wino on the ground said as he rubbed his mouth with a filthstained hand we got rights out now the assassin dropped the first of hats crew and took his pistol from a holster behind his back at the sight of the gun the two winos retreated hastily from the courtyard nearly falling over each other as they ran toward the alley that led to sixth avenue when hats men had gone the guard kicked at the pile of rubbish next to the dumpster until satisfied that there was nothing hidden within he turned his attention to the dumpster inside mercer crouched lower the guard lifted the plastic lid and recoiled in disgust the dumpster reeked of human feces rotted food and decay he let the lid drop gagging slightly mercer groped through the filth until he felt tishs hand then gave it a reassuring squeeze he couldnt feel her skin through the thin rubberized protection suit but he knew that it had to be as sweaty as his he adjusted the oxygen mask over his nose and mouth and took a deep breath the oxygen from the small tank at his side was crisp and cool the suits and oxygen tanks the same type worn by sewer workers had been provided by hat who asked mercer if he could use them to take an art gallery that he knew backed against a chinese restaurant the restaurant produced some particularly pungent rubbish the two guards fooled into believing that the two winos were the only humans in the courtyard cut short their search and reentered the of ampc building ten minutes later mercer opened the lid of the dumpster and climbed out he helped tish to the ground and both peeled off the protection suits they threw the suits into the dumpster and gratefully closed the lid this is one side of new york i never thought id see on a first date tish grinned mercer would have cautioned her about silence but he knew that she needed to speak in order to relieve some of the tension only the finest for you next time well go for a moonlight dip in the east river near an industrial vent i know very romantic this time of year you are a charmer mercer pulled a duffel bag from beneath a pile of garbage and unzipped it he retrieved a pair of nightvision goggles purchased from the hat and scanned the back of the of ampc building it was a typical new york brownstone five stories high with a flat roof speared by chimneys and tv antennas firewalls separated it from its neighbors there were four windows on each floor except for the ground floor which had no opening other than a thick steel door wroughtiron grilles covered the windows on the second and third floors making it impregnable from the ground the upper windows were unguarded but mercer knew that a sophisticated security system protected the whole building when mercer had outlined his plan to hat the professional thiefs opinion was youre fucked if da systems zoned if the brownstones security system lacked individual secure zones then the destroyed front door would have crippled the entire system but if individual zones could be compromised without affecting other areas of the building then mercers attempt to breach the back of the offices would trip further alarms mercer didnt see movement in any of the darkened windows but knew that a watcher would not give himself away so easily he had to take a chance from under a urinesoaked tarpaulin that hat had placed in the courtyard hours before mercer took four lengths of tenfoot pipe each with rungs protruding at regular intervals joined the sections became a crude fortyfoot ladder mercer carried the ladder to the base of the building and set it up with minimal effort resting the top between the building and a rusted drain pipe then he drew his gun a browning hipower a souvenir from iraq the mm pistol could not carry as many rounds as the h ampk he had lost in washington but its stopping power was fearsome the gun and the spare clip were loaded with mercuryfilled hollow point bullets that would break up on contact if a man were hit nearly anywhere on his body the shock alone would kill him he cocked the pistol and thumbed off the safety the silencer attached to the barrel made it slow for a quick draw but he needed both hands for the next few minutes he reholstered the weapon and climbed the ladder on the train ride to new york mercer had explained his plan to tish at first she had balked at his intentions but as he spoke he could see the trust growing in her eyes he outlined the four weeks of cia training he had received prior to his insertion into iraq and that seemed to alleviate most of her fears though his training had focused on weapon tactics he had learned the basics of breaking and entering and felt confident in his abilities at the top of the ladder just level with the fourthfloor window mercer paused and scanned the darkened room he saw nothing from a pocket in his black pants he withdrew a threequarter carat cubic zirconia engagement ring hed bought that afternoon while shopping for clothing for tish the retailer at the jewelry store had scoffed at mercers poor choice but he didnt know that the ring would never be used as a betrothal gift at on the mohs hardness scale the zirconia easily etched the glass mercer traced one of the panes of the window the protesting squeal of the cutting glass was loud in his ears judging that three times around had weakened the glass sufficiently mercer paused for a deep breath he was about to find out if the system was zoned if the alarm sounded neither he nor tish would have enough time to escape the courtyard before the guards rushed out to investigate he took another deep breath his pulse pounding fuck it he said as he gave the weakened pane a slight tap with the heel of his hand the tiny filament wires of the security system parted and the glass fell softly to the carpeted floor of the building an alarm screamed in mercers head but the building itself remained silent he could hear his heart pounding a furious tattoo in the eerie gloom of the courtyard then he realized that the noise wasnt his heart searching the square of visible sky above his head mercer saw the lights of an approaching police helicopter the chopper was no more than ten blocks away and already the powerful halogen spotlight mounted in the nose was piercing the dark streets he tried to open the window but countless coats of paint applied to the frame had glued it solidly shut shit mercer cursed under his breath and hammered at the underside of the open pane the small amount of glass left in the windowframe sliced painfully into his hand after several hard blows the window sprang up slamming into its upper stop mercer didnt worry about noise being heard inside the sound of the police helicopter would easily drown it out he wriggled through the window as the downblast of the choppers rotors whipped up a maelstrom in the small courtyard dust and debris choked the air the sound was deafening tish come on mercer called trying to be heard above the din tish scrambled up the ladder as the searchlight beam blasted into the courtyard probing into the darkest corners seeking its prey mercer grabbed tish by the wrists when she reached the top of the ladder the searchlight was systematically spotlighting every window of the of ampc building and it was only seconds before her form would be in the beam he yanked her into the room she yelped as her breasts scraped over the hard wooden sill mercer lunged up and slammed the window closed just as the searchlight probed into the office he thought for a moment that the cops above had seen his face but quickly the light passed on he could see its beam forming bizarre shadows in the hallway beyond the room from the helicopter the ladder would look like any of the wiring conduits that clung to the building like ivy jesus that hurt tish said massaging her chest id do that for you but youd probably slap me the grin she gave told him that she would be all right mercer pulled a flashlight from his jacket and switched it on a red lens diffused the light but he could see easily enough before beginning the search mercer pulled the browning from its holster he didnt know how long they would be in the offices so he had to eliminate the pair of guards he couldnt chance being discovered unexpectedly mercer had no illusions about taking on two professional assassins in a fair fight but he had no intention of being fair do you have any doubts about what we are going to do mercer asked tish perhaps more for his own benefit if these people have anything to do with the destruction of the ocean seeker then they deserve to be punished the steel in her voice was chilling all right then i want you to wait here until its over ill come back to get you her eyes were fearful in the dim light but there was a determined set to her jaw when he took her hand for an instant the trembling he felt was mild all the lights on the top floor were off but dim light spilled up the stairway mercer handed tish the flashlight and began his search the nightvision goggles over his face giving the building an eerie green glow the rooms on the top floor storerooms mostly were all empty dust coated and neglected mercer padded silently down the stairs on the third floor a single wall sconce illuminated the narrow carpeted hallway the doors which led off the hall were all locked and there was no one in sight mercer licked his fingers and unscrewed the bare bulb plunging the hallway into darkness the old wooden stairs creaked as mercer eased himself down one more flight the entire second floor was one huge room divided into small cubicles each containing a desk chair and computer there were plenty of lights in the large work area so mercer removed the goggles and left them on a desk he was thankful to have his peripheral vision restored he slid down to the floor and scanned the room he saw only the legs of desks and chairs and not those of a guard like a snake he slithered through the room every sense tuned to perfection an instructor at the cia facility had said more often than not you will find your enemy with your nose or ears before you will ever see him when the wisp of tobacco smoke tickled mercers nostrils he silently thanked the instructor the room was so quiet he could even hear the sizzle of tobacco as the guard drew on the cigarette the man was no more than ten feet away on mercers right shielded by a thin cubicle wall mercer glanced at his watch he had left tish more than fifteen minutes ago so he had to hurry panic would begin to overwhelm her soon he decided to be bold he removed his black leather jacket figuring that the black pants and shirt he wore were similar enough to the guards to confuse him for a second he stood and began to whistle cheerfully immediately he heard the unseen guard spring from a chair and begin moving toward him the guard turned a corner directly in front of mercer a machine pistol held at the ready in the millisecond it took him to realize that mercer wasnt his partner mercer brought the hipower to bear the guard died an instant before his own trigger finger could squeeze his body crumpled against a steel desk his arm sweeping a pile of papers to the floor the massive tissue damage caused by the hipower sickened mercer a hole had been punched almost completely through the guards body reclaiming his jacket mercer retraced his steps to the stairway and cautiously made his way to the ground floor the lobby of the building also occupied an entire floor the waiting area was furnished with several tasteful couches a large turkish carpet and an expansive reception desk the walls were painted a calming salmon color and the prints which lined them were all of ships a few dim lights kept the room more in shadow than light a figure leaned against the front doorframe a holster cocked off one hip for a moment mercer wondered if he could kill a man from behind without warning as if alerted by some primal instinct the guard whirled around drawing his pistol and firing in one continuous motion the bullet grazed mercers pantleg as he dove out of the way mercer hit the floor rolling as bullets gouged the marble floor near his head and torso he managed to duck behind the reception counter and when he looked back to see where the guard had gone another round slammed into the wood driving splinters deep into his jaw and right cheek son of a bitch he muttered wiping blood from his face suddenly the lights went out in the lobby mercer rolled silently from behind the counter hugging one of the walls his plan was to crawl to the light switch and flip it back on hopefully using the surprise to target his opponent halfway to the switch he bumped into the guards leg neither man had anticipated the contact so neither had an advantage mercer reared back then sprang forward like an allpro lineman playing in the super bowl his shoulder connecting with the guards knee the joint failed and the guard fell forward but he still had time to whip his pistol at mercers head shearing skin from his already bleeding cheek mercer smashed a fist into the guards thigh paralyzing the leg momentarily and giving himself time to bring up the hipower the guard kicked out with his good leg and sent mercers pistol skittering across the marbled floor mercer twisted away from the guard who was already trying to regain his feet the room was too dark to see where the pistol wound up so mercer ignored it and concentrated on his opponent he leapt to his feet and charged again catching the guard low in the stomach and forcing the breath out of him in a loud whoosh the guard backpedaled as mercer continued to push him but twisted aside just before they hit the sofas mercer flew over one of them and crashed to the floor wrenching his shoulder painfully there was a brief spark of muzzle flash as the guard fired his silenced pistol at mercer but the shot was several feet off target mercer used the flash to locate the other man in the darkness and leapt at him but missed the guard had moved mercer hit the floor and rolled twice coming up hard against another wall it was cat and mouse again neither man could see the other in the gloom and neither could hear the other over his own labored breathing mercer edged forward feeling along the floor and found his pistol the cool steel was a needed reassurance just then the lights snapped back on in full brilliance the nerves and muscles that controlled mercers pupils reacted just the barest fraction of a second faster than the assassins while the other man was squinting through nearly closed eyes disoriented by the glare mercers gaze was sweeping the room tish stood next to the bank of light switches one hand still on the rheostat the other holding the bulky nightvision goggles the guard was twenty feet away peering off to mercers left mercer didnt take the time to properly aim he fired from the hip his first two shots going wide but his next six catching the guard squarely pounding his torso into an unrecognizable mess mercer moved over to tish and took the goggles from her slack hand tish her eyes swiveled to his i told you to wait upstairs please from now on never listen to me again okay he slid his arms around her and her body eased into his embrace he calmly stroked her hair for a moment now were even i saved your life and you just saved mine thank you i waited until you had your gun and he was turned away from you she replied after a moment they went back up to the third floor dousing all the lights again and relying on mercers goggles to get them to the executive offices quickly scanning the names on the doors they found the locked door of the highest ranking employee a vice president mercer smirked at the mans name russo nice touch he commented if they are russian tish replied to have guards like those two theyre something it took mercer five frustrating minutes to pick the lock although he remembered the technique from his cia training theory and practice were two entirely different things one of hats men could have done it in ten seconds the office was paneled in rich oak the carpet was soft under their feet a window behind the broad desk looked out onto eleventh avenue mercer shut the thick drapes and turned on the desk lamp pictures of the of ampc fleet adorned the walls david saulman in miami had been right each ship had a different bunch of flowers painted on the funnels april lilac september laurel december iris and a score of others there was a fish tank against one wall and though it was large it only contained a single fish mercer turned to the four squat filing cabinets and opened a drawer at random he started leafing through the folders within pick a drawer any drawer he said lightly what are we looking for anything that might jog your memory there could be something here that you may remember from when you were rescued a name anything tish pointed to a picture on the wall thats the ship that rescued me i think mercer looked at the picture and recognized the september laurel as she calmly plied some distant sea that may be the ship that reported finding you but i dont think its the ship that pulled you from the water you remembered a black circle and a yellow dot on the funnel not a bunch of flowers besides dave saulman told me that her crew are mostly italians not russians i could have been wrong about hearing russian even if you are its obvious that something is going on here lets just go through the files and see if anything turns up for the next half hour mercer and tish pored through the files without turning up anything conclusive the only odd thing was a loose file tab labeled john dory lying on the bottom of the drawer containing the ownership papers of the of ampc ships there was no file to go along with the tiny scrap of paper because all of ampc vessels were named after a month and a flower mercer guessed that john dory was the name of a captain or ships officer employed by of ampc this has been a complete waste of time hasnt it there was hopelessness in tishs voice i know im right there has to be something here that we havent seen mercer persisted but we have to get out of here did you kill those guards without a reason mercer looked up from the file it was a question he did not want to address was there a chance he was wrong about of ampcs involvement no we didnt and ill tell you why look around this office theres nothing personal anywhere no photos no diplomas nothing this may be a legitimate shipping line to some but to the man who occupies this office shipping is not his career mercer walked to the desk and scanned the address file there isnt one ship brokers number in here not one chandler christ he doesnt even have the private numbers of his captains he could be just a figurehead he is dont you get it most shipping lines are built by individuals and based on personal contacts im willing to bet this greg russo wouldnt know a hawsepipe from a hole in the wall whoever occupies this office has a job to do but it has nothing to do with shipping hold it right there a male voice commanded mercer froze his pulse pounding hats son had said only two men had entered the building and they had already been eliminated whose was the voice behind them step away from the desk and turn around slowly the command was punctuated with the cocking of a revolver an overweight security guard stood in the doorway he was a frightened rentacop with a pale jowled face and a trembling grip on his weapon you got a lot to answer for keep your hands where i can see them move toward the fish tank mercer backed away from the desk tish right beside him she hadnt screamed when the guard entered and seemed in control mercer wished that he felt as calm as she appeared the guard had scared the hell out of him greg russo must have called in additional security after cap had left his post across the street mercer had no way of knowing if more men were scouring the building the guard crossed to the desk his eyes and gun never straying from mercer with his free hand he fumbled for the telephone mercers chance was coming the instant the guard glanced down at the phone mercer launched himself time slowed to a crawl mercers senses were heightened so that he could see the individual hairs on the guards face smell the nervous sweat of the man and hear his labored breathing mercer flew across the room focusing on the hand holding the revolver the rings of fat around the mans wrist the knuckles tightening around the trigger the hammer began to drop and mercers fingers were still inches away from their mark the gun discharged just as mercer grabbed the guards wrist the sound was like a burst of thunder in the small office cordite smoke burned mercers eyes blinding him next to tish the large fish tank exploded water gravel and the fish cascading to the carpet in a frothing wave the recoil lifted the gun high over the guards head so that mercers shoulder barreled into the guards unprotected flank mercer could feel the mans ribs snap as he smashed into them the guard was thrown across the desk the gun spinning from his hand he fell against a wall moaning mercer recovered the revolver aiming it at the fallen guard but did not pull the trigger youre not with those others you dont have to die mercer lowered the revolver and turned to tish are you all right shaken but not stirred weve got to get out of here someone must have heard this gun go off mercer held out his hand and tish came toward him and took it in hers he stared at the dying fish for a moment as it flopped on the soaked carpet and the sight triggered a vague memory benoit charleteaux he mumbled what tish asked as they started cautiously back to the fourth floor and the ladder outside another clue mercers muted voice sounded triumphant potomac maryland richard henna was just getting back into bed after a latenight foray into the kitchen when the bedside phone rang he grabbed the handset before the second ring his wife a twentyfiveyear veteran of middleofthenight calls didnt even stir henna dick its marge margaret doyle was a deputy director of the bureau and dick hennas oldest and best friend she didnt bother apologizing for waking him philip mercer has left the washington area how henna snapped by train the agents we had watching union station never saw him because he boarded the metroliner at new carolton we just found out through his credit card he purchased two oneway tickets for new york from the conductor on the train christ what is it dear fay mumbled in her sleep he covered the mouthpiece with his hand nothing hon then spoke softly but clearly into the phone all right marge call the new york office have them put a few men at penn station in case he tries to return by train fax them the picture of mercer we got from the us geological survey ive already made the calls if they pick him up i want to be notified right away then i want him and tish talbot flown immediately to andrews air force base should we cancel the surveillance on his house no im willing to bet hell get by us again call me back if there are any new developments sorry about this dick not your fault i think weve all underestimated mercer henna hung up the phone and slipped into a bathrobe he knew he would get no more sleep this night he went downstairs made a cup of coffee and sipped it in the darkened kitchen for a few minutes before crossing through the large federalstyle house to his study he turned on his desk lamp groaning as the light flashed into his eyes he dialed the combination of the chubb safe behind his desk and removed a single file the file headed antebellum recorded hennas personal observations about events since the letter from ohnishi came to his attention he read his own handwriting slowly mostly because it was too sloppy to scan the first page was a bare chronology henna now added mercer and talbots trip to new york at the bottom of the list on a clean sheet of paper he began drawing flow charts tying events into each other in minutes he had created an indecipherable series of lines circles and swirls the only thing he knew for certain was that mercer had gone to new york in response to the information he had received from the law offices of david saulman he reread the information that mercer had requested from saulman obtained by the fbi through a dade county judges court order saulmans office had grudgingly turned over a few lists of ships names and some basic information on ocean freight and cargo this time he saw it the ship that rescued tish talbot was owned by of ampc whose offices were in manhattan henna spilled his coffee as he grabbed for the phone ignoring the mess he dialed the new york fbi office federal bureau of investigations a tired voice answered the phone without preamble henna gave his personal recognition code to the night duty officer establishing his identity without question in situations like this the code numbers saved valuable minutes needed when a person high up in the organization wanted to speak with someone out in the field henna had heard a similar system was used by many of the crime syndicates the fbi fought henna asked to speak with special agent frank little im sorry agent little is on the day shift may i be of assistance this is agent scofield who else is there now henna needed to speak with someone he knew personally someone who wouldnt want to use this phone call for some favor in the future im sure sir that i can be of some henna cut the man off just tell me who else is there agent morton is here and so is pete morton had been a rookie agent when henna was station chief in new york six years earlier great let me talk to him a moment later morton pete this is dick henna in washington jesus henna could almost hear the man spring to his feet relax i need a favor yes sure anything mr henna get on the horn to one of your contacts in the nypd i want to know if there was any trouble near eleventh street tonight i dont see how pete just do it all right henna remembered that morton used to ask a million questions about everything call me at this number when youre done henna gave him his home number and then lose the number he hung up he skipped through the file in front of him until he came to philip mercers dossier compiled by the cia in mercer had been born in the belgian congo his father was an american mining engineer employed by mines belgique a firm mining diamonds from the rich katanga province his mother was a belgian fashion model they had met during a photo shoot in leopoldville the capital of the congo philip was their only child both parents had been killed during an insurrection in rwanda in the details of their deaths were sketchy mercer was raised by his paternal grandparents in barre vermont his grandfather worked in a granite quarry and his grandmother was a homemaker he graduated top of his class in high school and cum laude from penn state with a degree in geology he then went to the colorado school of mines in golden again graduating near the top of his class after four additional years of schooling at penn state while doing contract work for various coal mines around western pennsylvania he received his phd in geology his thesis on metamorphic rock dynamics as it pertains to quarry mining was still supplemental reading for graduate students at penn state after completing his doctorate he went to work for the us geological survey but lasted there only two years interviews with coworkers from that time showed that mercer was simply unchallenged by the work the usgs had given him henna noted that mercers case was another example of the governments inability to retain top minds in whatever field he couldnt count the number of agents he had known who left to work for private security firms it wasnt just the pay or the benefits that caused people to leave government work simply drained people of their spirit after the usgs mercer went into business for himself assaying mining properties for investment firms eager to know potential returns before committing huge amounts of money he built a reputation quickly within the industry after just a few years two weeks of his time cost up to fifty thousand dollars plus in some cases bonuses in the form of stock if he believed the property to be extremely valuable the year that the cia did the background check mercers income as reported to the irs was slightly over three quarters of a million dollars the cia had also contacted the us customs service who listed thirty overseas trips since his latest passport was issued the next section of the report detailed his involvement with the cia and the mission to iraq when the plan to infiltrate iraq was first conceived fortyeight candidates were considered for the position of onsite expert on mining practices and geology mercer was the eighth candidate to be interviewed and after his first series of tests all the other interviews were canceled he scored just above genius level on the iq test and did perfectly on all the memory tests one of the testers noted that mercer was able to recall a fortydigit number twentyfour hours after seeing it after agreeing to join the team he was sent to a training facility in rural virginia where he had excelled in marksmanship and the grueling obstacle course but fared just average in communications and what was termed basic trade craft the attached psychological report documented an acute fixation on selfreliance and a deeply rooted fear of abandonment probably due to his being orphaned he was a natural leader but had chosen not to develop those skills the staff psychiatrist summed up his report by stating that mercers motivation for joining the infiltration team was simply his need for continual challenge the doctor feared that this would lead to reckless behavior but recommended mercers approval in midjanuary mercer and eight delta force commandos parachuted into northern iraq near the city of mosul the site was chosen by mercer and a team of satellite analysts as the most likely spot for uranium mining mercer had quickly confirmed that the mining facility there was not even close to production and the uranium ore was too poor a quality to make nuclear weapons they were attacked by the mines security detachment as they were sneaking out through the perimeter fence two commando officers were killed during the opening gun battle and another fell shortly afterward as they retreated through the mountainous desert the extraction helicopter they had depended on couldnt pick them up because of the heavy weapons fire from iraqi scout cars mercer led the remaining troops through a scree field that the pursuing scout cars couldnt pass and managed to lead them to mosul there they stole a produce truck and made a mad dash to the turkish border the delta commandos all agreed that mercer was the person most responsible for their success and that without him none of them would have survived two days after their debriefing president bush ordered the beginning of operation desert storm henna stood and began pacing his chin buried against his chest he knew from the dossier that mercer was acquainted with tish talbots late father which would explain why he had gone to the hospital but his actions since then defied explanation how had he known the other man in her room was not part of the hospital staff or another fbi agent why hadnt he contacted the fbi as soon as he had gotten talbot safely away why had he pursued the matter on his own and if he had gone to new york to investigate the shipping company what had he found christ there are too damn many questions and not enough answers henna said aloud the phone rang shrilly and henna snatched at it henna mr henna pete morton in new york sir yeah pete whatve you got how did you know there was something up on eleventh street skip the questions and tell me what happened hennas heart was racing and his palms were sweaty at this morning a gunman drove down eleventh street and fired a shotgun five times blowing out several windows and doors he then raced away there are no suspects or clues was one of the buildings hit owned by a company called ocean freight and cargo yes how did you never mind that get some men down there right away take into custody anyone they see call me back as soon as youre done ill take care of it myself sir henna set the phone down and slumped back into his chair what the hell is mercer playing at now bangkok thailand the scotch in ivan kerikovs glass was quickly diluting as the ice melted under the onslaught of the asian heat the tumbler was jeweled with condensation and the small napkin on the royal river hotels table was sodden kerikov took another heavy swallow of the questionable scotch mindful of water dripping from the napkin that clung to the glass he had been in bangkok now for two uneventful days basking in the delights of his hotel the venerable oriental where he had taken a suite in the original authors wing and indulging in carnal vices on pat pong road bangkoks famous red light district he had also spent some of that time contemplating his hurried escape from moscow wondering if he had been too rash in executing the kgb auditor in his office hindsight said that he should have suffered through the little mans investigation and left afterward but killing him had given kerikov the sense of completion that he needed before he fled his homeland his leaving russia was never in doubt but the abruptness of his departure left a few loose ends that he now could never tie up so be it he mused lightly and ordered another scotch from the attractive waitress he had reason to be in a good spirit and regrets for the past would not be allowed to dampen it last night he had been contacted by dr borodin from aboard the august rose borodin reported that he had a definite location for the volcanos summit and it was nearly a thousand meters beyond hawaiis twohundredmile limit the news was like a yoke removed from kerikovs shoulders when dr borodin had first proposed vulcans forge forty years before his selection for the most optimal geologic site did not take into account any political considerations the area he chose had the right combination of natural volcanism ocean depth temperature salinity and currents as well as some native minerals that were necessary unfortunately this spot was forty miles from oahu because this site was obviously unusable borodin had cut his margin as fine as possible detonating his device as far from the hawaiian islands as he could without jeopardizing the results of his work at the time hawaiis entrance into the united states was a forgone conclusion giving her the territorial rights afforded a sovereign nation rather than those of a colony or protectorate yet borodins calculations demanded that the explosion had to take place within that twohundredmile demarcation if vulcans forge was to succeed boris ulinev trusted borodins assertion that oceanic currents would skew the volcano enough so that it would surface outside the limit yet the wily head of scientific operations hedged his bet by initiating an audacious contingency plan he selected a young japaneseborn american an adolescent with a tortured background but an incredible mind he surreptitiously groomed him guiding him from afar through university and into business using the massive support of the kgb ulinev shepherded wealth and power to this young man for many years all the while introducing him to people who shaped his personality and goals this shaping was done subtly over many years and continued even after ulinev had died and left department in the care of others the end result was the fanatical racist and megalomaniac takahiro ohnishi he had become a global industrialist with a farflung empire and had unwittingly been programmed his entire life to attempt to break hawaii away from the united states if scientific operations ever decided that was necessary for the success of vulcans forge kerikov when he took over department had read about ulinevs original contingency plan and inwardly cringed he knew from experience that humans were easy to program especially considering the extraordinary depth given in ohnishis case yet experience also showed that controlling those who had been so programmed was difficult at best they often became active without authority or did not activate at all when called upon the idea of a manchurian candidate worked well for fiction writers but not for true spy masters kerikov was relieved now that this phase of ulinevs original plan was no longer needed borodins call confirmed that a revolution in hawaii was no longer necessary to ensure they would be able to control the volcano and although the kgb had spent millions of dollars creating ohnishi kerikov really didnt care about the writeoff the volcano was outside american influence and within his personal grasp eight months earlier borodin on a regular passby of the burgeoning volcano aboard the august rose had reported that it would most likely crest outside the twohundredmile line yet he would not have conclusive proof for some time kerikov seized that moment to enact a contingency plan of his own with one million dollars in cash and a promissory note of an additional five million dollars kerikov bought someone high up in ohnishis personal staff to report on all of the eccentric billionaires activities if the coup in hawaii was unnecessary kerikov wanted to ensure that ohnishi would not continue his end of the plan the mole was his insurance that ohnishi could be controlled permanently if necessary at the same time kerikov set into motion a plot to steal the wealth of the volcano for himself had the soviet union remained the world power that it had been when dr borodin launched vulcans forge kerikov would have been proud to turn over the marvelous achievement to his superiors but the decades since then had seen russia degenerate into a third world country a nation whose very survival depended on loan guarantees from america and western europe after quietly capitulating the cold war in russia had suffered a cruel peace she was turning into a market for goods and a source of raw materials much the way europe had once treated the backwaters of asia and africa in just a few years the soviet union had toppled from superpower to colony and the decline was far from over watching dispassionately as his nation rotted kerikov decided that if he could not save the rodina then perhaps the motherland could save him since russia no longer possessed either the political clout or the financial resources to develop vulcans forge kerikov opened negotiations with a group of men who could the nine members of hydra consolidated a koreanbased holding company representing billions of dollars of real estate manufacturing and electronics recognized the value of vulcans forge when kerikov approached them they did not balk at the onehundredmilliondollar price tag that he attached to the volcano and its unusual riches for the strategic element being produced in the charnel guts of the volcano would make its possessor the most powerful force on earth in both the literal and figurative sense just a week after initiating talks with the koreans kerikov learned of the proposed meetings in thailand to discuss the spratly island situation sensing that the bangkok accords could aid his plan kerikov pulled in some favors and employed a little bribery and blackmail to get gennady perchenko assigned as the russian delegate to the meeting he also managed to get the taiwanese ambassador to act on his behalf in return for some information that would ensure minister tren the prime ministers office whenever he wanted it even before the accord meetings began kerikov knew how he would use his two agentsinplace to solidify possession of the volcano when it crested through the pacific swells when his second scotch arrived he glanced at the piaget watch on his wrist perchenko would arrive at any moment kerikov looked at the maitre d it was his first night here at the royal river yet he seemed comfortable in his job the regular man hadnt arrived for work this afternoon his body was secured to several cement blocks in a canal about ten miles from the city an hour after receiving the confirmation from borodin kerikov had killed the maitre d as the ultimate insurance that he would never discuss his dealings with the russian delegate to the bangkok accords after dispatching the young thai kerikov phoned his sociopathic assistant evad lurbud in cairo and ordered him to commence his housekeeping this would mean killing an egyptian arms merchant and then flying to hawaii to take care of takahiro ohnishi and kerikovs mole kerikov might have left behind some loose ends when he fled russia but hed be damned if there would be any from the final gambit of vulcans forge in just a few days hed be spending the one hundred million dollars from the koreans and there wouldnt be a soul left alive who would know how he got it kerikov spotted gennady perchenko leaping from a riva river taxi onto the quay of the royal river in a moment the new maitre d would guide the diplomat to his final briefing washington dc the big greyhound overtheroad bus hissed to a stop just outside the citys main terminal near the convention center mercer was stiff legged as he trailed tish down the three steps of the bus to the already sizzling pavement his whole body ached not only from his ordeal in new york but from the torturous seats that all transportation manufacturers seem intent on using he tried without success to knuckle the kinks from his lower back as he and tish ambled into the bus terminal announcements echoed off the tiled walls mixing with the din of the passengers arriving and departing the terminal stank of the homeless who spent their nights on the steel benches i still dont understand why we had to take the bus back to washington tish complained swiveling her head to stretch her tense neck muscles they had cabbed to newark and caught the bus there mercer grimaced as he stroked the new beard that stubbled his face because by now the fbi will have the train stations staked out and i needed time to think before we turn ourselves in he strode to a bank of telephones and dialed an international operator after i make this call well give up mercer waited a full five minutes for the connection to be made then spoke in french tish not understanding the language walked over to a bench and sat down mercer joined her after a few minutes all set he announced what was that all about i had to call an old fishing buddy in the ruhr valley tish had learned not to be surprised by any of mercers actions did he tell you what you needed he sure did there was a sense of triumph in mercers voice that cut through the exhaustion etched around his eyes they grabbed a taxi in front of the terminal and mercer gave the driver his home address why dont we go straight to the fbi tish said and leaned her head against his shoulder as she had for much of the sixhour ride from new york if we showed up at the hoover building it would take them hours to verify who we are and direct us to the person who was in charge of your protection at the hospital this way the agents at my house will take us straight to him clever the cab ride took nearly fortyfive minutes in the snarled downtown traffic the driver refused to use the cars airconditioning so great blasts of hot air blew into the taxi plastering tishs hair around her face since you fell asleep as soon as we got on the bus this morning i just want to thank you for the way you handled yourself in new york you came through like a true professional tish smiled at him her beautiful lips framing dazzling teeth jack talbot didnt raise a daughter who couldnt take care of herself mercer laughed no doubt about that mercer whats going to happen to us once the fbi picks us up i dont know tish i think the information weve gotten in the past couple of days points to the people responsible for the ocean seeker disaster once we deliver it to the fbi we should be out of it what if they dont believe us she persisted we just have to make sure they do the story i have to tell is too chilling to be ignored the cab stopped in front of mercers house he paid the driver unlocked the door of the house and keyed off the security system he almost had the door closed when a voice from behind interrupted him dr mercer please step away from the door and place your hands over your head this is the fbi mercer backed away and turned to the fbi agent his smile ironic the last person who told me that was left tied up in an office in new york and he already had his gun drawn the agent not catching mercers graveyard humor sensed a threat and pulled his service weapon i said place your hands on your head you too dr talbot the agent stepped forward he was mercers age but had a baby face under a mop of light blond hair mercer noted that his gun hand was very steady another agent joined the first ive been instructed to take you downtown youre not under arrest so please go easily i dont think so youd better make this official mercer replied with a slow smile he turned around and lowered his hands behind his back as if by programming the second agent came forward and slapped on a pair of handcuffs think of how good youll look to your friends when they see you captured us in irons when they were in the agents brown sedan heading back into the city tish whispered why in the hell did you do that i want to see the reaction of whoever has summoned us it might tell me a lot the car ducked into the city via route and exited just north of the lincoln memorial then streaked down constitution avenue parallel to the mall where countless tourists sweated in the washington heat while viewing the monuments they turned left onto th street as mercer expected he was certain they were headed for the j edgar hoover building fbi headquarters but just before reaching the treasury building the car slowed and made another left onto east executive avenue a moment later they entered the white house grounds through a back gate mercer and tish glanced at each other speechless the car pulled into an underground garage just behind the white house the agents escorted tish and mercer to an already waiting elevator two more agents joined them there mercer noticed just as the elevator doors closed that the garage didnt smell of oil and was absolutely spotless he suspected that the garage was washed every day to prevent a stray spark from lighting any spilled oil the elevator took them up to the ground floor and disgorged them into a bluecarpeted hallway young staffers rushed past reports and faxes clutched in their fists as if their jobs meant the safety of the free world which in reality they did only a few stopped to notice the cuffs that secured mercers hands behind his back he wondered if they thought he was a fellow staffer sacrificed to some as yet unknown scandal i wont give any of you away he called over the din of the countless ringing phones the agents pushed him roughly down the hall past numerous cramped offices until they reached a cluttered desk just outside a wide door the presidential seal hung from the wall behind the desk miss craig this is philip mercer and tish talbot is everything set inside yes it is the plump woman said she looked up at tish and smiled sweetly you poor dear ive heard about what youve been through come with me im sure youd love to freshen up a bit tish looked at mercer stricken its all right im sure youll be fine tish allowed the presidents personal secretary to lead her away mercer turned to the agents flanking him well gentlemen lets get on with it they opened the door and mercer stepped into the oval office mercers first impression was that the office was much smaller than he had imagined he envisioned the president governing the country from a much larger room he stepped over the seal embroidered into the pale blue carpet and studied the people in the room he recognized most of them seated were admiral c thomas morrison richard henna of the fbi and catherine smith the presidents chief of staff mercer guessed that the bald man standing against the far wall was the director of the cia the president sat behind his desk his large hands resting on the leather top ms smith wore a conservative suit white blouse and a muted bow at her throat and the assembled men were all wearing the customary washington uniform conservative suit white shirt and muted tie only admiral morrison in his summer whites and mercer still in the black clothing from the breakin were dressed any differently mr president i wish to congratulate you the president looked at mercer quizzically i saw in the paper a couple days ago that your wifes dog just had puppies we are not here to discuss dogs dr mercer paul barnes the head of the cia said sharply clipping each word were not going to discuss anything until i know why tish talbot was brought to washington and why she was placed under fbi protection she is no longer a concern of yours barnes snapped im beginning not to like you friend there was no malice in mercers voice but his gray eyes hardened dr mercer we will answer all of your questions in turn rest assured that dr talbots ordeal as you put it is at an end she is upstairs right now with my wife and the puppies you just mentioned she will be looked after the president cut through the mounting tension christ henna exclaimed as he realized that mercer was cuffed get those damn things off him and leave us the two agents removed the handcuffs and skulked from the room mercer helped himself to a cup of coffee from the silver urn next to the fireplace and took the last available chair so you wanted to see me mercer said innocently taking a sip of coffee dr mercer you have a lot of explaining to do henna replied but first we all want to express our gratitude to you for saving dr talbots life in the hospital how did you know that the man in the room was an impostor lucky guess mercer demurred we both used the same cover to get into her room i figured your watchdogs might let in one urologist but not two i also noticed that his shoes were too uncomfortable looking for a doctor making his rounds it was a calculated risk but at worst i was risking an assault charge from an irate citizen it turned out i was right who was he anyway josef skadra a czechborn agent who used to freelance for the kgb do you have any idea who he was working for when he went after dr talbot were not certain henna admitted remember you didnt leave him or any of his team in the position to answer questions dr mercer you are here to answer questions not ask them barnes spoke again paul take it easy the president cautioned dr mercer is a guest here not a prisoner before you start asking questions why dont i fill you in on what i know mercer said and the president nodded on the night of may an ore carrier named grandam phoenix sank about two hundred miles north of hawaii in the middle of the musicians seamounts a fivehundredmilelong string of undersea volcanoes whether she was destroyed by the nuclear blast that occurred that night or she was already sinking i dont know the bomb was under about seven thousand feet of water when it went off mercers audience was too dumbstruck to speak so he continued i pinpointed the epicenter by triangulating time delays and richter scale differences from six different stations in asia and the united states the sharp spike recorded on the seismograph tapes that night is identical to ones measured after underground nuclear tests there is no natural occurrence that even remotely resembles it since that time seven large vessels have sunk in a fiftymile radius of the explosions epicenter including most recently the noaa research ship ocean seeker what are you talking about henna finally found his voice let me finish and youll see that many ships sinking in such a relatively small area is strange enough but there is a connection between them that defies random mishap of the seven ships that went down only three had survivors a tanker in a container ship in and the ocean seeker the four other vessels the ones where no one survived all had something in common very accurate bottomscanning sonar the trawlers lost since use them for finding shoals of fish a cable layer sunk in would use it for locating a smooth path on the ocean floor and a chilean survey ship was mapping the pacific basin in when it vanished without a trace is that from the list of vessels you received from that law office in miami asked henna yes i stared at it for quite a while until i saw a connection between all the ships that sank with no survivors once i saw that they all had bottomscanning technology i pieced together what it was they may have seen i believe they were all sunk so they wouldnt report a new volcano building its way to the surface is this volcano connected to the nuclear detonation the president asked im certain that it is i believe that the explosion was the trigger that started the volcanos eruption the area around hawaii including the musicians seamounts contains an intraplate hot spot put simply a hot spot is a localized area of intense heat deep in the earths mantle that punches holes through the crust as a tectonic plate slides across it forming chains of volcanoes that are progressively older the further from the spot they are by detonating a nuclear bomb over a hot spot weakening the crust further magma from the lithosphere was given a new artificial outlet why would somebody want to do that i have no idea but its proved to be worth killing for lets get back to more recent history henna prompted the ocean seeker was sent out on an unscheduled survey to find the cause of some whale deaths the whales had been found beached on hawaii about a month ago with their digestive tracts filled with lava particles tish talbot was an invited guest on the expedition twentyfour hours after leaving port the ship exploded and tish was thrown into the sea after her rescue she was transferred to george washington university hospital for observation i received a telegram the day after she was admitted to the hospital saying she was in grave danger who sent the telegram it was signed by her father but i later found out her father has been dead for a year so i dont know who sent it its obvious that someone wanted me to get involved why mr president that is the milliondollar question this is a waste of time paul barnes snorted hes got more questions than answers youre right i do have a lot of questions why was tish talbot purposely saved when the ocean seeker was destroyed the seeker has the most sophisticated sonar systems found outside the us navy so tish being found alive breaks a wellestablished pattern why was she held prisoner for a few days before her official rescue by a freighter called the september laurel and then why did someone try to have her killed are these all things she told you no ive figured it out myself when the ship exploded she was thrown clear by the blast and suddenly there was an inflatable raft right next to her the raft could have been dislodged by the explosion admiral morrison pointed out impossible the raft would have been shredded not inflated she also told me she swam to it but admitted that she could barely hear anything how could she have swam in the turbulent water around a sinking vessel if the blast had stunned her so badly im certain there was someone aboard who was forewarned about the ships destruction and whose job it was to save her life the men in the room all exchanged glances mercer felt that they knew something he didnt to get back to your question about why dr talbot was brought to washington and placed under the protection of the fbi you must know that we received a warning a couple of days before the ocean seeker disaster the president spoke slowly we felt putting her at george washington university hospital would raise less suspicion than bringing her to walter reed you see she is the only living witness to a terrorist act directed at the heart of america he pulled out the letter sent from takahiro ohnishi and read it aloud to the president of the united states after world war ii europe faced with economic necessity released her longheld colonies and let them struggle through the arduous process of independence some made the transition smoothly while others continue to struggle internally and with their former masters it is a painful chapter of human history that is still being inked in blood it is time now that the united states too face economic realities the colonies that america maintains must be released and that is how we on hawaii feel weve been treated by you the fourtrilliondollar debt that you carry is a burden too heavy to maintain the stopgap efforts that you and your predecessors have attempted have done little but stave off the complete collapse of your system while us tax dollars flood the coffers of foreign nations and banks and bloat already engorged government contractors the american people slide deeper into an unquestioning torpor spawned by inane rhetoric and slick presentations mr president this cannot be allowed to continue for hawaii the people of hawaii are by origin not white europeans nor should they be governed by them we are a separate people with different beliefs and a different set of values and it is wrong that we too should be bankrupted by the dying system to which you cling you must realize by now that mankind does not thrive with cultural diversity we are a tribalist species one most comfortable within welldefined groups and it is wrong to deny this the idea of a melting pot is as outdated as the white mans burden i fear that soon the united states will join that growing list of nations torn by factional fighting and i do not wish to see this come to pass for my people hawaiis transition to independence must be made peaceably but it must be made already plans are being implemented to draw us away from the united states and establish ourselves as a sovereign nation do not attempt to resist this action i can promise peace but only if you do not interfere as a demonstration of the seriousness of my concern and conviction i have at my disposal the means to destroy any american government vessel within two hundred miles of these islands if i detect any such vessel in the coming weeks of transition i will not hesitate to sink it please do not test my resolve or the resolve of the people of these islands we are united in purpose and our goal will ultimately benefit all it is signed takahiro ohnishi the president placed the pages facedown on his desk and looked up at mercer mercer remained expressionless while his mind churned through what the president had just read he knew the eccentric billionaires views in fact hed read one of ohnishis books about the need for racial integrity but hed never believed the industrialist capable of this race relations between hawaiis japanese majority and the islands white population were strained but what the president had just read was tantamount to a declaration of independence he said as much as it turns out there were no naval vessels scheduled to arrive or depart pearl harbor at the time that we received this letter but noaa did have the ocean seeker heading northward dick brought the letter to my attention only after shed been lost before that he had assumed it was just a crank since then ive suspended all activity within the twohundredmile limit ohnishi outlined in this letter dr mercer you are the first person outside this group to know the situation we believed that this was a recent plot by ohnishi but the information youve brought us indicates that it goes back forty years mr president im not even finished yet this goes even further than some crackpot billionaire with a decidedly hitleresque mien mercer stated the men in the room turned to him intently you see the ocean seeker was sunk by a soviet submarine called john dory not by takahiro ohnishi cairo egypt the sun was still a sizzling torture over the crowded city streets despite the onset of evening the arabs in their long white galabias seemed immune to the hundred plus heat but the westerners in the city suffered evad lurbud bought a cup of warm date juice from a passing vendor who had a huge pewter urn strapped to his back the juice tasted awful but his body needed the fluids lurbud stood on shari almuizz ledin allah the main road in the khan elkhalili a huge sprawling bazaar located three miles and about a thousand years from modern tahrir square at the center of cairo a rabbit warren of twisting alleys choked with people the khan is the true shopping center for the locals harried redfaced tourists make it an obligatory stop after the pyramids the necropolis at memphis and the crowded cairo museum founded by sultan barquqs master of horse garkas elkhalili in as a way station for camel caravans the khan had grown enormously over time by the ottoman conquest of egypt in items from as far away as england were being traded in the sprawling bazaar the ottoman sense of order established a guild system within the bazaar that is still evident today perfume sellers congregate just south of the khans main crossroads gold and silver are sold in specific areas while carpet merchants are found in another the heady aromas from spice merchants and food sellers compete throughout the khan while tourist curio shops cling to the khans perimeter there were no cars in the khan but the din of the pedestrian traffic more than made up for the lack of engine noises hawkers touted their wares and the arab tradition of haggling reached a great cacophony the loudspeakers of the two mosques just outside the bazaar throbbed with cries of allah akbar with pious regularity soon lurbud knew the muslims would close up their shops and head to the mosques for sundown prayer he scoffed at the notion of a god especially one that demanded prayer five times a day yet he respected their fealty as a veteran of the afghani campaign he knew full well the strength the rebels derived from their religion the mujahedeen called their resistance a holy war and whipped the tribes into an amazing cohesive force that possessed the power to resist the largest army ever maintained lurbud had spent his first tour of the war as an intelligence operative for the kgb spending weeks and sometimes months away from the relative security of kabul on deep cover insertions because of his swarthy complexion and knack for languages he could ingratiate himself with a rebel band and act as one of their own while gathering data on their strengths and weaknesses assessing the future plans of other groups of resistance fighters when his task was complete he would call in the feared helicopter gunships the craft would thunder into an encampment where he was a trusted member and kill every man woman and child in sight lurbud would conveniently be on patrol during these massacres during the two years he spent on this duty lurbuds afghani compatriots never once suspected that he was the cause of the devastation his amazing nerve caught the eye of the kgb hierarchy especially ivan kerikov after one helicopter attack when lurbud couldnt extricate himself from a rebel village yet managed to survive the scathing fire from the hindd gunships kerikov pulled him from the ranks of field operatives and seconded him to his personal staff in kabul there lurbuds chief function was breaking captured rebels in the dank prisons the soviets had established lurbud learned that the binding force that held the mujahedeen together was also a major weapon in the interrogation rooms the muslim faith forbade the devout from coming into contact with swine and even the threat of such contact was enough to break the hardest rebels lurbud faced it amazed him how the most solid fighter would panic when threatened to be placed inside the decayed carcass of a pig what kind of god made men fear hogs considering so many of them lived just like them lurbud wondered idly the voice of the muezzin blared from speakers high above the streets in the minarets calling the faithful to prayer lurbud crouched deeper in an alley shrinking into the shadows of stacked spice bags as the streets began to empty the smell of saffron was nauseating glancing at his feet he saw that hed stepped into a pile of dog shit he muttered in disgust and smeared the filth against one of the bags looking up lurbud recognized his quarry as the man left his shop across the khans main road the sign above the shops door stated that suleiman elaziz suleiman was a jeweler and the size of his shop indicated that he was prosperous evad lurbud knew differently suleiman was one of the richest arms merchants in the middle east not having the notoriety and ostentation of other death merchants suleiman had been able to practice his trade unmolested by the united states or western europe although his arms were used to fight in beirut italy ireland germany the drugchoked cities of america and countless other places he had never once been questioned by the authorities the obese arab waddled down the street to the mosque of sayyada alhussein his body waggling with every step as huge sacks of extra flesh slid against each other his face was round with an almost childlike openness according to his kgb dossier suleiman was far from the fool whose image he projected he had distinguished himself in two of the wars against israel and in the subsequent years had established a relationship with nearly every terrorist organization on the planet the kgb figured that suleimans personal wealth was somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred million dollars too nice a neighborhood for a stinking arab thought lurbud as he crossed the now empty street lurbud paused by the door the streets were now eerie he had been watching suleimans shop since noon from various vantage points and during that entire time the streets had been crowded and loud there was no one about now even the countless cats that skulked through the alleys had vanished since crime is nearly nonexistent in the khan there was no need for elaborate security systems lurbud expertly picked the frail lock to suleimans shop he knew from the dossier that the arab always returned to his shop for a few minutes after prayer before leaving the khan for his home on shari el haram the road which leads to the great pyramids at giza lurbud closed and locked the door after once again checking the empty street inside the shop lurbud passed display cases that gleamed with gold in the dusty light that streamed in through the transomed windows the setting sun cast long shadows across the room lurbud eased a takarov pistol from its holster under his jacket and parted the beaded curtain that led to suleimans back office a battered wooden desk covered with stacks of books and a gold measuring scale occupied the center of the small office a coffee urn tarnished and pitted sat on a low settee against one wall the room smelled of dust mingled with the sweet odor of hashish lurbud sat behind the desk the pistol in his lap for twenty minutes until suleiman returned from prayer the only movement in the room was the occasional blinking of lurbuds dark eyes he waited with the same patience as the sphinx just outside the city lurbuds entrance had disturbed the room its air pattern its volume its feel as he remained motionless the room had calmed accepting his presence this was a skill he had learned at a training camp on the shores of the black sea where students were put into a completely dark maze the one who walked out alive graduated he remained motionless even when he heard the front door of the shop open and close an instant later suleimans immense bulk parted the curtain separating his shop from his office suleiman had grabbed a demitasse of coffee and was almost upon lurbud before he noticed the intruder the thimblesized cup fell from his pudgy finger shattering on the stone floor behind his beard suleimans face drained of color and he staggered back several paces i read in your dossier that you are never guarded here in the khan lurbud spoke fluent unaccented arabic you believed that your standing in the bazaar would protect you yes who are you suleiman demanded recovering from his initial shock my name means nothing to you suleiman elaziz lurbud spoke without emotion you were hired to supply and ship nearly a thousand tons of arms ammunition and material to hawaii is this not true i know not what you talk about i believe that you do the order was placed by takahiro ohnishi possibly several weeks or months ago i am a simple jeweler i dont understand lurbud continued as if suleiman had not spoken i represent a group that does not wish to see this order filled we dont want those arms shipped to hawaii in fact we dont want you to have any further involvement with ohnishi at all who are you to tell me how to run my business suleiman retorted with a sneer ah so no longer are you a simple jeweler lurbuds smile was devoid of amusement i know your type suleiman said his tone scornful youre some soldier of fortune who happened on that piece of information do you think you can blackmail suleiman elaziz suleiman i am not here to blackmail you im here to tell you that the order is canceled you are too late mercenary those arms are on a freighter halfway to hawaii sweat had beaded on suleimans creased forehead the arab was lying suleiman hadnt even purchased the arms yet he was currently using ohnishis deposit money to push up the bond prices of a hydroelectric project in sri lanka because of his contacts in the terrorist underworld suleiman knew that tamil separatists were going to bomb the huge network of dams within two weeks by pushing up the bond price and then selling at a slight discount just prior to the attack suleiman stood to quadruple the money only then would he put together ohnishis order for weapons i believe that youre lying suleiman lurbud brought the takarov into view for the first time but to be honest i dont really care what the truth is for such a large man suleimans reaction time was incredibly fast he dove across the room his body sailing through the air like a giant zeppelin lurbud swung his pistol in an arc matching suleimans leap but his first shot amazingly missed the huge target suleiman crashed against the wall near the settee one arm sweeping the coffee urn to the floor coffee flooded across the floor in a thick black tide suleimans hands made dexterous through years of precision jewelry making tore at a pistol which had been taped to the back of the old urn evad caught a look of murderous rage in the arabs eyes as suleiman torqued his huge body to bring the gun to bear lurbud fired an instant before the muzzle of suleimans automatic caught a bead on him the shot tore into the arms merchants body the fat rippling in shock waves around the impact suleimans arm was thrown up by the shot the tiny beretta spinning from his hand lurbud fired again and again the killing light in suleimans eyes began to fade lurbud came around the desk his pistol aimed directly at the arabs head with his free hand the russian pulled a flask from inside his jacket he unscrewed the lid from the pewter flask and knelt next to the dying muslim as a final thought suleiman elaziz suleiman lurbud began pouring the viscous red liquid from the flask onto suleiman you will meet allah with your body covered in pigs blood suleiman opened his mouth to scream at this ultimate desecration and lurbud fired one more round down the gaping throat the blood of the dead muslim mingled with that of the unclean pig on the hard floor of the office lurbud reholstered his gun noting for the first time the thick pall of cordite smoke that hung in the air the room reeked of smoke but beneath that odor he detected the smell of blood and suleimans voided bowels at the front door of the shop he paused there were a few people on the street mostly old men heading back to the coffeehouses and their hookahs the thick stone walls of the shop had muffled any sound from the silenced takarov lurbud eased out of the shop and mingled with the crowd as best he could ten minutes later he was out of the bazaar searching for a cab he had two hours to dispose of the pistol and get to the airport before his flight to hawaii the white house there was a stunned silence in the oval office after mercer made his revelation he watched as everyones expression turned from surprise to confusion and finally to doubt what makes you think russia has anything to do with this paul barnes broke the silence just because the assassin who went after dr talbot once worked for the kgb doesnt mean anything mercer realized that he had just stepped on the toes of the director of the cia tish talbot told me that after her rescue from the ocean seeker she heard some of her saviors speaking russian christ barnes said glancing around the room you said she was blown from the ship stunned who knows what she heard she was half dead at the time i doubt that st peter speaks russian during his interview at the pearly gates mr barnes mercer said evenly but thats not the fact im relying on a friend of mine in miami is an expert in maritime law i had him research ocean freight and cargo the owners of the september laurel he found that the company is a front for the kgb i had a court order demanding saulman turn over all the information that you requested henna said incredulously he withheld that from the fbi if you knew dave saulman you wouldnt be surprised hes as crusty as a paris bakery but he is a walking encyclopedia concerning maritime commerce and his word is gospel truth if we take his word about the kgb for the time being paul barnes said suspiciously what about this submarine idea of yours the first piece of evidence is really just simple reasoning according to the news reports there was a combined naval and coast guard search of the area using im sure the most sophisticated hardware in the world yet they failed to find any survivors the ocean seekers last known position was well documented by her loran transmissions yet the search turned up nothing except an oil slick and a few pieces of debris then two days later the september laurel happens along aiding in the search and miraculously they find tish that freighter which was a hundred miles away from the ocean seeker when she blew up managed to accomplish something the coast guard and navy couldnt do i dont buy it there were no weather problems during that time no storms no fog youre wrong there dr mercer admiral morrison interrupted there was a tremendous amount of surface fog and because of the presidents order not to send out surface ships we were confined to an aerial search only admiral tell me honestly is there any logical reason why your planes would have missed her even with the fog the chairman of the joint chiefs ran a hand across the tight whorls of hair on his large head before answering if she had been out there my boys would have found her since there is no logical reason why she wasnt found by the coast guard or navy i looked for an illogical one the only one that fits gentlemen is a submarine morrison turned to the president it makes sense sir there could have been a sub out there and we never would have known it none of the search aircraft used sonar buoys or acoustical gear in the search for survivors that sub could have sat just under the surface and listened to us flounder around the president nodded what other proof do you have dr mercer since i couldnt learn anything more about ocean freight and cargo from dave saulman i knew i needed a firsthand investigation so tish and i broke into their offices in new york what did you find asked dick henna for one i found a fish tank in the vice presidents office a large tank that contained only a single fish so well of ampc has a practice of naming their ships after months and flowers and painting those flowers on the stack of vessels tish remembers seeing the design on the stack of the ship that rescued her it was a black circle surrounding a yellow dot yet the september laurel is marked with a bunch of laurels the distinctive pattern that tish remembered matches that of a european game fish i once caught in france whats the connection the name of the fish is john dory and that tank at the of ampc office contained a prime specimen thats the thinnest connection ive ever heard barnes remarked id agree with you if i hadnt found a base file tab in the drawer with the ownership papers for the companys vessels the tab read john dory at the time i thought the reference was simply a misfile but it makes more sense that they own a ship by that name but dont keep any paperwork on her when i got back to dc i called the friend i went fishing with and he confirmed the name of the fish the design on the stack pins down the source of the name and the only ships ever named after fish are submarines youve got to be joking barnes chuckled indolently mercer stood up mr president you said i was a guest and not a prisoner if thats true i want to leave if you dont want to listen to what i have to say then i see no reason to stay here and try to explain in the past few days ive been shot at a dozen times and not because i have a bad standing in the community ive stumbled on something and if you gentlemen are not interested in what i have to say im going dr mercer please wait henna said tell us what happened in new york mercer told them about the breakin the armed soldiers guarding the building and his impressions about the office there is something nefarious behind ocean freight and cargo and so far all indications point to the russians mercer concluded i just dont know why mr president henna said turning in his seat i had some agents go to the of ampc offices soon after dr mercer and dr talbot had left the scene had been sanitized no corpses or blood my men could tell that a gun had been discharged in the building the air fresheners couldnt mask the smell of the cordite i cant confirm what dr mercer reported but i certainly cant deny it either i just remembered something paul barnes rejoined the conversation with a more accepting tone i cant remember any details but a report crossed my desk a few years ago from a metallurgist in pennsylvania it sounds similar to the conditions dr mercer described about the explosion in he had obtained a sample of some element i cant remember what it was called but it had something to do with radiation and seawater do you remember anything else admiral morrison prompted after barnes had lapsed into silence abraham jacobs barnes finally replied the scientists name was abraham jacobs im sure he knew something about what were discussing can you find him yes sir i want him in my office by this afternoon the force in the presidents voice galvanized the room we now have a more grave situation in hawaii than we first estimated if dr mercer is right and this does go beyond ohnishis personal coup and in some way involves the russians i dont even want to think of the consequences it seems too farfetched to me that takahiro ohnishi and the russians have been planning this since the s too much has changed in the world to make a plot of this type viable this from henna this could be an alliance of convenience hazarded mercer something that was formed recently as new situations developed that makes sense the president agreed but we have to get in touch with this dr jacobs hopefully he can tell us exactly whats at stake here you mean over and above the possible secession of hawaii henna said caustically the president shot him a scathing look mr president may i make a request asked mercer yes dr mercer what is it i have a feeling that were working under a time limit ohnishi or the russians must know were on to them in some respect they are probably being forced to push up their deadlines because of my action in new york i have a feeling that the situation in hawaii is going to get critical real soon i know what you are going to ask and its already been taken care of the carrier kitty hawk and the amphibious assault ship inchon are already on alert three hundred miles from hawaii a good idea sir but not what i wanted i think to better understand what were up against a series of infrared photos should be taken of the area where the ocean seeker was sunk the president looked toward barnes who rummaged through a briefcase at his feet lets see theres a kh flyby of the north pacific in thirteen hours that bird has the right cameras and it wouldnt take much to change her orbit to pass north of hawaii thirteen hours thats too late mercer said what do you suggest either an sr blackbird or one of the air forces superspy planes that no one is supposed to know about paul theres an sr wraith at edwards but i need your authorization to get her airborne do it how long before we get some pictures back at mach six the wraith will be there and back in about an hour and a half say a half hour for film processing and transmission here dr mercer i neednt remind you that you have not heard any of this correct the president cautioned im sorry sir mercer smiled i havent been listening did you say something very good gentlemen we all have jobs to do the group started for the door i want everyone to meet back here in two hours dr mercer ask my secretary for a temporary pass if you plan to leave the grounds ill do that mercer spoke with miss craig and learned that tish was asleep in one of the white house guest rooms he scribbled a quick note for her in case she woke up while he was gone and then hailed a cab near pennsylvania avenue he was home twenty minutes later after a quick shower and an even quicker beer he went to his study touched the large bluish stone that was his good luck piece and sat behind his desk he dialed a number and two rings later the phone was answered geology department carnegiemellon university id like to speak to dr jacobs please one moment after about a dozen moments the same voice came back on the line im sorry dr jacobs is with a class my name is vince andrews from the hiller foundation the group that supports dr jacobss research mercer said putting as much bluff into his voice as he could dr jacobs is in serious trouble and will probably lose his grant its imperative that i speak to him now i understand please hold the line a minute later a more mature voice spoke i dont know who this is since my grant comes from cochran steel but youve piqued my interest hi abe its philip mercer i should have known abraham jacobs laughed mercer give me a second to get into my office i dont want my assistant realizing the low caliber of some of my friends a few seconds later abe jacobs was back and the assistant had hung up the antechamber extension so to what do i owe the honor of this call and by the way thank you for getting me away from that class theyre an even bigger group of idiots than you and your class when i taught at penn state abe jacobs had been mercers academic advisor during his graduate work at penn state and mercer had continued to seek his former professors advice in the years since school they rarely saw each other now but the tight bond between master teacher and star student had not dimmed abe i was just in a meeting where your name came up dont tell me youre on carnegiemellons ethics board abe we both know your wifes leash on you is just long enough for you to roam to your classes and your lab too true well she might be in for a surprise tonight because you wont be home for dinner a couple of years ago you apparently sent a research paper to the cia hold it right there mercer how did you know that that information was top secret i was told by paul barnes the head of the cia ah the cia is tracking you down right now but itll probably take them a few hours to find you they think youre a metallurgist not a geologist i thought id beat them to the punch and teach paul barnes a lesson in humility at the same time they want you in washington as soon as possible with any relevant material about your paper whats this all about it was basically a theoretical paper without twenty years of development what i found would be unfeasible lets just say someone may have already put in the development effort get to the pittsburgh airport general aviation counter ill have a charter plane ready to bring you down here i dont understand how could mercer interrupted abe ill explain on the way to the white house this evening he cut the connection then called general aviation at the airport securing a plane and pilot for abe maxed out two of his credit cards but mercer shrugged off the expense he was keeping a running tally of what the government owed him and the price of the chartered lear jet wasnt even close to the repair bill for his shotup jaguar bangkok thailand minister lujian the chinese representative scratched his name into the heavy book slid to him by minister tren of taiwan lujian finished his signature with a flourish and slid the book across the burnished mahogany table to the person at his left ambassador marco quirino the representative from the philippines with each successive signature the oppressive air in the meeting room lightened there were murmurs from the small gallery of spectators allowed to see the ambassadors pledge their nations consent to the document those in the gallery had not been privy to the weeks of frustrating delays that had plagued the bangkok summit but still they sensed the great accomplishment these diplomats had achieved the official signature book was passed to the russian ambassador gennady perchenko a close observer could easily detect a slight rise in tension among the delegates the wily russian had been the reason for the past weeks of utter frustration then inexplicably this morning he announced to the delegates that he had no further comments because the symbolic documents for the representatives signatures had been prepared at the start of the accords thailands ambassador prem motioned that the delegates commence with the signing and the others nearly fell over themselves seconding him us undersecretary of commerce kenneth donnelly leaned over toward perchenko and whispered out of the corner of his mouth i sure hope you know what youve been playing at pardner mr secretary im not playing at anything i simply wanted to ensure all nations rights were explored here perchenko heard americas delegate mutter bullshit under his breath but let the comment pass no sooner had he signed the document than a wave of applause rippled through the room perchenko acknowledged the ovation with a smug smile and slid the book to donnelly donnelly signed with a tight smile focused on perchenko and closed the book with a resounding snap a pounding rain lashed the night the drone of the water interrupted only by the booming thunder that echoed across the city the storm did little to cool the overpowering heat and perchenko found himself nearly panting as he raced from the courtyard of the arun wat toward the protection of the temple itself kerikovs orders had been explicit that he wait by the low stone wall that separated the temple of dawn from the phraya river at eight pm but the spy had said nothing about drowning in a torrential downpour gennady dashed into the shadow of one of the four ceramictiled towers which surround the conical twohundredandsixtyfoot spire of the wat his suit was soaked through and his sparse hair hung limply against his pale face a face once tight and healthy looking but now worn by exhaustion so that bags drooped under his eyes and slabs of skin hung down his cheeks and throat he could hear the faint chanting of monks within the huge temple but the storm drowned out all other sounds save his labored breathing what the hell am i doing here he wheezed aloud not following instructions gennady perchenko ivan kerikov replied from the deep shadows to perchenkos right kerikov stepped into the light given off by the temples numerous floods and spots he seemed unaffected by the rain his shoulders were squared against the deluge and his eyes remained open and alert in contrast gennady hunched miserably and he squinted at kerikov as if he were a spectral apparition i told you to wait by the wall kerikov gestured with his arm then smiled warmly but under the circumstances i understand gennady relaxed a bit and smiled but still regarded kerikov with a wary nervous eye i assume that all went well kerikov moved toward gennady so that he stood in the protection of the temples massive portal yes gennady muttered his fear of kerikov oppressive yesterday in the open crowd of the royal river hotels bar was crippling now that the two were alone he had been terrified of kerikov since learning of the kgb mans unlimited influence so when he had shown up the day before kerikov had dismissed gennadys concerns over the missing maitre d and assured him that the time had come to wind up the bangkok accords gennady wanted to ask why the delay had been necessary in the first place but fear froze the question in his throat even in the relaxed atmosphere of the openair bar kerikov was the most malevolent man gennady had ever seen relax gennady it is done and you have triumphed kerikov slipped a sterling hip flask from his jacket pocket vodka from home gennady took a long pull from the flask even warm the vodka went down his throat with the smoothness of silk kerikov motioned for gennady to take another drink and he did so gratefully tell me were you able to insert my amendment into the accords yes that was done weeks ago it was simple really ive had more difficulty in actually delaying the signing ceremony ive made some promises to the taiwanese ambassador that may be out of my bounds yes yes kerikov said dismissively you had no trouble with my amendment though the wording had to be changed some to accommodate the american donnelly but they all agreed to it changed there was no panic in kerikovs voice but its pitch had raised slightly how i thought youd ask so i brought that section of the accords with me perchenko pulled a sheet of paper from within his jacket and read aloud no sovereign nation has the right to claim additional land created through volcanism or coral buildup or any other natural process ie not created by man not within a twohundredmile line radiating from that sovereign nations territory any land created in this fashion is open to exploration and exploitation by any nation or other party which lays upon it first rights as laid down in article of this treaty all contentions for said lands are to be settled by the world court in the hague donnelly wanted that last bit about the world court in holland gennady took another swallow of vodka waiting for a reaction from kerikov kerikov thought for a few seconds letting perchenkos words soak in then decided that the diplomat had followed close enough to the original wording thanks to that single amendment kerikov could turn over the volcano to the korean consortium without any fear of international recriminations the united states and russia had just signed away any title to the volcano and its unimaginable wealth kerikov did not betray his emotions to perchenko when he spoke this is acceptable come i have a boat waiting in the river we will celebrate your success kerikov hurried gennady away from the towering temple they nearly sprinted through the driving rain toward the stone wall and the river beyond despite the water streaming into gennadys eyes he could see enough to realize that there was no boat waiting at the quay he had just turned to question the kgb man when kerikov struck kerikov moved with the speed of a mamba smashing a short truncheon over gennadys head blood sprang from the wound over his left eye mingled with the falling rain and ran down perchenkos face in a pink sheet the diplomat crumpled to the ground in an untidy heap kerikov easily dragged gennady to the low stone wall the river beyond was as black as an oil slick hidden in some shrubs near the wall was a large plastic ice chest beside it were two large cement blocks connected by a chain the chain was wrapped in soft cloth and its two ends were joined not by a padlock but rather by the thick chunk of ice that nestled in the cooler kerikov rubbed the falling water from his eyes on a night like this he didnt have to fear discovery by a casual stroller but there was always a chance that a monk might come to the river to make an offering he hoisted gennadys stillunconscious body onto the low wall the diplomats breathing was shallow but even good after lifting the two cement blocks and the ice chest onto the wall kerikov slung the chain around perchenkos neck he had to hurry the ice was melting faster than hed anticipated kerikov heaved the loyal ambassador into the turgid water the dark river swallowed perchenko with a minimal splash the cement blocks dragging him quickly toward the bottom kerikov threw the cooler in also and watched as it was washed away by the rivers subtle current then started back to his hotel shoulders hunched against the biting rain he could imagine the police report when the body was finally discovered perchenko had been out celebrating the conclusion of his meetings the alcohol in his system would show he wasnt drunk but certainly tipsy he had slipped in the rain near the river smashed his head against the stone wall and fallen in there would be no indication of foul play because the padding around the chain would leave no marks around his throat and the chain that anchored him to the muddy bottom while he drowned would have vanished the ice that held it together would melt in about ten minutes and then perchenkos lifeless body would simply float free an hour later kerikov was seated in the living room of his hotel suite showered and dressed in a conservative suit with a scotch in his hand he could hear the rain pelting the patio just outside the curtained french doors the lighting in the elegant room was muted except for the lamp over the couch which shone brightly on the papers spread across the coffee table kerikov had gone over them a dozen times in the past few days and felt he could recite them by heart they were his ticket to a future outside russia a future that he had barely dreamed of the ice in the glass tinkled delicately as he took a sip he placed the glass exactly onto its condensation ring on the glasstopped table and picked up a sheet of paper at random it was the assay values of the mineral compiled by dr borodin in his survey runs over the past few months the figures were staggering in one ton of mined volcanic material eight pounds of usable ore were present processed those eight pounds would produce about one pound of highgrade metal with all its extraordinary properties by comparison borodin had explained that in openpit diamond mining tons of overburden had to be removed per carat of diamond recovered a ratio of one billion to one kerikov selected another sheet of paper this one was borodins plan for the actual mining of the mineral a ship fitted with a huge cycloidal pump would be stationed near a less active vent of the volcano a tungsten steel tube would be lowered into the vent and the pump turned on lava would be drawn directly from the volcano into the ship where it would be cooled and systematically broken up into workable chunks which would be offloaded onto waiting ore carriers for refinement at a landbased smelter the only real cost in the mining operation was the pump ship and since selling the idea to the koreans they had already had the ship built in pusan there was a knock at the door kerikov stacked the papers neatly took another sip of scotch and went to answer it two young orientals stood there each holding a bulky suitcase he let them in without a word the koreans opened the suitcases revealing a daunting mass of electronics they hurriedly set up the equipment camera monitor and computerized transceiver one man placed a small collapsible dish antenna on the teak railing of the patio from the street seventy feet below the steel mesh dish was invisible once the equipment was set up one of the young men began typing commands the machines beeped and whirred and a test pattern appeared on the color monitor the other man held a cardboard card in front of the camera in pusan the image of that second test pattern filled the screen of a huge wallmounted highdefinition television the two technicians nodded to each other and retreated from the room an instant later the test pattern vanished from the monitor and was replaced by a view of a beautiful room kerikov sat on the couch in front of the cyclops eye of the minicam on the monitor nine aged gentlemen were seated around a black lacquer table none of them was under seventy years of age yet their dark eyes were all alert and steady each mans face was deeply lined and there was not a single dark hair to be seen behind the men hung a red tapestry chronicling genghis khans conquest of asia flanked by two huge terracotta vases kerikov nodded slightly to show respect to the nine heads of hydra consolidated in turn the men merely dipped their eyes for a moment that piece of eastern nonsense complete kerikov spoke good evening gentlemen good evening to you mr kerikov the satellite feed scrambled their voices and automatically translated from korean into russian and vice versa the system worked well enough as long as their sentences were not filled with enigmatic phrases way hue dong spoke for the syndicate as he had during all their earlier negotiations i trust that this method of meeting is agreeable i am ready now to commit to our agreedupon proposal we would like to know why the delay was necessary the electronics masked the annoyance in ways voice but the question made his emotions clear it was needed i assure you gentlemen kerikov knew that a placating smile would be lost on these men so he refrained when you see the location of the mineral deposit you will understand that significant steps were needed to ensure its safety i trust that our future activities will not be disturbed no they will not kerikov responded hurriedly with the americans and russians hands tied by the bangkok accords only takahiro ohnishi presented any obstacle and by the time the koreans reached the volcano ohnishi would be eliminated dealing with the racecrazed billionaire was a necessary hazard during the final play of vulcans forge ohnishi had been programmed to attempt his break away from the united states and up until the last possible moment kerikov had needed him but now the mineral wealth lay beyond americas control and beyond ohnishis if he ever succeeded in his bid for independence then all is in order way asked snapping kerikovs attention back to the present yes i am ready to transmit the final data to you now kerikov hid the tension that tightened his stomach and we are ready to give you the account number kerikov could see ways lips moving long before the computers sterilized voice could be heard as a sign of good faith we will transmit first way nodded to an offcamera assistant an instant later the teletype attached to the transceiver began to pound away kerikov made it a point to keep his eyes glued to the camera to look toward the teletype would be a major loss of face when it stopped kerikov fed several sheets of paper into a portable fax machine attached to the satellite uplink these pages included the latest assay and elevation reports and gave the exact location of dr borodins island kerikov saw that ways eyes were locked on someone outside the cameras field of vision so he took a moment to scan the teletype one hundred million american dollars had just been transferred to the national cayman bank in the caribbean the transfer number and the account number were at the bottom of the page way hue dong received an acknowledgment from some technician out of view and turned back to the camera the information seems legitimate mr kerikov i believe now i know why there was a delay and i applaud your audacity you must forgive me sir way continued but there is a restraint order on the money you cannot touch it until i send the bank another set of code numbers way displayed no emotion as he revealed his doublecross once my engineers are onstation and prove what you have told us the money will be released into your care kerikov listened and could barely contain his rage way added im sure you understand that we must protect this large amount of money from fraud not that you are suspect once the value of this new mineral is established i will send the new code and the money will be yours good evening mr kerikov the monitor went blank in kerikovs hotel suite the camera continued to record and transmit so the nine koreans saw kerikov pound his foot through the monitor screen and then begin attacking the video transceiver the image faded when kerikov fired a roundhouse kick at the camera and sent it slamming into a wall those motherfucking bastards kerikov ranted once he could control himself enough to speak those pissdrinking shit eaters kerikov fumed for about ten minutes dredging up curses he hadnt used since afghanistan when he finally calmed he finished the diluted scotch in his glass and then drank right from the bottle the raw spirit singeing his stomach when it hit somehow the koreans had figured out that he was acting outside his own governments authority that the hundred million dollars was destined for kerikov himself and not the russian state treasury knowing that they wouldnt garner any government wrath they could delay the transfer of money indefinitely while they reaped the benefits of borodins volcano without an armed force to back him kerikov would be powerless to stop them he laughed to himself amid the wreckage of the computer equipment he admitted that he had been outsmarted once his laughter subsided kerikovs eyes gleamed with an unholy fire there was no way that he would allow those korean bastards to doublecross him when he still had an ace up his sleeve the white house paul barnes nearly cowered in his chair in front of the president as if the supple leather would shield him from the chief executives scathing censure the president usually a levelheaded man was furious the cia director had failed to find dr jacobs sir that report came across my desk years ago barnes said lamely you are the head of the most powerful spy network in the world and you cant find a man who is no more than two hundred miles from washington the presidents intercom chimed yes he responded sir the others are back thanks joy send them in the president turned back to barnes well continue this conversation later dick henna and admiral morrison filed into the oval office they were subdued their faces drawn and ashen henna helped himself to a slug of scotch wheres dr mercer the president asked hell probably be along in a few minutes henna said should we wait for him no we cant afford the time the president replied slowly dick whats the latest from hawaii im afraid i dont have much to report sir theres been no further communication from ohnishi ive got some agents keeping his estate under longrange surveillance but they havent reported anything suspicious our phone taps have turned up nothing but i doubt that any sensitive conversations would go over unscrambled land lines have you found a tiein between ohnishi and mayor takamora takamora went to ohnishis mansion last night but has not left as of an hour ago we assume that they are working together on this coup attempt as near as we can figure takamora will be the front man given his popularity in the islands while ohnishi plays the role of kingmaker what have you got tom morrison cleared his throat well sir ive been in contact with the base commander at pearl he reports that theres a fairly goodsized mob maybe three hundred or so on macarthur boulevard just outside the bases main entrance they dont appear to be armed but he also reports that the national guard which was called out a few hours ago seems to be part of the mob i had some records pulled from the pentagon files on hawaiian national guard enlistments in the past couple of years a disproportionate number of applications have been rejected nearly all white black and hispanic in the past three years eightysix percent of the new members of the national guard are of japanese ancestry given the situation id say takamora has built himself a private army right under our noses have you been working on some options in case they do try to pull this off the presidents cool blue eyes scanned the room waiting for responses well admiral morrison started after a pause we have the carrier kitty hawk and the amphibious assault ship inchon on station well within striking distance of hawaii pearl harbor is on full alert although theyre bottled up per your order if ohnishi tries to take the islands by force we can just as easily take them back again his mobs and guard troops cant stand up to what we can throw at them ordering our troops to fire on american citizens is not an option anguish etched the presidents handsome features goddamn it i control the best trained and best equipped fighting machine ever built and its fucking useless to me the men seated around the office watched the presidents pain stoically each man thankful that they did not sit behind that desk admiral morrison cleared his throat again a precise surgical air strike against ohnishis house would neutralize the problem cut off the head and the snake dies so to speak how do i explain that to the people of hawaii they revere him christ he donates something like twenty million dollars a year to hawaiian charities if we killed him wed touch off a grassroots revolution what about a commando raid of some sort paul barnes suggested and then tell the people about the russian involvement make a clean breast of it and put ohnishi on trial henna gave the answer to that our intelligence reports ohnishis house is heavily guarded a raid would turn into a pitched battle the furor over something like that would be ten times worse than the waco fiasco back in i doubt the administration could survive given the current polls no offense sir none taken the president said gloomily for the next hour the men in the oval office batted around ideas but each option they debated was rejected all of them ended with the same result the end of the administration maybe that is the only way the president mused the intercom buzzed and joy craig announced that mercer had finally arrived with a guest when mercer introduced the stooped dr abraham jacobs the president shot a brutal glare at barnes and henna laughed delightedly dr mercer when your contracts up at the usgs the fbi would love to have you i just cant see myself as one of your fairhaired boys mr henna i dont take orders very well dr jacobs have you been told anything the president interrupted jacobs still a little stunned by the men in the room merely nodded seeing his old teachers discomfort mercer came to the rescue i told him that he was needed here because of the paper he presented to the cia a few years ago yes that is correct jacobs had found his voice but sweat still gleamed on his wide bald head would you care to elaborate on that paper the president prompted after a preamble of coughs throat clearing and mumbles jacobs began eight years ago i was invited by the white sands testing center to do some analysis on mineral samples from their bikini tests the samples had lain neglected in an old storage shed that was being demolished so the white sands people contacted a number of independent researchers across the country they had something like eighteen thousand mineral samples in that shed dating back to the early s jacobss voice was now sure and firm confident of his subject of the groups of samples i agreed to assay for them one was a collection of rocks about twelve pounds worth recovered from the seafloor around bikini atoll after the second test the one where the bomb was detonated underwater after some initial work my interest was piqued and i requested all the data from the original tests conducted on soil rock and water samples collected from bikini in for the next few months i researched twelve thousand pages of documents after this i realized only one small sample had any potential value a twopound chunk of rock taken directly from the epicenter of the explosion it had been a ballast stone from the lsm the ship under which the bomb was suspended it was truly a miracle that the rock wasnt atomized by the blast or so i thought that phrase made the men in the room lean a little further forward in their seats the ballast rock consisted mostly of vanadium ore a surprising fact since vanadium is mainly found in north and south america and in parts of africa how it got to be ballast on a ship in the pacific is one of those bizarre quirks of war i suppose anyway for those who dont know vanadium is used to strengthen steel for use in precision machine tools and other highstress jobs so it is very tough that might have explained why it hadnt vaporized but it didnt seem likely i crushed the sample and ran it through a spectrometer to see what other elements occurred in the rock the standard stuff like mica i discounted but i found something interesting bonded to the vanadium were traces of a metal alloy at first i thought the metal was pure vanadium extracted from the ore because of the heat of the explosion but when i tested my theory i found i couldnt have been more wrong the metal was something completely new something i couldnt explain i crushed the rest of the samples given to me by white sands and found even more of this new metal about twenty grams in all not very much but enough to continue my research have any of you gentlemen ever heard of invar mercer was the only person in the room not to reply with a blank stare yes its an alloy of thirtysix percent nickel traces of manganese silicon and carbon and the rest is iron aplus to my star student it was developed by nobel prizewinner charles guillaume its principle characteristic is a minimal heat expansion about seven tenmillionths of an inch per degree fahrenheit of temperature increase the incredible temperature of the blast one hundred thousand degrees or more made me think of invar during my tests and i wondered if the two metals had similar properties i heated my samples at seven thousand degrees the metal didnt expand at all and at twelve thousand the change was measured in angstroms the technical language was beginning to lose jacobss audience but he seemed not to notice i continued applying heat but i never could find the metals melting point mercer had a sly smile on his face he thought he knew where the scientists discussion was heading yet his expression changed to one of astonishment when jacobs made his next revelation my next test was with electricity i ran one millijoule of electricity through the sample and created an unidirectional magnetic field of about six thousand gauss jesus mercer exclaimed i dont understand the president voiced the incomprehension on everyones face mr president had i been wearing a steel watch that magnetic field would have stripped it from my wrist at a distance of ten feet now everyone looked astonished after that experiment i reconfigured the sample so it would create a closed loop field and then i put the power to it so to speak i was able to sustain a field of eighty million kilogauss for seventeen seconds before an equipment short shut me down the equipment failed not the sample said mercer again the only one to grasp jacobss dissertation heat buildup melted the conductor wires despite the liquid oxygen cooling but i hadnt reached the magnetic saturation or curie points of the sample the curie point is where heat arrests magnetism the curie point of cobalt is around sixteen hundred degrees centigrade the highest known until my work my experiment failed when the wires melted at about seven thousand degrees centigrade at the time the magnetic pressure within the field was in the neighborhood of forty thousand tons per square inch you must remember that this really wasnt my area of expertise so i didnt have the proper equipment to continue experimenting but im sure that this new element could generate a strong enough field to create a magnetic well a magnetic well its something like a black hole but using magnetism rather than gravity the field within the well is strong enough to bend light and time would slow as you neared its event horizon are you saying that this stuff can be used to make some sort of time machine eventually yes admiral morrison though it would take years to develop that but bikinium has many applications in the here and now when i discovered its strategic importance i immediately contacted the government id done some consulting for the pentagon so i turned over my findings to the same people id dealt with before a few months later i was told to drop the whole thing and have barely thought about it since then bikinium that is what i called the new metal i considered naming it after myself but calling it jacobinium just sounded too ridiculous jacobs smiled at his little joke what are some of those uses the president prompted mr president the metal i have just described has more uses in defense aerospace and power production than i could possibly name i dont understand the greatest challenges currently facing many leading hightech corporations are the limitations placed upon them by the materials with which they work they have the ideas and techniques to produce wondrous inventions unfortunately they have nothing to build them with technological leaps must wait for materials to catch up think about the weight savings in automobiles when ceramic engines become a reality these engines have already been designed yet the ceramic itself cannot meet the strength requirements for internal combustion do you understand i think so ill give you some of bikiniums more exotic applications to existing ideas thermal and magnetic containment for fusion reactors a way to channel nuclear blasts for propulsion of deepspace vehicles desktop supercolliders endless charge electric cars or supersonic maglev trains that dont need superconductivity anything that uses magnetic power or is limited by thermal friction could be made thousands of times more efficient i see your point ive saved the best for last mr president jacobss dark eyes shone with feverish excitement the free lunch excuse me its a term used by physicists to describe a system that creates more energy than it requires einsteinian theory says that its impossible due to conservation of mass and energy but man has been searching for one anyway sort of a physicists holy grail a modern powerproducing plant burns coal or oil or splits atoms to release the energy stored within correct the men in the room nodded attentively bikinium used in the dynamos of an electric generator would create a much stronger electrical field than the amount of power put into it im sorry youve lost me again an electric motor and an electric generator are basically the same machine add electricity to a motor and it spins around add spin to a generator and it creates electricity each machine transforms energy from mechanical to electrical or vice versa yes because of bikiniums abnormal magnetic properties during that transformation more energy would be released than was first introduced youre neglecting the energy put into the system by the initial nuclear blast mercer pointed out in fact you would still remain within the laws of the conservation of mass and energy dont be a smart ass abe chided as if they were back in the classroom dick henna put into words what the rest of the men in the room were thinking dr jacobs youre describing an unlimited power source yes thats right jacobs looked smug dr jacobs the presidents tone was respectful how would you go about creating bikinium in useful amounts well to answer that you have to know how bikinium was formed in the first place and even my findings are only theory i researched all the mineral samples taken from nuclear detonations in new mexico going back to the original los alamos test and found no trace of it so the effect must have something to do with water that much i am certain i began to search for other dissimilarities between the land tests and the one conducted underwater i found no traces of vanadium ore at any test site other than the bikini test i could conclude that the vanadium must act as a catalyst or possibly a host in the formation of this new metal furthermore it is known that the neutrons released after a nuclear blast can be absorbed by any sodium in the area it is my belief that all of the neutrons from the bikini test were absorbed by the sodium in the surrounding seawater another dissimilarity between the two is the period of cooling the seawater at bikini cooled the test site much faster than those tests conducted on land there is a strong possibility that rapid cooling also aids in the formation of bikinium i also theorize that pressure may be a factor in its creation of course there is no way to test any of my assumptions but to create it again i would detonate an atomic bomb in the seas near a vanadium deposit abe mercer turned to jacobs is there anyone who might have stumbled onto this before you no one at all jacobs replied with confidence though there were some ore samples missing from white sands i dont think anyone in the world could have come up with this are you sure mercer persisted yes quite only the soviet union and china have done the kind of test we conducted at bikini the chinese dont have scientists of high enough caliber to find bikinium and the only one in the soviet union that ive heard about testing exotic metals like this died years ago when mercer snapped in the sixties i believe he had published some brilliant articles about the changes in metals after nuclear tests but his work centered mostly on the effects on the armor of tanks and ships his name was borodin pytor borodin oh jesus mercer moaned do we have those photos yet from the spy plane paul barnes slid the x s from a thin envelope and placed them on the presidents desk their colors were phantasmagorical fuchsia teal blinding white indigo blue vibrant yellow they created a concentric pattern on the photos each color ringing another so that the image looked like a distorted bullseye at the bottom of each photograph was printed the time location and altitude of each shot mercer couldnt help but notice the shots were taken above one hundred and fifty thousand feet miles above the earths atmosphere he was very impressed with the new sr wraith he wondered idly as he waited his turn to closely study the photos why all the men crowded around the desk to see them apart from barnes he doubted any of them had ever seen an infrared photo of this type he passed it off as the same kind of curiosity that caused people to stare into construction pits mercer looked at the near identical photos until his eyes found the one he wanted longitude and latitude lines had been etched onto the film by the computer that controlled the camera mercer muttered something under his breath what was that the bangkok accords his voice barely a whisper in the quiet room i said the bangkok accords what is meetings taking place right now that may just give away the greatest discovery of this or any century mercer said anticipating the question abe did this dr borodin have any children i cant see how that answer me goddamn it the vehemence in mercers voice made jacobs pale yes one son weve been had mercer leaned away from the photographs his eyes betraying respect for the master of the plan what do you mean dr borodin is alive and well gentlemen and he beat us to the punch by forty years mercer spoke slowly as his brain began unraveling the fourdecadeold mystery bear with me for a few minutes lets assume that this borodin somehow discovers the existence of bikinium back in the early fifties and wants to create his own he persuades the russians to give him an atomic bomb remember those things were in short supply back then so his project must have gotten a high priority then he fills an ore carrier with highgrade vanadium ore sails her to a predetermined location near volcanic activity and sinks her along with the bomb once she settles on the ocean floor he touches off the nuke later he fakes his own death so there wouldnt ever be any connection to him is there any record of a lost ore carrier abe asked grandam phoenix missing since may mercer replied sharply she was listed as running bauxite ore from malaysia to the states but christ only knew what she carried mercers voice trailed off his eyes glazed for a second and then snapped back into focus his voice was firm commanding i need a phone now in a moment that mercer would remember for the rest of his life the president of the united states obeyed and handed him the receiver to one of the telephones on his desk mercer gave the white house operator a number and waited patiently for the connection oblivious of the stares berkowitz saulman mercer cut off the secretary skip it give me dave saulman right away this is an emergency the secretary was used to emergencies in the uncontrollable world of ocean commerce and cut in on saulman while he was on another line saulman here the old lawyer answered quickly dave its mercer oh you finally have an answer for me mercer knew that saulman was asking about the trivia question at the bottom of the faxes he had received two days earlier without thinking mercer replied the captain of the amoco cadio was pasquale bardari you son of a bitch dave i need to know who owned the grandam phoenix never heard of her she was on the list you sent me of the vessels that disappeared north of hawaii oh right recognition lightened saulmans voice might take me a couple of days to find im swamped in work right now on a towing contract for an exxon tanker thats drifting off namibia the fucking dutch tugs are holding out for lloyds open and the value of that tanker and cargo is somewhere around one hundred and thirty million dollars not to namedrop mercer said with a fiendish smile but im sitting with the president the chairman of the joint chiefs and the heads of the fbi and cia and were all waiting for your answer there was a moments silence from the other end of the phone mercer marveled that there was no static on the presidents phone line must be nice he thought youre not kidding are you want to talk to one of them no itll take a few minutes to get the info do you want me to call back i dont think at ampt cares how long the president is on the phone ill hold whats this all about the president asked not really caring that mercer was now sitting on the corner of his desk conclusive evidence replied mercer enigmatically the president exchanged glances with the men around the room but none of them spoke they waited five long minutes clearing throats shuffling feet and rattling papers but their gaze never left mercer ive got it saulman was breathless the grandam phoenix was owned by ocean freight and cargo saulman continued to speak but mercer was already hanging up the phone the ore carrier that sank in and the ship that rescued tish talbot have the same owners ocean freight and cargo the same company i broke into last night the ones suspected of being a front for the kgb right you said something about the ore carrier being sunk over a volcanic area why henna asked correct me if im wrong abe but the deeper the explosion and the more water pressure the purer the bikinium abe jacobs nodded then added thats just my theory though well in there was no way to mine any minerals from even a few hundred feet underwater and were talking depths in the thousands even today the frasch process of using superheated water for mining cant work any deeper than two hundred feet dr borodin borrowed a line from the koran and like muhammad had the mountain come to him by setting off the blast over a volcanic area he would trigger an eruption and the lava would transport the bikinium to the surface jesus that would work jacobs said respect lowering his voice i never would have even considered it but volcanoes take millions of years to grow the president pointed out normal geologic processes are that slow mercer agreed but volcanoes like earthquakes are very dynamic a volcano in paricutin mexico grew out of a farmers field beginning in the summer of after the first week the field was a fivehundredfoottall mountain and growing by the second borodins volcano has had more than enough time to reach the surface what do we do now the president locked eyes with each man in the room the first step is to stop the bangkok accords mercer replied what does that have mr henna if you look at this photo youll see that the center of borodins volcano lies directly atop hawaiis twohundredmile limit im willing to bet that borodins there now studying the epicenter of the volcano as soon as he knows itll surface outside the limit hell contact the russian ambassador at the meeting in thailand and have him sign the treaty that would make the volcano anyones property right admiral morrison asked the first one to spot it gets it what happens if the volcano is within that line no one had an answer for dr jacobs actually they all knew the answer but no one was brave enough to put it into words mercer looked at the doctor and saw that his old teacher had asked the question because he really didnt know then we go to war abe as soon as the word was said everyone in the room started speaking at once clamoring to be heard the president snapped them to silence by slapping his palm against his desk though when he spoke his voice was calm dr mercer is right we cant allow such a priceless commodity to belong to anyone but the united states now that we know the stakes takahiro ohnishis threats take on a much more ominous dimension we now know why hes doing it if the volcano does crest within hawaiis twohundredmile limit and his coup is successful he can sell off possibly the most valuable commodity on earth i just cant believe that the soviets are still mixed up in this our relations with them have never been better mercer noted the president was now calling the old foe by their old name no longer were they the commonwealth of independent states once again they were the soviets paul use everything at your disposal to find out about pytor borodin who he used to work for before he disappeared and what happened to his old bosses dick keep digging at ohnishi i want to know why he turned traitor ive got something on that already henna fumbled through his briefcase ah here it is both his parents were born in japan and immigrated to the states in the s during the second world war they were sent to one of the internment camps in california and both died there his mother on june and his father just six months afterward ohnishi was raised by an aunt and uncle who also spent the war in the camps his uncle was on file at the bureau for antiamerican protests and petitions he had two arrests one for trying to break into pearl harbor and the other for assaulting a police officer at a projapanese rally in hawaii during the summer of seems he didnt like the idea of statehood i saw a copy of one of the pamphlets he printed its full of antiamerican propaganda and urged hawaiis japanese residents then and now the majority on the islands to fight the statehood referendum and become an independent nation loyal to japan ohnishis uncle committed suicide right after hawaii was admitted into the union in march of there is no record that ohnishi shared his uncles radical politics but theres no record that he didnt either henna looked up from his notes thanks dick i think thats our answer knowing the answer did not alleviate the problem the president straightened his shoulders and when he spoke his voice was like steel i dont know what ohnishis next move will be but i want a detailed battle plan drawn up not only for hawaii but also for this new volcano i dont know what legal right if any we will have to this new island but theres no way were not going to win if need be ill have the goddamn thing nuked now if you gentlemen will excuse me i have to call our diplomats in bangkok and stop them from signing that treaty the men got up to leave i want hourly reports from all of you dr mercer please make yourself available in case youre needed again dr jacobs thank you well see that you have a safe trip home mercer said farewell to jacobs gave his home number to joy craig and collected tish on the cab ride home she pumped him for information but mercer remained silent he wondered as the cityscape passed outside the cabs filthy windows how the president would react if he knew that his wife had just spent the afternoon with a russian spy hawaii jal flight a jumbo jet from tokyo was the last plane given permission to land at honolulus international airport employees loyal to ohnishi and takamora had followed their instructions and sabotaged the ifr equipment and the computers that controlled the other sophisticated systems only those planes without enough fuel to be rerouted were allowed to land hawaii was now completely isolated from the outside world flight touched down with an acrid puff of smoke and a bark of tires because of the danger in landing without electronic assistance from the tower the pilot gave himself plenty of room to make sure the craft returned to earth safely the pratt and whitney turbo fans shrieked as the pilot applied reverse thrust the tremendous airframe shuddering with their awesome power the three hundred and sixty passengers had no idea of the danger they had just been through those controlling the airport had ordered the pilot to keep his charges ignorant of any problems during the landing in direct violation of standard safety practices welcome to honolulu ladies and gentlemen the flight attendant said in japanese the temperature is seventyeight degrees and the local time is onethirty on a cloudless afternoon please remain seated until the aircraft has come to a complete stop and the pilot has turned off the seatbelt sign evad lurbud had absolutely no idea what the diminutive attendant said until she repeated her announcement in english he was the only westerner on the jumbo jet the rest were japanese tourists or businessmen lured to the islands by the increased trade promoted by ohnishi and takamora during the past months though lurbud had flown across eleven time zones since leaving egypt and had endured hourslong layovers one in hong kong and the other in tokyo he felt relaxed and refreshed this last flight had lasted nearly seven hours and he had slept through six and a half of them before each leg of his trip he had taken a timed sleeping pill developed by the kgb by calibrating the doses he could sleep a specific number of hours the only drawback to the medication was a slight nausea which lasted about an hour after waking the so graceful in the sky lumbered to the terminal like a hippopotamus her huge wings flexing with each bump in the tarmac lurbud remained seated and buckled as requested rather than draw attention to himself by standing as several hurried businessmen had done the aircraft taxied to its hardstand the huge engines spooling down to silence the truckmounted stairs eased to the exits and passengers began shuffling off the boeing deplaning lurbud was staggered by the amount of security within the airports customs area armed national guard troops all orientals he noted patrolled the area their m assault rifles slung low their eyes never lingering on one person too long at the customs counter the bored agent gave lurbuds forged german passport a cursory glance and didnt bother with his briefcase lurbud relaxed once he passed customs but became wary when two suited orientals strode toward him through the throng of passengers passport please one of the two men demanded his hand thrust out waiting for the slim booklet im already cleared by customs lurbud replied politely staining his flawless english with a german accent the other oriental flashed a silver badge in a cheap vinyl covering airport security your passport lurbud fished it from inside his suit coat and handed it over whats this all about routine mr schmidt one agent said reading through the passport would you come with us lurbud followed the two security men through a set of double doors and down a welllit flight of stairs they passed a couple of airport employees plodding upward as lurbud and his two minders made their way down at the base of the stairs they turned down a long hallway to the last doorway on the left as he stepped over the threshold lurbuds instincts told him that this was an interrogation room and his being here was far from routine in the stark room two chairs stood behind a unitarian trestle table with a third chair set in the center of the neutral beige carpet the room smelled of stale cigarettes and fear the moment the door closed one of the men shoved lurbud propelling him across the room he exaggerated his momentum and slammed himself against the far wall sliding to the floor with a moan one of the security agents walked over to lurbud probably intending to throw him into the chair and begin the formal interrogation of this gaijin foreigner the instant the mans hand touched lurbuds shoulder the russian uncoiled himself from the floor clutching an undetectable teflon knife in his fist he buried the knife between the orientals ribs piercing his heart lurbud pulled the knife from the dying mans chest ignoring the fountain of blood that pumped from the obscene wound and dove across the room the other agent was just going for his shoulderholstered pistol when lurbud reached him the impetus of lurbuds charge threw them both against the table the russians body pinning the other man lurbud raised the knife over his head and stabbed down viciously slicing into skin and cartilage severing the carotid artery of the shocked security man the man died hard gasping and choking and clutching at his punctured throat his writhing body smeared blood across the table and onto the carpet and white walls after the man had stilled lurbud cleaned his knife against his victims suit and stashed it back in its ankle sheath he checked himself quickly a few red splashes of blood were invisible against the dark tropical wool of his suit he opened the door and seeing that the hall was empty made his escape at the opposite end of the hall lurbud reentered the public part of the airport just off the main concourse outside he passed banks of beautiful tropical flowers and ponds loaded with huge goldfish he hailed a cab and gave the driver an address in downtown honolulu confident that he wouldnt be followed ten minutes into the cab ride his hands began to quiver and his stomach knotted up he wished he could pass it off as a reaction to the sleeping pill hed taken during the flight but knew in his heart that his close brush with the authorities had shaken him hed been living on adrenaline his entire adult life and like any addict his drug of choice was beginning to wear him away at the cairo airport lurbud had been given a sealed envelope by an embassy courier it had contained a briefing from ivan kerikov the top sheet had outlined the current situation in hawaii so lurbud knew that honolulu was under martial law with a strictly enforced eight pm curfew it had been a calculated risk bringing the packet into the state but there was too much information to memorize he read through some of it in the taxi to distract himself from the disturbing cityscape outside the fords windows the envelope contained lurbuds final orders names of the critical targets opposition strength and codes for contacting the john dory lurbud assumed that kerikov had an agent in place near ohnishi because the orders contained a detailed map of ohnishis house and also stated that mayor david takamora was already dead yet the kgb master made no provisions for sparing his agents life lurbud furtively wondered if he too would be considered a loose end after ohnishi and the mole had been eliminated although it was just midafternoon the city seemed nearly deserted only groups of national guard troops and armed cadres of students wandered the streets the citizens were hidden in their homes fearful or expectant depending on their loyalty the scene outside the cabs windows reminded lurbud of the time hed spent in warravaged beirut where religionintoxicated youths systematically ripped the mediterraneans most beautiful city into minute strips of terror columns of smoke lifted from numerous fires to mingle in a murky haze over the city the rocky outcrop of diamond head was invisible in the gloom near the commercial port thick black smoke belched from two burning oil storage tanks their noxious fumes reaching lurbuds cab many miles away buildings had been riddled with smallarms fire and the cab passed numerous husks of burnedout cars and buses the area over pearl harbor resembled a bees nest angry helicopters buzzing in frenzied flight as federal and national guard choppers performed a dizzying danse macabre after the uneasy fortyminute drive lurbud paid off the driver and left the taxi in one of honolulus worst neighborhoods his destination was a flatfronted threestory edifice with a liquor store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two the building had been bought by department when they had brought takahiro ohnishi into vulcans forge in case they ever needed a safehouse to monitor the local situation this was the first time that members of the operation had ever used the building lurbud surveyed the decayed neighborhood the vacant rubble strewn lots the peeling paint the empty looks in the eyes of the few passersby and knew that this location had never been compromised in the humid air his jacket was already beginning to stick to his body on the top floor he knocked twice on the stout metal door at the head of the stairs paused then knocked once more yes a voice called from within united parcel service i have a package for charles haines lurbud replied beginning a recognition code hed learned from kerikovs packet whos it from the voice behind the door responded suspiciously kyle leblanc lurbud finished the code and the bolts were thrown open the man whod opened the door kept his automatic pistol in view as lurbud entered the safehouse only after sergeant dimitri demanov spoke from across the vast room did he reholster it so what have you been doing since you can no longer rape boys with heated pokers demanov was referring to one of lurbuds more effective interrogation techniques from his time working for kerikov in afghanistan cutting off testicles of disrespectful sergeants lurbud retorted the two men crashed together in the center of the room like sea lions pounding each others backs in reunion how have you been dimitri lurbud asked smiling for the first time since killing suleiman bored in minsk until i got a call to meet you here replied demanov kissing lurbud in the traditional russian way it is good to see you again evad and you too old friend lurbud and demanov had fought side by side in afghanistan they had shared more freezing nights and narrow escapes than either could remember demanov had stayed in the field after lurbuds promotion and ended the war as the soviet unions third most decorated soldier since that time he had gone on to be an instructor of the spetnez russias special forces but had recently retired to a deteriorating existence the stout grizzled sergeant was a warrior in the truest sense of the word the safe room took up the entire top floor of the building and was designed to be used as a hideout for several weeks if necessary there were beds for a dozen people the kitchen shelves were crammed with canned food several huge drums were filled with water in case the buildings supply was ever cut off light streamed through the multiple windows but was diffused by the layers of caked dust that made it impossible to see into the room from the street i trust everyone got past customs without incident lurbud asked there were no problems we all arrived before the airport was shut down demanov responded lurbud took a moment to scrutinize the troops demanov had brought with him they were all former spetnez men more loyal to demanov than to their motherland without exception they were the finest trained commandos the russian army had ever produced their instruction went much further than gregory brezhnicovs kgb guards in new york who had been murdered the day before by an unknown assailant none of the men were especially large or hulking but there was an air of competence about them which was chilling their minds and bodies had been sharpened to a rapiers edge by endless training and actual combat experience though they never admitted it both the united states and russia lent some of their special forces troops to various warravaged nations so the men could gain practical understanding of battlefield operations it wouldnt shock lurbud to learn that these men had faced an american ranger battalion on the hills above sarajevo just a few years earlier how did you assemble such a large force so quickly army pay isnt what it used to be evad as you know the countrys full of out of work soldiers finding commandos in russia is easier than finding syphilis in a whorehouse did you have time to brief them in minsk i told them that they would be fighting with you that was all they needed to hear do you have any doubts about them dimitri demanov lit a cigarette and enjoyed the first few drags before answering in my career ive trained egyptians to fight israelis angolans to fight south africans nicaraguans to fight salvadorans and a dozen other groups to fight another dozen i knew from the beginning that i was training a surrogate russian army to fight a surrogate american one each time id run across an american or two advisors toting the most sophisticated weapons in their arsenal but those contacts were fleeting just once i want to face the americans in an open fight and prove once and for all whos been pumped full of propaganda and who is the best now that im finally getting my chance i cant think of a better group of men to back me up and that includes you sir lurbud was impressed with demanovs speech and his old friends conviction it seems that since the last time i saw you youve become a philosopher i havent met a soldier who wasnt one demanov said seriously so why is it that the shadowy kerikov has paid us so handsomely to be here what were you told by him that he needed a trained commando team ready to fight in the united states as the last part of a very old operation yes and no lurbud said taking a seat on one of the cots you are needed but your presence here is a deviation from a very old operation the current unrest on the islands is a direct result of department sevens most ambitious plan one which almost worked hawaii would have become a soviet puppet if things had gone according to plan were here to mop up and cut our losses demanov could not hide his astonishment i dont understand evad several months ago department seven approached a very wealthy and eccentric local billionaire named takahiro ohnishi and asked him to assist us in an operation called vulcans forge in return for his help kerikov promised to use russian resources to back a coup attempt that would split hawaii away from the rest of the united states of course kerikov never planned to aid ohnishi in any way but his involvement was necessary two different options had to be left open until certain scientific data was obtained concerning a volcanic island forming north of here now that we have this information the coup is no longer necessary and neither is ohnishi unfortunately ohnishi has already started his rebellion he must be stopped thats where we come in demanov interrupted yes were here to eliminate ohnishi for now we wait until kerikov gets in touch there is another aspect of this mission i didnt tell you about a submarine monitoring the volcano to the north kerikov is waiting for word from them before we put our plan into action he lied to his friend in fact the john dory was waiting for word from him im sorry to disappoint you dimitri but you wont get the chance to take on the american army only the guards around ohnishis mansion theyre still americans evad itll be close enough arlington virginia as soon as tish entered the rec room of mercers house she threw herself onto the leather couch with an exhausted sigh you didnt talk much on the way back from the white house she said not looking at mercer you must be exhausted ive been asleep for most of the day but you havent slept in thirtysix hours closer to forty replied mercer from behind the bar he was making a pot of his barely potable coffee want some coffee are you crazy tish sat up and looked at him go to bed youre dead on your feet mercer let the coffeemaker drip directly into a mug before sliding the glass pot under the nozzle he was about to take a sip thought for a moment then poured a dram of scotch into the cup the first taste was sublime im afraid itll be a while before i sleep we have to talk the tone of mercers voice made tish swing her long legs from the couch and stand up she crossed to the bar and took one of the six dark cane stools is something wrong tell me about valery borodin mercer invited nonchalantly i dont know any he saw that tish was flustered by the question tish right now i could have you detained by the fbi for your involvement in this plot i havent because youre jack talbots daughter but im not taking bets on how long i remain silent tell me first how you know about valery i spoke with dr baker at woods hole i remember that old busybody from mozambique she wanted to be everyones den mother figures she would talk tish settled down and turned her deep blue eyes to mercer what do you want to know let me make some assumptions first you know he was a geologist not a marine biologist and that he was in mozambique for a vacation right yes he swore me to secrecy about that though he told me he would be starting a new project soon and that his superiors had allowed him some time off before his reassignment did he tell you who his father is tish was startled by mercers unsettling question not at first did he mention that his father had faked his own death when valery was a boy how do you know about that mercer wasnt about to admit that hed been guessing about valerys candor with tish so he covered his relief with a gruff reply i cant tell you that just answer my questions valery told me that his father had supposedly died in a lab explosion when he was still a baby then about a month before we met valerys father reentered his life acting as if all those years had never passed his father was also a brilliant geologist like val and needed his sons help on some secret government project valery both hated his father for vanishing and loved him for returning he was hurting bad he would cry some nights until i thought his heart would break he was so alone and vulnerable what else did he tell you about his father or his upcoming project not much really he said they would be working together he and his father and that he was excited and frightened did he tell you he planned to leave russia mercers question made tish blanch how did you did he tell you yes but he couldnt do it until the project with his father was completed mercer rubbed his knuckles into his eyes trying to push away the sleep which threatened to overwhelm him he poured another cup of strong coffee this time omitting the scotch tell me what really happened the night the ocean seeker exploded tish said acting confused i already told you about it fury edged mercers voice let me put some things into perspective here tish so you know where im coming from okay she had never experienced such naked anger in her life mercers voice though not raised drilled into her forcing her back in her bar stool your boyfriend and his father are the architects of a plot that could tear apart the very fabric of our country it started in may of when pytor borodin detonated a nuclear device triggering a volcanic chain reaction that created a new metal whose value is incalculable since that time hes ruthlessly murdered everyone who came close to discovering his secret do you remember the list of ships that dave saulman sent me from miami tish looked like she was going to be ill as she nodded that is actually a list of pytor borodins victims i hope you take note that the ocean seeker the ship that blew up around you headed that list borodin is also connected with a possible coup in hawaii that could lead to race riots in every city in america valery borodin and his father have masterminded a plot that could leave this country wallowing in economic and social chaos while the rest of the world prospers mercers mouth was twisted into a disgusted rictus but his eyes were slate hard im not some ultrapatriot who salutes every time i see a flag but i dont want to see our government brought to its knees either you have a choice tell me what i need to know or i call the fbi and you spend the next century or two in a penitentiary with a cellmate named leather tish was sobbing now mercer wanted to take her into his arms brush the tears away and say he was sorry but he couldnt he had to be cruel this is fucking useless he said disgustedly and reached for the portable phone lying on the bar wait tish said meekly please wait mercer poured a shot of brandy into a balloon snifter and placed it in front of tish she sniffed back her tears and sipped the amber liquor what happened the night the ocean seeker was destroyed he repeated harshly around midnight a man came to my cabin id never seen him before he wasnt part of the scientific team or a member of the crew a stowaway he must have been he told me that valery had sent him mercer interrupted again what was he white oriental black he was oriental maybe thirtyfive or forty years old about your size but amazingly strong he told me that i was in danger and had to go with him i tried to question him but he said there was no time just tossed me over his shoulder and carried me up to the deck there was an inflatable raft tied to the stern of the seeker he threw me in and jumped after me about five minutes after he started rowing us away the seeker exploded i swear i dont remember anything after that i think he knocked me out then you never heard russian or saw the design on the stack of the ship that rescued you that part i do remember i must have come to as we were pulled aboard that freighter why didnt you tell me about this before i didnt want anything to spoil valerys chances of escape so i stayed quiet you see the group he was going to work for the one headed by his father was incredibly ruthless he told me that everyone involved with the project was sworn to lifelong secrecy and anyone who tried to leave the group before vals father said they could would be hunted down and killed he told me he knew his father would never let him leave he was bound to the old man forever he said but he was still determined to get away he said his father was completely insane and what they were working on could upset the balance of power all over the world valery told me before he left mozambique that he would contact me just before he escaped i assumed that this rescue was that contact that may be but hes made contact since then too when how tish asked a trace of excitement creeping into her trembling voice the telegram i received the one i thought was from your father must have been sent from him christ knows how he made the connection between us mercer spoke slowly at first but as ideas correlated in his brain he talked faster i was suspicious about your rescue from the ocean seeker it seemed too pat but now it makes sense valery must have ordered an agent to board the ship and save your life when he learned that the seeker was headed toward the volcano with you as a member of the research staff mercer stood silently behind the bar both hands cupped around his coffee mug his eyes had lost their focus as he stared beyond tish at a ken marschall lithograph of the hindenburg just before she exploded over lakehurst new jersey it was one of the only pictures that mercer had gotten around to hanging apart from those in his study he plans to steal his fathers work when he leaves doesnt he thats why he just didnt run away with you in mozambique how did you figure that out it fits with his actions so far and with the brief description you gave of his psychological state he would want to bring something of value with him so that he could provide for the two of you at the same time stealing his fathers work would fulfill his need for revenge against his father for abandoning him you cant know that tish was uncomfortable by mercers accuracy and covered it with an accusation the first reason is obvious hes going to want to be a provider for you and a possible family unlike his father had been to him and that data could make the two of you quite comfortable for the rest of your lives im even more familiar with the second reason remember i said that i used to live in africa when i was younger that i was actually born in the congo well i left there as an orphan my parents moved to rwanda so my father could work on opening a copper mine they were killed during an insurrection in ambushed going to a party on the first night of the fighting both of them were burned alive my nanny a tutsi woman took me back to her village the next day i lived there for a couple of months until the fighting died down then she turned me over to a world health organization team who eventually contacted my fathers parents in vermont even though my grandparents were kind and loving people i hated being with them and i hated my real parents even more for abandoning me i felt utterly betrayed i remember winter nights when id go crosscountry skiing id stop in some meadow miles away from the nearest house and scream at them cursing them accusing them of leaving me on purpose it was the loneliest time in my life if i could foster that much hate against my parents who actually died i can only imagine the hate valery must feel toward his father for leaving him for some government project and then just as casually returning how did you ever get over your parents death tish asked quietly mercers story had touched her deeply an old farmer overheard me one night when i was about sixteen and we talked he was the only person i ever opened up to when id finished my story he told me i was acting stupid and if i kept it up hed slap me around because i was upsetting his dairy cows i guess id received so much sympathy before that i saw myself as a perpetual victim by callously saying i was stupid he made me realize that in fact i was my parents deaths were beyond their control it was never their choice to abandon me finally i could accept that mercer poured a shot of scotch into his coffee then drained the cup in three deep swallows tish didnt say anything but the tension had eased from her neck and shoulders and her blue eyes were misted and soft i owe you an apology mercer said softly i thought you were part of this operation i thought you knew all about it no tish said quietly i didnt do you still love him i dont know tish replied haltingly the time valery and i had together was the most precious in my life but it was so long ago is that shallow of me thats not for me to decide he dodged the question adroitly he took the bar stool next to her and held her slim hands in his i was in love once mercer spoke slowly deliberately i was twentyfive years old taking summer classes at a mining school in england she was four years older than me a police psychologist just getting her start in the london constabulary we spent every moment together that we could i would commute a hundred miles to see her in the city and she took the maximum number of sick days she could without being kicked off the force one weekend toward the end of the summer she was seeing me off at paddington station we had just talked about marriage for the first time mercers voice was barely a whisper but the force of his words carried to the far corners of the room my train was just pulling out from the station suddenly there was gunfire a man had burst into the station and opened up with a machine pistol i watched from the window of the accelerating train as he emptied the clip then dropped the weapon and pulled a revolver by then the police had begun to swarm into the station the gunman grabbed a woman and used her as a shield the revolver screwed into her ear it was a standoff then the woman my possible fiancee started talking to the gunman trying to calm him down get him to surrender it was her job later they found that the man an ira terrorist had taken so much heroin that he probably never heard a word she said she spoke for only a few seconds before the gunman simply pulled the trigger and then turned the gun on himself i saw their bodies fall across each other just as my car pulled out of the station i was too numb to try to get off the train i just sat there as we sped north i never returned to london i didnt even go to her funeral mercers voice trailed off what was her name tory wilks mercer replied evenly youre the first person whos ever heard that story i finished my classes in england and came home as if nothing ever happened im sorry mercer looked at her squarely we never had a chance to start a life together i told you about tory and what i lost because you at least deserve a chance you once loved valery borodin and lost him because of circumstances out of your control mercers voice firmed im going to make sure you have a fair shot at making it work i dont understand its simple mercer smiled warmly the wrenching emotions of a few moments earlier safely tucked back where they belonged again he was his normal sardonic self im going to help him escape how you dont know where he is dont i though mercer raised a mocking eyebrow i happen to know down to the inch where he is at this very moment where excitement raised tishs voice an octave all in good time mercer replied vaguely ive got some things to figure out first why dont you take that nap you wanted tish saw that she could get nothing further out of him so she went to the couch she looked over at mercer and saw he was already scratching away at a note pad with a fountain pen she tucked the normandie lap robe up around her chin and for the first time in a long time started considering a real life with valery ten minutes later tish sat up suddenly mercer he looked up from the pad his normally dark complexion was drained and his wide set eyes were narrowed by exhaustion i was thinking valery took a risk to have me rescued from the ocean seeker and put you in contact with me right well who tried to kill me in the hospital mercer stared at her for a moment his weary mind grinding away at her question he tore the top sheet of paper from the pad crumpled it up and tossed it into the plastic trash can behind the bar back to the drawing board several hours later as the sun ambered the room with its dying rays mercer finally put down his pen drank the last sip of his second pot of coffee and stood for a stretch he had written twelve pages of notes and made eighteen phone calls tish was still asleep on the couch mercer knuckled the kinks out of his lower back and squeezed his eyes tight trying to clear his sleepdeprived brain the caffeine he had drunk left him feeling weak and with a pounding headache he pulled dick hennas card from his wallet and dialed his office number henna himself answered the phone mr henna its philip mercer do you have anything new mercer liked the squat director for his bluntness i need to get to hawaii mercer stated flatly im afraid thats impossible two hours ago all communications from the islands stopped no telephones radio or television all aircraft that could be routed to other destinations were turned back our reports from pearl harbor say the mob has started taking potshots at soldiers ive gotten unconfirmed reports from ham radio operators that honolulu is under martial law by authority of mayor takamora and that national guard troops are shooting any white face they see oh jesus mercer breathed the fucking lunatic has started it it appears so theres no way to get you out there even if i wanted to listen i have some theories that if true can clear this up in twentyfour hours but i have to get to hawaii mercer wouldnt allow his horror at hennas news to dissuade him dr mercer i prefer mister or just plain mercer really most phds i know flaunt their titles i only use mine when im trying to get dinner reservations henna chuckled i can respect that anyway the president has authorized a covert action against ohnishi in light of his involvement with this coup jesus mercer was shocked thats a stupid mistake ohnishis just a pawn in this whole thing taking him out wont accomplish anything you know something we dont henna asked tiredly yes i do but its going to cost you at least a ticket to that amphibious assault ship stationed near hawaii thats extortion extortion is such a genteel word mr henna i prefer blackmail what if i said i can hand over the mastermind of the entire operation im listening i wont talk until you guarantee transport to that ship christ mercer could almost see henna throw his hands up in exasperation all right ill get you out there now what have you got for the next twenty minutes mercer spoke without pause and henna listened hard you got proof for any of this henna asked when mercer finished not one single shred but it all fits together i said it before mercer if you ever want another job the bureau would love to have you do you think the american civil liberties union would stand to have an fbi agent making accusations like i just made shit theyd skin us both alive henna chuckled again youre right ive got a meeting with the president in an hour ill take your proposal to him the only way i can get you out there is as an observer nothing more thatll be fine lied mercer smoothly i really cant ask for more call me back when youre finished with the president a minute after hanging up the phone mercer was between the sheets of his bed despite his battered bodys need for sleep he tossed and turned for twenty minutes before drifting into unconsciousness the pacific unlike most conventional helicopters the kamov ka lacked a stabilizing rotor in the stern rather it had two main rotors stacked on top of each other their counterrotating blades kept the tiny copter from gyrating through the skies the craft was much noisier than normal helicopters because of this arrangement though the rotor noise couldnt drown out her two radial engines mounted in pods outside the cramped cabin the ka codenamed hoodlum by nato pounded through the clear skies at one hundred knots near her maximum cruising speed the sea below was an azure plane which rolled into infinity the august rose mother ship to the small chopper was nearly two hundred miles astern and steaming hard for taipei a gift to the taiwanese ambassador dr borodin had ascertained the precise location of his islands birth so the sophisticated gear on board the freighter was no longer needed the hoodlum had been stored inside a huge packing crate on the deck of the refrigerator ship her double set of rotor blades folded back along the twin booms of her tail the chopper had remained hidden long after the freighter had started her long journey westward away from the volcano which was now no more than a few days from broaching the surface already dense sulfurladen steam clouds clung to the surface of the sea marking the eruption with an operational range of miles in her unitarian configuration the hoodlum remained on the august rose until she was nearly twothirds that distance away from the rising volcano only then had the pilot lifted from the deck with his two passengers now three hours after takeoff the pilot was beginning to sweat not from the humid air that whipped through the tiny cabin but from fear the antiquated radar on the twentyfiveyearold craft could no longer detect the august rose not that they had fuel to reach her in any case they were alone five thousand feet above an empty sea the pilot looked back at his two passengers the older one apparently slept while the younger one watched the ocean far below the earphones over his head kept his fine hair from blowing about but the wind worried at his olive drab flight suit the pilot turned back to his instruments scanning fuel altitude speed and course in a quick glance before he gazed again at the endless horizon valery borodin turned away from the open door he touched his father on the shoulder and pytors eyes cleared instantly we should be only about ten kilometers away the pilot overheard the comment through the intercom and replied ten kilos away from what were at least three hundred kilometers away from hawaii and running out of fuel do you mind telling me what this is all about of course take us down to about two hundred meters first the pilot shrugged and complied he doubted these two men were planning their suicides so they must have a plan relieved the pilot put the ka in a gutwrenching dive the rotors clawed at the air as they drove the chopper toward the surface of the sea in an expert maneuver the pilot pulled back on the collective pitch and leveled the craft at exactly two hundred meters he looked back and was disappointed to see that his passengers appeared bored at his antics and expertise two hundred meters sir the elder borodin pulled a cylinder from the pocket of his flight suit the yellow plastic case was no more than three inches in diameter and about a foot long he pressed a red button at the top of the cylinder and casually threw it out the open door of the helicopter what was that the pilot asked a highfrequency transponder valery answered for his father fly a onekilometer box pattern and in a moment youll see what were up to the chopper banked sharply to starboard as the pilot began running his boxes he had completed two kilometerlong legs when he saw a disturbance in the sea the limpid blue water was frothing as if leviathan itself was surfacing the pilot brought the chopper to a hover near the boiling water the maddened sea grew more turgid until the bow of a ship burst from the waves water streaming off her black hull she rose swiftly revealing her forward deck studded with cranes a boxy superstructure crowned with a single funnel her aft deck and finally her jack staff sporting a limp panamanian flag it was like watching the death throes of a sinking ship only in reverse water poured through her scuppers with the force of fire hoses as the ship wallowed in the frenzied swells of her own creation after a minute the ship settled to an even keel the waves dispersing quickly jesus the pilot muttered that borodin said with triumph is the watchdog of ocean freight and cargo and our destination the steamer john dory if the pilot had had time to notice the decoration on the ships funnel as he brought the hoodlum toward the landing pad aft deck of this extraordinary vessel he would have seen a black circle surrounding a yellow dot the hoodlum settled on the rolling deck with deceptive ease the pilot was truly a professional the deckhands tossed chains around the four wheels of the copter and signaled him to cut power an instant later the blades slowed to a stop sagging like palm fronds valery borodin jumped from the craft followed a moment later by his wheezing father the elder scientists skin had gone a chalky gray and his breath was short both men paused waiting for the pilot to join them what in the hell is this the pilot nearly shouted his ears still ringing from the long flight one moment and ill let the captain explain borodin turned to the crew chief and made a cutting motion across his throat the chief waved his acknowledgment and signaled his crew they quickly unshackled the landing gear and unceremoniously pushed the hoodlum into the sea the chopper bobbed in the water for a few minutes her rotor blades scratching at the paintwork of the john dory before she filled with water and vanished the pilot gave the tired little craft an ironic salute as he watched her go under if he was bothered by the intentional destruction of his helicopter it didnt show you wont be leaving me that way valery borodin remarked casually as he turned away valery stood as if hed just witnessed a horrible accident his eyes wide and his mouth hanging slackly how had he guessed valery questioned himself how could he know i wanted to escape using the helicopter pytor answered his sons silent question kerikov contacted me after you tried to pressure him into rescuing that girl from the american research vessel the plight of the beached whales weeks before and the effort to find out the cause of their deaths had been given a great deal of media attention that was picked up aboard the august rose as she was monitoring the volcano the radio reports about the noaa mission had been very thorough including interviews with some of the key scientific personnel valery recalled with pride that tish had been brilliant during hers only he and his father knew that the ocean seeker was sailing toward her destruction as she embarked on her survey in a gamble born of desperation valery had told kerikov that if tish talbot wasnt rescued he would destroy the volcano with the seismic charges stored aboard the august rose kerikov wasnt impressed with your threat valery and quite frankly neither was i but i knew if she wasnt saved you would try to sabotage our mission so he had her rescued at my request you looked so smug when we heard on the radio that she was rescued borodin laughed shortly and looked over the stillwet rail of the john dory at the small patch of bubbles that marked the grave of the chopper you wont be leaving anytime soon i still need you russia still needs you that was the longest speech pytor had addressed to valery in the year since their reunion it left valery with such a cold blinding hatred that his mouth felt the searing acids of the bile roiling in his knotted stomach his fingers had gone white and bloodless as they curled into fists so tight that his bones seemed ready to tear through his skin pytor borodin saw none of his sons reaction he had turned to greet the captain of the john dory valery ambled toward them his shoulders hunched and his trembling hands thrust deeply into the pockets of his flight suit welcome aboard dr borodin captain nikolai zwenkov said extending a hand im sorry i couldnt meet you on the landing pad but i had to see that the ship was trimmed properly borodin shook the proffered hand and introduced his son and the chopper pilot zwenkov was an ethnic georgian and spoke russian with an oafish accent but he had the look of a stern uncompromising professional we must hurry and submerge once again i dont want to give the american spy satellites a chance to spot us the captain led the three men into the ships superstructure there were no bulkheads or companionways no cabins or bridge the boxy structure was only a facade bolted to struts protruding from the rounded conning tower of a submarine the sides and main deck of the john dory were also just plates of steel welded to the hull of the sub the cargo cranes winches and booms merely props on the surface from any range over two hundred yards the freighter looked legitimate giving no indication of her deadly secret within its like a kboat the helicopter pilot remarked his eyes roaming the dank interior of the john dorys superstructure referring to vessels used by germany during world war i they resembled freighters but in fact were disguised gunboats they would lure their victims within range with bogus distress calls then reveal their large cannons hidden behind secret plates in their hulls thousands of allied tonnage paid the ultimate price for falling into their traps i like to think that this ship is a little more sophisticated borodin replied rubbing the insides of his arms but the principle is the same come pytor you look tired from your journey the captain led them through a hatch and into the working part of the vessel an old foot victor class nuclear attack submarine zwenkov moved through the maze of pipes narrow hatches and equipment with the agility of a child twenty years in the soviet submarine service had taught him how to avoid banging himself aboard these cramped vessels he led borodin and his son straight to his cabin after dropping the chopper pilot off with a subordinate valery sat silently while the captain and his father chatted zwenkov would have killed his beloved tish talbot had kerikov not been able to sneak an agent on board the ocean seeker to save her he wanted to beat zwenkov for his anonymous barbarity yet valery couldnt fully blame zwenkov for he was just a soldier doing his duty following orders the man behind those orders was his father a cramp seized valerys gut as he thought how close he had been to escaping the hoodlum would have been the perfect way out of the demented world he found himself in valery was a man of science dedicated to reason and thought yet his father had corrupted that pure world into a perverse dimension of murder and betrayal and unfathomable cruelty hatred boiled within him hatred for his fathers almost murdering the woman he loved hatred for the untold murders in the past hatred for abandoning a frightened little boy all those years before only a few more days and it would all be over if he didnt manage to escape to rejoin the woman whod been his source of strength since his father had reentered his life then his only other option was suicide valery promised himself that he would not die alone that decided he found that his head had cleared his mind was sharp and focused as he leaned forward to listen to the captain and his father all i know is kerikov radioed and said to suspend all activity until further orders we are to remain on station submerged but with the antennae array extended until we are contacted but why it makes no sense we should make preparations to claim our prize dr borodin was speaking more to himself than the others he rubbed his neck and throat absently i radioed kerikov from the august rose he knows that the volcano falls outside americas twohundredmile limit it belongs to the first nation that discovers it by rights it belongs to us there is one more thing zwenkovs rumbling voice sounded almost apologetic kerikov told me not to reveal this to you but ive known you too long for secrets he ordered me to load a thirtykiloton nuclear warhead onto an ssn siren missile and make it ready to launch borodin took this news without emotion it was as if his mind had turned in on itself probing within to find answers the hum of the subs airconditioning was the only sound in the spartan cabin for many long seconds finally borodin looked first at zwenkov and then at his son he must mean to destroy the volcano but why borodin appeared more concerned with kerikovs motives than with the fact that his lifes work might be destroyed in a nuclear fireball there must be a leak somewhere in our security he would have to destroy the entire project to maintain secrecy dont you understand that kerikov has doublecrossed you anger made valerys voice sound like a hiss he never had any intention of turning over the volcano to the government hes used you since taking over department seven hoping one day to sell your work right out from under you the old regime is gone for good the russia you threw your life away for no longer exists the world has changed since the s but you never took the time to notice vulcans forge would have only worked under a stalinist regime and that has been gone for decades this whole operation was doomed the moment gorbachev started glasnost and perestroika give up your old mans dreams and start living in reality the russian government would never attempt to occupy an island so close to american soil with one hand while the other was begging for economic aid kerikov knows this and hes made some sort of contingency plan how can you be so sure valery you are only my assistant youve not been told everything borodin dismissed the truth so easily because he really didnt understand it give it up father there is nothing more and we both know it valery said sadly he saw for the first time how frail and weak his father looked his eyes were rheumy behind his glasses and his once stocky frame had withered to a skeletal apparition borodins skin had the pallor and texture of modeling clay it will work out borodin said so softly that his lips barely moved suddenly his body went rigid his eyes snapped open as if they were ready to burst from their sockets his lips pulled back revealing his chipped and stained teeth in a deaths head smile he convulsed once gasping for a quick breath before once again being grasped by the immense pain that tore through his body his fingers crawled up his torso as if grasping his chest to calm the faltering heart within pytor convulsed again his heels kicking up from the floor as he made one last struggle and then he was gone borodins prostate muscle had relaxed in death the smell of urine hung heavily in the cramped office zwenkov had seen enough death in his career to know that borodin was beyond resuscitation he crossed himself and leaned forward to close the old mans staring eyes i am sorry he said quietly to valery valery looked at his father for a long time before reaching out to touch the wrinkled hand its funny so am i death had cut through all of his hatred at the end leaving him clean inside as if reborn his bitterness had vanished with his fathers dying gasp and he knew it could not have been any other way even if hed escaped with the data from the august rose he wouldve been forever plagued with this inner demon but not anymore the demon was put to rest forever arlington virginia the insistent ringing of the phone dragged mercer from a deep deathlike sleep his hand groped across the nightstand knocking the tiffany clock to the floor then found the phone and swung the receiver to his head hlo his tongue was cemented to the roof of his mouth with congealed saliva mercer dick henna mercer came a little more awake opening his eyes he was startled to see that night had descended the twin skylights above his bed were black rectangles in the ceiling he glanced across his balconied bedroom and saw that his whole house was dark tish too must have gone to sleep yes mr henna whats up mercer ran his tongue around his mouth and grimaced at the taste the president accepted your proposal and believe it or not paul barnes from the cia backed you up thats surprising i got the impression i was at the bottom of his christmas card list kind of surprised me too but when it comes to the job barnes puts his personal feelings second the commando assault that the president ordered will be postponed for at least twelve hours so what happens now mercer realized that his body was bathed in sweat his sheets were a damp tangle around his legs a jet will be ready for you at andrews air force base in about an hour and a half you should be aboard the aircraft carrier kitty hawk by five tomorrow morning mercer glanced at his scarred and scratched tag heuer chronometer okay ill be at andrews in about an hour mercer swung his legs off the bed the cool air evaporating the sweat making the dark coarse hair on his chest and legs tingle ill meet you at the main gate with the recon photos you requested thanks dick mercer used the directors given name for the first time he cut the connection and dialed harry whites number after twenty rings he hung up and dialed tinys tiny told him to hold for a second while harry came back from the restroom harry are you up for a little more babysitting that you mercer yeah harry can you come over and watch tish again why whats she doing sleeping in the nude yeah id love to watch that harry said with mock lasciviousness ill be there in about fifteen minutes mercer hung up plucked the clock from the floor and straightened the silver framed photograph of his mother that was the only other item on the nightstand he flipped a bedside switch and light from three round japanese lanterns bathed the room in a milky glow he stood up and moaned the punishment his body had taken in the past few days was taking its toll his shoulders were bruised a rich purple from his scrape against the metro train and his feet and lower legs still stung from his leap into the potomac the cuts on his face had scabbed over but they pulled every time mercer moved his jaw there was a livid red weal on his calf where the bullet had grazed him in new york jesus christ he muttered as he headed for the bathroom he took a steaming shower popped a handful of tylenol and dressed quickly in baggy black pants and a longsleeved black tshirt his socks and desert boots were also black feeling slightly more refreshed but by no means normal he spun down the old rectory spiral stairs to the ground floor his feet gliding over the steps because his cooking skills fell far short of gourmet his kitchen cabinets were nearly barren it took him ten frustrating minutes to make a mangled runny omelet using his last three eggs a slice of american cheese a couple of cocktail onions pilfered from the bar and half a can of tuna fish he carried the plate of food into his office letting his hand brush against the large bluish stone on the credenza near the door as he entered setting the plate on his desk he turned on the green shaded lamp with a huge chunk of omelet stuffed in his mouth he took a key from under a reference volume of mineralogy in the shelf behind his desk the key slid into the oiled lock of the closet adjacent to the offices entrance and the oak doors opened smoothly in the closet were a fire retardant safe a twisted and blackened piece of duraluminum that had once been a support girder in the airship hindenburg and a multidrawer cabinet which housed over a hundred valuable geologic samples he had collected through the years on the floor of the closet sat an antique steamer trunk filled with souvenirs from his mission into iraq mercer dragged the heavy trunk out of the closet and propped open the lid a heckler and koch mpa sat on top of the pile of equipment the west german manufactured machine pistol was a vicious weapon capable of firing mm ammunition at over six hundred rounds per minute mercer lifted the nasty little gun and cleared the breach to ensure the action was still smooth then set it aside and retrieved a beretta automatic pistol since replacing the venerable colt as the primary sidearm of the us army the beretta had more than proved its worth in combat conditions the pistol was in pristine condition like the h ampk the next item mercer pulled from the trunk was the heaviest by far a nylon combat harness a thick belt supported by suspender straps the holster for the beretta was attached to the suspenders so it would rest under his left shoulder for a quick draw and several nylon pouches full of clips for the machine pistol hung from the belt a sixinchlong gerber knife hung inverted from the suspenders the final touches were a basic first aid kit and field compass in a slim padded case mercer slid the beretta into its holster and stuffed the combat rig into a light nylon duffel along with the machine pistol then added a few other pieces of equipment he zipped the bag shoved the nearly empty trunk back into the closet and locked the doors he stashed the key back under the thick book and took one last weapon from his desk first making sure it was loaded taking another big bite of his eggs mercer promised himself hed never make another tuna omelet again mercer tish called from the kitchen im back here tish entered the study wearing one of mercers penn state sweatshirts it came down to the midpoint of her smooth thighs and thrust up proudly over her unrestrained breasts with her tousled hair and sleepy eyes she looked vulnerable and incredibly sexy that sweatshirt looks a hell of a lot better on you than it does on me mercer remarked with a grin dont even look at me im a mess tish ran a hand through her hair to get it away from her face she noticed the duffel bag i heard you get up whats going on im leaving for a couple of days i think i can finally put an end to everything and with a little luck bring back valery borodin for you tishs eyes brightened i was thinking earlier and couldnt believe how badly i want to see him again give me a couple of days and hes yours mercer was genuinely happy for her lets go up to the bar i need some of my famous coffee whats that tish asked as she turned to leave the study her gaze had fallen on the large stone near the door my good luck piece mercer remarked caressing the rippled surface its a piece of kimberlite given to me by a director of debeers as thanks for saving his life after a cavein in south africa kimberlite is the most common type of matrix stone found in diamond mines he explained by itself its worthless but nearly every diamond mined in the past hundred years has been found within a volcanic kimberlite pipe mercer didnt tell her that this piece of kimberlite was far from worthless embedded in the underside of the stone was an approximately eightcarat diamond of startling bluewhite color uncut it was worth about a quarter of a million dollars and if he ever had the stone finished who could tell its value the door bells chimed announcing harrys arrival while mercer was making coffee harry let himself in and entered the bar through the library he needed the doorjamb for support where are you going a costume party as a ninja mercer looked down at his black attire and shrugged actually the theme is your favorite environmental catastrophe im an oil spill what do you think i think youre full of shit harry replied seating himself at the bar the cigarette in his mouth jumped with each word hi harry tish greeted the old man with a kiss on his gray stubbled cheek you lied to me mercer you said shed be naked tish didnt understand the comment but already knew harry and mercer well enough to not be offended give me a drink will ya mercer deftly poured jack daniels and ginger ale actually im going to put another pin in my map he jerked his thumb at the pinstudded map behind the bar what color clear mercer replied harry knew that the clear pin in iraq had been some sort of covert government mission and that the one in rwanda denoted a violent episode in his friends life his whiskeydulled eyes became a little sharper where you heading im not supposed to tell you hawaii mercer smiled so i wont so i guess the whole thing comes full circle harry said softly looking at tish mercer glanced at his watch and hoisted a nylon bag over his shoulder ive got to go give me your truck keys harry fished the keys to his battered ford pickup from his pocket and tossed them to mercer mercer snatched them from the air ill be back in a few days keep an eye on things he gave tish a light kiss and told her you be good and dont excite old harry here on his way out of the house mercer paused in the library and smiled wickedly at the stack of framed pictures on the floor the top photo an x showed mercer and another man standing on the crawler track of a huge caterpillar dn bulldozer the handwritten caption read mercer you did it again this time i really owe you one it was signed daniel tanaka the logo stenciled on the engine cowling of the ton dozer was the stylized hard hat and dragline of ohnishi minerals debt paid danny boy in the black night the sentry post at andrews air force base in morningside maryland looked like a highway toll booth several small glass buildings supported a metal roof that stretched across the entire road and bathed it in fluorescent lights mercer brought harrys pickup to a stop the ancient brakes squealing like nails drawn across a blackboard the guard an africanamerican barely out of his teens regarded the decrepit truck with suspicion until dick henna standing behind him placed a hand on his shoulder through the open window of the truck mercer heard henna reassure the young corporal henna exited the small armoredglass guardhouse walked to the passenger side of the pickup opened the door and slid in without comment mercer started rolling forward i know that until recently you drove a jaguar convertible henna said at length his voice nearly drowned by the blasting exhaust i expected your second car to be a little better than this mercer coughed as the ford backfired and an acrid cloud of exhaust was blown into the trucks cab he grinned something old something new something borrowed something blue henna finished the rhyme got ya but i think under all the rust this truck is brown im not sure mercer looked at the large manila envelope in hennas hand is that for me yes henna set it on the seat between them two of the infrared photos from the spy plane and contractors drawings of the homes of takahiro ohnishi and his assistant kenji what the hell do you want this stuff for you know youre only going as an advisor and observer absolutely mercer agreed quickly but when the assault occurs i need some material to advise with right turn left here henna directed as they drove further into the sprawling complex youre one of the most ingenious men ive ever met mercer but ive yet to figure out how youre going to get off the inchon and onto hawaii mercer looked at him with mock astonishment his face the picture of cherubic innocence perish the thought a cruise on an assault ship has always been a dream of mine i have no intention of leaving the watchful eye of the navy seriously dick you need someone out there who knows the whole situation and also understands something about bikinium i dont think abe jacobs is up to it besides i found out about this whole mess and i just want to see it finished henna did not respond are you buying any of this no im not henna grunted good because thats about the worst line of bull ive ever thrown mercer looked at henna the streetlights casting his face in either blinding light or impenetrable shadow if you know im planning to get off the inchon as soon as i can and get to the islands why are you letting me go simple i know youve withheld information from me there was no anger in hennas voice and that information is the key to ending this whole affair youre the only person who knows what the hell is going on and suicidal enough to try and stop it i appreciate your honesty and confidence replied mercer sardonically but dying isnt on my agenda of things to do and see on my hawaiian vacation turn left mercer swung the pickup and drove parallel to one of the bases steelreinforced concrete runways the blue lights which bordered the tarmac flashed by in a solid blur in the distance a jet roared off into the night they approached several massive hangars the powerful lights around the buildings reflecting against their corrugated metal sides men in blue overalls walked purposely in and around the hangars carrying tools binders and other paraphernalia swing into the first hangar henna directed mercer slowed passing several mobile generators used to jumpstart the jet fighters he pulled the truck into the hangar and stopped in a spot indicated by a grizzled chief master sergeant the hash marks on his uniform sleeve denoting years in the service ran from his wrist to his shoulder henna shook the chiefs hand everything all set yes sir the chief said sir the way most men say impotent either not at all or never above a bare whisper theres an extra flight suit in the office and a kc stratotankers ready to take off in omaha another is standing by near san francisco why the air force is paying for the transfer of a civilian in a navy aircraft ill never know mercer had seen the jet when he first drove into the hangar but now took a moment to study his ride to the pacific the mcdonnell douglas fa hornet rested lightly on her landing gear as if ready to pounce she was like a leopard seated on its haunches immeasurable power coiled up like a spring the hard points under her razoredged wings were bare of weapons though two drop tanks clung there like fat leeches mercer took in her clean lines the sharp needle nose the twin outwardcanted tails the six stubby barrels of her general electric gatling gun tucked under the canopy she had two seats which meant she was a training version ever been in a fighter before the chief asked with a patronizing smile no replied mercer oh bubbas going to love you mercer looked down at the chief he was a good foot taller than the air force man but the chiefs wide shoulders and hard thick gut made them appear physically equal bubba howdy said a voice that came straight from a dirt farm in southern georgia mercer whirled around the speaker stood near an office tucked against one wall of the cavernous hangar the mans hightech flight suit bulged where pads and air bladders would squeeze his body to keep him from passing out in the highg world of the modern dog fighter the pilot had a baby face and thin mangled hair and when he smiled mercer could see that a front tooth was missing the helmet in his hand had bubba stenciled between stripes of red white and blue the man looked nothing like mercers mental picture of the pilot billy ray young the pilot extended a bony hand jist call me bubba he grinned around the plug of tobacco firmly held in one cheek mercer they shook hands henna couldnt help but chuckle at the pallor that had crept into mercers face kinda glad to have me some company on the flight bubba said i been to the stockade fer a spell and didnt talk to many folks there mercer looked over at henna the fbi director said nothing but his eyes sparkled with amusement come with me ayll git ya geared up mercer followed the pilot to the office billy ray kept up a solid monologue about his term in the stockade for flying his hornet under the golden gate bridge his accent was so thick that mercer understood maybe a third of the pilots speech billy ray showed mercer how to fit into the constricting flight suit and cinch up the various harnesses mercer felt like the michelin man strapping on a girdle back out in the hangar dick henna hefted mercers nylon duffel bag bit heavy for a change of underwear my toilet case is lead lined mercer grabbed the bag from him a mechanic took the duffel from mercer and stored it in the area meant for the rounds of mm gatling gun ammunition he closed the hatch to the ammo bay and secured it with a special screwdriver patting the fuselage affectionately before walking away giddyup there mr mercer wes got a schedule to keep billy ray young was already in the hornets front seat mercer dont worry about him henna said hes one of the best pilots in the navy his record during the gulf war was unparalleled is that supposed to make me feel better mercer asked no not really henna smiled and extended his right hand once you get to the carrier a helicopter will transfer you to the inchon ill get in touch with you there good luck thanks dick mercer walked over to the aircraft and mounted the metal steps to the cockpit the chief personally strapped mercer into the ejector seat briefly outlining the fifty things mercer shouldnt do or touch while in the aircraft any parting thoughts chief yeah you puke in here and ill have the deck officer on the kitty hawk make you clean it up the chief slapped mercer on the top of the helmet and scrambled down the mobile ladder yawl set billy ray asked over the intercom lets do it bubba mercer said tiredly suddenly the five hours of sleep he had gotten earlier didnt seem like enough but he doubted he would sleep much on this flight billy ray closed the canopy and fired up the two ge f turbofans the sixteenthousandpound thrust engines sounded like banshees as he brought them to full power for an instant and then throttled them back again a tow tractor came out of the nights gloom and a lineman attached the tow bar to the front landing gear with a slight jerk the tractor edged the hornet out onto the bases apron over the helmet intercom mercer listened to the chatter between the tower and several aircraft in the area when billy ray finally spoke to ground traffic control his accent nearly vanished his voice was crisp and professional and mercer began to feel a little better about the flight and the pilot you barf easy on carnival rides mr mercer but not much better dont worry about me bubba the tractor stopped just short of the runway and the driver leapt from the vehicle and unhooked the tow bar billy ray eased open the throttles and the twentyfiveton aircraft began to judder under the massive power of her own engines they taxied to the end of the runway and paused waiting for clearance from the tower the runway was a twomilelong ribbon racing off into the night edged by blue lights which seemed to converge at the distant horizon when they got clearance billy ray let out an earsplitting rebel yell and jammed the twin throttles to their stops simultaneously engaging the afterburners thirtyfoot cones of bluewhite flame knifed from the two turbofans as raw fuel was dumped into their exhaust the hornet reared back on her pneumatic landing gear as she started to rocket down the runway mercer was forced back into his seat as the aircraft accelerated at two hundred knots billy ray yanked back on the stick and the plane arrowed into the black sky mercers pressure suit automatically squeezed his chest ensuring that blood didnt drain from his head and cause a blackout he held onto the seat arms as he watched the altimeter needle wind around like a hyperactive clock billy ray didnt level out until they reached thirtytwo thousand feet and it took several minutes for mercers stomach to catch up to the hurtling hornet sixty seconds later there was a jarring explosion and the thunderous roar of the engines died abruptly mercer thought for sure that billy ray had torn the guts out of her but then realized they had just broken the sound barrier what ya think of her billy ray asked in the eerie silence i cant wait until united uses these for their shuttle service mercer retorted does she have a name sure does billy ray said with pride mabel your mother no my pappys prize heifer the pilot replied matteroffactly mercer slumped into his seat as much as he could and rested his head against the canopy he closed his eyes for a moment and realized that sleeping would be a lot easier than he had first imagined the only irritation was billy rays offkey humming of dixie he was jolted awake once during the trip between washington and the west coast that waking was the worst moment of sheer terror he had ever experienced it was still dark outside and he could clearly make out the running lights of another aircraft that was so close he couldnt see the tips of its wings billy ray seemed bent on ramming it they were at subsonic speed but the other plane was rapidly filling the hornets canopy mercer braced himself for the impending collision but billy ray tucked his f under the other lumbering plane with maybe twentyfive feet to spare rapt mercer watched in fascination as a spectral boom came out of the murky night and into the halo of light around the fighter only when the boom attached itself to the tube just forward and right of the hornets cockpit did he realize that the fighter was being refueled in flight it took several minutes for the kc tanker to fill the fs tanks as the hose retracted toward the tanker residual drops of fuel froze in the rarefied atmosphere and flashed past the cockpit like tracer fire thanks for the nipple this baby was hungry billy ray said to the crew of the stratotanker he waggled the wings of the nimble fighter dipped below the slowmoving kc and eased the throttles forward an instant later the tanker was miles behind them and the hornet was approaching the speed of sound once the f began flying faster than the roar of her engines and again the cockpit was silent mercer rested his head against the plexiglas canopy it took another few minutes for his heart to slow enough for him to fall asleep mv john dory the radio operator tossed his earphones onto his gray steel desk under the massed banks of communications equipment he nodded to his assistant and hurried from the cramped room a hastily scrawled page in his hand the john dory was running under the ruddy glow of battle lights as she had for most of this patrol but his little world was bright because of the lights on the sophisticated electronic radio gear it took a few moments for his eyes to adjust to the gloom in the rest of the transformed submarine he passed through the small aperture of a watertight door and into the subs control center the two planesmen sat to the left in airlinestyle seats the yokes controlling the rudders and dive planes completed the aircraft cockpit facsimile behind them the three men who monitored the ballast controls stood in front of a panel studded with two dozen valves and pressure gauges the system was archaic dating back to the earliest type of subs from the first world war but still effective only the very latest soviet subs utilized the modern ballast control computers that the americans had been using since the s the fire control station was to the left it was the most modern piece of equipment on the boat a twelveyearold computer copied from the american uyk command and control computer the uyk was the first type of c ampc computer utilized on the american los angeles class attack subs the russian copy had been installed during the refitting of the john dory in vladivostok at the back of the control center four engineers monitored the ancient reactor at the stern of the boat their eyes and fingers never leaving the confusing mass of lights dials and switches an identical panel was located in the reactor room and the two stations were electronically linked this way there were actually eight pairs of eyes watching for any danger from the radioactive furnace burning away under its decaying shield of lead and concrete the boats periscope hung from the low ceiling like a steel stalactite it acted as the only visible means to ensure the outside still existed once the sub dove beneath the waves the passive and active sonars only reporting the echoes of the real world captain message from matrushka the code name for ivan kerikov referred to the intricate nesting dolls so popular with generations of russian children it was a fitting code for such a secretive and multitiered man captain zwenkov was hunched over the weapons officers console reviewing firing solutions for the subs siren missile in case it was needed against the volcano not more than twenty miles distant this is good boris the captain praised his weapons officer and slapped him on the shoulder before turning to the lanky radio man what have you got message from matrushka comrade captain the radio operator repeated handing over the sheet of paper he stood at attention waiting for the captains response zwenkov held the flimsy paper to one of the steelcaged battle lights and squinted to make out the writing he grunted several times as he read it through he then folded the paper carefully and slid it into a pocket of his stiffnecked tunic bowman take us to periscope depth zwenkovs orders were quiet but clear but do not use the ballast take us up with engines alone turning for two knots were not in any hurry sonar secure the active systems i dont want an accidental ping zwenkov looked around the dim bridge as the men went about their jobs satisfied with their performance he picked up a hand mike and dialed in the ships intercom this is the captain speaking his voice was barely above a whisper crewmen not directly near a speaker had to strain to hear him i know weve been rigged for silent running for a long time but the need for this precaution is almost over we will be leaving station within twentyfour hours and heading for home we cannot afford to be lax during these crucial hours now is the time to redouble our efforts there is an american carrier in the area as well as an amphibious assault ship i dont need to remind you that there will be a fastattack sub protecting the carrier and their sonar can hear a hammer drop two hundred miles away they do not know were here and i dont want to give them a chance to find us all conversations are to be in whispers there will be no music in the mess rooms and any necessary repairs must first be cleared by me personally all scheduled maintenance is suspended until further orders that is all he hung the mike back in its cradle the men on the bridge looked at him with a mixture of anticipation and excitement apart from sinking the noaa ship a week ago the cruise had been long and monotonous the tension of remaining as quiet as possible for weeks at a time could destroy the nerves of even the best submariner and theyd been at it for seven long months now the captain was promising the men that they would be going home soon and the anticipation creased their faces into smiles the threat of an american hunterkiller sub in the area only served to spice that anticipation after all they were sailors in the russian navy and their job was fighting not waiting captain zwenkov turned to the young radio operator preset your system to alternate channel b every two hours starting at midnight you will receive a flash message the message will be the word green repeated for five seconds sometime tomorrow night the code word will be red it may not come during the twohour cycle so be prepared at all times every time you receive the message tell me understood yes comrade captain the radio operator saluted smartly and turned away captain periscope depth the dive officer reported quietly all stop all stop aye extend the ultralow frequency antenna but dont let it broach the surface ulf extending ulf antenna depth one meter engineer disengage reactor bring her down to five percent power five percent aye although a nuclear reactor operates much more quietly than diesel electric propulsion the powerful pumps used to keep the containment vessel cooled emitted a distinct whirling sound that a trained sonarman could distinguish over the noisy clutter of the open sea by reducing power to the barest minimum zwenkov lowered his chances of detection by the lurking american sub and its verywelltrained sonarmen anton zwenkov said as he ran a hand through his short gray hair in response his executive officer stepped away from his station near the glasstopped plotting table just aft of the periscope find young dr borodin and send him to my cabin yes captain the exec left the bridge heading aft to the ward room where he felt sure he would find the scientist zwenkov went to his cabin just forward of the bridge from the locked drawer of his plasticveneered desk he removed a halffull bottle of vodka and a cheap glass tumbler emblazoned with a picture of the immense television tower in east berlin the glass reminded him of his one vacation outside the soviet republics to a city as bleak and depressing as his native tbilisi in georgia he poured a half inch of the liquor into the glass shot it down in one fiery swallow and returned glass and bottle to the drawer of course alcohol was strictly forbidden on all russian vessels especially on submarines but he figured a captain should have some privileges a single shot once a week was all he usually allowed himself though this week hed taken three the second drink he had taken soon after two seamen carried the corpse of pytor borodin to the subs nearly empty freezer come he barked after a knock on his door valery entered wearing a borrowed officers utility uniform he looked like a recruitment poster dark handsome features trim athletic body held erect with just a trace of tragedy around him that lent an air of mystery understandably zwenkov had not seen much of him since his fathers death sit down please zwenkov invited would you care for some tea valery demurred with a hand gesture as he swung himself into a chair next to where his father had died he eyed the other chair for a moment before turning to the captain you wanted to see me zwenkov knew that the direct approach was always best i just received word from kerikov hes ordered the destruction of the volcano valery took the news without changing expression he didnt even blink he had expected something like this but now that it came he felt nothing part of him was vindicated the father who had abandoned him so young had wasted his entire life on a dream that would never be fulfilled and part of him felt pain for the old mans failure the conflicting emotions turned his face into a stony mask zwenkov continued im waiting to hear from a commando team in hawaii once i receive word ill fire the missile and obliterate the volcano we then head toward hawaii to extract the commando team did he give a reason valery asked softly im sorry dr borodin what was that valery cleared his throat but his voice was still a whisper i asked if kerikov gave you a reason im a member of the russian armed forces attached to the kgb dr borodin when i receive orders i dont ask for explanations you know its a mistake dont you that is not my concern zwenkov replied caustically i heard what you said to the crew about the american submarines in the area when you launch that missile theyll find us instantly you may know geology borodin but i know american tactics when that warhead goes off theyll rush to the area to investigate and well slip quietly away the acoustics of the explosion will hide our underwater signature even at flank speed he had told valery about the missile strike out of courtesy since the young scientist and his father had put so much effort into the volcanos creation but that didnt mean he liked borodin nor wanted to have his orders questioned since his fathers death valery had abandoned any thoughts of suicide admitting that he had been tempted in a moment of weakness now he realized that he would never be able to dissuade zwenkov from destroying the volcano but he still had a chance of escaping with his fathers briefcase when the john dory rendezvoused with the commando team valery would find a way to get off the boat even if it meant swimming to hawaii he would escape the volcano would be gone by then but pytors notes would certainly be worth something to the americans because our boat is about to enter a potential combat situation zwenkov said interrupting valerys thoughts you will be confined to your quarters you are not under arrest but a guard will be posted to ensure that you do not interfere with the operation of this vessel zwenkov pressed the intercom button on his desk the xo answered instantly from the bridge yes captain send the security officer here to escort dr borodin back to his cabin and have a guard posted there there is no need for a sidearm a moment later the security man entered the cabin and escorted a silent valery borodin away a beefy guard already stood outside valerys cabin when they reached it valery threw himself onto his bunk after the guard closed the door with exaggerated courtesy waves of frustration pounded against the top of his head like a crashing winter surf he had been so close the john dory would have picked up the commando team near the hawaiian coast under the cover of darkness and he could have easily slipped into the sea unnoticed gone his chances were gone he would never be able to overpower the guard outside his door and make his way off the submarine he had lost he pounded his fists into his thin mattress trying not to imagine how close hed been to being with tish again the ache was strong enough to make him moan and toss about on the narrow bunk those beautiful weeks when theyd been together in mozambique played through his mind like a romance film himself and tish swimming and laughing and loving carefree and gay he could almost feel her thinking about him at this very moment feel the connection they shared the bond that wouldnt ever let them be truly apart valery closed his eyes tightly in a vain attempt to block out his loss goddamn it he seethed teeth clenched so tightly they were almost in danger of shattering goddamn it near hawaii the roar of the turbo jets woke mercer and he knew the fa hornet had just slowed to subsonic speeds he blinked his eyes hard and rotated his stiff neck the constricting flight suit dug painfully into his groin and had bunched up under his arms but there was no way he could stretch out in the cockpit night still held the earth in its grip the moon was big and fat overhead mercer was sure he could read by its pale glow where are we he asked billy ray about fifty miles out from the kitty hawk theyre trackin us now ask any commercial or private pilot to name the most dangerous thing they could do with an aircraft and they will invariably say landing without power on rough terrain ask any naval aviator and the response would be landing on a carrier at night in rough seas knowing this mercer thought it prudent to keep quiet and let billy ray do his job billy ray bubba young had other ideas he kept up a running dialogue of inane observations about farming flying and anything else that came into his head mercer could see his hands gesturing wildly as he talked only when they were ten miles out did the pilot regain his calm professionalism and get down to business control this is ferryman oneonethree bubba gave the flight destination i have you in sight mercer peered into the gloom ahead of the hurtling aircraft but it took him nearly twenty seconds to find the dim lights of the aircraft carrier which were just faint pinpricks of light like a constellation on the black surface of the sea there was no doubt that billy ray possessed exceptional eyesight the hornet was descending steadily her powerful engines throttled back her airspeed no more than two hundred knots as they drew closer to the huge carrier mercer could see the lights on her stern running lights vassi system lights to show the pilot his glide path and the ball light that indicated the ships roll they meant nothing to him but he trusted billy ray to know what he was doing one mile out the voice of the flight controller called confirmed billy ray replied casually there was a mechanical whine as the landing gear sank from the fuselage the few lights on the carrier made the sea look even darker and more ominous by watching the ships bow mercer saw she was pitching wildly it looked impossible to land the hornet on her deck call the ball the radio buzzed billy ray slewed his aircraft through the sky to match the great ships ponderous roll when he felt they were aligned he keyed his mike and said bubba has the ball the flight was in his hands now the carrier closing by the second the hornet still flying over one hundred and fifty knots the controlled sway of the aircraft matching the flight decks movement three hundred yards out the stall warning wailed the wings were losing lift at the slow speed two hundred yards out billy ray pitched the needle nose up at an even steeper angle the aircraft was barely hanging in the sky at one hundred yards the aircraft began to shudder but billy ray held her up with a deft touch on the throttle the deck was just a murky shadow ahead the entire situation seemed out of control it was definitely unlike anything mercer had ever experienced before the wailing alarms the mad movements of the fighter and billy rays rebel yell the wheels touched with a squeal of burned rubber billy ray slammed the throttles to their forward stops and activated the afterburners but the massive power of the engines could not pull the hornet from the arrester cable that stretched across the kitty hawks deck he shut down the engines as the planes nose dropped to the deck the instant deceleration from knots to zero slammed mercer into his harness bruising both shoulders painfully as the turbofans whined into silence mercer exhaled the breath he was sure hed held for the past two minutes ay shoulda warned you about hittin max power when we touch down gotta do that in case we missed the cable and needd to take off again no problem mercer said too relieved to complain control billy ray spoke into the radio give me the wire you snagged two ferryman oneonethree the controller replied billy ray shouted triumphantly ah havent landed on a carrier in two months and ah can still lay her down on the center wire to maintain flight status naval pilots must consistently hook into the middle of the three arrester cables that stretch across a carriers deck hitting on number one or three meant they came in too high or too low and if they do either too often theyre taken off active status and sent to the mainland for additional training billy ray had executed a perfect nighttime landing as the f was towed to one of the aircraft lifts by a small utility tractor the canopy opened and mercer breathed in the rich pacific air the smell of aviation fuel and the smoke from the carriers eight forestwheeler boilers could not dampen the tanginess of the ocean mercer was amazed at the activity on the flight deck men scurried from task to task aircraft jockeyed around an f tomcat streaked into the darkened sky a huge helicopter warmed up nearby deck crews swarmed up to the hornet one pushed a mobile ladder to the cockpit two men scrambled up the ladder and helped mercer and billy ray extricate themselves from the cramped seats good to have you back bubba one of the men said your squadron leader wants to see you in the briefing room right away fine billy ray drawled well mr mercer been a pleasure mercer shook his hand and grinned if you say so im sorry i wasnt much company on the flight i guess i needed the sleep shoot you were asleep the whole time no wonder you didnt answer none of my questions billy ray laughed someone handed mercer his nylon bag recovered from the ammo well the asphalt deck felt good under his feet as he stretched his tired muscles he realized that the ship was barely pitching it had just seemed violent as the hornet had screamed in on its approach dr mercer commander quintana wants to see you said a crewman ill lead the way please stay behind me sir the flight deck is a pretty dangerous place no sooner had they stepped away from the aircraft than the huge square of the deck elevator vanished carrying the hornet to the hangar below mercer followed the crewman to the sevenstory island the only part of the carrier to rise above the flight deck he could make out the bridge windows and the mass of antennae that shot up into the sky since the kitty hawk wasnt nuclear powered she had a single funnel that cantilevered out over the starboard rail the wind that swept the deck pushed mercer and his escort aft toward the island as they approached mercer saw a figure silhouetted in a doorway when they were close enough the hispanic features and dark hair allowed him to correctly identify commander quintana he was dressed in starched khakis and though he seemed relaxed he held himself erect typical ramrod navy man mercer thought welcome to the cv kitty hawk im commander juan quintana why dont we step inside out of the wind quintana made no offer to shake hands and spoke as if every word was capitalized and punctuated with a period mercer followed him into the ship the unitarian gray walls and stark lighting reminded mercer of the basement of his grandparents house in vermont the steel corridors were spotlessly clean but smelled of fuel oil and saltwater quintana led him up three decks and through a maze of corridors to his office had mercer not been used to the threedimensional labyrinths of underground mines he would have been thoroughly lost quintanas office was small but on a ship which housed more than men space was at a premium the walls were covered in cheap paneling and the carpet on the floor was thin but a definite upgrade from the steel passageways quintanas desk was wooden standard government issue in fact it reminded mercer of his own desk at the usgs since he believed that a clean desk was the sign of a sick mind he assumed quintana was indeed touched the only items on the desk were a lamp bolted to its surface and a black threeline telephone the head is through that curtain quintana pointed you can leave your flight suit in there thanks mercer smiled his gratitude and headed for the bathroom a few minutes later he was seated in front of the commander sipping the coffee that quintana had thoughtfully poured the captain would have met you himself dr mercer but he really doesnt like you boys in the cia quite frankly i dont like you either the distaste in quintanas voice was hard edged im glad we have that cleared up mercer replied with a grin i dont like spies either i dont understand i thought youre with the cia mercer finished his thought no im with the usgs ive never heard of it quintana said cautiously the united states geological survey commander quintana mercer said with a smile im a mining engineer its bad enough using a navy jet to transport civilians but this is ridiculous quintana said acidly youre just an engineer what the hell is this all about dr mercer the commanders arrogant attitude triggered mercers temper dont act as if you had to pay for that flight yourself quintana all right im on a mission so far over your head the people involved read like a whos who and i dont recall any of them giving you permission to act like some simpering prima donna as far as im concerned your ship is just an airport where im changing planes so stuff your holierthanthou attitude im really not in the mood mercer wouldnt normally have been that short with quintana but the tension was building within him and he needed an outlet besides the commander was acting like a prick your job is to get me to the assault ship inchon nothing more quintanas eyes narrowed in rancor as mercer spoke fine dr mercer its now first light in another two hours or so a helicopter will transfer you over to inchon then thatll be fine in the meantime where can i get something to eat quintana stood his anger locked behind clenched teeth ill take you to the officers mess by the way tell the captain that admiral morrison sends his regards mercer said lightly as they left the office the casual remark about the chairman of the joint chiefs was puerile he knew but the bulging veins on quintanas forehead gave him a fiendish pleasure honolulu evad lurbud always woke angry even after a short nap anger was an integral part of him as much as his dark eyes or his powerful arms it was an unfocused emotion wild yet so very important to him it was the only thing that gave his life any meaning if he could somehow vent just a little of that anger every day then he knew he was alive as he swung his legs off the cot he wondered what he would be like if he ever woke and found all the anger had finally left him it had been his constant companion since the days of brutal beatings by his father and the intimate touches of his mother and aunt he guessed if he ever woke without it he would put a bullet into his forehead the other bunks in the dim safehouse were occupied by his team the bed above lurbud sagged under the weight of sergeant demanov their snores were almost deafening because the team had arrived only a day before lurbud he knew it was prudent to give the men a chance to acclimate to the hawaiian time zone the men had to be fresh this evening when it was time to move out he glanced at his watch pm he had been in hawaii a little over twentyfour hours and now as he stretched his muscles he knew he was ready in one corner of the safehouse two members of the team were playing endless hands of gin trying in vain to alleviate the boredom between their scheduled twohour reports to the john dory when they saw lurbud looking at them they came to immediate attention lurbud smiled and waved them back to their seats he turned back to the bunks of sleeping soldiers gentlemen he said softly with fluid grace the men woke and slid out of their beds coming to attention automatically their response was so instantaneous that even lurbud was impressed sergeant demanov broke rank and strode across the room to evad he was naked yet showed no selfconsciousness his chunky body was covered in a thick pelt of hair not bad eh demanov asked grabbing a cigarette and lighter from a table are you talking about your troops or your shriveled manhood demanov let out a deep belly laugh smoke shooting from his nostrils in twin jets best fucking troops in the world they are lurbud smiled i think this time even you are not exaggerating dimitri i want them ready to move out by hours it will take us at least an hour after that to get into position around ohnishis house have you given any thought to my plan yes this afternoon when the rest of you were sleeping i dont think it would be a good idea to split our forces we dont have the communications gear to coordinate a simultaneous attack against ohnishi and kenji we will hit them in turn with luck kenji will be with his master and the second operation wont be necessary it is critical that we maintain our scheduled contact with the john dory if shes not waiting for us when we reach the coast well you know the consequences while sergeant demanov and his team checked the equipment and weapons that had been smuggled into the safehouse months earlier through the russian embassys diplomatic pouch lurbud scanned the reports given to him in cairo ohnishis mansion was protected by twenty guards all of whom had military or police training and had attended numerous professional defense schools these guards were better trained than most nations elite defense forces lurbud had no doubt that his troops could handle them but there he would certainly lose men ohnishi was old wheelchair bound and frail he would pose no difficulty once the guards had been eliminated kenji on the other hand was different lurbud had no plan of his house no details of his security arrangements even his personal details were sketchy he was fiftyfour years old but the attached blurry photograph though taken only a year earlier showed a man who appeared twenty years younger kenji was a master of kendo tae kwan do and several martial arts that lurbud had never even heard of a note from the kgb compiler who had put the dossier together stated that kenji had mastered the art of nonweapons he could use simple household items to kill or maim the note explained that a similarly trained assassin had once slit the throat of a hungarian dissident with a sheet of paper torn from a london phone book lurbud sincerely hoped that they would catch kenji at ohnishis heading into an assassins lair without any tactical intelligence was tantamount to suicide at lurbud and his men left the safe house after checking that they had left no incriminating items behind despite the curfew they left the city unmolested in a van that had been stored in a garage nearby if honolulu survived the crisis the only evidence that they had ever been there was an empty barrackslike room and an abandoned van both rented by ocean freight and cargo months earlier and since the breakin at the new york offices of ampc had ceased to exist fortyfive miles away the cooling breeze of evening was washing across takahiro ohnishis glassandsteel mansion ohnishi seated in his wheelchair on the open balcony high above the rolling lawns nodded solemnly as kenji explained the current situation throughout hawaii though it has been four days since he was killed many of the national guard units still believe that their orders are still coming from david takamora they dont know that honolulus mayor is now dead macarthur boulevard leading to pearl harbor is blockaded by students armed with hunting rifles and fully equipped guardsmen the airport is now closed to all traffic and the buildings have been evacuated except for mercenary guards i hired the runways are blocked with airport maintenance vehicles that wont be moved without orders from either you or me the microwave relay stations are also closed and guarded and the main phone cables have been seized hawaii is essentially isolated has there been any resistance from the media yes kenji replied glancing at his watch the local heads of the networks are demanding some sort of interview with takamora preferably live to calm the fears of the general population one has threatened to start broadcasting reports about the violence to the mainland if takamora doesnt appear soon how do you plan to deal with him ohnishi did not sound too concerned as soon as he leaves his studio i have an agent ready to take him out good how violent are the streets right now from my men stationed in the hospitals it seems maybe two hundred dead around five hundred injured so far most of these are random acts like the ones seen in los angeles in gangs of youths beating innocent people vendetta retributions between gang members that sort of thing some of the victims are those weve specifically targeted of our list of three hundred possible threats eightysix are confirmed dead but many more have probably been eliminated i dont have confirmation from our agents yet it disturbs me that we have not heard from suleiman about our arms shipment ohnishi said suddenly kenji did not reply but his gaze darted furtively to the face of his rolex those arms are supposed to be here in a few hours and we dont know what type of planes will be flying them in or the recognition codes the pilots will transmit if we dont get those codes we cant clear the runways we are approaching a critical point soon people will begin to lose their fervor and want the violence to end we must get those weapons and the rest of our mercenaries the president of the united states will respond soon im sure the forces at pearl may be bottled up for now but they can be unleashed very quickly indeed the president wouldnt dare order those troops to open fire hed be risking a sympathetic revolt on the mainland every ethnic minority in america would be behind us anarchy would reign in every town and street he has other options kenji an attack against me for example he knows of my involvement in this coup he could target me alone and wait for the violence to die with me mobs like this only stay active with someone to control them if we dont stay in contact with our lieutenants around the islands they will quickly lose their fire true kenji agreed and we must also think of kerikovs response i dont worry about him his powers are severely limited but the coup was his idea and was only supposed to happen on his orders surely he has a plan to stop it we are jeopardizing his control of the volcano he must have a way of protecting it in such a contingency ohnishi smiled paternally you have always only thought of my protection kenji and that is most admirable but i believe that we are quite secure there is no way kerikov can stop us kenji seemed relieved to hear his masters confident tone what will we do when we cant produce takamora to lead the people senator namura is currently hiding outside washington dc he was my choice to lead the coup if takamora had refused so he will become the new leader he has already accepted the honor one of my private jets will fly him here as soon as its safe for him to move and takamoras death well blame the us military dont worry so kenji all is working out well suleimans weapons will arrive along with mercenaries to augment your forces namura will probably be here within twentyfour hours to place a stamp of legitimacy on what weve started neither the president nor kerikov will have the time or fortitude to launch any major opposition from the corner of one eye kenji noticed a dark figure dart across the lawn toward the main house the first man was quickly followed by two more racing from the shadowed protection of the jungle kenji crossed his legs casually belying the instinctive tightening of his muscles his hand rested naturally against his ankle maybe all contingencies have been thought of he remarked i never thought we would actually get this far just a few months ago a coup in hawaii seemed like such a farfetched idea it really wasnt so outrageous even then the state was ripe for it racism and tension were building we only heightened it with our acts and now orchestrate its crescendo the explosion wasnt strong enough to shatter the thick glass skin of the mansion but it did rattle the balcony and startle a flock of dark pelicans into flight across the vast lawn ohnishi whirled around in his wheelchair scanning his surroundings for a frightened moment when he turned to his faithful assistant kenji had already sprung to his feet the snubnosed revolver from his ankle holster was held firmly in his hand the barrel was pointed directly between ohnishis wide staring eyes dont move old man kenji sneered takahiro ohnishis ageweakened bladder released into his trademark black armani suit the white house staff sergeant harold tompkins was about as nervous as a human being could get he was on duty in the situation room when the video images from pearl harbor faded from the highdefinition screen he fiddled with the satellite feeds under the combined stares of the president the chairman of the joint chiefs the secretaries of state and defense and the directors of the cia nsa and fbi one moment the image of pearl harbor was crisp and vivid and the next the screen had gone blank had this been a commercial transmission a please stand by sign would have flashed and those assembled gone off for snacks or to use the bathroom but this was not a commercial transmission pearl harbor had just come under attack when the image had faded and these men expected tompkins to get the video feed back on line anything admiral c thomas morrison asked no sir not yet tompkins managed to squeak jesus christ the air was thick in the twentybytwentyfoot vault buried four floors below the white house a blue pall of smoke swirled from the cigarettes that these men would never admit to in public even the president where he sat hunched at the head of the large refractory table had a marlboro hanging from the corner of his pensive mouth if my wife sees me like this shes going to kill me he said to lighten the mood the answering laughter had a nervous edge despite the cigarettes the hands made twitchy by endless cups of coffee and the grizzled stubble that covered their faces these men were still as sharp as theyd been when called to the situation room twelve hours earlier an aide entered from the single elevator and walked straight to sam becker the head of the national security agency sir heres the latest from the kh flyby he handed over a sheaf of infrared photographs taken by an orbiting spy satellite just like the photos taken from the sr wraith im afraid the analysts couldnt make much out of them the heat signature from the volcano makes it impossible to locate any other thermal images damn becker said leafing through the photos if my men didnt see a russian nuclear sub i dont see how mercer could have the nsa has the best photo interp people in the world i hope youre right about him dick henna looked up from the fan of papers spread before him ive got no guarantees but so far the man hasnt disappointed he told me over the phone that he had the john dory pinpointed at the volcano site if thats true why didnt we just order him to tell us where that was asked paul barnes christ paul you met him do you think he would have told us anything i agree with dick on this one the president remarked rubbing his bloodshot eyes the deft touch is whats needed here not a heavy hand i think i have it sirs tompkins interrupted the men turned to the screen an image came into focus a handsome oriental man dressed in jungle camouflage behind him marines were firing at an unseen enemy from the protection of sandbag bunkers two abrams tanks sat squarely on a wide expanse of asphalt their turrets pointed toward the main gates of pearl harbor their mm cannons were silent but machinegun fire spat from their coaxially mounted brownings it was a macabre scene because there was no audio tompkins pressed a few more buttons on his console and the clamor of battle assaulted the room the ferocity was stunning repeat your message colonel we lost your transmission for a few minutes morrison said over the sound of the battle words matched the officers moving lips about ten minutes ago sir colonel shinzo this is admiral morrison please repeat the admiral asked a second time sir about ten minutes ago all hell broke loose without warning the guardsmen and locals outside the gate opened fire small arms mostly but the guardsmen do have rocket launchers and tow antitank missiles they are not making any move for an assault yet but its only a matter of time sir colonel shinzo shouted something incomprehensible and ducked behind a sandbag wall the camera must have been mounted on a tripod because it remained steady as a grenade detonated no more than twenty yards away the image faded for a moment then returned shinzo was again standing in view what are you doing to hold them shinzo as ordered were firing over their heads but my boys are taking too many casualties to remain passive much longer sir colonel shinzo do you recognize my voice the president asked clearly hiding his exhaustion i believe so mr president the statement was more of a question colonel youre doing a fine job there but i want civilian and national guard casualties at a minimum do you understand yes mr president shinzo said resignedly knowing this meant losing a lot of his men the noise of the battle increased dramatically shinzo turned away quickly as the transmission broke off again the assembled men all turned to tompkins who was frustratingly twisting dials and knobs im sorry but the transmission was broken at the other end theres nothing i can do thats fine admiral morrison said dryly youre dismissed tompkins gratefully hurried from the room can we trust him paul barnes asked i mean hes a jap after all shut your fucking mouth you racist son of a bitch morrison was on his feet the instant barnes finished speaking shinzo wears the uniform of the united states marine corps you question the integrity of one of my boys again and so help me christ im going to tear you a new asshole lets calm down here gentlemen dick henna said soothingly but admiral morrison has a point we start secondguessing the motivations of our own people and we might as well go home and wait for armageddon i guess its started the president said slowly every man knew he meant a civil war the great melting pot has been simmering for two hundredplus years and its about to boil over unless this situation ends within a few hours the news from hawaii will light a powder keg in every big city in america itll make the los angeles riots of look like mardi gras the president was silent for five long minutes his most trusted advisors knew he was making a decision that might very well condemn the united states to the bloodiest war ever fought in the western hemisphere the compassion they felt for him could not make the decision any easier his shaggy head was bowed over the table and his lips moved silently was he praying or asking advice of the ghost of abraham lincoln who was said to wander the white house he raised his head his shoulders squaring tom admiral morrison looked the president square in the eye awaiting his orders i want a tomahawk cruise missile armed with a nuclear warhead launched at the volcano if there is a russian sub out there guarding it itll be destroyed by the blast so it was war the united states was going to fight and perhaps lose everything democracy had created once again race would plunge america into a civil war but this time there would be no north and south no masondixon line the boundaries had blurred in the decades since then now the battles would be fought in every state and every town then order the kitty hawk and the inchon to stand off suspend all flights and steam out of the area i dont want them anywhere near hawaii is that clear tell the commander at pearl to throw down their weapons and surrender the base a sigh ran through the room i would rather sacrifice hawaii than risk a war maybe their secession will start a chain reaction and this country will disintegrate but im willing to take that risk i cant order our troops to kill americans no matter what the consequences tears ran unashamedly down his cheeks sir dick henna was the first person to speak what about mercer we havent even given him a chance dick hes only one man were talking about a massive revolution supported by god knows how many people mr president henna persisted what if hes right that this revolution is being masterminded by an outside influence if he can cut that off there will be no revolt i spoke to the russian president no more than two hours ago dick he had no idea what i was talking about mercer was wrong about the russians being involved this whole thing was strictly takahiro ohnishis and what if this is something the russian government didnt sanction thats a bit too farfetched for me to believe this is a massive operation theres no way the head of the country wouldnt know about it ask your predecessors about irancontra sometime henna retorted sarcastically the president ignored the remark about the russian government not sanctioning this operation it may not be that farfetched paul barnes said polishing his glasses what do you mean this afternoon the body of gennady perchenko was fished from a river in bangkok if you recall perchenko was the russian ambassador to the bangkok accords the one who outfoxed us into signing away any legal rights to that new volcano was there any indication of foul play in my business theres never any indication but id stake my career that he was murdered also an informer reported seeing ivan kerikov flying into thailand a few days before perchenkos death whos ivan kerikov a real cagey kgb operator sir my contacts in moscow tell me that there is a massive manhunt on for him even as we speak it seems he has a record of working outside the fold and right now hes under arrest for misappropriation of government funds equipment and personnel and a dozen other charges including murder hes come to the attention of the cia a few times over the years he ran a team of assassins and torturers in afghanistan during the early s and he was somehow connected to the korean air jumbo jet shot down in september of most recently he took over department seven of the kgb department seven is one of those groups we know very little about they dont seem to have any active agents or any real goals they just act as a sort of think tank as far as we can figure now if perchenkos death can be linked to kerikov then we have a definite connection between the volcano and this department seven sam becker had been reading the file handed to him earlier with the photos and now he looked up sharply we have that connection what do you have sam the president caught the strength behind beckers voice and drew from it on pauls request last evening i had the archive sections at fort meade pull anything they had on soviet geologists from the fifties and sixties the records were sketchy but we just got lucky since its inception the national security agency at fort meade was the repository for every scrap of intelligence gathered from around the world there was more computer power in the sprawling complex than anywhere else on the planet and it was used to decipher even the most oblique reference or cryptic message from enemy and ally alike if something had ever been put in print spoken about over a phone line or bounced off a satellite nsa had a record of it from the personal advertisements in the johannesburg star to mundane conversations between two sisters in madrid to the dying gasps of three cosmonauts who secretly suffocated aboard the soyuz space station in it was all stored on the magnetic tapes in nsas archives becker held up his slim file this is from the archive director oliver lee according to lee personnel records from a research laboratory near odessa show that olga borodin has been drawing a decent pension from the state since an accident claimed her husband on june given the parameters of the search her name caught lees attention and after a bit more research he found that the laboratory was part of an agency called department seven it seems the cia knows more about department seven than we do but the connection is obvious olga borodin is the widow of a geologist named pytor borodin you mean the russian specialist on bikinium henna interrupted so dr mercer was right the russians are involved just not their government the president was truly shocked kerikov must be the mastermind and ohnishi merely a pawn the mans got balls ill say that much but knowing this doesnt help us any we still have a coup taking place in hawaii and a valuable resource about to fall to this ivan kerikov the president swiveled to face henna what do you propose give mercer until dawn henna said if he has a plan at least give him that much time you saw from that last transmission that its almost dark in hawaii tonight should be relatively calm the guardsmen dont have the right equipment for night fighting if we dont hear anything by sunrise continue with your plan blow up the volcano and surrender the islands to ohnishi the president leaned back in his chair for a moment staring at the soundproofed ceiling tiles fingers laced behind his head he made his decision quickly all right ill give mercer until seven am local time then i want that volcano obliterated henna stood to leave the room mercer had arrived on the inchon ten hours earlier and henna had promised to get in touch with any final news dick yes mr president why do you trust mercer so much henna paused by the elevator door his arms full of papers and files im basically a cop sir and cops learn to trust their instincts despite the sophistication of the equipment in the white house communications room henna spent twenty frustrating minutes waiting for a connection to the inchon and another ten for mercer to be tracked down aboard the foot assault ship and brought to the radio about time you called youve got until seven tomorrow morning your time henna said without preamble so you better have one hell of a plan in that machiavellian mind of yours what happens at seven mercer asked airily a cruise missile blows up borodins volcano and the president surrenders the hawaiian islands without a fight talk about your serious deadlines mercer paused absorbing this latest piece of information well id best be off then any parting advice yeah right now pearl harbor is a war zone and we can only assume the rest of the islands are equally inflamed im surprised its stayed calm as long as it has what else weve found a definite link between the coup and a russian kgb director named ivan kerikov hes the mastermind he was last seen in thailand but may be on hawaii by now oh yeah ive had a team monitoring ham radio operators from hawaii for the past couple of days a guy there named ken peters who works for one of the television stations got hold of one of my people in california he suspects that one of their reporters jill tzu may have been kidnapped by ohnishi she was doing a real indepth expose on him when she vanished dudley doright to the rescue what else just that ohnishis mansion is heavily guarded by some real fanatics so be careful dont worry dick i have no interest in ohnishis house hes just a willing accomplice not the linchpin the signal from the inchon faded henna knew that mercer had cut him off he settled the phone back into its cradle if mercer wasnt going to ohnishis mansion then where was he going and if ohnishi wasnt the principal in this affair who was hawaii evad lurbuds senses were so highly tuned that the explosion which echoed across the lawns from the main house rocked him back against his heels as if he had been physically struck sergeant demanov placed a steadying hand on his shoulder what in the hell was that the burly sergeant asked in a whisper dont know lurbud replied curtly straining his eyes through the nightvision binoculars at the front of ohnishis glass mansion i cant see anything out of the ordinary demanov lurbud and two commandos were crouched behind a small stand of flowering rhododendrons placed like an island on the wide front lawn of the estate the rest of the squad was similarly hidden behind other natural cover they had reached ohnishis as the shadows of twilight began smearing the beautiful grounds lurbuds team had made use of the jungle which surrounded the estate to approach to within two hundred yards of the house then had dashed across the lawn in a leapfrog technique moving from small grove to small grove lurbud and demanov were no more than fifty yards from the marble porte cochere when the explosion occurred the sound was accompanied by a flash of brilliant light at the side of the darkened house i dont see anyone within the building lurbud said the nightvision glasses allowed lurbud to see into the glasswalled house but the main foyer entrance curving staircase and the rooms immediately to its left and right were all empty he was about to signal the men behind him to move forward when a tiny movement within the mansion made him pause someone was moving across the foyer toward the staircase the figure was walking cautiously twisting his body and neck as he peered around when the man reached the base of the stairs lurbud clearly saw the assault rifle tucked under his arm weve got company he said tensely lurbud watched closely as another figure swept into the entrance foyer and scurried up the stairs two so far he remarked but somethings not right they look as if they arent familiar with the house it seems strange for ohnishis security to act like that could be standard practice after that explosion demanov suggested i dont think so i think i know why we havent seen any of ohnishis personal bodyguards anywhere on the estate american commandos beat us here thats my guess good demanov grunted and quietly cocked his machine pistol kenji whats going on ohnishi wailed there was one contingency you never anticipated the revolver in kenjis hand was steady just as kerikov sold you out and you sold out kerikov i have done the same to both of you i dont understand kenji ohnishi pleaded its really quite simple ivan kerikov hired me eight months ago to act as his watchdog to report your activities to him ohnishi slouched deeper in his wheelchair his frail neck vanishing into his shoulders as he bowed in defeat he already knew the rest of what kenji would say and the weight of truth was heavy on his wasted body kerikov had to maintain absolute command of every aspect of his operation you were the only player that he did not directly control that is why he enlisted me to make sure that he knew what you were plotting but i have known you all your life you are like my son how how could you do such a thing ohnishi might have accepted the betrayal but he still had to know the reason you know nothing about me except that which ive told you it is true that at the beginning i saw you as my father as my master but like any son i outgrew you i searched for my own path which i found through kerikov kenjis laugh was without feeling so mocking that it sounded more like the bark of a rabid dog kerikov is as much a fool as you were old man soon after he approached me with his lucrative offer i was approached by a group of men that gave me even more kenji related the story of his mothers enslavement as a comfort girl to the occupying japanese army in korea his subsequent birth and his sale to his natural father i am half korean ohnishi a heritage that my father tried to bury but a fact i could never ignore in the years since kerikov first approached you he had to change his plans due to the collapse of his government not long ago but before you began actively pursuing this doomed dream of yours he sold you out to a group of investors this group bought the volcano that kerikov promised would make hawaii a viable nation what he did not know or couldnt know is that this group of korean investors then contacted me i dont know how they found out about my heritage but they gave me the opportunity to prove who i really am from then on not only was i a spy for kerikov against you but also a spy against the both of you for my new korean benefactors you had no chance at all every move you made was counteracted by one of my allies you bought weapons from suleiman elaziz suleiman i betrayed the egyptian to kerikov the weapons that you so hoped for will not arrive nor will there be any additional mercenaries kerikov asked me to rescue a certain woman from the noaa ship i told my allies to have her killed in washington dc kerikov forced you to write that letter to the president intending to hold it over your head i sent it to the white house knowing that would lead to the anarchy that now holds these islands you sent the letter ohnishi did nothing to hide his astonishment oh yes mayor takamora made a convenient scapegoat but i was responsible for sending the letter the volcano was too close to the surface to risk any detection and it was agreed that your letter would act as the best possible deterrent against the american forces finding it the ocean seeker almost foiled these plans but kerikov dealt with it with a typical russian reaction after he had the noaa ship destroyed i knew that the american focus would be on to you and perhaps the russians if they got smart but we that is the koreans would never be suspect the volcano would be ours without ever having created or defended it it was the perfect triplecross while you and kerikov and the united states quarreled over the hawaiian islands and the volcano hydra consolidated would take the prize and no one would be the wiser kenji was chuckling at the frail old man before him when an armed figure burst onto the balcony his assault rifle covering both kenji and ohnishi kenji spoke to him in korean its all right this is ohnishi he wont give us any difficulties all went well yes the korean commando replied crisply ohnishis guards were taken out smoothly the diversionary explosion worked perfectly none of my men were even wounded good well leave here for my house in just a few minutes make sure the remainder of the explosives are in place the korean soldier began speaking into a walkietalkie you see ohnishi this is where my true loyalties lie when i told the koreans about your coup they thought it was the perfect cover under which they could claim the volcano the united states and ivan kerikov would be too busy trying to quell the violence and silence you to notice us the sound of an automatic weapon ripped through the mansion like the tearing of a piece of canvas kenji rolled to the floor shifting his aim from ohnishi to the doorway leading to the balcony the korean soldier swung around so that he too covered the entrance silence hung in the air for a long moment it came from downstairs you must have missed one of ohnishis guards go check it out kenji waited until the korean left before jerking ohnishi to his feet and half dragging him toward his bedroom lurbud gave the trigger of his machine pistol another tap as a figure lunged from the front door for the bushes just to its left he knew hed missed but it would keep his opponent pinned for a few crucial seconds sergeant demanov followed lurbud and two other troopers in the last dash across the lawn to the house as they approached the thick slabs of glass of one wing lurbud tossed a grenade the grenade cracked the glass as it hit but did not penetrate a second later it exploded shattering three panels in a plume of crystal and fire lurbud led his men through the resulting sixfootwide hole their boots crunched across the fine glass chips spread out over the woven reed mat within one of kenjis men lay smeared against the far wall of the japanesestyle room his body shredded by the razorsharp glass the remainder of lurbuds team had used similar techniques blowing four other holes in the structure what followed was nothing short of an allout war with both sides falsely assuming their enemy was an american commando team cordite smoke hung heavily in the entrance foyer as lurbud cautiously edged himself into the lofty room near one wall in the whirling air it was difficult to tell who was part of his force and who was not a figure leapt from behind a huge terracotta vase leveling his weapon at lurbud sergeant demanov dispatched the attacker with a quick burst lurbud acknowledged demanov with a nod and continued his sweep of the house gunfire echoed throughout the cavernous home and streaks of tracer fire like comet tails could be seen through some of the transparent walls halfway up the stairs lurbud came under a scathing fire bullets ripping up the thick marble banister only inches from his body lurbud leapt up and over the railing exposing himself for a moment to the hidden gunman before dropping back to the first floor he hit the hard marble and rolled once as more bullets sliced the air around him more than one gunman had targeted him he continued to roll directing fire from his machine pistol at the vague outline of a man far across the foyer the rounds caught the man low in the gut the kinetic energy of the impacts lifting him bodily and tossing him through a bulletriddled glass wall a grenade rumbled somewhere within the mansion shaking the entire building it was immediately followed by the sound of huge chunks of glass shattering against the hard floor up and running lurbud changed clips for his weapon with expert hands someone loomed out from the reeking smoke and lurbud almost tore him apart but stopped in time as he realized it was demanov whats your estimate lurbud panted ten to fifteen maybe as many as twenty its hard to tell because this place is so fucking big bullets flew over their heads as they both dove behind a sofa in what must have been the formal living room demanov returned fire quickly another fusillade pinned them back to the whitecarpeted floor as soon as the firing stopped lurbud sprang to his feet and ran across the room bullets tracked his progress edging closer and closer to his racing form a waterford crystal sculpture nearly seven feet tall exploded just behind him he dove for the floor between two leather ottomans breath jamming into his throat with the impact the firing stopped for a moment and he lifted himself the gunman was in plain view lurbud opened up stitching rounds across a massive roy lichtenstein painting before finding his mark the gunman went down with three slugs buried deep in his torso lurbud slithered across the room to the fallen assailant expecting to see a caucasian or japanese from ohnishis security detachment he was shocked to find that the gunman was chinese or possibly korean what the fuck is going on he wondered lurbud heard the distinctive crack of a pistol shot just as a bullet slammed into the corpses chest inches from his hand he lifted his machine pistol and fired instinctively but his bullets hit nothing but more glass the attacker had nimbly ducked behind a glasscased suit of japanese armor guarding a curve in the hallway leading to some of the guest suites lurbud lurched to his feet and started down the hall back pressed tight to the wall hands steady on his weapon he fired a burst at the priceless armor which disintegrated under the hail of mm rounds there was no one behind it he continued on passing the body of one of his own men further down the hallway the russian soldiers head had been completely twisted around jesus lurbud muttered remembering that ohnishis assistant kenji was a black belt of the eight don a master virtually without peer the dead russian had to be his handiwork lurbud tightened the grip on his machine pistol now that he knew the power of his quarry he searched each of the opulent guest suites quickly but calmly mentally blocking out the firefight still raging within the building the door at the far end of the hallway did not lead to a room but rather opened onto a stark concrete and steel service staircase he ascended cautiously the rancid sweat of fear snaking down his flanks it was impossible to hear anything in the echoing stairway because of the cacophonous battle after a few minutes lurbud reached the top of the stairs but there was no sign of kenji just a dimly lit landing and a fire retardant door lurbud jerked open the door keeping his body safely out of the way when the gunfire he expected didnt occur he ducked his head around the corner quickly the room beyond was small maybe twelve feet square but tastefully furnished with a low bed an antique dresser and damascene wall coverings a huge builtin mirror dominated the far wall lurbud knew it was oneway glass from the plans provided to his team rather than waste time looking for the secret exit that kenji must have used lurbud pumped a few rounds into the mirror and watched it tumble to the floor in a glittering cascade beyond lay ohnishis private bedroom and on the beautiful fourposter bed lay ohnishi himself naked his head had been severed from his torso as had his arms and legs each appendage lay neatly in its proper anatomical position but about two inches separated each from the trunk of the billionaires body evad lurbud had been witness to and had in fact carried out some of the most vicious torture yet devised by mankind but what lay before him brought vomit shooting out of his mouth ohnishis withered genitalia had been cut off and placed a few inches from his groin lurbud knew from the amount of blood in this region that this had been the first member carved off trying to regain his composure lurbud thought for a moment and realized that such a death took more time than hed given the fleeing kenji either someone else had been here first or kenji had done this prior to lurbuds assault on the mansion if the presence of korean guards was baffling then ohnishis death was truly confusing kenji was ohnishis assistant of many years by all accounts incredibly loyal why had he suddenly turned why had he killed his employer lurbud let these questions sink into the back of his mind as he continued his search beyond the bedroom lay a dayroom as large as most suburban homes the decor was very modern including geometric and freeform art pieces and a glossy white pine floor the pyramidal top of the mansion soared over lurbuds head supporting a huge primarycolored mobile by calder a smaller version of the one hanging in the east wing of the national gallery in washington dc lurbud dashed from the dayroom through the ninefoottall french doors at the far end and onto an open balcony that overlooked the back of ohnishis estate he took a few deep breaths of the humid air glad to be out of the smokefilled house amazingly he could make out the sounds of night insects over the din of battle below kenji stood on the back lawn a lean shadowy form in the rich moonlight the instant lurbud saw him he raised his machine pistol but kenji was too far out of range a glance to his left showed lurbud the rope ladder hanging over the side of the balcony that kenji must have used to escape below kenji stretched his arms over his head and lurbud swore he heard laughter when kenjis hands met though lurbud could not see the gesture his finger touched the detonation button on a small radio transmitter a deep rumbling shook the building buckling the entire structure some of the few still intact glass plates popped from their supports and flew onto the lawn the rumbling deepened and the house began to shiver as the chain of small explosives planted around the foundation by kenjis soldiers went off in a predetermined sequence the timing of the blasts corresponded with the harmonic resonance of the entire structure so that the rumbling deepened even as the sound of the small explosions diminished lurbud clutched at the railing as the building shook faster and faster huge rents appeared in the main support columns those that took most of the strain of the massive glass roof the columns collapsed all at once and the roof shattered in a glittering explosion the slabsided glass walls toppled as the entire building turned into an endless shower of glass tons of it poured down killing all those beneath slicing through flesh and bone without check one moment the koreans and russians had been fighting a desperate battle and the next they were torn apart by an unimaginable force lurbud had felt the balcony sway as the support columns let go the lighted almost crystalline pyramid above him shattered as if a bomb had gone off directly beneath it he ducked under ohnishis breakfast table an instant before the shards sliced through the air like hypervelocity bullets his left hand was caught in the hail of glass and he quickly pulled it to his chest three fingers were missing and a seveninchlong fragment of glass was thrust halfway through his hand he had just started to scream when the whole cantilevered balcony let go his last sensation even before the pain of his mutilated hand had time to fully course through his nervous system was of falling indefinitely uss inchon mercer thanked the radio operator politely after hanging up on henna and left the cryptlike communications room his expression was neutral and only a trained observer would notice the slight tenseness in his stride his gray eyes were hard devoid of emotion a woman he had dated several years earlier had said the day their relationship ended that the only way to tell what he was thinking was to ask him his expressions she complained would never give him away and his eyes which are supposed to be windows into the soul were really oneway glass that only he could see through he had scoffed at the notion but any navy personnel that he passed would have agreed with her because he had been sent to the inchon for an undetermined number of days mercer had been assigned a cabin it had the luxurious appointments of a cheap highway motel but it was his own he locked the door and stripped after a cold shower to help wake him up he dressed again secreting equipment brought from his home when he was dressed he did some quick shadowboxing to ensure that nothing would fly free and that his equipment was unconstricting his moves were fast and efficient his mind focused to a pinpoint satisfied he took several deep calming breaths he tucked his beretta pistol into the waistband of his pants the tails of his black shirt over it grabbing the nylon duffel containing his combat harness and machine pistol he left the small cabin he passed a few dozen of the nineteen hundred marines on board as he headed for the flight deck he could tell by their grim faces that the men didnt relish the idea of invading their own country neither do i he thought the flight deck of the amphibious assault ship was nearly three hundred feet shorter than the kitty hawks but equally as pandemonious an avb harrier jump jet thundered into the sky just as he walked onto the deck thanks to her ducted fans the attack aircraft utilized only a tiny portion of the deck to achieve flight the wind kicked up by her rolls royce pegasus engines whipped the air furiously sending grit into mercers eyes several sea stallion and sea king helicopters sat on the deck their huge rotors hanging limply mechanics and other personnel were buzzing around dodging small vehicles and each other in preparation for a possible battle it was obvious that the president hadnt ordered the standdown yet mercer guessed that the commanderinchief would wait until the last moment he shielded his eyes against the thirtyknot wind and surveyed the twilit deck until he saw the helicopter that had brought him from the kitty hawk early that morning a sikorsky sea king lieutenant edward rice usmc pilot the huge chopper sat just forward of the ships superstructure mercer could see movement in the cockpit eddie rice had told him on the flight from the carrier that he would be ferrying some equipment back to the kitty hawk just after sunset mercer was thankful that henna had called before the chopper returned to its ship the hijacking would be a little easier since he knew the pilot no sense ruining a strangers day thought mercer as he walked to the big helicopter he approached the chopper from the port side and noticed with satisfaction that the crew door was open he pulled the beretta mm from under his shirt and threw his duffel bag onto the small platform below the choppers flight deck he kept the gun hidden when he poked his head into the cockpit come to see me off mercer eddie rice smiled without a doubt he had the worst teeth for a black man that mercer had ever seen so much for stereotypes he thought i loved your flying so much the navy decided i should go back with you mercer replied they sent you to the inchon just to bring you back to the kitty hawk rice shook his head ive heard of the government paper shuffle but this is nuts come on up im just about cleared for takeoff mercer tucked the pistol away without ever displaying it and slipped into the empty copilots seat as he had earlier that day he felt like he was in a cocoon of dials and switches he sat anxiously as rice continued his preflight check waiting for the takeoff was agonizing and he kept glancing at his watch he had eleven and a half hours until the nuclear strike you got a date or something rice asked noting mercers agitation something like that mercer said grimly two more minutes and were out of here rice tugged the microphone to his lips and began talking to the flight controller a moment later the two turboshaft engines began to whine needles on the instrument panel quivered and then started to climb as the general electric motors warmed rice watched the instruments intently his gaze darting from one gauge to the next when he engaged the gearbox the engines whine dulled for a moment as they fought the inertia of the stationary rotors then picked up as the five great blades began to turn the noise in the cockpit increased dramatically forcing mercer to don a helmet eddie continued to add power and the blades beat the air fervently he eased back on the collective pitch and the pound helicopter lifted into the dim pacific sky piece of cake rice grinned as the inchon vanished behind them he turned to mercer expecting a return smile but was greeted by the gaping barrel of the beretta the grin melted from his face sorry eddie mercer said his voice sounding tinny through the choppers intercom but were not heading for the kitty hawk i guess were not mercer reversed his grip on the pistol and smashed it into the sea kings radio cutting the chopper off from the outside then turned the weapon back on rice listen im on a secret mission hijacking a helicopter at the last moment was the only way to maintain security right rice said suspiciously you know why the navy moved these ships to hawaii it was a statement not a question you may be forced to invade your own country and kill your own people well theres a chance i can stop it i have to get to hawaii and youre my best shot it doesnt matter if you believe me or not but you are going to take me to hawaii theres no way you work for the cia the few agents ive known wouldve just pulled the gun and given the orders they dont like to explain shit so who the hell are you i dont work for the cia eddie i didnt lie this morning when i told you i was a geologist but im also the only guy who can pull this off you know theres nothing i can do to you ive got to keep both hands on the sticks to keep this eggbeater in the sky so dont you worry about me but my passengers might not like a sightseeing tour passengers i thought you were carrying cargo when you see them youll know why i call em cargo knowing rice couldnt leave his seat or contact any other aircraft or ship mercer ducked down until he could look into the cargo hold of the sea king there were five men in the squarefoot hold they were navy seals the best trained commandos in the american military perhaps in the world they sat in stony silence oblivious to the noise of the chopper or the wind buffeting them from the open hatch like a computer that only works in a binary system of ones and zeros the commander of the seals regarded mercer as threat or nonthreat his fathomless eyes were the bright blue of glacial ice they held mercers for the fraction of a second it took him to categorize mercer as nonthreat and turned away indifferently mercer had never felt such an aura of utter malignance in his life than that surrounding these men rice was right to call them cargo to call them passengers would be admitting they retained a trace of humanity he went back up to the flight deck and took his seat donning his headset see what i mean eddie grinned me ive got no problems with hawaii in fact id love a mai tai just give me a target destination and ill get us there oh you didnt need to smash up our radio you know yeah whys that rice smiled crookedly the call i received about two minutes before you boarded seems my commander was contacted by the director of the fbi said he thought youd pull a stunt like this and the seals would be a compromise between your plan and the presidents those seals back there are under orders to follow you he told me they might come in handy tonight mercer laughed so hard his guts ached that son of a bitch he said admiringly no wonder hes the director of the fbi my first hijacking and the victims turn out to be willing accomplices sorry about pulling the gun on you aint nothing i was born in south central wasnt the first time its ever happened probably not the last either an hour and a half later the sea king blasted along the northern coasts of the hawaiian islands her watertight hull no more than fifty feet above the crashing surf her sixtyfivefoot rotor blades less than one hundred yards from the towering cliffs mercer had spent much of the flight in the cargo hold with the seals poring over the plans to kenjis estate and forming a battle plan by the time the sea king cleared the coast all of them were satisfied that the assault could be pulled off successfully back in the cockpit mercer could see lights the concentration on rices face but he also saw a slight trace of enjoyment too maui and molokai and the big island were behind them and now they skirted the northern coast of oahu mercer thought about the dead whales found there only a month ago the start of this whole chain reaction amazing how such an inane event sparked one of the greatest crises america might ever face do you have the coordinates rice asked his eyes never leaving the moonbathed waves below mercer read the coordinates of kenjis estate from the map provided by dick henna eddie rice punched them into the navigational computer waited as the machine processed them then glanced at the readout banking the helicopter he lifted her over the cliffs and headed inland the moonlit scenery below them was a gray blur the sea king beating through the sky at nearly knots at times below tree top level mercer trusted rices flying implicitly he had no choice they rocketed over mountains only to plunge down the other side the helicopter never more than a hundred feet from the ground ever done flying like this before mercer asked trying to act casual though his knuckles were white as he gripped the seat sure rice replied course that was in iraq where there werent as many mountains or trees or buildings to smear against mercer tightened his grip you ever done anything like this before asked rice sure mercer mimicked rices deep baritone course that was in iraq where there werent any wiseass pilots rice laughed then yanked the helicopter skyward to avoid a tall stand of trees thrusting up from the jungle as the terrain flattened out rice began to whistle mercer recognized the song as wagners ride of the valkyries he knew exactly how eddie felt were about ten miles from your coordinates rice announced a few minutes later okay the target is a compound in the middle of an old pineapple plantation there will be a clearing about two miles north it used to be an equipment storage area when the plantation was operational theres an abandoned shed on its southern edge well land there rice didnt reply he was watching the ground below the low jungle canopy retained a semblance of regimentation from when it had been planted fields he slowed the chopper to thirty knots there he said spotting the clearing as he crabbed the helicopter to starboard mercer saw the open ground a moment later an area of about an acre the abandoned metal building stood at its far end the corrugated roof sagging in the middle ugly country in thirty seconds mercer said into his microphone informing the seals in the cargo hold rice used the last scrap of jungle cover before bursting into the clearing the rotors kicked up a cloud of fine dust cutting visibility down to nothing he landed the big chopper by feel alone settling her as close to the building as possible had there been paint on the huge storage garage the teflon rotors would have scraped it off by the time mercer jumped from the chopper the seals had already secured the building and the surrounding area there was no one else in the vicinity the air was hot and incredibly humid mercers clothing stuck to his body like a clammy film and the chirping of insects sounded unnaturally loud after his hours in the chopper he buckled his combat harness around his lean waist cinching the shoulder straps so they were snug but not binding after pulling his mp from the duffel he threw the empty bag back into the chopper and turned to rice you know what to do ill wait here until you contact me rice held up a miniature walkietalkie given to him by one of the seals if i dont hear anything by five am im outta here right mercer looked at his watch in nine and a half hours the president would unleash the nuclear warhead and destroy the volcano two hundred miles north a few minutes after that hawaii would become an independent country mv john dory although she was forty feet under the surface the john dory still felt the turbulence above that rolled her about fifteen degrees port and starboard the radio operator clutched at a ceiling mounted support as he waited to gain captain zwenkovs attention zwenkov was once again in muted conference with the weapons officer going over the firing solutions for the vessels bowmounted siren missile for the tenth time captain the radio man interrupted flash message received from the mainland zwenkov turned cocking one bushy eyebrow in question the message read green repeated for five seconds sir very well zwenkov glanced at his watch hours this was the eleventh such message hed received hed expected the red code by now authorizing him to launch his missile but it had not come if it didnt come until the next scheduled contact in two hours he would barely make it to the hawaiian coast before dawn to extract the commandos all right weapons officer one more time if you please and they ran another plot for the nuclear missile evad lurbud collapsed the portable antenna and powered down his radio using his mangled left hand had caused a bright wave of blood to seep out from under his hastily applied bandage he let the pain wash over him gritting his teeth to keep from screaming that he had survived four hours since the attack on ohnishis house was due mainly to his extensive kgb training that he had survived the destruction of the house itself was little short of a miracle once the bombs had detonated and the glass house had begun to shatter lurbuds dive under the table on ohnishis breakfast balcony had saved his life the table had protected him from the exploding glass when the main structure of the house tumbled the balcony had fallen outward carrying lurbud with it he landed on the lawn forty feet below astonished to find himself alive but by no means had he escaped unscathed his right shoulder joint had dislocated and his legs torso and face were severely lacerated by shards of glass his right eye had been punctured so that the clear fluid within leaked down his face and dripped into the collar of his battle jacket with such massive injuries the bodys main defense is to go into shock but there are many forms of shock depending on the strength of the person as endorphins and adrenaline coursed through him lurbud struggled to remain conscious and focused after nearly twenty minutes lurbud began to move slowly at first he raised himself onto his hands and knees then to his feet all that remained of takahiro ohnishis palatial home were heaped piles of shattered glass and an empty skeleton of tubular struts lurbud staggered into the debris to search for the radio that would link him to the john dory where the scything weight of the falling building had sliced through a victim the mound of glass was stained crimson by gallons of blood in the dim moonlight the blood looked black but lurbud could tell that dozens of such bloody piles dotted the charnel ruin systematically he checked each body scraping off the accumulated glass with the butt of his weapon to expose a recognizable portion korean and russian alike had been diced so finely by the shards that easy identification was impossible with only fifteen minutes to spare before his next scheduled contact with the submarine he found the bloody mass that had once been his radio carrier of the man there was little more than strips of flesh but the radio in its armored plastic pack had survived the cascade undamaged propped against the sanguine heap lurbud made his first broadcast repeating the word green for five seconds finished he fell back against the pile shards and chips digging into his flesh unnoticed fighting the exhaustion brought on by the battle and loss of blood lurbud tended his wounds winding a bandage around his mangled hand and gently mopping his sightless eye socket to dull the ache growing in his skull he shot a full syringe of morphine into his arm from the medical kit the radio man had also carried he recognized immediately how one could become addicted to the drug despite the pain clawing at his tortured body his spirits had never been better he felt buoyed and knew that he would survive to have his revenge against kenji all else faded in importance to him the submarine the volcano even his own condition as long as he could have his revenge the van that the russians had used to get to ohnishis estate was only a mile or so away he could drive to kenjis house and make him pay dearly for the suffering hed caused lurbud was lucid enough to know that he had to continue to make regular calls to the john dory their action if he failed to report would surely jeopardize his chance at revenge on ohnishis former assistant it had taken him nearly two hours to stagger and crawl to where the van was hidden his mangled body leaving a vivid trail of blood across ohnishis estate the fifteenmile drive north had taken another hour and a half he had to stop about every ten minutes to allow his graying vision to return to normal now he lay in a shallow ditch no more than one hundred yards from kenjis home peering at it through nightvision binoculars the view dimmed and blurred from pain and effects of the morphine as he strained to focus his one functioning eye the sprawling twostory house was not nearly as grand as ohnishis but it was very impressive constructed of dressed stones coated in beige stucco the two main wings of the house spread from the central entrance like the blades of a boomerang each second floor window was a pair of french doors that opened onto narrow wroughtiron balconies the firebaked barrel tile roof and the expansive lawns betrayed the home as a former plantation from a bygone era a separate guest house sat on the other side of an olympicsized pool from the main structure after making his latest report lurbud knew that he had two hours to concentrate on kenji he was professional enough to realize that in his condition he was no match for the japanese killer he had to plan carefully kenjis martial arts skill would render anything less than a longrange rifle shot useless therefore a diversion was needed to bring the oriental out of his home and within range lurbud slithered further into the ditch to get a better view into the rooms and hoped that something would present itself hawaii way hue dong was the head of hydra consolidated the korean consortium that had bought the volcano from ivan kerikov his grandson chinhuy sat at kenjis desk smoking a fragrant romeo y julietta cigar he was young not much past twenty but he possessed the eyes of an old man eyes that had seen many things in the service of his family when his grandfather had ordered him to lead the fiftyman contingent of troops to hawaii chinhuy had not questioned merely obeyed his family had sent him and his older brothers to some of the most dangerous places on earth in search of profit whether it was poached ivory from wartorn angola or stolen artifacts from the ravaged jungles of central america the younger members of the family had responded with vigor and initiative this mission though potentially dangerous had proved quite easy for young chin his local contact kenji had done much of the work necessary to ensure that the family would not be bothered when they seized the volcano chins men held the airport under the auspices of hawaiis more fervent national guardsmen and few had had to be used at pearl harbor to incite the assembled students to open fire at the military compound the only difficulties had been at ohnishis house where more than twenty of his men had been cut down by a failed commando strike presumably american all in all chins role had been minor all that remained now was confirmation from the mining ship en route to the volcano that its target was in sight that would not take place for another ten hours or so once his family had possession of the volcano chin would recall his troops making sure that their withdrawal would bring a swift end to the states unrest the violence now gripping hawaii served only a limited purpose once the volcano was secure it was best that the islands quieted your rewards will be great kenji what do you plan to do with them kenji did not like the young man sitting languidly in his chair chin was brash uncouth and obnoxious do not speak too quickly everything is yet to be settled that commando team fell for your ruse perfectly they attacked the wrong house just as you planned chin waved his cigar in a dismissive gesture the volcano is within our grasp surely you no longer worry ivan kerikov believed that the volcano was within his grasp and takahiro ohnishi believed that hawaii was within his too both men were wrong i will not believe that we are successful until the mining vessel anchors at the volcano site ach chin said then launched into another story of his own bravery in the face of adversity he had told kenji nearly a dozen such stories earlier in the afternoon before kenji had set out to murder ohnishi chins tales of bravado had a whining tone to them as if daring kenji to doubt them since chin had not volunteered to lead his troops in the assault on ohnishis mansion kenji needed no proof of the boys true character kenji had grown weary of the stories and the boy yet listened as if rapt it was expected of him chin summed up if i could survive that and still keep the diamonds with me the whole time surely i will get us out of this kenji tightened his fists at his sides he could disembowel chin with his bare hands without raising a sweat and the idea was a pleasurable one but he had to maintain his composure his grandfather held kenjis fate after he escaped hawaii and he wouldnt jeopardize that for the mere pleasure of killing the boy all operations are different surely you know this because you survived many in the past does not mean you are protected in the present though not chastened by kenjis comment chin remained silent kenji was content to lean against the paneled wall of his study arms now crossed over his chest watching chin smoke his cigar his years of training had taught kenji to remain impassive no matter what the situation around him the tension within him would make a weaker man pace but kenji simply stood quiet and dangerous what of the woman chin said breaking the minutes long silence the reporter you have in the gardeners shed what about her she has refused to help us surely it is time for her to die yes maybe it is kenji said sadly i will do it chin volunteered i want her first take her kenji replied casually masking a sense of hurt at first kenji had entertained thoughts of taking jill tzu with him there was something in the defiant beauty of the woman that made kenji want to dominate her maybe it was because she knew of his korean birth he knew that she would never willingly be with him of course she could be drugged like that american woman hed rescued a week ago but kenji knew that that was not a solution jill had to be eliminated yet he had not been able to bring himself to do it chins lurid request was the perfect opportunity jill would die but her blood would not be on his hands chin pulled his small feet from the desk and slammed them against the carpeted floor kenji expected him to skip from the room like a spoiled child granted his favorite wish instead chin swaggered out eyeing kenji in an adolescent attempt at domination jill wasnt sure but it felt as if night had descended once again making this the fifth shed spent locked up inside the maintenance shed she could hear the incessant buzz of insects if she pressed her ear against the tiny crack under the door the slit was too narrow for her to look through not that it really mattered to her anymore what was another night after all shed entertained the thought of marking the floor by scratching the concrete with a sharp pebble to track the passage of time but decided that it wouldnt do her any good she knew shed be dead before there were even a few gouges shed asked herself over and over why she was willing to be killed rather than report the propaganda kenji had presented her with was her journalistic integrity worth more than her life were her priorities that messed up no she decided she could have done it spouted off whatever he told her she could have guaranteed her survival but afterward her life wouldnt really be worth living not because she would have helped that monster kenji and not because she would have deceived the public she would have disappointed herself and that was something she just couldnt do all her life she had faced the world according to her personal set of standards and not once had she ever broken her own rules if she had she would have been lying to herself jill remembered doing a report once on heroin use among teens in honolulu one junkie a sixteenyearold girl who supported her habit by hooking refused to admit she was addicted to drugs she accused jill of faking a photograph of her shooting up behind a sleazy hotel the girl had lied to herself so much that she couldnt even acknowledge the physical evidence of her problem shed told jill that the needle tracks on her arms were tattoos jill was afraid that if she broke her personal code she would end up as selfdelusioned as that junkie helping kenji even in an oblique way would be a violation of that code she couldnt do it wouldnt do it and would die for it her mind had sharpened during the solitude of the past few days driven by the same instincts which had kept mans ancient ancestors alive on the plains of prehistoric africa like any animal the human being can sense danger long before the threat is seen or heard jill knew that there was a new danger around her she could feel a malignancy in the air as surely as if it were a physical sensation she had first noticed it about an hour earlier primarily as a tightening of the atmosphere an almost electric sensation soon she noted more tangible evidence of a change there was an audible increase in the numbers of guards pacing around kenjis estate more pairs of footfalls on the raked gravel walk next to the shed that was her prison these new guards walked with a tighter cadence more vigilant than kenjis usual security but in the past half hour or so she had heard fewer and fewer people walking around as if the new guards were vanishing into the night she heard them walk past the building as if headed for the jungles edge but they never returned now she heard new footsteps there was an urgency in the strides jill knew instinctively where this man was headed the footsteps stopped outside the door and she heard keys jingling as merrily as a christmas chime the man thrust a key into the lock turned it violently and threw open the door jill had gotten to her feet and backed as far away from the door as possible the intruder was young no more than a boy but he carried himself with the negligent attitude of a world weary soldier cocky eyes and a leering slit of a mouth there was a pistol in a holster hanging from one bony hip he will rape me and then kill me she thought as if reporting an incident that happened to someone else i will be dead soon chinhuy approached his small hands flexing in nervous anticipation his eyes were dark spots on his face like those drawn by a cartoonist in them she saw no depth he drew closer massaging his crotch languidly his leer deepening by the moment jills attacker was small no more than fifteen or twenty pounds heavier than she she might have a chance fighting him off if only he left his pistol in its holster incredulous she watched as he undid the web belt and let it fall to the floor the pistol landing heavily against the concrete the door was open behind him beckoning her into the warm embrace of the night maybe she could duck past him before he could retrieve his weapon jills eyes shifted past his shoulder to look at the rectangle of open country beyond her prison and in that split second chinhuy covered the last few feet between them he struck her with a vicious roadhouse punch that drove her to the floor as if shed been hit by a baseball bat her connection to consciousness was just a thin strand a quick hand darted out and kneaded one of her breasts painfully this is not happening to me jill thought this is not me thats being touched chinhuy twisted her nipple viciously and she gasped the pain bringing her back from the dark realm that draped her mind she looked up into his face his teeth were crooked and stained his breath on her skin was hot and fast his eyes had narrowed to pinpoints and lust had suffused his face with dark blood in the millisecond it took her to blink away some of the tears flooding her eyes an arm had whipped around his neck and yanked him up off his feet by the time chin sensed something was wrong his windpipe had nearly been crushed he tried to whirl around and break the grip but the arm clung as tenaciously as a remora his body began to jerk and twitch as if controlled by a manic puppeteer he slammed back with one elbow but the blow lacked power and the man killing him didnt so much as grunt the arm tightened even more completely cutting off his air chinhuys tongue snaked from between his lips tearing against his teeth so that his saliva was stained pink with one final tug chins neck snapped with a nauseating crackle jill watched the man fall then her eyes scanned upward along the legs that stood behind the body of her wouldbe rapist when she reached the face of the man who saved her life she was greeted by a lazy smile and a pair of the most charming gray eyes she had ever seen if hes my only competition for your affection i bet youre free for dinner tomorrow night mercer grinned then bent down and checked the livid bruise spreading across jills cheek it was ugly and would last for a couple of weeks but wasnt serious her eyes were brightening so he wasnt too concerned about a concussion they were stunning deep and black with such a trusting expression that mercer looked into them much longer than absolutely necessary the emotions shed bottled up for five days poured out as jill ducked her head against his shoulder and cried he murmured to her reassuringly stroking her thick black hair youre safe now jill how do you know my name she asked meekly her cheeks slick with tears youre an unwitting victim in something much larger that im here to stop you know about takahiro ohnishi and his coup she said urgently her resiliency marveled him i know all about it mercer untangled her long arms from around his neck jill i have to leave you here for a while but im sure that nobody will bother you again he pointed to the dead soldier he was probably going to kill you so now everybody thinks youre dead when kenjis eliminated ill come back for you and well all get out of here together i have a helicopter waiting about two miles away i understand she said calmly whats your name most damsels call me lance a lot but you can call me mercer he smiled and was rewarded with one of jills christ even in her condition she was beautiful the corpse of the soldier was dragged out of the maintenance shed by one of the seals mercer closed the door but didnt relock it then regarded the body hes korean mercer exclaimed studying the mottled face i wonder who the hell he was the seals simply stared flatly not commenting on their approach to the shed mercer and his team had taken out eight asian guards some wearing fatigues like the figure at his feet and some wearing street clothing in the jungle they had not taken the time to closely examine their victims assuming that they were kenjis personal guards the discovery that the dead men were korean put a new twist on the situation i dont know who these guys belong to but well assume theyre not allies that means we still have kenjis guards plus these koreans mercer spoke more for his benefit than the seals i doubt they know were coming so we have the element of surprise but how effective is that against an unknown force mercer led them closer to kenjis compound using whatever natural cover they could find until they were tucked safely behind the guest house near them the azure pool shimmered with muted underwater lights kenjis house waited quietly twenty yards beyond the pool mercer surveyed the back of the twostory sprawling home through the nightvision goggles lent to him by one of the seals only a few rooms were illuminated but the glasses easily probed the darkened rooms as well through the greenish hue he saw at least fifteen armed men in the house slowly pacing through the rooms scanning the extensive grounds after about five minutes of studying the mansion he gave the commandos their orders they obeyed without question and left blending into the night waiting while the seals got into position was agonizing thoughts of fear and failure tried to weaken mercers resolve but he crushed them down mercilessly he had come too far to be afraid now he told himself yet even as he mentally prepared himself for the assault his mind drifted to a vision of jill tzu he chuckled at himself of all the times to be thinking about sex when the first crackling report of automatic fire rippled the silent sky he shook his head quickly and moved as ordered the seal team had crept around to the front of the house and opened fire raking the edifice with a scathing barrage mercer ran across the open back lawn praying that human nature would cause the men inside to turn toward the sounds leaving him undetected as his booted feet pounded across the grass he crouched in anticipation of a killing shot from the secondstory guards he covered the twenty yards to the house in record time mercer leapt onto an immature palm and shimmied up like a monkey feet and hands working in perfect harmony near its top his weight bowed the tree inward and he dropped easily onto an unguarded secondfloor balcony the sound of gunfire intensified at the front of the house as the seals and the guards traded ammunition at a staggering pace mercer kicked in one of the french doors and rolled across the rooms carpet in case there was an unseen guard stationed inside he came up onto his knees the mp tucked hard against his shoulder and scanned the room quickly empty he stripped off his goggles and took a few calming breaths the sounds of the fight below were barely muted by the thick walls of the plantation house he had just turned to reach for the door when he noticed a shadow bisect the sliver of light at the floor mercer rested his hand lightly on the polished brass knob and felt it twist beneath his fingers as the latch fully retracted he yanked on the handle and brought up his machine pistol the guard was caught unaware mercer pulled him into the room and jammed the barrel of the mp into his belly just as mercer felt himself being pushed backward by the mans weight he pulled the trigger the mm rounds tunneled through the guard boring a coneshaped wedge of flesh from his body that smeared against the wall behind him mercer yanked his bloodied weapon from the falling corpse and turned down the wide hall a fatiguedressed korean ducked out of one of the other rooms and mercer managed to snap off a burst that caught the man high in the back a quick check showed that one of the rounds had been fatal while the rest had just mangled the ornate millwork of the door frame he did a sweep of the rest of the upstairs the remainder of the elegant guest rooms in both wings of the mansion were deserted one floor below machine guns and grenades pummeled the masonry and shook the walls of the old plantation house mercer paused at the head of the stairs the acrid tang of cordite smoke searing his nostrils a stab of fear lanced through his body the battle below was like nothing hed ever heard before the ugly sounds of death echoing up the stairs his experiences in iraq and washington were nothing like this those times hed been ambushed and hadnt had time to think in the of ampc offices in new york he had felt more in control but this this hell was something different he was about to voluntarily walk into carnage and that terrified him grimly he descended the ornate mahogany stairs one finger squeezed firmly around the trigger of his mp just an ounce more pressure would unleash a hail of bullets in the mezzanine two bodies lay sprawled in the rubble of the blownout windows one dressed in fatigues the other one of kenjis men in a dark suit cloying smoke layered the air burning mercers eyes as he crouched just above the bottom of the staircase bullets and shrapnel whizzed by like angered wasps obviously the seals assault had lost none of its fervor in an adjoining room someone screamed in pain mercer knew thanks to the plans provided by dick henna that the wailing originated in a formal reception area mercer didnt realize someone had spotted him until a stream of bullets tore into the railing and banister near him shredding the wood like a chain saw he tumbled down the remaining steps ducking his head and hunching his shoulders as he landed on the marble floor he glimpsed the assassin silhouetted in the doorway to the dining room mercer fired but only one round went off before his clip emptied the shot caught the korean in the shoulder and spun him nearly completely around but left him very much alive he started to turn back toward mercer uzi clutched in his hands mercer launched himself from the floor diving across a rich turkish carpet while reaching for his holstered beretta as he flew the move threw off the guards aim giving mercer time to torque himself as he landed and pump four or five rounds into him mercer reholstered the beretta and jammed a fresh clip into his machine pistol he ducked around the doorway leading to the reception area taking out three guards who were crouched under the shattered windows from the plans he knew kenjis study was on the other side of the entrance foyer several rooms past the dining room another guard spotted him as he raced back across the foyer and bullets tore up the marble at his heels mercer jinked once then dove into the dining room landing on a table large enough to seat twenty the table had been beautifully set mercers momentum shattered the ornate royal doulton china turning it into a very expensive pile of trash on the polished wood floor he tumbled over the far side of the table knocking three chairs onto their backs he knelt up steadying his h ampk on the table shards of china dug deeply into the toughened skin of his knees through his black pants an explosion ripped through the foyer as the seals blew out the solid front door a pall of smoke roiled into the dining room and the korean who had just fired at mercer staggered into the room obviously hed been standing near the door when it shattered and the wood splinters had torn through his body mercers dispatching shot was a relief to the pitiable figure mercer smashed through the door to the kitchen there was more blood on the floor than in an abattoir crimson smears streaked the walls and pooled under the two bodies crumpled below a blownout window the seals certainly knew their business mercer returned to the dining room and cautiously nudged open the other exit door the room beyond reeked of smoke flames licked at the ceiling from a destroyed television set a few yards beyond a large leather sectional couch one of kenjis guards feebly tried to lift his weapon from where he lay but he was missing a massive chunk of his left shoulder blood streamed from the wound dispassionately mercer fired a short burst between the mans hatefilled eyes the other guard in the informal living room a uniformed korean was already dead mercer took a few deep breaths as he changed clips glancing at his watch he noted with surprise that only six minutes had elapsed since he had started running for the palm tree in the backyard the adrenaline fizzing in his veins had made it seem more like six hours yet each moment was etched into his brain like frames of film outside the battle was dying down either the ranks of seals or guards had dwindled to nothing he had no way of knowing beyond the living room a wide windowlined gallery stretched the length of the northern wing of the house the seals had shot out the tall transomed windows to his right so the air was free of smoke opposite the windows french doors opened into other rooms a booklined library a silkdraped billiards room a small cinema that had probably been the music room when the house was built at the turn of the century the last door of the gallery led to kenjis study mercer stealthily made his way along the promenade quickly checking each room he passed the door just before the study was open and as mercer approached a foot kicked out with incredible strength the mp flew from his grip tearing some meat off his right index finger where it had caught on the trigger guard before he had time to react a fist pounded into him catching him just below the heart mercers breath exploded in a wheezing gasp he staggered back a few paces massaging his ribs kenji stepped into the corridor wearing a black gi and no shoes his dark eyes blazed with pure hatred as he gazed at the occidental interloper i do not know who you are but i will take great pleasure in killing you for what youve done his voice echoed from someplace deep within an empty chasm which contains normal mens souls kenji had none mercer struggled to draw his pistol but kenji paced forward cutting the distance between them in the blink of an eye his foot flicked out with the speed of a vipers tongue and the beretta spun away as mercers right hand went numb though kenji was nearly twenty years his senior mercer had no hope of defeating him even if mercer hadnt been battered so much in the past week kenji would still be able to take him apart at a leisurely pace are you another of kerikovs errand boys kenji asked mildly cracking a hardened foot against mercers ribs mercer fell against the wall clutching at the rough stucco to keep himself on his feet his chest felt as if it had been worked over with a baseball bat what are you talking about he gasped a fist slammed into mercers stomach doubling him over into kenjis knee which shot upward into his face kenji spun away as mercer went sprawling onto the flagstone floor did kerikov send you with those assassins at ohnishis house mercer retched painfully a trace of blood in the rancid bile that shot from his mouth and nose kenjis questions had thrown him off as much as the brutal hits hed taken dazed by the punches and kicks he wasnt sure he had heard correctly im not with your russian allies kenji kicked again but mercer managed to block the shot with his arm kenji was thrown off balance by the move giving mercer precious seconds to regain his feet where are your russian sponsors anyway mercer asked through gritted teeth as kenji stalked around him kenji gave a derisive laugh as dead as ohnishi he threw a combination punch at mercer the first blow knocking against mercers skull and the other cracking two more ribs despite the pain mercer managed a counterpunch but his fist felt like it merely bounced off the muscled cords of kenjis throat like ohnishi the russians were pawns to be used and discarded by myself and my true allies the koreans mercer wheezed understanding a bit they have backed me for months in a doublecross against both ivan kerikov and ohnishi kenji wasnt even breathing hard while mercer was sucking in great draughts of air we triggered ohnishi and kerikovs pathetic coup and shifted american interest away from the volcano and its mineral wealth to kerikov the coup was a means to an end for ohnishi it represents a lifelong dream to us it was simply a diversion you piggybacked onto kerikovs plan took his idea and his agents for yourselves then it was you who rescued tish talbot from the ocean seeker mercer had to keep kenji talking in a vain hope that a seal was still alive to save him as ordered by kerikov for the benefit of valery borodin i believe but she has no use in my plan so my allies hired some assassins to execute her in washington not quite mercer managed a wry smile she is very much alive and well you yes no matter ill have her killed later on the fuck you will mercer said hatred giving him a reckless courage he dove at kenji slamming a shoulder into his chest both men flew backward pounding into the wall hard enough to break away some of the plaster mercer recovered an instant before kenji and fired three heavy punches into the older mans muscled torso kenji grunted with each blow but still had the strength to pick mercer off his feet and toss him away mercer scrambled up as quickly as he could his cracked ribs keeping him slightly doubled over i thought killing ohnishi would give me the greatest pleasure but now i realize your death will be even better kenji said menacingly as he came for mercer kenjis kick contained every ounce of strength in his body it was a killing blow mercer bent backward the instant kenjis foot rose ignoring the pain that exploded in his chest with the movement as he straightened back up his hand reached for the gerber knife suspended from his harness the steel pommel of the knife cracked against kenjis foot with all the strength mercer had left the blow shattered the delicate bones as though they were glass checking kenjis attack mercer whipped the knife upward in a last desperate lunge the tempered steel parted kenjis abdominal muscles sliced through the tough membrane of his diaphragm and punctured his left lung kenji reeled back yanking the knife from mercers fingers he stared down at the blade sticking from his chest with crazed and panicked eyes you he sputtered blood spraying with his word mercer had fallen to the floor after his attack he was too weak to rise so when kenji pulled the knife from his body and turned the bloody blade at him he had no defense the savagery was draining from kenji as fast as his lifes blood but he still had enough time to kill his last victim mercer lay sprawled like a temple sacrifice arms at his sides legs slightly parted he could not avoid the blade plunging toward his chest the kinetic energy of the first bullet arrested kenjis downward thrust and nearly stood him upright the second shot tore another hole through his chest shredding his heart and damaged lung the final shot blew out the back of his skull mercer twisted around in time to see one of the seals bloody and battered fall to the floor a full sixty seconds passed before mercer recovered enough to get up and check on the wounded seal when he turned him onto his back mercer was staggered the man who had saved his life wasnt a seal at all through a mask of dried and caked blood the unknown man opened his one undamaged eye spesivo the use of russian shocked mercer for a second then he understood kerikov no the man coughed up a bloody ball of phlegm and spat it on the floor i am evad lurbud major in the kgb department seven and ivan kerikovs assistant thank you for allowing me to kill that pig where is kerikov mercer demanded sharply last i knew he was headed toward europe now who knows you are a member of the american special forces yes im the guy who blew your entire operation lurbud chuckled painfully i doubt that no man could stop every contingency we laid down i bet your men in new york wouldnt agree with you that was you mercer smiled modestly it was nothing really but it did lead to all sorts of interesting things little things like disguised submarines named john dory manmade volcanoes and longdead scientists who do great lazarus impressions mercer could tell that lurbud was truly shocked to see how much he knew you guys made just enough small errors for me to figure out your little caper mercer ticked of each item on a finger when tish talbot was pulled aboard the john dory she saw the design on her stack and heard her crew speaking russian then you used an of ampc ship for her official rescue which made it easy to find the connection to the grandam phoenix the ship you bastards started the whole operation with and you didnt watch valery borodin closely enough since he managed to send off the telegram that got me involved i guess you can ultimately blame him for your failure without that telegram no one would have ever suspected a thing too bad that your agents here in hawaii turned on you its wise when picking allies to be certain of their true motivations ohnishi wanted an independent country more than he wanted the volcano and kenji he must have had his reasons for bringing in those koreans mercer had retrieved his weapons and now had the mp pointed at lurbuds chest you cant kill me why in the hell not mercer replied casually if i dont radio the john dory in an hour and a half she will launch a nuclear missile at the volcano mercer noticed the black radio pack wedged under lurbuds body he jerked it out by its nylon strap and held it at arms length letting the hechler amp koch dangle by its sling he drew the beretta then calmly fired two rounds through the armored plastic shell the radio sparked and smoked for a moment as it shorted completely he dropped the radio next to lurbuds head any other bargaining chips i am a major in the kgb i am worth much to the cia assuming i work for the cia must be an infectious disease youre the third or fourth person to think that too bad mercer aimed his pistol im a geologist he said as he fired the last round from the beretta not a spy mercer wearily started back down the gallery toward the main entrance of the house he believed lurbud about the nuclear threat from the john dory if kenji and his korean allies had somehow doublecrossed kerikov he had no doubt that the russian spymaster would reap some form of revenge destroying the volcano and the bikinium made the best sense the hour and a half time limit would make things extremely tight he was just passing the last transomed window before the living room when a figure crashed through the remaining glass and fragile mullions mercer dove to the side twisting in the air to bring the mp up to bear the attacker hit the floor rolled and came to his knees in an instant his gun aimed at mercers head mercer was a fraction of a second too slow the man had him pinned im sorry if i scared you dr mercer i wasnt sure who you were from outside the leader of the seals apologized and lowered his weapon jesus mercer breathed his heart slamming against his rib cage i was too petrified to be scared the seals uniform was so tattered it was nearly unrecognizable a wound in his shoulder bled freely his face was streaked with dirt and dried blood despite the pain he must have felt his eyes were impassive whats the situation mercer asked all the guards are dead the building is secure but i lost my entire squad im sorry about that mercer said getting to his feet its our duty sir radio the chopper and have the pilot land in the backyard ive got some more work tonight while the seal made the call mercer wandered through the dining room and into the kitchen ignoring the two bodies on the floor he searched through the three large refrigerators until he found something decent to drink though kirin beer was far from his favorite he gulped two bottles in record time a minute later he was in the backyard skirting the edge of the pool jill tzu had left the shed when the firing had stopped and was hiding near the guest house when she saw mercer striding across the back lawn behind him the main house burned in several places the fiery light making his features appear sharp and uncompromising the sea king thundered in over the grounds its blinding searchlight playing across the estate as eddie rice searched for a clear place to set her down reaching jill mercer took her into his arms she clung to him tightly unaware that mercers ribs grated against each other as she squeezed everything is all right now youre safe kenjis dead she nuzzled her head into his shoulder as if she were a small creature burrowing into the earth for protection jill i have to leave you here with one of my men for a while jill looked up into his face with beautiful but frightened eyes cant you take me with you i cant theres still a lot for me to finish mercer said then kissed her tenderly thats to let you know i would if i could and that im coming back mercer untangled her arms from around his body and nodded to the seal try to contact the inchon somehow maybe through pearl harbor and have another team sent here dont trust any local authorities also guard her with your life he jogged to the waiting chopper and vaulted into its hold eddie lifted off immediately sweeping the chopper over the dark jungle in the cockpit mercer threw on a helmet keying the mike immediately head north as fast as this bitch can move eddie banked the chopper then turned to mercer grinning i dont think youre gay so that must have been a woman you were kissing just then where the hell did you find a woman in the middle of that fight you just gotta know where to look mercer chuckled in the murky light of the cockpit he opened the last two beers hed taken from the kitchen and handed one to eddie not when im flying the pilot demurred im not with the faa or the navy dont worry about it good point eddie replied and took a long swallow did those seals have any dive equipment on board yeah like you asked i went through their stuff while i was waiting theres air tanks regulators masks the works good mercer pulled a slip of paper from his pants pocket and handed it to rice whats this the loran numbers of a russian submarine about to start a nuclear war mercer had mentally calculated the position of the john dory from the infrared pictures provided by the national security agency punch them in and follow them problem eddie said after keying the loran numbers into the sea kings navigational computer we have enough fuel to get out there but not enough for the return flight theres a good chance there wont be a return flight whyd i know youd say that eddie muttered an hour later the chopper was thundering over the ocean swells a driving rain pelting the windscreen of the sea king like grenade fragments the wipers were all but useless occasionally a bolt of lightning arced through the sky casting a brilliant incandescence into the cockpit mercer sat quietly in a borrowed navy wet suit content to let eddie rice do his job it had been torture getting himself into the constricting neoprene but now the tightness around his chest eased the pain from his cracked ribs unconsciously his hand polished the barrel of his machine pistol as if he were at home working on a piece of railroad track hundreds of questions roiled in his mind questions about kenji the koreans kerikov and lurbud but he could not allow himself to become distracted by them he had to remain completely focused on the present and let the past sort itself out later he and eddie were racing against an imminent nuclear launch failing meant not only their deaths but also the loss of one of mans greatest discoveries the benefits of the bikinium were too great to let slip away now and on a personal level mercer wouldnt allow himself to fail hed suffered too much in the past week to not see this completed successfully whats our eta about another ten minutes mercer glanced at the luminous dial of his tag heuer according to lurbuds threat the john dory launches in thirty im already ten knots over the safety limits of this bird in these conditions make it twenty knots over and that mai tai you wanted will be on me christ i could use it now eddie replied miserably as he torqued more power out of the turbofans the chopper rocked and jerked in the storm as rice fought to keep her below the john dorys radar her rounded nose nearly skimmed the white spume atop the waves bingo eddie nearly shouted a minute later target dead ahead whats the range one mile eddie said glancing again at the neon blue radar screen thats got to be her take us down ill swim the rest of the way when i jump out take off again but be ready to pick me up when that ship blows approach from the stern and make sure no one else gets aboard except me and the man ill have with me i told you we dont have enough fuel to get back to hawaii that doesnt matter someone will figure out were here eventually mercer didnt want to tell eddie that if the seal failed to get through to pearl harbor the president would launch his own nuclear strike against the volcano in just three hours youre crazy you know that its the main reason i cant get life insurance the sea kings engines wound down and the rotors whipped the sea into a salty mist as rice brought her in for a water landing mercer waited at the open doorway of the chopper sweating in the wet suit the two large air tanks bowing his back around his waist he wore a leaded belt and a waterproof bag containing some other items borrowed from the seals a razorsharp dive knife was strapped to his right calf the whole time mercer had struggled into the gear he had wracked his brain trying to recall everything that spook had taught him about diving all those years ago in that flooded new york mine as soon as the rounded underhull of the sea king touched the churnedup water mercer bit down on his mouthpiece sucked in a breath of cool air and launched himself out of the chopper the water was warmer than he expected at first mercer sank below the surface then he adjusted his buoyancy by detaching one of the lead weights he took a bearing from the compass on his wrist and still underwater started swimming toward the john dory mercer had made two potentially fatal assumptions when he launched himself from the sea king one was that the ship they had picked up on radar was in fact the john dory there was a definite possibility that the craft ahead of him was an entirely different ship one innocently steaming through the area the second assumption concerned the hull of the soviet submarine freighter if there was no gap between the submarines hull and the fake sides of the freighter he would have no way of gaining access to the vessel if he was wrong about either guess he would be dead long before the russian missile detonated after a few minutes of swimming mercer felt a vibration through the water the pounding engines of a large ship adding a little air to the compensator he surfaced on the crest of a swell through the rainlashed night he made out the running lights of a large freighter about two hundred yards ahead of him his breath hissed through the regulator rain and spume splattered against his mask he ducked back under the surface and continued to doggedly swim toward the john dory the backs of his legs were beginning to ache and his breathing was labored the sound of the ships props filled the silence of the sea but the vessel itself was still hidden in the gloom mercer was hesitant to turn on his dive light for fear of being detected by a lookout on deck but at last he took the chance the knifeedge bow of the john dory was no more than ten feet away and bearing down on him at eight knots mercer dove hard but his reaction came an instant too late the steel plates of the ships bow scraped along his body shredding the thick rubber of his wet suit the thick crust of barnacles grated against mercers skin like a thousand tiny paring knives mercer screamed into his mouthpiece as pain shot through his system racing through his body to explode against the top of his skull he felt the gray blanket of unconsciousness falling over his mind but managed to push it aside by sheer force of will he wouldnt allow pain to stop him now he had only a few seconds in which to find a handhold of some sort before the vessel passed him and if that happened he had no chance of ever catching her training the dive light upward mercer recognized the smooth curve of a submarines hull at least he had the right ship he flashed the light to starboard and saw a space between the freighter silhouette and the subs hull he swam into the gap when his head broached the surface he spat out his mouthpiece and gulped down the warm humid air trapped between the steel plating and the sub the water in the fourfootwide gap was churned in a vortex that carried mercer along with the ship since he did not have the luxury of time he didnt bother glancing at his watch he was certain that the sub was getting into position to fire the missile he immediately set to work the magnetic limpet mines hed pilfered from the seals stores stuck to the hull with a quiet snap the timers had all been set and as each one made contact with the subs hull it went active as soon as the explosive charges were planted mercer began climbing the spiderweb of steel girders that locked the bogus freighter hull to the submarine because of his injured ribs and the scuba gear hanging from his back the climb was exhausting he wished he could dump the dive equipment but if he hoped to escape with valery borodin he needed it at the top of the girders he paused to look at his watch four minutes until launch shit the sharp steel struts had ripped into his hands blood poured from the wounds and dripped onto the deck where mercer stood just forward of the submarines conning tower the empty superstructure of the freighter soared thirty feet above his head the cavernous space echoed with the hiss of water sliding across her hull and the beat of her props the nearly total darkness smelled of diesel oil and saltwater as quietly as possible mercer stashed his scuba gear and dive fins in a corner two minutes he crept up the ladder of the rounded conning tower as he neared the top he made out muted voices the language was unmistakably russian he popped his head over the top of the conning tower and gave a friendly smile to the two shocked officers standing at the open hatch take me to your leader mercer grinned exhaustion and the adrenaline he was using as a substitute for real courage had made him giddy the two officers produced pistols in record time leveling them at mercers head one of them shouted down into the sub though mercer did not speak russian he assumed that the captain had just been informed that they had a prisoner prompted by curt gestures from a pistol barrel mercer went down the hatchway and into the soviet submarine at the base of the ladder mercer casually glanced around the vessels control room by the slackjawed looks and the lack of movement he rightly guessed that the launch had been suspended for the moment hi my names barney cull mercer stuck out his hand but no one made a move to shake it im offering a sale on hull scraping and wondered if you needed my services captain zwenkov stepped forward his face set in a deep scowl who are you his english was thick but understandable actually im sam o var your local coffee wagon company representative how are you guys fixed for blinis zwenkov said something that in any language would have sounded like get him out of here and lock him up mercer was hustled from the control room by two armed sailors he called over his shoulder dont think strongarm tactics will get me to lower my prices he would have continued with the jokes but the pistol stabbing into his kidney jammed the air in his throat he was led through the sub toward the stern thankfully away from where he had planted the charges he was stripped of his wet suit and after a rather extensive body search one of his guards undogged a hatch and thrust mercer into a small cabin the hatch was closed behind him but not locked in the spartan room a man a few years younger than mercer sat on one of the bunks he was handsome in that connecticut shore hair blowing in the wind sweater knotted around the throat kind of way mercer assumed correctly that this was valery borodin borodin said something to mercer in russian sorry i dont speak it mercers use of english drained the color from valerys face i said youre not a member of the boats crew who are you im philip mercer the guy you sent the telegram to who valerys eyes narrowed in confusion philip mercer you sent a telegram to me in washington warning me about the danger to tish talbot tish sent you valery stood his voice brightening no you sent me mercer was getting confused himself i dont know who you are but you know tish you didnt send a telegram to me in tishs fathers name no just after you had her rescued from the ocean seeker no if you didnt then who the hell did mercer muttered well anyway im here to help you get off this tin can did tish ask you to come not exactly but shes safe and waiting for you right now in washington dc theres no way to escape were hundreds of miles from hawaii listen in thirty seconds this sub is going to have more holes in it than the golf course at pebble beach ive got a helicopter waiting for us so dont worry about it wheres your father he died two days ago heart attack for the pain hes caused dont expect my condolences mercer glanced at his watch and held up his right hand with fingers splayed as each second ticked by he curled one finger downward with two fingers to go several explosions rocked the john dory immediately klaxons sounded throughout the sub the dim battle lights blinked once then shut off completely a single white bulb lit as the emergency system took over above the wail of the sirens and the shouts of men mercer could hear the sound of water pouring into the vessel signaling her impending death mercer thrust his hand down the front of his pants ignoring valerys startled look few body searches ever explore the area between the scrotum and anus as mercers fingers grasped the fourbarrel pepperbox derringer pistol held there by his jock strap he was thankful that homophobia struck russians too the gun a favorite of nineteenthcentury riverboat gamblers because of its small size had been a gift from his grandfather years before and had remained in mercers desk at home since then he yanked the tiny pistol from his pants mindful of the stray hairs caught in the guns hammer although the derringer was only twentytwo caliber it was loaded with boredout hollowpoints filled with mercury at a range of more than ten feet the gun was useless closer a hit would be fatal are you coming the sub was already listing valery grabbed a cheap briefcase from the bunk yes im with you they stepped into the boats central passageway valery clutching the briefcase to his chest like a mother protecting her baby panicked sailors and officers ran down the narrow corridor ignoring everything except their own safety mercer and valery blended into the stream of men rushing to the nearest hatch bursting into the control room mercer saw captain zwenkov leaning over the weapons officer they were still going to launch the nuclear missile instinct made zwenkov turn around and face his executioner the report from the derringer was lost in the sounds of the dying vessel and her crew but the bullet tore through the captains head cleanly his cap flew through the air carried by the top section of his skull the bloodsplattered weapons officer whirled in his seat but before he could move a round caught him in the throat ripping out his carotid artery and jugular vein sending a fountain of blood across the ballistic control computer a crewman grabbed mercer from behind mercer whipped around smashing his elbow into the mans jaw blood and broken teeth sprayed from the russians lips another man this one wearing the coveralls of an engineer charged forward and mercer shot him point blank in the heart the little fourbarreled pistol had only one round left and mercer didnt have any spare ammunition valery come on with valery close behind mercer shouldered his way to the hatch shoving kicking and punching his way to the bottom of the ladder on deck the list of the submarine was much more noticeable at least twenty degrees mercer guessed that the vessel would flip onto her back in moments the confused mass of men on the deck were too busy trying to launch an inadequate number of life rafts to notice mercer as he led valery to the cache of scuba equipment the din of the klaxons echoed across the storm chopped sea theres only one set of tanks valery pointed out well buddy dive mercer said slipping the heavy tanks over his shoulders but ive never dived before thats okay this is only my second time so were almost even mercer shoved valery into the gap between the sub and the outer plating and leapt after him losing his mask in the plunge in the water mercer slipped valerys hand through the straps of the scuba tank so they would not get separated in the confusion explosions rumbled within the subs hull and burning oil filled the narrow gap with reeking smoke mercer worried fleetingly about the very real danger that the nuclear power plant would melt down from the shock of cool seawater washing over its fivehundreddegree shielding there will be a helicopter a few hundred yards directly astern if we stay underwater we wont be spotted a bullet plowed into the sea a few inches from mercers head throwing up a tiny fountain of water mercer fired the last round from the derringer into the gloom above them grasped valerys free arm and ducked beneath the waves he kicked downward breathing as slowly as possible about fifteen feet below the surface he felt valery tug the regulator from his mouth the russian took a few breaths then thrust the rubber piece back between his lips the john dory was mortally wounded but her engines still pounded out eight knots mercer and valery hung below the surface as the foot hull glided over their heads the concussion from the blasts that were wrenching her apart assaulted their ears painfully but they had no time to worry about its effects they began swimming away from the stricken vessel their progress was impeded by the turbid swells and their need to trade the lifegiving mouthpiece after five minutes mercer brought them to the surface the john dory was a few hundred yards away and it was easy to see she was sinking her bow rode deep and her props thrashed the water into a white froth as they were pulled from the ocean only two of the lifeboats had been launched and the crew seemed too occupied picking up survivors and corpses to care about the huge helicopter that swooped in overhead eddie rice settled the sea king into the water and let the rotors idle mercer could see the pilot scramble to the cargo door of the sikorsky machine rice popped open a large drum of oil and spilled it onto the water the churnedup sea settled immediately under the weight of the fluid mercer and valery swam toward the helicopter their heads repeatedly swamped by the storm both men retched seawater regularly they were only twenty yards from the machine when one of the lifeboats began motoring their way eddie mercer screamed into the night get ready to take off the pilot must have heard mercer because he vanished from the hatch the last fifteen yards of the swim were the most agonizing moments in mercers life the pain in his body was unbearable his lungs burned his arms felt like lead and saltwater had closed his eyes to slits he dug deep within himself searching for any last reserves of stamina to keep him going there wasnt much left but still he swam on with valery right beside him the outboard motor of the life raft was getting louder as the small craft drew near neither man dared look back suddenly they burst into the calmed pool of oil that eddie rice had laid down the choppers rotors were beginning to beat harder mercer and valery swam the last few yards on will alone valery tossed his fathers briefcase into the open door and clung desperately to the side of the chopper his lungs pumping for air mercer shoved him into the craft and stole a glance over his shoulder the john dorys life raft was only about twenty yards behind and closing fast mercer knew hed never clamber into the chopper before the soviets were upon them tell the pilot to take off he shouted and let go of the sea king valery was nowhere to be seen mercer assumed that the russian had passed out as soon as he was inside he was wrong valery reappeared in the doorway a machine pistol held firmly to his flank he fired a long devastating burst at the life raft bullets and screams piercing the night when the clip was empty he held the weapon out to mercer mercer grasped the proffered gun stock and hauled himself to the chopper he hooked an arm through valerys and the younger man hoisted him aboard mercer didnt even take time to catch his breath he grabbed a headset and wheezed into the microphone go eddie goddamn it go only after the sea king lifted from the water toward hawaii did mercer collapse to the deck his eyes glazed over his lungs nearly in convulsions valery sat down next to him drained by exhaustion and an adrenaline overdose my father told me that years ago he had stood by and watched as a lifeboat full of men was machinegunned like that he said that the men died for russias greater glory even though they werent russian now i have done the same for what for the best reason of all mercer gasped to save your own ass he got to his feet and staggered to the open cargo door wind and rain whipping around his body he closed the door and returned to valerys side tell me are you sure you didnt send that telegram positive i wonder mercer mused and then passed out arlington virginia mercer sat at the back corner booth of tinys and slowly swirled his vodka gimlet so the cubes of ice clicked discreetly he took a swallow and placed the glass back on the scarred tabletop his movements were slow deliberate it had been three weeks since eddie rice had ditched his sea king into the pacific nearly a hundred miles from hawaii and his body was still stiff and battered mercer fractured a leg during the impact and eddie had given himself a severe concussion and turned his face into a vermillion patchwork of bruises and lacerations the chopper pilot was still bedridden at the pearl harbor naval hospital valery borodin wasnt so much as scratched during the crash he swiveled his head and surveyed the room tiny was out of sight behind the bar searching for something or other there were four or five other patrons workers from the local trucking firm looking at them mercer felt vaguely conspicuous not sporting a baseball cap or at least a cigarette umber light slashed through the windows as the sun dropped beneath the smoggy horizon mercer had been back in washington just long enough to jam a clear pin into hawaii on the map at home call dick henna to set up this meeting at tinys and give himself a decent buzz he drained the last of his drink and called to tiny for another the three gimlets already wending their way through his body were dulling the pain in his bruised joints richard henna came through the front door just as tiny set the new drink in front of mercer henna wore a dark suit and tie his eyes hidden by the dark glasses seen on all fbi agents in the movies mercer stood slowly supporting himself with one hand on the table as henna crossed the room to his booth i see youre alive if not well henna shook his hand and the two men sat henna removed his glasses and glanced around the dingy room his expression matched one mercer had made once in a public toilet in istanbul lovely place you have here henna said sarcastically it has its charms mercer grinned they water down the beer with bourbon ill stick to scotch tiny scotch and he looked at henna cocking an eyebrow neat scotch and scotch so where have you been since the navy fished you out the explosions that sunk the john dory had been heard by the sonar aboard the uss jacksonville the los angelesclass attack submarine attached to the kitty hawk battle group she was the vessel poised to launch a nucleartipped tomahawk cruise missile at the rising volcano the sub raced to investigate the blasts and in the process found the sinking sea king and three passengers after an hour of argument with the captain radio communication with the commander of the pacific fleet and finally intervention by admiral morrison the jacksonville abandoned her mission and headed for hawaii i stayed in hawaii until just this afternoon a little rest and relaxation more like recovery and research henna thought better than to press for mercers meaning how are you feeling not bad the cast on my leg came off yesterday and my ribs are okay as long as i dont try to sing opera henna smiled then thanked tiny as his drink came i see how this place gets its name he used to be a jockey mercer pointed out so whats been happening in hawaii you were there you should know better than me no i was up north on kauai near a town called hanalei cut off from just about everybody and everything the only news i heard was on the flight from la to washington and even then i wasnt really paying attention well let me fill you in a little bit henna shrugged out of his jacket and laid it next to him on the booth the state hell the whole nation was stunned when we told them exactly what had happened the president decided to come clean on the whole affair from ohnishi to kerikov to the bikinium valery borodin was at the press conference at pearl harbor to back him up the cia found some old photographs of evad lurbud to match his corpse found at kenjis estate of course we needed two undertakers to make his body look human again after what hed been through the russians deny all knowledge of the operation codenamed vulcans forge but admitted that ivan kerikov was known for operating outside government sanction you said was known is he dead no hes vanished he was in thailand then went to switzerland but from there no one knows he simply disappeared the russians are looking for him now as well as the cia and interpol hell turn up dont count on it if hes cagey enough to nearly succeed with an operation like this he can easily stay lost too maybe youre right i dont know henna nodded slowly remember though theres also a group of very pissedoff koreans after him have you been able to find out who was behind the korean angle we got nothing from the bodies at ohnishis house but the guy found near the gardeners shed at kenjis was the grandson of way hue dong one of the seven richest men in the world to further link him to what happened the day after you were rescued a small flotilla of ships one of them specially designed for hightemperature dredging and all owned by one of ways companies arrived at the volcano site you better believe they were surprised to see the us navy already there with a carrier and a halfdozen support ships ways already lodged a formal complaint with the world court at the hague but he doesnt stand a chance of taking the bikinium from us as for hawaii itself there was one more night of rioting after your raid but that was it without the koreans or ohnishi to act as agitators the mobs lost their will to fight and pretty much just went home hawaiis senators have both resigned claiming health problems but it was either that or face prosecution for treason the president has pardoned all others involved and a special task force has been set up to deal with any legitimate claims by the hawaiians he felt it best to sweep the violence under the rug rather than make the nation relive it for months in the courts in all about three hundred people died during the riots the presidents going to ramrod some funding through congress to try to end a lot of the racial tension in this country education programs urban aid that sort of thing the los angeles riots and now this recent crisis have finally brought people to their senses the old adage united we stand divided we fall almost came true and its scared enough people who want to really do something about it with the current conciliatory mood in congress hell get all the funding he needs mercer interrupted you cant change peoples opinions with new laws and federal spending thirty years ago doctors were advertising the health benefits of cigarettes henna countered touche it will take some time but at least we are finally on the right track no one wants the type of ethnic strife thats tearing apart central europe and the old soviet republics weve maintained racial diversity for two hundred years and were not going to let it slip away now america is famous for pulling through a crisis just as things reach bottom and well do it again i hope youre right henna took a swig of his drink valery borodin is with our own people at the volcano assaying the parts of it now above the surface to see where to begin mining the bikinium i believe dr talbot is with him she is as a favor to me the president had her flown out there two weeks ago i spoke to her on the phone yesterday just before my flight back to washington she and valery have rekindled the passion they once felt already theyre talking marriage henna smirked kind of funny you were the hero in all of this i thought it was customary for the hero to get the girl at the end when they make the television miniseries ill make sure they change the ending mercer replied offhandedly well dont think youre going to come out of this completely emptyhanded henna fished a set of keys from his pocket and tossed them to mercer what are these the keys to a new black sjx jaguar convertible with tan interior cellular phone cd player and an aftermarket turbo charger it was the least we could do mercer looked at the keys and gave henna a sardonic smile after getting me shot at a few dozen times nearly smeared against a train almost drowned beaten up more than once crashed into the ocean and within a few minutes of being nuked youre right buying me a new car is the very least you could do henna knew by mercers tone that he wasnt really angry and gave a low chuckle the cars parked in front of your house there are two things i want to know how did you know to go to kenjis house rather than ohnishis and how in the hell did you pinpoint the john dory when the experts at nsa couldnt find a damn thing mercer smiled slyly finding the john dory was easy those infrared photos showed a classic shield volcano a number of small vents surrounding a central magma outlet normally those smaller vents are located on the side of the volcano and therefore under deeper water well on all of the photos there was a white hot signature nearly a mile from the central vent at that distance the thermal image would be yellow or orange cooler because of the water depth that white dot couldnt have been a natural vent it had to be something manmade like the nuclear reactor aboard the john dory as she rode near the surface henna was impressed and what about kenji that was a hunch really but i felt confident i worked for ohnishi as a consultant a few years ago in tennessee ohnishi minerals was interested in buying the second mining rights to some disused property owned by the tennessee valley authority second mining is when the coal pillars that support the mine tunnels are ripped down to their very weakest tolerances its dangerous work and caveins occur frequently but the profit margin is astronomical if the mines can be bought cheap enough the tva didnt want the old mines stripped the usual way citing all sorts of possible insurance liabilities i was brought in at the tvas request because there had never been a cavein on any of the second mining operations id worked on tva was still reluctant to sell after they read my geomechanic report but ohnishi minerals managed to end run them ohnishi bought off officials paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to some highpower lawyers and in the end opened his own bogus insurance company to underwrite tvas liability what he did was illegal to a degree but american mining laws are gray enough that he got away with it at the time the vice president in charge of ohnishi minerals was a guy id gone through the doctoral program at penn state with daniel tanaka when his crew was reopening the mine i met with him and explained that i had faked some of the figures underestimating the strength of the coal pillars i had rightly guessed that ohnishi would order him to pull out more coal than i said could be safely removed we both knew that id saved the lives of his men so he owed me a favor i called him just before i went to hawaii and he told me confidentially that ohnishi himself had no knowledge of the details of the transaction when they had acquired the mining rights anything that could be construed as illegal or corrupt was handled by his aide kenji i assumed that when ohnishi was approached by ivan kerikov concerning the bikinium hed ordered kenji to handle any of the details therefore kenji was the real linchpin not his boss it wasnt until i reached kenjis estate that i found out the koreans had gotten to kenji too he was the perfect agentprovocateur working all sides koreans and ohnishi against the middle ivan kerikov as near as i can figure the cycle of doublecross kenji screwed ohnishi with the help of the koreans while ohnishi screwed kerikov whod already sold him out to the same koreans meanwhile those koreans are screwing kerikov right back by forming a partnership with kenji i think i have that right but im not sure the only thing that matters is that ohnishi and kenji are dead kerikovs in hiding and the wily koreans have nothing to show for their effort that sounds about the same way we figured it too henna agreed harry white staggered into the bar a nearly spent cigarette clinging to his lower lip he sat at the bar hunching over in what he and mercer referred to as the bar slouch and took a swig of the jack and ginger tiny had already poured for him its hard to believe this all started over forty years ago with something as insignificant as the sinking of an ore carrier not so insignificant if you were on that ship mercer replied still staring at harry you know what i mean the crew of the grandam phoenix died without ever knowing that they were the beginning of a conspiracy that nearly tore this nation apart dont be so sure mercer said quietly then called to harry what i come back from a trip and no sarcasm from you harry heaved himself from his stool and started toward the booth i see you talking to a guy in a suit i figure the irs has finally nailed you for tax fraud i thought it best to stay away mercer laughed as harry slid into the booth next to henna richard henna director of the federal bureau of investigation mercer said drawing out each syllable i would like you to meet ralph michael linc former captain of the ore carrier grandam phoenix for the rest of his life mercer would never again see such a look of incredulity as those on the faces of henna and harry their jaws had both dropped noticeably and they regarded mercer with blank expressionless eyes had he said he was the second coming of jesus christ the reaction would have been more mundane before either man could speak mercer explained after i got out of the hospital at pearl harbor i went to kauai because its the closest big island to the new volcano i went there hoping to find out if there had been any survivors from that night in i found a spry old lady mae turner who remembered a sea captain named ralph linc who washed up on shore four days after the phoenix went down he had lost a leg to a shark unconsciously harry rubbed his good foot against the prosthesis strapped below his knee she nursed him back to health but never heard from him again how did you guess it was me harry asked calmly it was the telegram that started this whole mess for me the telegram from tishs dead father at first i had no idea who sent it but when i learned that valery borodin had been involved with tish i figured it must have been him but he denied having sent it i wondered who else would want me involved and knew that jack talbot was a friend of mine then i remembered talking to you the night before the telegram arrived from jakarta i remembered telling you that i thought he was working in indonesia and wondered if he knew his daughter had been hurt you were the only person who could have known i thought he was there i started thinking about motive about why you would want to get me involved and i came up with revenge so i figured you had to be a member of the grandam phoenixs crew mae turner confirmed my suspicion i never did figure out how you got the telegram sent from jakarta easy really i havent been to sea since but i still know mariners all over the globe i just phoned a friend who knew someone in indonesia and had him send the wire why henna asked softly we had a deal with those bastards to scuttle the phoenix for the insurance money they were supposed to pick us up instead they gunned us down in the lifeboats they killed my entire crew i caught two slugs myself i blacked out after i got hit and when i came to i was holding onto an overturned lifeboat with a great white using me as an afterdinner mint i pulled myself up onto the boat hatred keeping me alive and eventually landed on hawaii after mae nursed me i went looking for those responsible thats when i changed my name to harry white so they wouldnt ever know that one man managed to slip away i searched for twenty goddamn years and didnt get anywhere every time a ship vanished near hawaii i checked it out some were legitimate sailboats found capsized storms that sort of thing but i knew some were caused by the same people who killed my boys but i never could find a connection between those ships and mine after twenty years i finally gave up hope and moved here to washington i felt like a failure then they hit that noaa ship and i thought maybe after all these years id have a chance at revenge surely the government would investigate and find some pattern to the disappearances i even thought i might be able to help in some way but christ im crowding eighty now who the hell would listen to me anymore he turned to mercer when you told me that your friends daughter had been rescued from that ship i understood how fate really works i called my friend and had his buddy in indonesia send that telegram to your office hoping that i could avenge my crew through you listen mercer i was wrong to involve you but i just couldnt stop myself i am sorry mercer looked at his old friend for a long moment his face a mask his eyes neutral do i call you harry or ralph ive been harry white longer than i was ralph linc he replied sullenly well harry from now on if you want jack daniels at my house you bring it yourself because i never drink the stuff mercer grinned and reached across the table to slap harry on the shoulder harry was nearly in tears thanks mercer thanks for finally avenging the boys who died that night and thanks for understanding next time i fight one of your battles mercer admonished mockingly make sure its not the goddamn kgb im up against all right mercer slid out of the booth and stood now if you gentlemen will excuse me i have to pick up my private nurse from the airport she couldnt get a seat on the same flight as me private nurse harry and dick said in unison well not nurse really more like physical therapist her producer gave her one more week off and i plan to spend it at a little bed and breakfast i know near annapolis it seems youre wrong dick the hero does get the girl at the end mercer left the bar before either man could speak he only had thirty minutes to get to the airport and pick up jill tzu it would be another hours drive to the hotel and a certain part of his anatomy was telling him he would need her type of therapy by then khania crete once an outpost of the mighty venetian trading empire the seaside town of khania retains much of the influence of its renaissance benefactor though lacking the trademark canals of venice khania can still fool even the most seasoned traveler into thinking he or she is on the italian peninsula rather than the largest of the greek islands the calm aegean spices the air of the resort town as breezes blow into the protected bay past the stone lighthouse and domed mosque left over from the turkish occupation the cramped architecture of the port itself gives a person seated in one of the many quayside restaurants a feeling of contentment and belonging even as multitudes of tourists promenade by in armlinked droves khania sits nearly forty miles west of cretes capital connected to it by a stretch of new highway dotted with beautiful beaches and luxury condominium developments catering to germans and scandinavians wishing to hide from winters fury because of the transitory nature of the population no one paid heed to khanias newest arrival as he sipped a scotch at an outdoor cafe watching the tourists load themselves up like pack animals with souvenirs and mementos of their stay on crete he was dressed in creamy linen pants and a silk polo shirt his feet shod in soft leather moccasins if tourists had taken the time to notice him they would have assumed that he was just another rich german getting away from it all they would have been dead wrong ivan kerikov had selected khania with much care and deliberation he knew that he was being hunted by the kgb the cia and more importantly way dongs security forces so any hiding place must have several avenues of escape khanias transitory population almost guaranteed anonymity while the islands rugged interior offered thousands of hiding places if things became desperate libya was only a tenhour boat ride away kerikov signaled his waiter for another drink and sat back contentedly in the cloth and steel tubing chair he could think of no better place to sit and wait without fear of detection while still enjoying the amenities of civilization before leaving zurich hed managed to empty several kgb accounts held there for agents operating in the west he had enough money to live on for at least a year the waiter brought his drink and kerikov thanked him with a grunt a year would be all the time he needed to utilize the information locked away in a banks safedeposit box near sygtagma square in athens that information stolen from the archives of department would be worth millions to the right buyer one eager for the power to bring america to her economic knees
