introduction readers who find the subject matter of this book shocking or frightening should not delude themselves by also thinking it is something quite new the physical study of the brain has been proceeding for more than a century the technology of behavior modification has been developing for more than fifty years for decades it was there for anyone to see discuss support or oppose nor has there been any lack of publicity research in neurobiology is spectacular enough to appear regularly in the sunday supplements but the public has never really taken it seriously there has been so much ominous talk and so much frivolous speculation for so many years that the public now regards mind control as a problem removed to the distant future it might eventually happen but not soon and not in a way that would affect anyone now alive scientists engaged in this research have sought public discussion james v mcconnell of the university of michigan told his students some years ago look we can do these things we can control behavior now whos going to decide whats to be done if you dont get busy and tell me how im supposed to do it ill make up my own mind for you and then its too late many people today feel that they live in a world that is predetermined and running along a fixed preestablished course past decisions have left us with pollution depersonalization and urban blight somebody else made the decisions for us and we are stuck with the consequences that attitude represents a childish and dangerous denial of responsibility and everyone should recognize it for what it is in that

j b s haldane the wilderness masters the colonist frederick jackson turner tuesday march asmission they came down to the emergency ward at noon and sat on the bench just behind the swinging doors that led in from the ambulance parking slot ellis was nervous preoccupied distant morris was relaxed eating a candy bar and crumpling the wrapper into the pocket of his white jacket from where they sat they could look at the sunlight outside falling across the big sign that said emergency ward and the smaller sign that said no parking ambulances only in the distance they heard sirens is that him morris asked ellis checked his watch i doubt it its too early they sat on the bench and listened to the sirens come closer ellis removed his glasses and wiped them with his tie one of the emergency ward nurses a girl morris did not know by name came over and said brightly is this the welcoming committee ellis squinted at her morris said well be taking him straight through do you have his chart down here the nurse said yes i think so doctor and walked off looking irritated ellis sighed he replaced his glasses and frowned at the nurse morris said she didnt mean anything i suppose the whole damned hospital knows ellis said its a pretty big secret to keep the sirens were very close now through the windows they saw an ambulance back into the slot two orderlies opened the door and pulled out the stretcher a frail elderly woman lay on the stretcher gasping for breath making wet gurgling sounds severe pulmonary edema morris thought as he watched her taken into one of the treatment rooms i hope hes in good shape ellis said who benson why shouldnt he be they might have roughed him up ellis stared morosely out the windows he really is in a bad mood morris thought he knew that meant ellis was excited he had scrubbed in on enough cases with ellis to recognize the pattern irascibility under pressure while he waited and then total almost lazy calm when the operation began where the hell is he ellis said looking at his watch again to change the subject morris said are we all set for threethirty at that afternoon benson would be presented to the hospital staff at a special neurosurgical rounds as far as i know ellis said ross is making the presentation i just hope bensons in good shape over the loudspeaker a soft voice said dr ellis dr john ellis twotwothreefour dr ellis twotwothreefour ellis got up to answer the page hell he said morris knew what he meant twotwothreefour was the extension for the animal laboratories the call probably meant something had gone wrong with the monkeys ellis had been doing three monkeys a week for the past month just to keep himself and his staff ready he watched as ellis crossed the room and answered from a wall phone ellis walked with a slight limp the result of a childhood injury that had cut the common peroneal nerve in his right leg morris always wondered if the injury had had something to do with elliss later decision to become a neurosurgeon certainly ellis had the attitude of a man determined to correct defects to fix things up that was what he always said to his patients we can fix you up and he seemed to have more than his share of defects himself the limp the premature nearbaldness the weak eyes and the heavy thick glasses it produced a vulnerability about him that made his irascibility more tolerable or perhaps the irascibility was the result of all those years as a surgeon morris wasnt sure he hadnt been a surgeon long enough he stared out the window at the sunlight and the parking lot afternoon visiting hours were beginning relatives were driving into the parking lot getting out of their cars glancing up at the high buildings of the hospital the apprehension was clear in their faces the hospital was a place people feared morris noticed how many of them had sun tans it had been a warm sunny spring in los angeles yet he was still as pale as the white jacket and trousers he wore every day he had to get outside more often he told himself he should start eating lunch outside he played tennis of course but that was usually in the evenings ellis came back shit he said ethel tore out her sutures how did it happen ethel was a juvenile rhesus monkey who had undergone brain surgery the day before the operation had proceeded flawlessly and ethel was unusually docile as rhesus monkeys went i dont know ellis said apparently she worked an arm loose from her restraints anyway shes shrieking and the bones exposed on one side did she tear out her wires i dont know but ive got to go down and resew her now can you handle this i think so are you all right with the cops ellis said i dont think theyll give you any trouble no i dont think so just get benson up to seven as fast as you can ellis said then call ross ill be up as soon as possible he checked his watch itll probably take forty minutes to resew ethel if she behaves herself good luck with her morris said and smiled ellis looked sour and walked away after he had gone the emergency ward nurse came back whats the matter with him she asked just edgy morris said he sure is the nurse said she paused and looked out the window lingering morris watched her with a kind of bemused detachment hed spent enough years in the hospital to recognize the subtle signs of status he had begun as an intern with no status at all most of the nurses knew more medicine than he did and if they were tired they didnt bother to conceal it i dont think you want to do that doctor as the years went by he became a surgical resident and the nurses became more deferential when he was a senior resident he was sufficiently assured in his work that a few of the nurses called him by his first name and finally when he transferred to the neuropsychiatric research unit as a junior staff member the formality returned as a new mark of status but this was something else a nurse hanging around just being near him because he had a special aura of importance because everyone in the hospital knew what was going to happen staring out the window the nurse said here he comes morris got up and looked out a blue police van drove up toward the emergency ward and turned around backing into the ambulance slot all right he said notify the seventh floor and tell them were on our way yes doctor the nurse went off two ambulance orderlies opened the hospital doors they knew nothing about benson one of them said to morris you expecting this one yes ew case no a direct admission the orderlies nodded and watched as the police officer driving the van came around and unlocked the rear door two officers seated in the back emerged blinking in the sunlight then benson came out as always morris was struck by his appearance benson was a meek pudgy thirtyfouryearold man with a sort of permanently bewildered air about him he stood by the van with his wrists handcuffed in front of him and looked around when he saw morris he said hello and then looked away embarrassed one of the cops said you in charge here yes im dr morris the cop gestured toward the interior of the hospital lead the way doctor morris said would you mind taking off his handcuffs bensons eyes flicked up at morris then back down we dont have any orders about that the cops exchanged glances i guess its okay while they took the cuffs off the driver brought morris a form on a clipboard transfer of suspect to institutional care medical he signed it and again here the driver said as morris signed again he looked at benson benson stood quietly rubbing his wrists staring straight ahead the impersonality of the transaction the forms and signatures made morris feel as if he were receiving a package from united parcel he wondered if benson felt like a package okay the driver said thanks doc morris led the other two policemen and benson into the hospital the orderlies shut the doors a nurse came up with a wheelchair and benson sat down in it the cops looked confused its hospital policy morris said they all went to the elevators the elevator stopped at the lobby a halfdozen relatives were waiting to go up to the higher floors but they hesitated when they saw morris benson in the wheelchair and the two cops please take the next car morris said smoothly the doors closed they continued up where is dr ellis benson asked i thought he was going to be here hes in surgery hell be up shortly and dr ross youll see her at the presentation oh yes benson smiled the presentation the cops exchanged suspicious looks but said nothing the elevator arrived at the seventh floor and they all got out seven was the special surgical floor where difficult and complex cases were treated it was essentially a research floor the most severe cardiac kidney and metabolic patients recuperated here they went down to the nurses station a glasswalled area strategically located at the center of the xshaped floor the nurse on duty at the station looked up she was surprised to see the cops but she said nothing morris said this is mr benson have we got seventen ready all set for him the nurse said and gave benson a cheery smile benson smiled bleakly back and glanced from the nurse to the computer console in the corner of the nursing station you have a timesharing station up here yes morris said wheres the main computer in the basement of this building yes it draws a lot of power and the power lines come to this building benson nodded morris was not surprised at the questions benson was trying to distract himself from the thought of surgery and he was after all a computer expert the nurse handed morris the chart on benson it had the usual blue plastic cover with the seal of university hospital but there was also a red tag which meant neurosurgery and a yellow tag which meant intensive care and a white tag which morris had almost never seen on a patients chart the white tag meant security precautions is that my record benson asked as morris wheeled him down the hall to the cops followed along behind uhhuh i always wondered what was in it lot of unreadable notes mostly actually bensons chart was thick and very readable with all the computer printouts of different tests they came to before they entered the room one of the cops went in and closed the door behind him the second cop remained outside the door just a precaution he said benson glanced up at morris theyre very careful about me he said its almost flattering the first cop came out its okay he said morris wheeled benson into the room it was a large room on the south side of the hospital so that it was sunny in the afternoon benson looked around and nodded approvingly morris said this is one of the best rooms in the hospital can i get up now of course benson got out of the wheelchair and sat on the bed he bounced on the mattress he pressed the buttons that made the bed move up and down then bent over to look at the motorized mechanism beneath the bed morris went to the window and drew the blinds reducing the direct light simple benson said whats that this bed mechanism remarkably simple you should really have a feedback unit so that body movements by the person in the bed are automatically compensated for his voice trailed off he opened the closet doors looked in checked the bathroom came back morris thought that he wasnt acting like an ordinary patient most patients were intimidated by the hospital but benson acted as if he were renting a hotel room ill take it benson said and laughed he sat down on the bed and looked at morris then at the cops do they have to be here i think they can wait outside morris said the cops nodded and went out closing the door behind them i meant benson said do they have to be here at all yes they do all the time yes unless we can get charges dropped against you benson frowned was it i mean did i was it bad you gave him a black eye and you fractured one rib but hes all right yes hes all right i dont remember any of it benson said all my memory cores are erased i know that but im glad hes all right morris nodded did you bring anything with you pajamas anything like that benson said no but i can arrange for it all right ill get you some hospital clothing in the meantime are you all right for now yes sure and he grinned i could do with a quick shot maybe that morris said grinning back is something youll have to do without benson sighed morris went out of the room the cops had brought a chair up to the door one of them sat on it the other stood alongside morris flipped open his notebook youll want to know the schedule he said an admitting person will show up in the next half hour with financial waivers for benson to sign then at threethirty he goes downstairs to the main amphitheater for surgical rounds he comes back after about twenty minutes his head will be shaved tonight the operation is scheduled for six am tomorrow morning do you have questions can someone get us meals one of them asked ill have the nurse order extras will there be two of you or just one just one were working eighthour shifts morris said ill tell the nurses itd help if you check in and out with them they like to know whos on the floor the cops nodded there was a moment of silence finally one of them said whats wrong with him anyway he has a form of epilepsy i saw the guy he beat up one of the cops said big strong guy looked like a truck driver youd never think a little guy like that he jerked his arm toward bensons room could do it when he has epileptic fits hes violent they nodded vaguely whats this operation hes getting its a kind of brain surgery we call a stagethree procedure morris said he didnt bother to explain further the policemen wouldnt understand and he thought even if they understood they wouldnt believe it neurosurgical grand rounds where unusual cases were presented and discussed by all the surgeons of the hospital were normally scheduled for thursdays at nine special rounds were hardly ever called it was too difficult for the staff to get together but now the amphitheater was packed tier after tier of white jackets and pale faces staring down at ellis who pushed his glasses up on his nose and said as many of you know tomorrow morning the neuropsychiatric research unit will perform a limbic pacing procedure what we call a stage three on a human patient there was no sound no movement from the audience janet ross stood in the corner of the amphitheater near the doors and watched she found it odd that there should be so little reaction but then it was hardly a surprise everyone in the hospital knew that the nps had been waiting for a good stagethree subject i must ask you ellis said to restrain your questions when the patient is introduced he is a sensitive man and his disturbance is quite severe we thought you should have the psychiatric background before we bring him in the attending psychiatrist dr ross will give you a summary ellis nodded to ross she came forward to the center of the room she stared up at the steeply banked rows of faces and felt a momentary hesitation janet ross was tall and exceptionally goodlooking in a lean tanned darkblond way she herself felt she was too bony and angular and she often wished she were more softly feminine but she knew her appearance was striking and at thirty after more than a decade of training in a predominantly masculine profession she had learned to use it she clasped her hands behind her back took a breath and launched into the summary delivering it in the rapid stylized method that was standard for grand rounds harold franklin benson she said is a thirtyfouryearold divorced computer scientist who was healthy until two years ago when he was involved in an automobile accident on the santa monica freeway following the accident he was unconscious for an unknown period of time he was taken to a local hospital for overnight observation and discharged the next day in good health he was fine for six months until he began to experience what he called blackouts the audience was silent faces staring down at her listening these blackouts lasted several minutes and occurred about once a month they were often preceded by the sensation of peculiar unpleasant odors the blackouts frequently occurred after drinking alcohol the patient consulted his local physician who told him he was working too hard and recommended he reduce his alcohol intake benson did this but the blackouts continued one year ago a year after the accident he realized that the blackouts were becoming more frequent and lasting longer he often regained consciousness to find himself in unfamiliar surroundings on several occasions he had cuts and bruises or torn clothing which suggested that he had been fighting however he never remembered what occurred during the blackout periods heads in the audience nodded they understood what she was telling them it was a straightforward history for a temporallobe epileptic the hard part was coming the patients friends she continued told him that he was acting differently but he discounted their opinion gradually he has lost contact with most of his former friends around this time one year ago he also made what he called a monumental discovery in his work benson is a computer scientist specializing in artificial life or machine intelligence in the course of this work he says he discovered that machines were competing with human beings and that ultimately machines would take over the world now there were whispers in the audience this interested them particularly the psychiatrists she could see her old teacher manon sitting in the top row holding his head in his hands manon knew benson communicated his discovery to his remaining friends they suggested that he see a psychiatrist which angered him in the last year he has become increasingly certain that machines are conspiring to take over the world then six months ago the patient was arrested by police on suspicion of beating up an airplane mechanic positive identification could not be made and charges were dropped but the episode unnerved benson and led him to seek psychiatric help he had the vague suspicion that somehow he had been the man who had beaten the mechanic to a bloody pulp that was unthinkable to him but the nagging suspicion remained he was referred to the university hospital neuropsychiatric research unit four months ago in november on the basis of his history head injury episodic violence preceded by strange smells he was considered a probable psychomotor epileptic as you know the nps now accepts only patients with organically treatable behavioral disturbances a neurological examination was fully normal an electroencephalogram was fully normal brainwave activity showed no pathology it was repeated after alcohol ingestion and an abnormal tracing was obtained the eeg showed seizure activity in the right temporal lobe of the brain benson was therefore considered a stageone patient firm diagnosis of psychomotor epilepsy she paused to get her breath and let the audience absorb what she had told them the patient is an intelligent man she said and his illness was explained to him he was told he had injured his brain in the automobile accident and as a result had a form of epilepsy that produced thought seizures seizures of the mind not the body leading to violent acts he was told that the disease was common and could be controlled he was started on a series of drug trials three months ago benson was arrested on charges of assault and battery the victim was a twentyfouryearold topless dancer who later dropped charges the hospital intervened slightly on his behalf one month ago drug trials of morladone pamino benzadone and triamiline were concluded benson showed no improvement on any drug or combination of drugs he was therefore a stage two drugresistant psychomotor epilepsy and he was scheduled for a stagethree surgical procedure which we will discuss today she paused before i bring him in she said i think i should add that yesterday afternoon he attacked a gasstation attendant and beat the man rather badly his operation is scheduled for tomorrow and we have persuaded the police to release him in our custody but he is still technically awaiting arraignment on charges of assault and battery the room was silent she paused for a moment then went to bring in benson benson was just outside the doors to the amphitheater sitting in his wheelchair wearing the blueandwhite striped bathrobe the hospital issued to its patients when janet ross appeared he smiled hello dr ross hello harry she smiled back how do you feel it was a polite question after years of psychiatric training she could see clearly how he felt benson was nervous and threatened there was sweat on his upper lip his shoulders were drawn in his hands clenched together in his lap i feel fine he said just fine behind benson was morris pushing the wheelchair and a cop she said to morris does he come in with us before morris could answer benson said lightly he goes anywhere i go the cop nodded and looked embarrassed all right she said she opened the doors and morris wheeled benson into the amphitheater over to ellis ellis came forward to shake bensons hand mr benson good to see you dr ellis morris turned him around so he was facing the amphitheater audience ross sat to one side and glanced at the cop who remained by the door trying to look inconspicuous ellis stood alongside benson who was looking at a wall of frosted glass against which a dozen xrays had been clipped he seemed to realize that they were his own skull films ellis noticed and turned off the light behind the frosted glass the xrays became opaquely black weve asked you to come here ellis said to answer some questions for these doctors he gestured to the men sitting in the semicircular tiers they dont make you nervous do they ellis asked it easily ross frowned shed attended hundreds of grand rounds in her life and the patients were invariably asked if the doctors peering down at them made them nervous in answer to a direct question the patients always denied nervousness sure they make me nervous benson said theyd make anybody nervous ross suppressed a smile good for you she thought then benson said what if you were a machine and i brought you in front of a bunch of computer experts who were trying to decide what was wrong with you and how to fix it how would you feel ellis was plainly flustered he ran his hands through his thinning hair and glanced at ross and she shook her head fractionally no this was the wrong place to explore bensons psychopathology id be nervous too ellis said well then benson said you see ellis swallowed hes being deliberately irritating ross thought dont take the bait but of course ellis said im not a machine am i ross winced that depends benson said certain of your functions are repetitive and mechanical from that standpoint they are easily programmed and relatively straightforward if you i think ross said standing up that we might take questions from those present now ellis clearly didnt like that but he was silent and benson mercifully was quiet she looked up at the audience and after a moment a man in the back raised his hand and said mr benson can you tell us more about the smells you have before your blackouts not really benson said theyre strange is all they smell terrible but they dont smell like anything if you get what i mean i mean you cant identify the odor memory tapes cycle through blankly can you give us an approximation of the odor benson shrugged maybe pig shit in turpentine another hand in the audience went up mr benson these blackouts have been getting more frequent have they also been getting longer yes benson said theyre several hours now how do you feel when you recover from a blackout sick to my stomach can you be more specific sometimes i vomit is that specific enough ross frowned she could see that benson was becoming angry are there other questions she asked hoping there would not be she looked up at the audience there was a long silence well then ellis said perhaps we can go on to discuss the details of stagethree surgery mr benson knows all this so he can stay or leave whichever he prefers ross didnt approve ellis was showing off the surgeons instinct for demonstrating to everyone that his patient didnt mind being cut and mutilated it was unfair to ask to dare benson to stay in the room ill stay benson said fine ellis said he went to the blackboard and drew a brain schematically now he said our understanding of the disease process is thata portion of the brain is damaged in epilepsy and a scar forms its like a scar in other body organs lots of fibrous tissue lots of contraction and distortion and it becomes a focus for abnormal electrical discharges we see spreading waves moving outward from the focus like ripples from a rock in a pond ellis drew a point on the brain then sketched concentric circles these electrical ripples produce a seizure in some parts of the brain the discharge focus produces a shaking fit frothing at the mouth and so on in other parts there are other effects if the focus is in the temporal lobe as in mr bensons case you get what is called psychomotor epilepsy convulsions of thought not of body strange thoughts and frequently violent behavior preceded by a characteristic aura which is often an odor benson was watching listening nodding now then ellis said we know from the work of many researchers that it is possible to abort a seizure by delivering an electrical shock to the correct portion of the brain substance these seizures begin slowly there are a few seconds sometimes as much as half a minute before the seizure takes effect a shock at that moment prevents the seizure he drew a large x through the concentric circles then he drew a new brain and a head around it and a neck we face two problems he said first what is the correct part of the brain to shock well we know roughly that its in the amygdala an anterior area of the socalled limbic system we dont know exactly where but we solve that problem by implanting a number of electrodes in the brain mr benson will have forty electrodes implanted tomorrow morning he drew two lines into the brain now our second problem is how do we know when an attack is starting we must know when to deliver our aborting shock well fortunately the same electrodes that we use to deliver the shock can also be used to read the electrical activity of the brain and there is a characteristic electrical pattern that precedes a seizure ellis paused glanced at benson then up at the audience so we have a feedback system the same electrodes are used to detect a new attack and to deliver the aborting shock a computer controls the feedback mechanism he drew a small square in the neck of his schematic figure the nps staff has developed a computer that will monitor electrical activity of the brain and when it sees an attack starting will transmit a shock to the correct brain area this computer is about the size of a postage stamp and weighs a tenth of an ounce it will be implanted beneath the skin of the patients neck he then drew an oblong shape below the neck and attached wires to the computer square we will power the computer with a handler ppj plutonium power pack which will be implanted beneath the skin of the shoulder this makes the patient completely selfsufficient the power pack supplies energy continuously and reliably for twenty years with his chalk he tapped the different parts of his diagram thats the complete feedback loop brain to electrodes to computer to power pack back to brain a total loop without any externalized portions he turned to benson who had watched the discussion with an expression of bland disinterest any comments mr benson ross groaned inwardly ellis was really letting him have it it was flagrantly sadistic even for a surgeon no benson said i have nothing to say and he yawned when benson was wheeled out of the room ross went with him it wasnt really necessary for her to accompany him but she was concerned about his condition and a little guilty about the way ellis had treated him she said how do you feel i thought it was interesting he said in what way well the discussion was entirely medical i would have expected a more philosophical approach were just practical people she said lightly dealing with a practical problem benson smiled so was newton he said whats more practical than the problem of why an apple falls to the ground do you really see philosophical implications in all this benson nodded his expression turned serious yes he said and so do you youre just pretending that you dont she stopped then and stood in the corridor watching as benson was wheeled down to the elevator benson morris and the cop waited in the corridor for the next car morris pushed the button repeatedly in that impatient aggressive way of his then the elevator arrived and they got on benson waved one last time and the doors closed she went back to the amphitheater has been under development for ten years ellis was saying it was first started for cardiac pacemakers where changing batteries requires minor surgery every year or so thats an annoyance to surgeon and patient the atomic power pack is totally reliable and has a long lifespan if mr benson is still alive we might have to change packs around but not before then janet ross slipped back into the room just as another question was asked how will you determine which of the forty electrodes will prevent a seizure we will implant them all ellis said and wire up the computer but we will not lock in any electrodes for twentyfour hours one day after surgery well stimulate each of the electrodes by radio and determine which electrodes work best then we will lock those in by remote control high up in the amphitheater a familiar voice coughed and said these technical details are interesting but they seem to me to elude the point ross looked up and saw manon speaking manon was nearly seventyfive an emeritus professor of psychiatry who rarely came to the hospital any more when he did he was usually regarded as a cranky old man far past his prime out of touch with modern thinking it seems to me manon continued that the patient is psychotic thats putting it a little strongly ellis said perhaps manon said but at the very least he has a severe personality disorder all this confusion about men and machines is worrisome to me the personality disorder is part of his disease ellis said in a recent review harley and coworkers at yale reported that fifty percent of temporallobe epileptics had an accompanying personality disorder which was independent of seizure activity per se quite so manon said in a voice that had the slightest edge of impatience to it it is part of his disease independent of seizures but will your procedure cure it janet ross found herself quietly pleased manon was reaching exactly her own conclusions no ellis said probably not in other words the operation will stop his seizures but it wont stop his delusions no ellis repeated probably not if i may make a small speech manon said frowning down from the top row this kind of thinking is what i fear most from the nps i dont mean to single you out particularly its a general problem of the medical profession for example if we get a suicide attempt or a suicide gesture by drug overdose in the emergency ward our approach is to pump the patients stomach give him a lecture and send him home thats a treatment but its hardly a cure the patient will be back sooner or later stomach pumping doesnt treat depression it only treats drug overdose i see what youre saying but id also remind you of the hospitals experience with mr l do you recall the case i dont think mr l applies here ellis said but his voice was stiff and exasperated im not so sure manon said since several puzzled faces in the amphitheater were turned toward him he explained mr l was a famous case here a few years ago he was a thirtynineyearold man with bilateral endstage kidney disease chronic glomerulonephritis he was considered a candidate for renal transplant because our facilities for transplantation are limited a hospital review board selects patients the psychiatrists on that board strongly opposed mr l as a transplantation candidate because he was psychotic he believed that the sun ruled the earth and he refused to go outside during the daylight hours we felt he was too unstable to benefit from kidney surgery but he ultimately received the operation six months later he committed suicide thats a tragedy but the real question is couldnt someone else have benefited more from the thousands of dollars and many hours of specialized effort that went into the transplant ellis paced back and forth the foot of his bad leg scraping slightly along the floor ross knew it meant he was feeling threatened under attack normally ellis was careful to minimize his disability concealing it so that the limp was noticeable only to a trained eye but if he was tired or angry or threatened the flaw appeared it was almost as if he unconsciously wanted sympathy dont attack me im a cripple consciously of course he was not aware of it i understand your objection ellis said in the terms you present it your argument is unanswerable but i would like to consider the problem from a somewhat different viewpoint it is perfectly true that benson is disturbed and that our operation probably wont change that but what happens if we dont operate on him are we doing him a favor i dont think so we know that his seizures are lifethreatening to himself to others his seizures have already gotten him into trouble with the law and his seizures are getting worse the operation will prevent seizures and we think that is an important benefit to the patient high up manon gave a little shrug janet ross knew the gesture it signaled irreconcilable differences an impasse well then ellis said are there other questions there were no other questions jesus fucking christ ellis said wiping his forehead he didnt let up did he janet ross walked with him across the parking lot toward the langer research building it was late afternoon the sunlight was yellowing turning pale and weak his point was valid she said mildly ellis sighed i keep forgetting youre on his side why do you keep forgetting she asked she smiled as she said it as the psychiatrist on the nps staff shed opposed bensons operation from the beginning look ellis said we do what we can itd be great to cure him totally but we cant do that we can only help him so well help him she walked alongside him in silence there was nothing to say she had told ellis her opinion many times before the operation might not help it might in fact make benson much worse she was sure ellis understood that possibility but he was stubbornly ignoring it or so it seemed to her actually she liked ellis as much as she liked any surgeon she regarded surgeons as flagrantly actionoriented men they were almost always men which she found significant desperate to do something to take some physical action in that sense ellis was better than most of them he had wisely turned down several stagethree candidates before benson and she knew that was difficult for him to do because a part of him was terribly eager to perform the new operation i hate all this ellis said hate what the politics thats the nice thing about operating on monkeys no politics at all but you want to do benson im ready ellis said were all ready we have to take that first big step and now is the time to take it he glanced at her why do you look so uncertain because i am she said they came to the langer building ellis went off to an early dinner with mcpherson a political dinner he said irritably and she took the elevator to the fourth floor after ten years of steady expansion the neuropsychiatric research unit encompassed the entire fourth floor of the langer research building the other floors were painted a dead cold white but the nps was bright with primary colors the intention was to make patients feel optimistic and happy but it always had the reverse effect on ross she found it falsely and artificially cheerful like a nursery school for retarded children she got off the elevator and looked at the reception area one wall a bright blue the other red like almost everything else about the nps the colors had been mcphersons idea it was strange she thought how much an organization reflected the personality of its leader mcpherson himself always seemed to have a bright kindergarten quality about him and a boundless optimism certainly you had to be optimistic if you planned to operate on harry benson the unit was quiet now most of the staff gone home for the night she walked down the corridor past the colored doors with the stenciled labels sonoencephalography cortical function eeg ras scoring parietal t and at the far end of the hall telecomp the work done behind those doors was as complex as the labels and this was just the patientcare wing what mcpherson called applications applications was ordinary compared to development the research wing with its chemitrodes and compsims and elad scenarios to say nothing of the big projects like george and martha or form q development was ten years ahead of applications and applications was very very advanced a year ago mcpherson had asked her to take a group of newspaper science reporters through the nps he chose her he said because she was such a piece of ass it was funny to hear him say that and shocking in a way he was usually so courtly and fatherly but her shock was minor compared to the shock the reporters felt she had planned to show them both applications and development but after the reporters had seen applications they were so agitated so clearly overloaded that she cut the tour short she worried a lot about it afterward the reporters hadnt been naive and they hadnt been inexperienced they were people who shuttled from one scientific arena to another all their lives yet they were rendered speechless by the implications of the work she had shown them she herself had lost that insight that perspective she had been working in the nps for three years and she had gradually become accustomed to the things done there the conjunction of men and machines human brains and electronic brains was no longer bizarre and provocative it was just a way to take steps forward and get things done on the other hand she opposed the stagethree operation on benson she had opposed it from the start she thought benson was the wrong human subject and she had just one last chance to prove it at the end of the corridor she paused by the door to telecomp listening to the quiet hiss of the printout units she heard voices inside and opened the door telecomp was really the heart of the neuropsychiatric research unit it was a large room filled with electronic equipment the walls and ceilings were soundproofed a vestige of earlier days when the readout consoles were clattering teletypes now they used either silent crts cathoderay tubes or a printout machine that sprayed the letters with a nozzle rather than typed them mechanically the hiss of the sprayer was the loudest sound in the room mcpherson had insisted on the change to quieter units because he felt the clattering disturbed patients who came to the nps for treatment gerhard was there and his assistant richards the wizard twins they were called gerhard was only twentyfour and richards even younger they were the least professional people attached to the nps both men regarded telecomp as a kind of permanent playground filled with complex toys they worked long but erratic hours frequently beginning in the late afternoon quitting at dawn they rarely showed up for group conferences and formal meetings much to mcphersons annoyance but they were undeniably good gerhard who wore cowboy boots and dungarees and satiny shirts with pearl buttons had gained some national attention at the age of thirteen when he built a twentyfoot solidfuel rocket behind his house in phoenix the rocket possessed a remarkably sophisticated electronic guidance system and gerhard felt he could fire it into orbit his neighbors who could see the nose of the finished rocket sticking up above the garage in the backyard were disturbed enough to call the police and ultimately the army was notified the army examined gerhards rocket and shipped it to white sands for firing as it happened the second stage ignited before disengagement and the rocket exploded two miles up but by that time gerhard had four patents on his guidance mechanism and a number of scholarship offers from colleges and industrial firms he turned them all down let his uncle invest the patent royalties and when he was old enough to drive bought a maserati he went to work for lockheed in palmdale california but quit after a year because he was blocked from advancement by a lack of formal engineering degrees it was also true that his colleagues resented a seventeenyearold with a maserati ghibli and a propensity for working in the middle of the night it was felt he had no team spirit then mcpherson hired him to work at the neuropsychiatric research unit designing electronic components to be synergistic with the human brain mcpherson as head of the nps had interviewed dozens of candidates who thought the job was a challenge or an interesting systems application context gerhard said he thought it would be fun and was hired immediately richardss background was similar he had finished high school and gone to college for six months before being drafted by the army he was about to be sent to vietnam when he began to suggest improvements in the armys electronic scanning devices the improvements worked and richards never got closer to combat than a laboratory in santa monica when he was discharged he also joined the nps the wizard twins ross smiled hi jan gerhard said hows it going jan richards said they were both offhand they were the only people on the staff who dared refer to mcpherson as rog and mcpherson put up with it okay she said weve got our stage three through grand rounds im going to see him now were just finishing a check on the computer gerhard said it looks fine he pointed to a table with a microscope surrounded by a tangle of electronic meters and dials where is it under the stage she looked closer a clear plastic packet the size of a postage stamp lay under the microscope lens through the plastic she could see a dense jumble of microminiaturized electronic components forty contact points protruded from the plastic with the help of the microscope the twins were testing the points sequentially using fine probes the logic circuits are the last to be checked richards said and we have a backup unit just in case janet went over to the filecard storage shelves and began looking through the test cards after a moment she said havent you got any more psychodex cards theyre over here gerhard said you want fivespace or nspace nspace she said gerhard opened a drawer and took out a cardboard sheet he also took out a flat plastic clipboard attached to the clipboard by a metal chain was a pointed metal probe something like a pencil this isnt for the stage three is it yes she said butyouve run so many psychodexes on him before just one more for the records gerhard handed her the card and clipboard does your stage three know whats going on he knows most of it she said gerhard shook his head he must be out of his mind he is she said thats the problem at the seventh floor she stopped at the nurses station to ask for bensons chart a new nurse was there who said im sorry but relatives arent allowed to look at medical records im dr ross the nurse was flustered im sorry doctor i didnt see a name tag your patient is in sevenohfour what patient little jerry peters dr ross looked blank arent you a pediatrician the nurse asked finally no she said im a psychiatrist at the nps she heard the stridency in her own voice and it upset her but all those years growing up with people who said you dont really want to be a doctor you want to be a nurse or well for a woman pediatrics is best i mean the most natural thing oh the nurse said then you want mr benson in seventen hes been prepped thank you she said she took the chart and walked down the hall to bensons room she knocked on bensons door and heard gunshots she opened the door and saw that the lights were dimmed except for a small bedside lamp but the room was bathed in an electricblue glow from a tv on the screen a man was saying dead before he hit the ground two bullets right through the heart hello she said and swung the door wider benson looked over he smiled and pressed a button beside the bed turning off the tv his head was wrapped in a towel how are you feeling she asked coming into the room she sat on a chair beside the bed naked he said and touched the towel its funny you dont realize how much hair you have until somebody cuts it all off he touched the towel again it must be worse for a woman then he looked at her and became embarrassed its not much fun for anybody she said i guess not he lay back against the pillow after they did it i looked in the wastebasket and i was amazed so much hair and my head was cold it was the funniest thing a cold head they put a towel around it i said i wanted to look at my head see what i looked like bald but they said it wasnt a good idea so i waited until after they left and then i got out of bed and went into the bathroom but when i got there yes i didnt take the towel off he laughed i couldnt do it what does that mean i dont know what do you think it means he laughed again why is it that psychiatrists never give you a straight answer he lit a cigarette and looked at her defiantly they told me i shouldnt smoke but im doing it anyway i doubt that it matters she said she was watching him closely he seemed in good spirits and she didnt want to take that away from him but on the other hand it wasnt entirely appropriate to be jovial on the eve of brain surgery ellis was here a few minutes ago he said puffing on the cigarette he put some marks on me can you see he lifted up the right side of his towel slightly exposing white pale flesh over the skull two blue x marks were positioned behind the ear how do i look he asked grinning you look fine she said how do you feel fine i feel fine any worries no i mean what is there to worry about nothing i can do for the next few hours im in your hands and elliss hands i think most people would be a little worried before an operation there you go again being a reasonable psychiatrist he smiled and then frowned he bit his lip of course im worried what worries you everything he said he sucked on the cigarette everything i worry about how ill sleep how ill feel tomorrow how ill be when its all over what if somebody makes a mistake what if i get turned into a vegetable what if it hurts what if i die sure that too its really a minor procedure its hardly more complicated than an appendectomy i bet you tell that to all your brainsurgery patients no really its a short simple procedure itll take about an hour and a half he nodded vaguely she couldnt tell if she had reassured him you know he said i dont really think it will happen i keep thinking tomorrow morning at the last minute theyll come in and say youre cured benson you can go home now we hope youll be cured by the operation she felt a twinge of guilt saying that but it came out smoothly enough youre so goddamned reasonable he said there are times when i cant stand it like now he touched the towel around his head again i mean for christs sake theyre going to drill holes in my head and stick wires in youve known about that for a long time sure he said sure but this is the night before do you feel angry now no just scared its all right to be scared its perfectly normal but dont let it make you angry he stubbed out the cigarette and lit another immediately changing the subject he pointed to the clipboard she carried under her arm whats that another psychodex test i want you to go through it now yes its just for the record he shrugged indifferently he had taken the psychodex several times before she handed him the clipboard and he arranged the question card on the board then began to answer the questions he read them aloud would you rather be an elephant or a baboon baboon elephants live too long with the metal probe he punched out the chosen answer on the card if you were a color would you rather be green or yellow yellow im feeling very yellow right now he laughed and punched the answer she waited until he had done all thirty questions and punched his answers he handed the clipboard back to her and his mood seemed to shift again are you going to be there tomorrow yes will i be awake enough to recognize you i imagine so and when will i come out of it tomorrow afternoon or evening that soon its really a minor procedure she said again he nodded she asked him if she could get him anything and he said some ginger ale and she replied that he was npo nothing per ora for twelve hours before the operation she said hed be getting shots to help him sleep and shots in the morning before he went to surgery she said she hoped hed sleep well as she left she heard a hum as the television went back on and a metallic voice said look lieutenant ive got a murderer out there somewhere in a city of three million people she closed the door before leaving the floor she put a brief note in the chart she drew a red line around it so that the nurses would be sure to see it admitting psychiatric summary this yearold man has documented psychomotor epilepsy of years duration the etiology is presumably traumatic following an automobile accident this patient has already tried to kill two people and has been involved in fights with several others any statement by him to hospital staff that he feels funny or smells something bad should be respected as indicating the start of a seizure under such circumstances notify the nps and hospital security at once the patient has an accompanying personality disorder which is part of his disease he is convinced that machines are conspiring to take over the world these beliefs are strongly held and attempts to dissuade him from them will only draw his enmity and suspicion one should also remember that he is a highly intelligent and sensitive man the patient can be quite demanding at times but he should be treated with firmness and respect his intelligent and articulate manner may lead one to forget that his attitudes are not willful he suffers an organic disease which has affected his mental state beneath it all he is frightened and concerned about what is happening to him janet ross md nps i dont understand the pr man said ellis sighed mcpherson smiled patiently this is an organic cause of violent behavior he said thats the way to look at it the three of them were sitting in the four kings restaurant adjacent to the hospital the early dinner had been mcphersons idea mcpherson said he wanted ellis present so ellis was present that was how ellis thought about it ellis raised his hand beckoning the waiter for more coffee as he did so he thought it might keep him awake but it didnt matter he wouldnt sleep much tonight anyway not on the eve of his first stage three on a human subject he knew he would toss and turn in bed going over the operative procedure over and over again reviewing the pattern he already knew so well hed done a lot of monkeys as stagethree procedures one hundred and fiftyfour monkeys to be exact monkeys were difficult they pulled out their stitches they tugged at the wires they screeched and fought you and bit you cognac mcpherson asked fine the pr man said mcpherson glanced questioningly at ellis ellis shook his head he put cream in his coffee and sat back suppressing a yawn actually the pr man looked a little like a monkey a juvenile rhesus he had the same blocky lower jaw and thesame brighteyed alertness the pr mans name was ralph ellis didnt know the last name no pr man ever gave his last name of course at the hospital he wasnt referred to as a pr man he was the hospital information officer or news officer or some damned thing he did look like a monkey ellis found himself staring at the area of the skull behind the ear where the electrodes would be implanted we dont know much about the causes of violence mcpherson said and theres a lot of crap theory floating around written by sociologists and paid for by perfectly good taxpayer money but we do know that one particular illness psychomotor epilepsy may lead to violence psychomotor epilepsy ralph repeated yes now psychomotor epilepsy is as common as any other kind of epilepsy there are some famous people who have had it like dostoevski at the nps we think that psychomotor epilepsy may be extremely common among those people who engage in repetitive violent acts like certain policemen gangsters rioters hells angels nobody ever thinks of these people as physically ill we just accept the idea that there are a lot of men in the world with bad tempers we think thats normal perhaps it isnt i see ralph said and he did indeed seem to be seeing mcpherson should have been a gradeschool teacher ellis thought his great gift was teaching certainly hed never been much of a researcher and so mcpherson said brushing his hand through his white hair we have no idea exactly how common psychomotor epilepsy is but our guess is that as much as one or two percent of the population may suffer from it thats two to four million americans gosh ralph said ellis sipped his coffee gosh he thought good christ gosh for some reason mcpherson said nodding to the waiter as the cognacs were brought psychomotor epileptics are predisposed to violent aggressive behavior during their attacks we dont know why but its true the other things that go along with the syndrome are hypersexuality and pathological intoxication ralph began to look unusually interested we had the case of one woman with this disease mcpherson said who during a seizure state would have intercourse with twelve men a night and still be unsatisfied ralph swallowed his cognac ellis noticed that ralph wore a wide tie in a fashionable psychedelic pattern a hip fortyyearold publicrelations man gulping cognac at the thought of this woman pathological intoxication refers to the phenomenon of excessive violent drunkenness brought on by minuscule amounts of liquor just a sip or two that much liquor will unleash a seizure ellis thought of his first stage three benson pudgy little benson the mildmannered computer programmer who got drunk and beat up people men women whoever happened to be present the very idea of curing that with wires stuck in the brain seemed absurd ralph seemed to think so too and this operation will cure the violence yes mcpherson said we believe so but the operation has never been done before on a human subject it will be done at the hospital tomorrow morning i see ralph said as if he suddenly understood the reason for the dinner its very sensitive in terms of the press mcpherson said oh yes i can see that there was a short pause finally ralph said whos going to do the operation i am ellis said well ralph said ill have to check our files i want to make sure i have a recent picture of you and a good bio for the releases he frowned thinking of the work ahead of him ellis was astonished at the mans reaction was that all he thought that he might need a recent photo but mcpherson took it smoothly in stride well get you whatever you need he said and the meeting broke up robert morris was sitting in the hospital cafeteria finishing some stale apple pie when his pagemaster went off it produced a high electronic squeal which persisted until he reached down to his belt and turned it off he returned to his pie after a few moments the squeal came again he swore put down his fork and went to the wall phone to answer his page there had been a time when he regarded the little gray box clipped to his belt as a wonderful thing he relished those moments when he would be having lunch or dinner with a girl and his pagemaster would go off requiring him to call in that sound demonstrated that he was a busy responsible person involved in lifeanddeath matters when the pagemaster went off he would excuse himself abruptly and answer the call radiating a sense of duty before pleasure the girls loved it but after several years it was no longer wonderful the box was inhuman and implacable and it had come to symbolize for him the fact that he was not his own man he was perpetually on call to some higher authority however whimsical a nurse who wanted to confirm a medication order at am a relative who was acting up making trouble about mamas postoperative treatment a call to tell him a conference was being held when he was already there attending the damned conference now the finest moments in his life were those when he went home and put the box away for a few hours he became unreachable and free and he liked that very much he stared across the cafeteria at the remainder of his apple pie as he dialed the switchboard dr morris dr morris twofoursevenone thank you that was the extension for the seventh floor nurses station it was odd how he had learned all these extensions the telephone network of university hospital was more complicated than human anatomy but over the years without any conscious attempt to learn it he came to know it quite well he dialed the floor dr morris oh yes a female voice said we have a woman with an overnight bag for patient harold benson she says its personal things is it all right to give it to him ill come up he said thank you doctor he went back to his tray picked it up and carried it to the disposal area as he did so his beeper went off again he went to answer it dr morris dr morris onethreefiveseven that was the metabolic unit he dialed dr morris this is dr hanley an unfamiliar voice said we wondered if you could take a look at a lady we think may have steroid psychosis shes a hemolytic anemic up for splenectomy i cant see her today morris said and tomorrow is tight that he thought was the understatement of the year have you tried peters no peters has a lot of experience with steroid mentation try him all right thanks morris hung up he got onto the elevator and pressed the button for the seventh floor his beeper went off a third time he checked his watch it was and he was supposedly offduty by now but he answered it anyway it was kelso the pediatric resident want your ass whipped kelso said okay what time say about half an hour if youve got the balls ive got them theyre in my car see you on the court morris said then he added i may be a little late dont be too late kelso said itll be dark soon morris said he would hurry and hung up the seventh floor was quiet most of the other hospital floors were noisy jammed with relatives and visitors at this hour but the seventh floor was always quiet it had a sedate calm quality that the nurses were careful to preserve the nurse at the station said there she is doctor and nodded to a girl sitting on a couch morris went over to her she was young and very pretty in a flashy showbusiness sort of way she had long legs im dr morris angela black she stood up and shook hands very formally i brought this for harry she lifted a small blue overnight bag he asked me to bring it all right he took the bag from her ill see that he gets it she hesitated then said can i see him i dont think its a good idea benson would have been shaved by now preop patients who had been shaved often didnt want to see people just for a few minutes hes heavily sedated he said she was clearly disappointed then would you give him a message sure tell him im back in my old apartment hell understand all right you wont forget no ill tell him thank you she smiled it was a rather nice smile despite the long false eyelashes and the heavy makeup why did young girls do that to their faces i guess ill be going now and she walked off short skirt and very long legs a briskly determined walk he watched her go then hefted the bag which seemed heavy the cop sitting outside the door to said hows it going fine morris said the cop glanced at the overnight bag but said nothing as morris took it inside the room harry benson was watching a western on television morris turned down the sound a very pretty girl brought you this angela benson smiled yes she has a nice exterior not a very complicated internal mechanism but a nice exterior he extended his hand morris gave him the bag did she bring everything morris watched as benson opened it placing the contents on the bed there were a pair of pajamas an electric razor some aftershave lotion a paperback novel then benson brought out a black wig whats that morris asked benson shrugged i knew id need it sooner or later he said then he laughed you are letting me out of here arent you sooner or later morris laughed with him benson dropped the wig back into the bag and removed a plastic packet with a metallic clink he unfolded it and morris saw it was a set of screwdrivers of various sizes stored in a plastic package with pockets for each size whats that for morris asked benson looked puzzled for a moment then he said i dont know if youll understand yes i always have them with me for protection benson placed the screwdrivers back into the overnighter he handled them carefully almost reverently morris knew that patients frequently brought odd things into the hospital particularly if they were seriously ill there was a kind of totemic feeling about these objects as if they might have magical preservative powers they were often connected with some hobby or favorite activity he remembered a yachtsman with a metastatic brain tumor who had brought a kit to repair sails and a woman with advanced heart disease who had brought a can of tennis balls that kind of thing i understand morris said benson smiled telecomp was empty when she came into the room the consoles and teleprinters stood silently the screens blinking up random sequences of numbers she went to the corner and poured herself a cup of coffee then fed the test card from bensons latest psychodex into the computer the nps had developed the psychodex test along with several other computeranalyzed psychological tests it was all part of what mcpherson called doubleedged thinking in this case he meant that the idea of a brain being like a computer worked two ways in two different directions on the one hand you could utilize the computer to probe the brain to help you analyze its workings at the same time you could use your increased knowledge of the brain to help design better and more efficient computers as mcpherson said the brain is as much a model for the computer as the computer is a model for the brain at the nps computer scientists and neurobiologists had worked together for several years from that association had come form q and programs like george and martha and new psychosurgical techniques and psychodex psychodex was relatively simple it was a test that took straightforward answers to psychological questions and manipulated the answers according to complex mathematical formulations as the data were fed into the computer ross watched the screen glow with row after row of calculations she ignored them the numbers she knew were just the computers scratch pad the intermediate steps that it went through before arriving at a final answer she smiled thinking of how gerhard would explain it rotation of thirty by thirty matrices in space deriving factors making them orthogonal then weighting them it all sounded complicated and scientific and she didnt really understand any of it she had discovered long ago that you could use a computer without understanding how it worked just as you could use an automobile a vacuum cleaner or your own brain the screen flashed calculations ended call display sequence she punched in the display sequence for threespace scoring the computer informed her that three spaces accounted for eightyone percent of variance on the screen she saw a threedimensional image of a mountain with a sharp peak she stared at it a moment then picked up the telephone and paged mcpherson mcpherson frowned at the screen ellis looked over his shoulder ross said is it clear perfectly mcpherson said when was it done today she said mcpherson sighed youre not going to quit without a battle are you instead of answering she punched buttons and called up a second mountain peak much lower heres the last one previously on this scoring the elevation is psychotic mentation she said so hes much more pronounced now mcpherson said much more than even a month ago yes she said you think he was screwing around with the test she shook her head she punched in the four previous tests in succession the trend was clear on each test the mountain peak got higher and sharper well then mcpherson said hes definitely getting worse i gather you still think we shouldnt operate more than ever she said hes unquestionably psychotic and if you start putting wires in his head i know mcpherson said i know what youre saying hes going to feel that hes been turned into a machine she said mcpherson turned to ellis do you suppose we can knock this elevation down with thorazine thorazine was a major tranquilizer with some psychotics it helped them to think more clearly i think its worth a try mcpherson nodded i do too janet she stared at the screen and didnt reply it was odd how these tests worked the mountain peaks were an abstraction a mathematical representation of an emotional state they werent a real characteristic of a person like fingers or toes or height or weight janet what do you think mcpherson repeated i think she said that youre both committed to this operation and you still disapprove i dont disapprove i think its unwise for benson what do you think about using thorazine mcpherson persisted its a gamble a gamble not worth taking maybe its worth it and maybe its not but its a gamble mcpherson nodded and turned to ellis do you still want to do him yes ellis said staring at the screen i still want to do him as always morris found it strange to play tennis on the hospital court the hospital buildings looming high above him always made him feel slightly guilty all those rows of windows all those patients who could not do what he was doing then there was the sound or rather the absence of sound the freeway ran near the hospital and the reassuring thwock of the tennis balls was completely obliterated by the steady monotonous rush of passing cars it was getting dark now and he was having trouble with his vision the ball seemed to pop unexpectedly into his court kelso was much less hampered morris often joked that kelso ate too many carrots but whatever the explanation it was humiliating to play late with kelso darkness helped him and morris hated to lose he had long ago become comfortable with the fact of his own competitiveness morris never stopped competing he competed in games he competed in work he competed with women more than once ross had pointed that out to him and then dropped the subject in the sly way that psychiatrists raise a point then drop it morris didnt mind it was a fact of his life and whatever the connotations deep insecurity a need to prove himself a feeling of inferiority he didnt worry about it he drew pleasure from competition and satisfaction from winning and so far in his life he had managed to win more often than not in part he had joined the nps because the challenges were very great and because the potential rewards were enormous privately morris expected to be a professor of surgery before he was forty his past career had been outstanding that was why ellis had accepted him and he was equally confident about his future it wouldnt hurt to be associated with a major landmark in surgical practice all in all he was in a good mood and he played hard for half an hour until he was tired and it was too dark to see he signaled to kelso no point in calling above the freeway sounds to end the game they met at the net and shook hands morris was reassured to see that kelso was sweating heavily good game kelso said tomorrow same time im not sure morris said kelso paused oh he said thats right you have a big day tomorrow big day morris nodded christ had the news even reached the pediatric residents for a moment he felt what ellis must be feeling the intense pressure abstract vague that came from knowing that the entire university hospital staff was watching this procedure well good luck with it kelso said as the two men walked back to the hospital morris saw ellis a distant solitary figure limping slightly as he crossed the parking lot and climbed into his car and drove home wednesday march implantation at am janet ross was on the third surgical floor dressed in greens having coffee and a doughnut the surgeons lounge was busy at this hour although operations were scheduled to begin at six most didnt get going for fifteen or twenty minutes after that the surgeons sat around reading the newspaper discussing the stock market and their golf games from time to time one of them would leave go to the overhead viewing galleries and look down on their ors to see how preparations were coming she was the only woman in the room and her presence changed the masculine atmosphere subtly it annoyed her that she should be the only woman and it annoyed her that the men should become quieter more polite less jovial and raucous she didnt give a damn if they were raucous and she resented being made to feel like an intruder it seemed to her that she had been an intruder all her life even when she was very young her father had been a surgeon who never bothered to conceal his disappointment and irritation that he had a daughter instead of a son a son would have fitted into his scheme of life he could have brought him to the hospital on saturday mornings taken him into the operating rooms those were all things you could do with a son but a daughter was something else a perplexing entity not suited for a surgical life and therefore an intrusion she looked around at all the surgeons in the lounge and then to cover her unease she went to the phone and dialed the seventh floor this is dr ross is mr benson on call he was just sent when did he leave the floor about five minutes ago she hung up and went back to her coffee ellis appeared and waved to her across the room therell be a fiveminute delay hooking into the computer he said theyre tying in the lines now is the patient on call sent five minutes ago you seen morris not yet he better get his ass down here ellis said somehow that made her feel good morris was in the elevator with a nurse and benson who lay on a stretcher and one of the cops as they rode down morris said to the cop you cant get off on the floor why not were going onto the sterile floor directly what should i do the cop was intimidated hed been docile and hesitant all morning the routine of surgery left him feeling a helpless outsider you can watch from the viewing gallery on the third floor tell the desk nurse i said it was all right the cop nodded the elevator stopped at the second floor the doors opened to reveal a hallway with people all in surgical greens walking back and forth a large sign read sterile area no admittance without authorization the lettering was red morris and the nurse wheeled benson out of the elevator the cop remained behind looking nervous he pushed the button for the third floor and the doors closed morris went with benson down the corridor after a moment benson said im still awake of course you are but i dont want to be awake morris nodded patiently benson had gotten preop medications half an hour earlier they would be taking effect soon making him drowsy hows your mouth dry that was the atropine beginning to work youll be okay morris himself had never had an operation hed performed hundreds but never experienced one himself in recent years he had begun to wonder how it felt to be on the other side of things he suspected though he would never admit it that it must be awful youll be okay he said to benson again and touched his shoulder benson just stared at him as he was wheeled down the corridor to or or was the largest operating room in the hospital it was nearly thirty feet square and packed with electronic equipment when the full surgical team was there all twelve of them things got pretty crowded but now just two scrub nurses were working in the cavernous graytiled space they were setting out sterile tables and drapes around the chair or had no operating table instead there was a softly cushioned upright chair like a dentists chair janet ross watched the girls through the windows in the door that separated the scrub room from the operating room alongside her ellis finished his scrub and muttered something about fucking morris being fucking late ellis got profane before operations he also got very nervous though he seemed to think nobody noticed that ross had scrubbed with him on several animal procedures and had seen the ritual tension and profanity before the operation and utter bland calmness once things were under way ellis turned off the faucets with his elbows and entered the or backing in so that his arms did not touch the door a nurse handed him a towel while he dried his hands he looked back through the door at ross and then up at the glasswalled viewing gallery overhead ross knew there would be a crowd in the gallery watching the operation morris came down and began scrubbing she said ellis wondered where you were tour guide for the patient he said one of the circulating nurses entered the scrub room and said dr ross theres somebody here from the radiation lab with a unit for dr ellis does he want it now if its loaded she said ill ask the nurse said she disappeared and stuck her head in a moment later he says its loaded and ready to go but unless your equipment is shielded it could give you trouble ross knew that all the or equipment had been shielded the week before the plutonium exchanger didnt put out much radiation not enough to fog an xray plate but it could confuse more delicate scientific equipment there was of course no danger to people were shielded ross said have him take it into the or ross turned to morris scrubbing alongside her hows benson nervous he should be she said morris glanced at her his eyes questioning above the gauze surgical mask she shook her hands free of excess water and backed into the or the first thing she saw was the radlab man wheeling in the tray with the charging unit on it it was contained in a small lead box on the sides were stenciled danger radiation and the tripleblade orange symbol for radiation it was all faintly ridiculous the charging unit was quite safe ellis stood across the room being helped into his gown he plunged his hands into his rubber gloves and flexed his fingers to the radlab man he said has it been sterilized sir has the unit been sterilized i dont know sir then give it to one of the girls and have her autoclave it its got to be sterile dr ross dried her hands and shivered in the cold of the operating room like most surgeons ellis preferred a cold room too cold really for the patient but as ellis often said if im happy the patients happy ellis was now across the room standing by the viewing box while the circulating nurse who was not scrubbed put up the patients xrays ellis peered closely at them though he had seen them a dozen times before they were perfectly normal skull films air had been injected into the ventricles so that the horns stood out darkly one by one the rest of the team filtered into the room all together there were two scrub nurses two circulating nurses one orderly ellis two assistant surgeons including morris two electronics technicians and a computer programmer the anaesthetist was outside with benson without looking up from his console one of the electronics men said any time you want to begin doctor well wait for the patient ellis said dryly and there were some chuckles from the nine group team ross looked around the room at the seven tv screens they were of different sizes and stationed in different places depending on how important they were to the surgeon the smallest screen monitored the closedcircuit taping of the operation at the moment it showed an overhead view of the empty chair another screen nearer the surgeon monitored the electroencephalogram or eeg it was turned off now the sixteen pens tracing straight white lines across the screen there was also a large tv screen for basic operative parameters electrocardiogram peripheral arterial pressure respirations cardiac output central venous pressure rectal temperature like the eeg screen it was also tracing a series of straight lines another pair of screens were completely blank they would display blackandwhite imageintensified xray views during the operation finally two color screens displayed the limbic program output that program was cycling now without punchedin coordinates on the screens a picture of the brain rotated in three dimensions while random coordinates generated by computer flashed below as always ross felt that the computer was another almost human presence in the room an impression that was always heightened as the operation proceeded ellis finished looking at the xrays and glanced up at the clock it was benson was still outside being checked by the anaesthetist ellis walked around the room talking briefly to everyone he was being unusually friendly and ross wondered why she looked up at the viewing gallery and saw the director of the hospital the chief of surgery the chief of medicine and the chief of research all looking down through the glass then she understood it was when benson was wheeled in he was now heavily premedicated relaxed his body limp his eyelids heavy his head was wrapped in a green towel ellis supervised bensons transfer from the stretcher to the chair as the leather straps were placed across his arms and legs benson seemed to wake up his eyes opening wide thats just so you dont fall off ellis said easily we dont want you to hurt yourself uhhuh benson said softly and closed his eyes again ellis nodded to the nurses who removed the sterile towel from bensons head the naked head seemed very small that was rosss usual reaction and white the skin was smooth except for a razor nick on the left frontal elliss blueink x marks were clearly visible on the right side benson leaned back in the chair he did not open his eyes again one of the technicians began to fix the monitor leads to his body strapping them on with little dabs of electrolyte paste they were attached quickly soon his body was connected to a tangle of multicolored wires running off to the equipment ellis looked at the tv monitor screens the eeg was now tracing sixteen jagged lines heartbeat was recorded respirations were gently rising and falling temperature was steady the technicians began to punch preop parameters into the computer normal lab values had already been fed in during the operation the computer would monitor all vital signs at fivesecond intervals and would signal if anything went wrong lets have music please ellis said and one of the nurses slipped a tape cartridge into the portable cassette recorder in a corner of the room a bach concerto began to play softly ellis always operated to bach he said he hoped that the precision if not the genius might be contagious they were approaching the start of the operation the digital wall clock said am next to it an elapsedtime digital clock still read with the help of a scrub nurse ross put on her sterile gown and gloves the gloves were always difficult for her she didnt scrub in frequently and when she plunged her fingers into the gloves she caught her hand missing one of the finger slots and putting two fingers in another it was impossible to read the scrub nurses reaction only her eyes were visible above the mask but ross was glad that ellis and the other surgeons were turned away attending to the patient she stepped to the back of the room being careful not to trip over the thick black power cables that snaked across the floor in all directions ross did not participate in the initial stages of the operation she waited until the stereotaxic mechanism was in place and the coordinates were determined she had time to stand to one side and pluck at her glove until all the fingers were in the right slots there was no real purpose for her to attend the operation at all but mcpherson was insistent that one member of the nonsurgical staff scrub in each day that they operated he felt it kept the unit more cohesive at least that was what he said she watched ellis and his assistants across the room draping benson then she looked over to the draping as seen on the closedcircuit monitor the entire operation would be recorded on video tape for later review i think we can start now ellis said easily go ahead with the needle the anaesthetist working behind the chair placed the needle between the second and third lumbar spaces of bensons spine benson moved once and made a slight sound and then the anaesthetist said im through the dura how much do you want the computer console flashed operation begun the computer automatically started the elapsedtime clock which ticked off the seconds give me thirty ccs to begin ellis said lets have xray please the xray machines were swung into position at the front and side of the patients head film plates were set on locking in with a click ellis stepped on the floor button and the tv screens glowed suddenly showing blackandwhite images of the skull he watched in two views as air slowly filled the ventricles outlining the horns in black the programmer sat at the computer console his hands fluttering over the buttons on his tv display screen the words pneumograph initiated appeared all right lets fix his hat ellis said the boxlike tubular stereotactic frame was placed over the patients head burrhole locations were fixed and checked when ellis was satisfied he injected local anaesthetic into the scalp points then he cut the skin and reflected it back exposing the white surface of the skull drill please with the mm drill he made the first of the two holes on the right side of the skull he placed the stereotactic frame the hat over the head and screwed it down securely ross looked over at the computer display values for heart rate and blood pressure flashed on the screen and faded everything was normal soon the computer like the surgeons would begin to deal with more complex matters lets have a position check ellis said stepping away from the patient frowning critically at bensons shaved head and the metal frame screwed on top of it the xray technician came forward and snapped the pictures in the old days ross remembered they actually took xray plates and determined position by visual inspection of the plates it was a slow process using a compass protractor and ruler they drew lines across the xray measured them rechecked them now the data were fed directly to the computer which did the analysis more rapidly and more accurately all the team turned to look at the computer printout screen the xray views appeared briefly and were replaced by schematic drawings the maxfield location of the stereotactic apparatus was calculated the actual location was then merged with it a set of coordinates flashed up followed by the notation placement correct ellis nodded thank you for your consultation he said humorlessly and went over to the tray which held the electrodes the team was now using briggs stainlesssteel tefloncoated electrode arrays in the past they had tried almost everything else gold platinum alloy and even flexible steel strands in the days when the electrodes were placed by inspection the old inspection operations were bloody messy affairs it was necessary to remove a large portion of the skull and expose the surface of the brain the surgeon found his landmark points on the surface itself and then placed his electrodes in the substance of the brain if he had to place them in deep structures he would occasionally cut through the brain to the ventricles with a knife and then place them there were serious complications the operations were lengthy the patients never did very well now the computer had changed all that the computer allowed you to fix a point precisely in threedimensional space initially along with other researchers in the field the nps group had tried to relate deep brain points to skull architecture they measured their landmark points from the orbit of the eye from the meatus of the ear from the sagittal suture that of course didnt work peoples brains did not fit inside their skulls with any consistency the only way to determine deep brain points was in relation to other brain points and the logical landmarks were the ventricles the fluidfilled spaces within the brain according to the new system everything was determined in relation to the ventricles with the help of the computer it was no longer necessary to expose the brain surface instead a few small holes were drilled in the skull and the electrodes inserted while the computer watched by xray to make sure they were being placed correctly ellis picked up the first electrode array from where ross stood it looked like a single slender wire actually it was a bundle of twenty wires with staggered contact points each wire was coated with teflon except for the last millimeter which was exposed each wire was a different length so that under a magnifying glass the staggered electrode tips looked like a miniature staircase ellis checked the array under a large glass he called for more light and turned the array peering at all contact points then he had a scrub nurse plug it into a testing unit and test every contact this had been done dozens of times before but ellis always checked again before insertion and he always had four arrays sterilized though he would need only two ellis was careful at length he was satisfied are we ready to wire he asked the team they nodded he stepped up to the patient and said lets go through the dura up to this point in the operation they had drilled through the skull but had left intact the membrane of dura mater which covered the brain and enclosed the spinal fluid elliss assistant used a probe to puncture the dura i have fluid he said and a thin trickle of clear liquid slid down the side of the shaved skull from the hole a nurse sponged it away ross always found it a source of wonder the way the brain was protected other vital body organs were wellprotected of course the lungs and heart inside the bony cage of the ribs the liver and spleen under the edge of the ribs the kidneys packed in fat and secure against thick muscles of the lower back good protection but nothing compared to the central nervous system which was encased entirely in thick bone yet even this was not enough inside the bone there were saclike membranes which held cerebrospinal fluid the fluid was under pressure so that the brain sat in the middle of a pressurized liquid system that afforded its superb protection mcpherson had compared it to a fetus in a waterfilled womb the baby comes out of the womb mcpherson said but the brain never comes out of its own special womb we will place now ellis said ross moved forward joining the surgical team gathered around the head she watched as ellis slid the tip of the electrode array into the burr hole and then pressed slightly entering the substance of the brain the technician punched buttons on the computer console the display screen read entry point localized the patient did not move made no sound the brain could not feel pain it lacked pain sensors it was one of the freaks of evolution that the organ which sensed pain throughout the body could feel nothing itself ross looked away from ellis toward the xray screens there in harsh black and white she saw the crisply outlined white electrode array begin its slow steady movement into the brain she looked from the anterior view to the lateral and then to the computergenerated images the computer was interpreting the xray images by drawing a simplified brain with the temporallobe target area in red and a flickering blue track showing the line the electrode must traverse from entry point to the target area so far ellis was following the track perfectly very pretty ross said the computer flashed up triple coordinates in rapid succession as the electrodes went deeper practice makes perfect ellis said sourly he was now using the scaledown apparatus attached to the stereotactic hat the scaler reduced his crude finger movements to very small changes in electrode movements if he moved his finger half an inch the scaler converted that to half a millimeter very slowly the electrodes penetrated deeper into the brain from the screens ross could lift her eyes and watch the closedcircuit tv monitor showing ellis at work it was easier to watch on tv than to turn around and see the real thing but she turned around when she heard benson say very distinctly uh ellis stopped what was that patient the anaesthetist said gesturing toward benson ellis paused bent over to look at bensons face you all right mr benson he spoke loudly distinctly yuh fine benson said his voice was deeply drugged any pain no good just relax now and he returned to his work ross sighed in relief somehow all that had made her tense even though she knew there was no reason for alarm benson could feel no pain and she had known all along that his sedation was only that a kind of deep drugged semisleep and not unconsciousness there was no reason for him to be unconscious no reason to risk general anaesthesia she turned back to the computer screen the computer had now presented an inverted view of the brain as seen from below near the neck the electrode track was visible end on as a single blue point surrounded by concentric circles ellis was supposed to keep within one millimeter one twentyfifth of an inch of the assigned track he deviated half a millimeter track error warned the computer ross said youre slipping off the electrode array stopped in its path ellis glanced up at the screens too high on beta plane wide on gamma okay after a moment the electrodes continued along the path track error the computer flashed it rotated its brain image slowly bringing up an anterolateral view track error it said youre correcting nicely ross said ellis hummed along with the bach and nodded zero track error the computer indicated and swung the brain view around to a full lateral the second screen showed a full frontal view after a few moments the screen blinked approaching target ross conveyed the message seconds later the flashing word strike youre on ross said ellis stepped back and folded his hands across his chest lets have a coordinate check he said the elapsedtime clock showed that twentyseven minutes had passed in the operation the programmer flicked the console buttons rapidly on the tv screens the placement of the electrode was simulated by the computer the simulation ended like the actual placement with the word strike now match it ellis said the computer held its simulation on one screen and matched it to the xray image of the patient the overlap was perfect the computer reported matched within established limits thats it ellis said he screwed on the little plastic button cap which held the electrodes tightly against the skull then he applied dental cement to fix it he untangled the twenty fine wire leads that came off the electrode array and pushed them to one side we can do the next one now he said at the end of the second placement a thin arcing cut was made with a knife along the scalp to avoid important superficial vessels and nerves the cut ran from the electrode entry points down the side of the ear to the base of the neck there it deviated to the right shoulder using blunt dissection ellis opened a small pocket beneath the skin of the right lateral chest near the armpit have we got the charging unit he asked the charger was brought to him it was smaller than a pack of cigarettes and contained thirtyseven grams of the radioactive isotope plutonium oxide the radiation produced heat which was converted directly by a thermionic unit to electric power a kenbeck solidstate dcdc circuit transformed the output to the necessary voltage ellis plugged the charger into the test pack and did a lastminute check of its power before implantation as he held it in his hand he said its cold i cant get used to that ross knew layers of vacuumfoil insulation kept the exterior cool and that inside the packet the radiation capsule was producing heat at degrees fahrenheit hot enough to cook a roast he checked radiation to be sure there would be no leakage the meters all read in the lownormal range there was a certain amount of leakage naturally but it was no more than that produced by a commercial color television set finally he called for the dog tag benson would have to wear this dog tag for as long as he had the atomic charging unit in his body the tag warned that the person had an atomic pacemaker and gave a telephone number ross knew that the number was a listing which played a recorded message twentyfour hours a day the recording gave detailed technical information about the charging unit and warned that bullet wounds automobile accidents fires and other damage could release the plutonium which was a powerful alphaparticle emitter it gave special instructions to physicians coroners and morticians and warned particularly against cremation of the body unless the charger was first removed ellis inserted the charging unit into the small subdermal pocket he had made in the chest wall he sewed tissue layers around it to fix it in place then he turned his attention to the postagestampsized electronic computer ross looked up at the viewing gallery and saw the wizard twins gerhard and richards watching intently ellis checked the packet under the magnifying glass then gave it to a scrubbed technician who hooked the little computer into the main hospital computer to ross the computer was the most remarkable part of the entire system since she had joined the nps three years before she had seen the computer shrink from a prototype as large as a briefcase to the present tiny model which looked small in the palm of a hand yet contained all the elements of the original bulky unit this tiny size made subdermal implantation possible the patient was free to move about take showers do anything he wanted much better than the old units where the charger was clipped to a patients belt and wires dangled down all over she looked at the computer screens which flashed operative monitors interrupted for electronics check on one screen a blownup circuit diagram appeared the computer checked each pathway and component independently it took fourmillionths of a second for each check the entire process was completed in two seconds the computer flashed electronic check negative a moment later brain views reappeared the computer had gone back to monitoring the operation well ellis said lets hook him up he painstakingly attached the forty fine wire leads from the two electrode arrays to the plastic unit then he fitted the wires down along the neck tucked the plastic under the skin and called for sutures the elapsedtime clock read one hour and twelve minutes morris wheeled benson into the recovery room a long lowceilinged room where patients were brought immediately after operation the nps had a special section of the rec room as did cardiac patients and burns patients but the nps section with its cluster of electronic equipment had never been used before benson was the first case benson looked pale but otherwise fine his head and neck were heavily bandaged morris supervised his transfer from the rolling stretcher to the permanent bed across the room ellis was telephoning in his operative note if you dialed extension you got a transcribing machine the dictated message would later be typed up by a secretary and inserted in bensons record elliss voice droned on in the background centimeter incisions were made over the right temporal region and millimeter burr holes drilled with a k drill implantation of briggs electrodes carried out with computer assistance on the limbic program honey thats spelled in capital letter limbic program xray placement of electrodes determined with computer review as within established limits electrodes sealed with tyler fivation caps and sevenohgrade dental sealer transmission wires what do you want on him the recroom nurse asked vital signs q five minutes for the first hour q fifteen for the second q thirty for the third hourly thereafter if hes stable you can move him up to the floor in six hours the nurse nodded making notes morris sat down by the bedside to write a short operative note short operative note on harold f benson preop dx psychomotor temporal lobe epilepsy postop dx same procedure implantation of twin briggs electrode arrays into right temporal lobe with subdermal placing of computer and plutonium charging unit preop meds phenobarbital mg one hr prior to atropine mg procedure anaesthesia lidocaine epinephrine locally estimated blood loss cc fluid replacement cc dw operative duration hr min postop condition good as he finished the note he heard ross say to the nurse start him on phenobarb as soon as hes awake she sounded angry he looked up at her something the matter no she said you seem angry are you picking a fight with me no he said of course just make sure he gets his phenobarb we want to keep him sedated until we can interface him and she stormed out of the room morris watched her go then glanced over at ellis who was still dictating but had been watching ellis shrugged whats the matter with her the nurse asked probably just tired morris said he adjusted the monitoring equipment on the shelf above bensons head he turned it on and waited until it warmed up then he placed the temporary induction unit around bensons taped shoulder during the operation all the wires had been hooked up but they were not working now before that happened benson had to be interfaced this meant determining which of the forty electrodes would stop an epileptic seizure and locking in the appropriate switches on the subdermal computer because the computer was under the skin the locking in would be accomplished by an induction unit which worked through the skin but the interfacing couldnt be done until tomorrow meanwhile the equipment monitored bensons brainwave activity the screens above the bed glowed a bright green and showed the white tracing of his eeg the pattern was normal for alpha rhythms slowing from sedation benson opened his eyes and looked at morris how do you feel he asked sleepy he said is it beginning soon its over morris said benson nodded not at all surprised and closed his eyes a radlab technician came in and checked for leakage from the plutonium with a geiger counter there was none morris slipped the dog tag around bensons neck the nurse picked it up curiously read it and frowned ellis came over time for breakfast yes morris said time for breakfast they left the room together the trouble was he didnt really like the sound of his voice his voice was rough and grating and his enunciation was poor mcpherson preferred to see the words in his mind as if they had been written he pressed the microphone button on the dictation machine roman numeral three philosophical implications iii philosophical implications he paused and looked around his office the large model of the brain sat at the corner of his desk shelves of journals along one wall and the tv monitor on the screen now he was watching the playback of the mornings operation the sound was turned off the milky images silent ellis was drilling holes in bensons head mcpherson watched and began to dictate this procedure represents the first direct link between a human brain and a computer the link is permanent now of course any man sitting at a computer console and interacting with the computer by pressing buttons can be said to be linked too stuffy he thought he ran the tape back and made changes now a man sitting at a computer console and interacting with the computer by pressing buttons is linked to the computer but that link is not direct and the link is not permanent therefore this operative procedure represents something rather different how is one to think about it a good question he thought he stared at the tv image of the operation then continued one might think of the computer in this case as a prosthetic device just as a man who has his arm amputated can receive a mechanical equivalent of the lost arm so a braindamaged man can receive a mechanical aid to overcome the effects of brain damage this is a comfortable way to think about the operation it makes the computer into a highclass wooden leg yet the implications go much further than that he paused to look at the screen somebody at the main tape station had changed reels he was no longer seeing the operation but a psychiatric interview with benson before the surgery benson was excited smoking a cigarette making stabbing gestures with the lighted tip as he spoke curious mcpherson turned the sound up slightly know what theyre doing the machines are everywhere they used to be the servants of man but now theyre taking over subtly subtly taking over ellis stuck his head into the office saw the tv screen and smiled looking at the before pictures trying to get a little work done mcpherson said and pointed to the dictation machine ellis nodded ducked out closing the door behind him benson was saying know im a traitor to the human race because im helping to make machines more intelligent thats my job programming artificial intelligence and mcpherson turned the sound down until it was almost inaudible then he went back to his dictation in thinking about computer hardware we distinguish between central and peripheral equipment that is the main computer is considered central even though in human terms it may be located in some outoftheway place like the basement of a building for example the computers readout equipment display consoles and so on are peripheral they are located at the edges of the computer system on different floors of the building he looked at the tv screen benson was particularly excited he turned up the sound and heard getting more intelligent first steam engines then automobiles and airplanes then adding machines now computers feedback loops mcpherson turned the sound off for the human brain the analogy is a central brain and peripheral terminals such as mouth arms and legs they carry out the instructions the output of the brain by and large we judge the workings of the brain by the activity of these peripheral functions we notice what a person says and how he acts and from that deduce how his brain works this idea is familiar to everyone he looked at benson on the tv screen what would benson say would he agree or disagree but then did it matter now however in this operation we have created a man with not one brain but two he has his biological brain which is damaged and he has a new computer brain which is designed to correct the damage this new brain is intended to control the biological brain therefore a new situation arises the patients biological brain is the peripheral terminal the only peripheral terminal for the new computer in one area the new computer brain has total control and therefore the patients biological brain and indeed his whole body has become a terminal for the new computer we have created a man who is one single large complex computer terminal the patient is a readout device for the new computer and he is as helpless to control the readout as a tv screen is helpless to control the information presented on it perhaps that was a bit strong he thought he pressed the button and said harriet type that last paragraph but i want to look at it okay roman numeral four summary and conclusions iv summary and conclusions he paused again and turned up the sound on benson benson was saying hate them particularly the prostitutes airplane mechanics dancers translators gasstation attendants the people who are machines or who service machines the prostitutes i hate them all as he spoke benson continued to stab with his cigarette and how did you feel dr ramos said angry janet ross said angry as hell i mean that nurse was standing there watching it all she pretended she didnt understand what was happening but she did you felt angry about dr ramos let his voice trail off about the operation about benson they went ahead and did it i told them from the beginning from the goddamned very beginning that it was a bad idea but ellis and morris and mcpherson all wanted to do it theyre so cocky particularly morris when i saw him in the recovery room gloating over benson who was all taped up and pale as a ghost i just got mad why is that because he was so pale because he uh she stopped she fumbled for an answer but couldnt think of a logical response i gather the operation was successful dr ramos said and most people are pale after surgery what got you mad she said nothing finally she said i dont know she heard dr ramos shift in his chair she could not see him she was lying on the couch and dr ramos was behind her head there was a long silence while she stared at the ceiling and tried to think what to say her thoughts seemed to be churning not making any sense finally dr ramos said the presence of the nurse seems important to you it does well you mentioned it i wasnt aware i had you said the nurse was there and knew what was going on what exactly was going on i was mad but you dont know why yes i do she said it was morris hes so cocky cocky dr ramos repeated overly selfassured you said cocky look i didnt mean anything by that it was just a word she broke off she was very angry she could hear it in her voice you are angry now dr ramos said very why after a long pause she sad they didnt listen to me who didnt listen to you any of them not mcpherson not ellis not morris nobody listened to me did you tell dr ellis or dr mcpherson you were angry no but you vented your anger on dr morris yes he was leading her someplace and she couldnt see where normally at this point she could jump ahead and understand but this time how old is dr morris i dont know about my age thirty thirtyone something in there about your age that pissed her off his way of repeating things yes god damn it about my age and a surgeon yes is it easier to express anger toward someone you regard as a contemporary i never thought about it your father was also a surgeon but he wasnt your contemporary you dont have to draw me a picture she said youre still angry she sighed lets change the subject all right he said in that easy voice that she sometimes liked and sometimes hated morris hated to do initial interviews the initial interview staff consisted mostly of clinical psychologists the work was lengthy and boring a recent tabulation had shown that only one in forty new patients to the nps received further work and only one in eightythree was accepted as having some variety of organic brain disease with behavioral manifestations that meant most initial interviews were a waste of time and it was particularly true of offthestreet patients a year ago mcpherson had decided for political reasons that anyone who heard of the nps and presented himself directly would be seen most patients were still referrals of course but mcpherson felt the image of the unit depended upon prompt treatment of selfreferrals as well mcpherson also felt that everyone on the staff should do some initial interviews from time to time morris worked two days a month in the little interview rooms with the oneway glass mirrors this was one of his days but he didnt want to be here he was still exhilarated from the mornings operation and he resented returning to this kind of mundane routine he looked up unhappily as the next patient came into the room he was a young man in his twenties wearing dungarees and a sweatshirt he had long hair morris stood to greet him im dr morris craig beckerman the handshake was soft and tentative please sit down he waved beckerman to a chair which faced morriss desk and the oneway mirror behind what brings you to us i uh im curious i read about you beckerman said in a magazine you do brain surgery here thats true well i uh i was curious about it in what sense well this magazine article can i smoke here of course morris said he pushed an ashtray across the desk to beckerman beckerman brought out a pack of camels tapped one on the desk then lit it the magazine article right the magazine article said that you put wires in the brain is that true yes we sometimes perform that kind of surgery beckerman nodded he smoked the cigarette yeah well is it true that you can put wires in so that you feel pleasure intense pleasure yes morris said he tried to say it blandly thats really true its really true morris said and then he shook his pen indicating that it was out of ink he opened the desk drawer to take out another pen and as he reached into the drawer he pressed a sequence on the buttons hidden inside immediately his telephone rang dr morris at the other end the secretary said you rang yes would you hold all calls please and transfer them to development section right away the secretary said thank you morris hung up he knew that the development people would arrive soon to watch on the other side of the oneway mirror im sorry for the interruption you were sayg about the wires in the brain yes we do that operation mr beckerman under special circumstances but its still pretty experimental thats all right beckerman said he puffed on his cigarette thats fine with me if you want information we can arrange for you to have some reprints and magazine tear sheets explaining our work here beckerman smiled and shook his head no no he said i dont want information i want the operation im volunteering morris pretended to be surprised he paused a moment and said i see listen beckerman said in the article it said that one jolt of electricity was like a dozen orgasms it sounded really terrific and you want this operation performed on you yeah beckerman said nodding vigorously right why are you kidding wouldnt everybody want it pleasure like that perhaps morris said but youre the first person to ask for it whats the matter beckerman said is it really expensive or something no but we dont perform brain surgery for trivial reasons oh wow beckerman said so thats where you are jesus and he got up and left the room shaking his head the three development guys looked stupefied they sat in the adjoining room and stared through the oneway glass beckerman had long since departed fascinating morris said the development guys didnt reply finally one of them cleared his throat and said to say the least morris knew what was going through their heads for years they had been doing feasibility studies potential application studies ramification studies industrial operations studies inputoutput studies they were geared to think in the future and now they were suddenly confronted with the present that man is an elad one of them said and sighed the elad concept had caused a lot of interest and some detached academic concern the notion of an electrical addict a man who needed his jolts of electricity just as some men needed doses of drugs had seemed almost fancifully speculative but now they had a patient who was clearly a potential addict electricity is the biggest kick of all one of them said and laughed but the laugh was nervous edged with tension morris wondered what mcpherson would say probably something philosophical mcpherson was mostly interested in philosophy these days the idea of an electrical addict was predicated on an astonishing discovery made by james olds in the s olds found that there were areas in the brain where electrical stimulation produced intense pleasure strips of brain tissue he called rivers of reward if an electrode was placed in such an area a rat would press a selfstimulation lever to receive a shock as often as five thousand times an hour in its quest for pleasure it would ignore food and water it would stop pressing the lever only when it was prostrate with exhaustion this remarkable experiment had been repeated with goldfish guinea pigs dolphins cats and goats there was no longer any question that the pleasure terminals in the brain were a universal phenomenon they had also been located in humans out of these considerations had come the notion of the electrical addict the man who needed pleasurable shocks at first glance it seemed impossible for a person to become an addict but it actually wasnt for instance the technological hardware was now expensive but it neednt be one could envision clever japanese firms manufacturing electrodes for as little as two or three dollars and exporting them nor was the idea of an illegal operation so farfetched at one time a million american women underwent illegal abortions each year the implantation brain surgery was somewhat more complex but not forbiddingly so and the surgical techniques would become more standardized in the future it was easy to imagine clinics springing up in mexico and the bahamas nor was there a problem finding surgeons to do the job a single busy wellorganized neurosurgeon could perform ten or fifteen operations a day he could certainly charge a thousand dollars for each and with that kind of incentive unscrupulous surgeons could be found a hundred thousand dollars a week in cash was a strong inducement to break the law if indeed a law were ever passed that did not seem very likely a year before the hospital had organized a seminar with legal scholars on biomedical technology and the law elads were among the subjects discussed but the lawyers were not responsive the elad concept did not fit neatly into the already existing pattern of laws governing drug addiction all those laws recognized that a person could become a drug addict innocently or involuntarily quite a different proposition from a person coldly seeking a surgical procedure that would make him an addict most of the lawyers felt that the public would not seek such an operation there would be no legal problem because there would be no public demand now beckerman had provided evidence for such a demand ill be goddamned another of the development people said morris found that comment hardly adequate he himself felt something he had felt once or twice before since joining the nps it was the sensation that things were moving too fast without enough caution and control and that it could all get out of control suddenly and without warng at pm roger mcpherson head of the neuropsychiatric research unit went up to the seventh floor to check on his patient at least that was how he thought of benson as his patient a proprietary feeling but not entirely incorrect without mcpherson there would be no nps and without an nps there would be no surgery no benson that was how he thought of it room was quiet and bathed in reddish light from the setting sun benson appeared to be asleep but his eyes opened when mcpherson closed the door how are you feeling mcpherson asked moving close to the bed benson smiled everyone wants to know that he said mcpherson smiled back its a natural question im tired thats all very tired sometimes i think im a ticking time bomb and youre wondering when ill explode is that what you think mcpherson asked automatically he adjusted bensons covers so he could look at the iv line it was flowing nicely ticktick benson said closing his eyes again ticktick mcpherson frowned he was accustomed to mechanical metaphors from benson the man was preoccupied after all with the idea of men as machines but to have them appear so soon after operation any pain none a little ache behind my ears like id fallen thats all that mcpherson knew was the bone pain from the drilling fallen im a fallen man benson said ive succumbed to what to the process of being turned into a machine he opened his eyes and smiled again or a time bomb any smells strange sensations as he asked mcpherson looked at the eeg scanner above the bed it was still reading normal alpha patterns without any suggestion of seizure activity no nothing like that but you feel as if you might explode he thought ross should really be asking these questions sort of benson said in the coming war we may all explode how do you mean you look annoyed benson said im not just puzzled how do you mean in the coming war in the coming war between men and machines the human brain is obsolete you see that was a new thought mcpherson hadnt heard it from benson before he stared at him lying in the bed his head and shoulders heavily bandaged it made the upper part of his body and his head appear thick gross oversized yes benson said the human brain has gone as far as it is going to go its exhausted so it spawned the next generation of intelligent forms they will why am i so tired he closed his eyes again youre exhausted from the operation a minor procedure he said and smiled with his eyes closed a moment later he was snoring mcpherson remained by the bed for a moment then turned to the window and watched the sun set over the pacific benson had a nice room you could see a bit of the ocean between the highrise apartments in santa monica he remained there for several minutes benson did not wake finally mcpherson went out to the nurses station to write his note in the chart patient alert responsive oriented times three he paused after writing that he didnt really know if benson was oriented to person place and time he hadnt checked specifically but he was clear and responsive and mcpherson let it go flow of ideas orderly and clear but patient retains machine imagery of preoperative state it is too early to be certain but it appears that early predictions were correct that the operation would not alter his mentation between seizures signed roger a mcpherson md he stared at it for a moment then closed the chart and replaced it on the shelf it was a good note cool direct holding out no false anticipations the chart was a legal document after all and it could be called into court mcpherson didnt expect to see bensons chart in court but you couldnt be too careful he believed very strongly in appearances and he felt it was his job to do so the head of any large scientific laboratory performed a political function you might deny it you might dislike it but it was nonetheless true a necessary part of the job you had to keep all the people in the lab happy as they worked together the more prima donnas you had the tougher the job was as pure politics you had to get your lab funded from outside sources and that was also pure politics particularly if you were working in a delicate area as the nps was mcpherson had long since evolved the horseradishperoxidase principle of grant applications it was simple enough when you applied for money you announced that the money would be spent to find the enzyme horseradish peroxidase which could lead to a cure for cancer you would easily get sixty thousand dollars for that project although you couldnt get sixty cents for mind control he looked at the row of charts on the shelf a row of unfamiliar names into which benson h f merged indistinguishably in one sense he thought benson was correct he was a walking time bomb a man treated with mindcontrol technology was subject to all sorts of irrational public prejudice heart control in the form of cardiac pacemakers was considered a wonderful invention kidney control through drugs was a blessing but mind control was evil a disaster even though the nps control work was directly analogous to control work with other organs even the technology was similar the atomic pacemaker they were using had been developed first for heart work but the prejudice remained and benson thought of himself as a ticking time bomb mcpherson sighed took out the chart again and flipped to the section containing doctors orders both ellis and morris had written postop care orders mcpherson added after interfacing tomorrow am begin thorazine he looked at the note then decided the nurses wouldnt understand interfacing he scratched it out and wrote after noon tomorrow begin thorazine as he left the floor he thought that he would rest more easily once benson was on thorazine perhaps they couldnt defuse the time bomb but they could certainly drop it into a bucket of cold water late at night in telecomp gerhard stared anxiously at the computer console he typed in more instructions then walked to a printout typewriter and began reviewing the long sheaf of greenstriped sheets he scanned them quickly looking for the error he knew was there in the programmed instructions the computer itself never made a mistake gerhard had used computers for nearly ten years different computers different places and he had never seen one make a mistake of course mistakes occurred all the time but they were always in the program not in the machine sometimes that infallibility was hard to accept for one thing it didnt fit with ones view of the rest of the world where machines were always making mistakes fuses blowing stereos breaking down ovens overheating cars refusing to start modern man expected machines to make their fair share of errors but computers were different and working with them could be a humiliating experience they were never wrong it was as simple as that even when it took weeks to find the source of some problem even when the program was checked a dozen times by as many different people even when the whole staff was slowly coming to the conclusion that for once the computer circuitry had fouled up it always turned out in the end to be a human error of some kind always richards came in shrugging off a sport coat and poured himself a cup of coffee hows it going gerhard shook his head im having trouble with george again shit richards looked at the console hows martha marthas fine i think its just george which george is it saint george gerhard said really a bitch richards sipped his coffee and sat down at the console mind if i try it sure gerhard said richards began flicking buttons he called up the program for saint george then he called up the program for martha then he pushed the interaction button richards and gerhard hadnt devised these programs they were modified from several existing computer programs developed at other universities but the basic idea was the same to create a computer program that would make the computer act emotionally like people it was logical to designate the programs with names like george and martha there was a precedent for that eliza in boston and aldous in england george and martha were essentially the same program with slight differences the original george was programmed to be neutral in his response to stimuli then martha was created martha was a little bitchy martha disliked most things finally another george was formulated a very loving george who was referred to as saint george each program could respond with three emotional states love fear and anger each could produce three actions approach withdrawal and attack all this was of course highly abstract it was carried out in terms of numbers for example the original george was neutral to most numbers but he disliked the number he was programmed to dislike it and by extension he disliked similar numbers and so on he much preferred numbers such as and if you punched in one of these numbers george responded with numbers signifying love and approach if you punched in george withdrew if you punched in george angrily attacked according to the numbers he printed out the nps staff had played with the programs in this way for a long time then they had incorporated program modifications to allow for talk from the computer the numbers were translated into sentences this was amusing and revealing the actual interaction was referred to as the christmas game because most of it was conducted as giving and receiving gifts objects that had an assigned or learned emotional value just as the numbers did normal george interacting with martha would eventually win her over and her bitchiness would recede into the background but saint george had a much worse effect on her his loving acceptance drove her up the wall that is if things were working normally richards watched as the printout flashed across the screen hello im saint george hello what is your name martha you dont say much martha no but i like you why i dont like you i understand that how can i help it isnt printing periods consistently richards said when did that start thats nothing gerhard said just keep watching help yes i would like to help you have a cat richards winced cats were programmed to be something that both george and martha disliked giving george a cat was a very hostile move thank you have another cat thank you you are very kind have another cat no thank you dont you like cats yes but i have enough cats have a gorilla really nasty richards said what are the other interactions like pretty much the same gerhard said as bad as this pretty much they were accustomed now to the idea that when the computers interacted the results were unpredictable the general form of interaction could be guessed but the specific results were uncertain it was like a computer playing checkers it was probably going to win but it would win a different way each time depending on what the opponent did i dont want a gorilla dont you like gorillas no thank you you are too polite i am sorry if i offend you in any way you talk too much i am sorry have an eggplant richards watched with interest saint george had no background for eggplants but he disliked cucumbers and bananas no thank you dont you like eggplant not very much here have another one no thank you i want you to hae it no thank you go on and take it no thank you i insist no thank you whats happened to saint george richards asked his responses are too much the same thats whats bothering me whats he cycling through on the program i was looking for it when you came in i insist that you have a cucumber i refuse george richards said almost without thinking then have a banana no george is breaking down richards said hes not a saint any more then have both a banana and a cucumber no thank you i insist go to hell i will kill you the screen was filled with white dots what does that mean unprintable response richards said i dont know ive never seen it before tonight how many times has this program been run richards asked one hundred and ten against martha any learning erasures no ill be goddamned richards said hes getting to be a shorttempered saint he grinned we can write this one up gerhard nodded and went back to the printout in theory what was happening was not puzzling both george and martha were programmed to learn from experience like the checkersplaying programs where the machine got better each time it played a game this program was established so that the machine would learn new responses to things after one hundred and ten sets of experience saint george had abruptly stopped being a saint he was learning not to be a saint around martha even though he had been programmed for saintliness i know just how he feels richards said and switched the machine off then he joined gerhard looking for the programming error that had made it all possible thursday march interfacing janet ross sat in the empty room and glanced at the wall clock it was am she looked down at the desk in front of her which was bare except for a vase of flowers and a notepad she looked at the chair opposite her then aloud she said howre we doing there was a mechanical click and gerhards voice came through the speaker mounted in the ceiling we need a few minutes for the sound levels the light is okay you want to talk a minute she nodded and glanced over her shoulder at the oneway mirror behind her she saw only her reflection but she knew gerhard with his equipment was behind watching her you sound tired she said trouble with saint george last night gerhard said im tired too she said i was having trouble with somebody who isnt a saint she laughed she was just talking so they could get a sound level for the room she hadnt really paid attention to what she was saying but it was true arthur was no saint he was also no great discovery though shed thought he might be a few weeks ago when she first met him she had been in fact a little infatuated with him infatuated hmm is that what youd call it she could hear dr ramos now arthur had been born handsome and wealthy he had a yellow ferrari a lot of dash and a lot of charm she was able to feel feminine and frivolous around him he did madcap dashing things like flying her to mexico city for dinner because he knew a little restaurant where they made the best tacos in the world she knew it was all silly but she enjoyed it and in a way she was relieved she never had to talk about medicine or the hospital or psychiatry arthur wasnt interested in any of those things he was interested in her as a woman not as a sex object damn dr ramos then as she got to know him better she found herself wanting to talk about her work and she found with some surprise that arthur didnt want to hear about it arthur was threatened by her work he had problems about achievement he was nominally a stockbroker an easy thing for a rich mans son to be and he talked with authority about money investments interest rates bond issues but there was an aggressive quality in his manner a defensiveness as if he were substantiating himself and then she realized what she should have known from the beginning that arthur was chiefly interested in her because she was substantial it was in theory more difficult to impress her to sweep her off her feet than it was to impress the little actresses who hung out at bumbles and the candy store and therefore more satisfying finally her role had begun to bother her and she no longer drew pleasure from being frivolous around him and everything became vaguely depressing she recognized all the signs her work at the hospital became busier and she had to break dates with him when she did see him she was bored by his flamboyance his restless impulsiveness his clothes and his cars she would look at him across the dinner table and try to find what she had once seen she could not find even a trace of it last night she had broken it off they both knew it was coming why did it depress her you stopped talking gerhard said i dont know what to say now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the patient the quick brown fox jumped over the pithed frog we are all headed for that final common pathway in the sky she paused is that enough a little more mary mary quite contrary how does your garden grow im sorry i dont remember the rest how does the poem go she laughed thats fine we have the level now she looked up at the loudspeaker will you be interfacing at the end of the series probably gerhard said if it goes well rog is in a hurry to get him onto tranquilizers she nodded this was the final stage in bensons treatment and it had to be done before tranquilizers could be administered benson had been kept on sedation with phenobarbital until midnight the night before he would be clearheaded this morning and ready for interfacing it was mcpherson who had coined the term interfacing mcpherson liked computer terminology an interface was the boundary between two systems or between a computer and an effector mechanism in bensons case it was almost a boundary between two computers his brain and the little computer wired into his shoulder the wires had been attached but the switches hadnt been thrown yet once they were the feedback loop of bensoncomputerbenson would be instituted mcpherson saw this case as the first of many he planned to go from epileptics to schizophrenics to mentally retarded patients to blind patients the charts were all there on his office wall and he planned to use more and more sophisticated computers in the linkup eventually he would get to projects like form q which seemed farfetched even to ross but today the practical question was which of the forty electrodes would prevent an attack nobody knew that yet it would be determined experimentally during the operation the electrodes had been located precisely within millimeters of the target area that was good surgical placement but considering the density of the brain it was grossly inadequate a nerve cell in the brain was just a micron in diameter there were a thousand nerve cells in the space of a millimeter from that standpoint the electrodes had been crudely positioned and this crudeness meant that many electrodes were required one could assume that if you placed several electrodes in the correct general area at least one of them would be in the precise position to abort an attack trialanderror stimulation would determine the proper electrode to use patient coming gerhard said over the loudspeaker a moment later benson arrived in a wheelchair wearing his blueandwhite striped bathrobe he seemed alert as he waved to her stiffly the shoulder bandages inhibited movement of his arm how are you feeling he said and smiled im supposed to ask you ill ask the questions around here he said he was still smiling but there was an edge to his voice with some surprise she realized that he was afraid and then she wondered why that surprised her of course he would be afraid anyone would be she wasnt exactly calm herself the nurse patted benson on the shoulder nodded to dr ross and left the room they were alone for a moment neither spoke benson stared at her she stared back she wanted to give gerhard time to focus the tv camera in the ceiling and to prepare his stimulating equipment what are we doing today benson asked were going to stimulate your electrodes sequentially to see what happens he nodded he seemed to take this calmly but she had learned not to trust his calm after a moment he said will it hurt no okay he said go ahead gerhard sitting on a high stool in the adjacent room surrounded in the darkness by glowing green dials of equipment watched through the oneway glass as ross and benson began to talk alongside him richards picked up the taperecorder microphone and said quietly stimulation series one patient harold benson march gerhard looked at the four tv screens in front of him one showed the closedcircuit view of benson that would be stored on video tape as the stimulation series proceeded another displayed a computergenerated view of the forty electrode points lined up in two parallel rows within the brain substance as each electrode was stimulated the appropriate point glowed on the screen a third tv screen ran an oscilloscope tracing of the shock pulse as it was delivered and a fourth showed a wiring diagram of the tiny computer in bensons neck it also glowed as stimulations traveled through the circuit pathways in the next room ross was saying youll feel a variety of sensations and some of them may be quite pleasant we want you to tell us what you feel all right benson nodded richards said electrode one five millivolts for five seconds gerhard pressed the buttons the computer diagram showed a tracing of the circuit being closed the current snaking its way through the intricate electronic maze of bensons shoulder computer they watched benson through the oneway glass benson said thats interesting whats interesting ross asked that feeling can you describe it well its like eating a ham sandwich do you like ham sandwiches benson shrugged not particularly do you feel hungry not particularly do you feel anything else no just the taste of a ham sandwich he smiled on rye gerhard sitting at the control panel nodded the first electrode had stimulated a vague memory trace richards electrode two five millivolts five seconds benson said i have to go to the bathroom ross said it will pass gerhard sat back from the control panel sipped a cup of coffee and watched the interview progress electrode three five millivolts five seconds this one produced absolutely no effect on benson benson was quietly talking with ross about bathrooms in restaurants hotels airports try it again gerhard said up five repeat electrode three ten millivolts five seconds richards said the tv screen flashed the circuit through electrode three there was still no effect go on to four gerhard said he wrote out a few notes memory trace ham sand bladder fullness no subjective change he drew the dash and waited it was going to take a long time to go through all forty electrodes but it was fascinating to watch they produced such strikingly different effects yet each electrode was very close to the next it was the ultimate proof of the density of the brain which had once been described as the most complex structure in the known universe and it was certainly true there were three times as many cells packed into a single human brain as there were human beings on the face of the earth that density was hard to comprehend sometimes early in his nps career gerhard had requested a human brain to dissect he had done it over a period of several days with a dozen neuroanatomy texts opened up before him he used the traditional tool for brain dissection a blunt wooden stick to scrape away the cheesy gray material he had patiently carefully scraped away and in the end he had nothing the brain was not like the liver or the lungs to the naked eye it was uniform and boring giving no indication of its true function the brain was too subtle too complex too dense electrode four richards said into the recorder five millivolts five seconds the shock was delivered and benson in an oddly childlike voice said could i have some milk and cookies please thats interesting gerhard said watching the reaction richards nodded how old would you say about five or six at most benson was talking about cookies talking about his tricycle to ross slowly over the next few minutes he seemed to emerge like a timetraveler advancing through the years finally he became fully adult again thinking back to his youth instead of actually being there i always wanted the cookies and she would never give them to me she said they were bad for me and would give me cavities we can go on gerhard said richards said electrode five five millivolts five seconds in the next room benson shifted uncomfortably in his wheelchair ross asked him if something was wrong benson said it feels funny how do you mean i cant describe it its like sandpaper irritating gerhard nodded and wrote in his notes potential attack electrode this happened sometimes occasionally an electrode would be found to stimulate a seizure nobody knew why and gerhard personally thought that nobody ever would the brain was he believed beyond comprehension his work with programs like george and martha had led him to understand that relatively simple computer instructions could produce complex and unpredictable machine behavior it was also true that the programmed machine could exceed the capabilities of the programmer that was clearly demonstrated in when arthur samuel at ibm programmed a machine to play checkers and the machine eventually became so good that it beat samuel himself yet all this was done with computers which had no more circuits than the brain of an ant the human brain far exceeded that complexity and the programming of the human brain extended over many decades how could anyone seriously expect to understand it there was also a philosophical problem goedels theorem that no system could explain itself and no machine could understand its own workings at most gerhard believed that a human brain might after years of work decipher a frog brain but a human brain could never decipher itself in the same detail for that you would need a superhuman brain gerhard thought that someday a computer would be developed that could untangle the billions of cells and hundreds of billions of interconnections in the human brain then at last man would have the information that he wanted but man wouldnt have done the work another order of intelligence would have done it and man would not know of course how the computer worked morris entered the room with a cup of coffee he sipped it and glanced at benson through the glass hows he holding up okay gerhard said electrode six five and five richards intoned in the next room benson failed to react he sat talking with ross about the operation and his lingering headache he was quite calm and apparently unaffected they repeated the stimulation still without change in bensons behavior then they went on electrode seven five and five richards said he delivered the shock benson sat up abruptly oh he said that was nice what was ross said you can do that again if you want to how does it feel nice benson said his whole appearance seemed to change subtly you know he said after a moment youre really a wonderful person dr ross thank you she said very attractive too i dont know if i ever told you before how do you feel now im really very fond of you benson said i dont know if i told you that before nice gerhard said watching through the glass very nice morris nodded a strong pterminal hes clearly turned on gerhard made a note of it morris sipped his coffee they waited until benson settled down then blandly richards said electrode eight five millivolts five seconds the stimulation series continued at noon mcpherson showed up for interfacing no one was surprised to see him in a sense this was the irrevocable step everything preceding it was unimportant they had implanted electrodes and a computer and a power pack and they had hooked everything up but nothing functioned until the interfacing switches were thrown it was a little like building an automobile and then finally turning the ignition gerhard showed him notes from the stimulation series at five millivolts on a pulseform stimulus we have three positive terminals and two negatives the positives are seven nine and thirtyone the negatives are five and thirtytwo mcpherson glanced at the notes then looked through the oneway glass at benson are any of the positives true ps seven seems to be strong pretty strong when we stimulated him he said he liked it and he began to act sexually aroused toward jan is it too strong will it tip him over gerhard shook his head no he said not unless he were to receive multiple stimulations over a short time course there was that norwegian i dont think we have to worry about that mcpherson said weve got benson in the hospital for the next few days if anything seems to be going wrong we can switch to other electrodes well just keep track of him for a while what about nine very weak equivocal really how did he respond there was a subtle increase in spontaneity more tendency to smile to tell happy and positive anecdotes mcpherson seemed unimpressed and thirtyone clear tranquilizing effect calmness relaxation happiness mcpherson rubbed his hands together i guess we can get on with it he said he looked once through the glass at benson and said interface the patient with seven and thirtyone mcpherson was clearly feeling a sense of high drama and medical history but gerhard wasnt he got off his stool in a straightforward almost bored way and walked to a corner of the room where there was a computer console mounted beneath a tv screen he began to touch the buttons the tv screen glowed to life after a moment letters appeared on it benson h f interfacing procedure possible electrodes designated serially possible voltages continuous possible durations continuous possible wave forms pulse only gerhard pressed a button and the screen went blank then a series of questions appeared to which gerhard typed out the answers on the console interface procedures benson h f which electrodes will be activated only what voltage will be applied to electrode seven mv what duration will be applied to electrode seven sec there was a pause and the questions continued for electrode gerhard typed in the answers watching him mcpherson said to morris this is amusing in a way were telling the tiny computer how to work the little computer gets its instructions from the big computer which gets its instructions from gerhard who has a bigger computer than any of them maybe gerhard said and laughed the screen glowed interfacing parameters stored ready to program auxiliary unit morris sighed he hoped that he would never reach the point in his life when he was referred to by a computer as an auxiliary unit gerhard typed quietly a soft clicking sound on the other tv screens they could see the inner circuitry of the small computer it glowed intermittently as the wiring locked in benson hf has been interfaced implanted device now reading eeg data and delivering appropriate feedback that was all there was to it somehow morris was disappointed he knew it would be this way but he had expected or needed something more dramatic gerhard ran a systems check which came back negative the screen went blank and then came through with a final message university hospital system computer thanks you for referring this interesting patient for therapy gerhard smiled in the next room benson was still talking quietly with ross neither of them seemed to have noticed anything different at all janet ross finished the stimulation series profoundly depressed she stood in the corridor watching as benson was wheeled away she had a last glimpse of the white bandages around his neck as the nurse turned the corner then he was gone she walked down the hallway in the other direction through the multicolored nps doors for some reason she found herself thinking about arthurs yellow ferrari it was so marvelous and elegant and irrelevant to anything the perfect toy she wished she were in monte carlo stepping out of arthurs ferrari wearing her balenciaga gown going up the stairs to the casino to gamble with nothing more important than money she looked at her watch christ it was only she had half the day ahead of her what was it like to be a pediatrician probably fun tickling babies and giving shots and advising mothers on toilet training not a bad way to live she thought again of the bandages on bensons shoulder and went into telecomp she had hoped to speak to gerhard alone but instead everyone was in the room mcpherson morris ellis everyone they were all jubilant toasting each other with coffee in styrofoam cups someone thrust a cup into her hands and mcpherson put his arm around her in a fatherly way i gather we turned benson on to you today yes you did she said managing to smile well i guess youre used to that not exactly she said the room got quieter the festive feeling slid away she felt bad about that but not really there was nothing amusing about shocking a person into sexual arousal it was physiologically interesting was frightening and pathetic but not funny why did they all find it so goddamned funny ellis produced a hip flask and poured clear liquid into her coffee makes it irish he said with a wink much better she nodded and glanced across the room at gerhard drink up drink up ellis said gerhard was talking to morris about something it seemed a very intent conversation then she heard morris say you please pass the pussy gerhard laughed morris laughed it was some kind of joke not bad considering ellis said what do you think very good she said taking a small sip she managed to get away from ellis and mcpherson and went over to gerhard he was momentarily alone morris had gone off to refill his cup listen she said can i talk to you for a second sure gerhard said he bent his head closer to hers what is it i want to know something is it possible for you to monitor benson here on the main computer you mean monitor the implanted unit yes gerhard shrugged i guess so but why bother we know the implanted unit is working i know she said i know but will you do it anyway as a precaution gerhard said nothing his eyes said precaution against what please okay he said ill punch in a monitoring subroutine as soon as they leave he nodded to the group ill have the computer check on him twice an hour she frowned four times an hour how about every ten minutes she said okay he said every ten minutes thanks she said then she drained her coffee feeling the warmth hit her stomach and she left the room ellis sat in a corner of room and watched the halfdozen technicians maneuvering around the bed there were two people from the rad lab doing a radiation check there was one girl drawing blood for the chem lab to check steroid levels there was an eeg technician resetting the monitors and there were gerhard and richards taking a final look at the interface wiring throughout it all benson lay motionless breathing easily staring up at the ceiling he did not seem to notice the people touching him moving an arm here shifting a sheet there he stared straight up at the ceiling one of the radlab men had hairy hands protruding from the cuffs of his white lab coat for a moment the man rested his hairy dark hand on bensons bandages ellis thought about the monkeys he had operated on there was nothing to that except technical expertise because you always knew no matter how hard you pretended that it was a monkey and not a human being and if you slipped and cut the monkey from ear to ear it didnt matter at all there would be no questions no relatives no lawyers no press no nothing not even a nasty note from requisitions asking what was happening to all those eightydollar monkeys nobody gave a damn and neither did he he wasnt interested in helping monkeys he was interested in helping human beings benson stirred im tired he said he glanced over at ellis ellis said about ready to wrap it up boys one by one the technicians stepped back from the bed nodding collected their instruments and their data and left the room gerhard and richards were the last to go finally ellis was alone with benson you feel like sleeping ellis said i feel like a goddamned machine i feel like an automobile in a complicated service station i feel like im being repaired benson was getting angry ellis could feel his own tension building he was tempted to call for nurses and orderlies to restrain benson when the attack came but he remained seated thats a lot of crap ellis said benson glared at him breathing deeply ellis looked at the monitors over the bed the brain waves were going irregular moving into an attack configuration benson wrinkled his nose and sniffed whats that smell he said that awful above the bed a red monitor light blinked stimulation the brain waves spun in a distorted tangle of white lines for five seconds simultaneously bensons pupils dilated then the lines were smooth again the pupils returned to normal size benson turned away staring out the window at the afternoon sun you know he said its really a very nice day isnt it for no particular reason janet ross came back to the hospital at pm she had gone to see a movie with a pathology resident who had been asking her for weeks finally she had relented they had seen a murder mystery which the resident claimed was the only kind of movie he attended this one featured five murders before she stopped counting them in the darkness she had glanced at the resident and he was smiling his reaction was so stereotyped the pathologist drawn to violence and death that she found herself thinking of the other stereotypes in medicine the sadistic surgeons and the childish pediatricians and the womanhating gynecologists and the crazy psychiatrists afterward he had driven her back to the hospital because she had left her car in the hospital parking lot but instead of driving home she had gone up to the nps for no particular reason the nps was deserted but she expected to find gerhard and richards at work and they were poring over computer printouts in telecomp they hardly noticed when she came into the room and got herself some coffee trouble she said gerhard scratched his head now its martha he said first george refuses to be a saint now martha is becoming nice everythings screwed up richards smiled you have your patients jan he said and we have ours speaking of my patient of course gerhard said getting up and walking over to the computer console i was wondering why you came in he smiled or was it just a bad date just a bad movie she said gerhard punched buttons on the console letters and numbers began to print out heres all the checks since i started it at onetwelve this afternoon normal eeg normal eeg normal eeg normal eeg sleep eeg normal eeg sleep eeg sleep eeg normal eeg normal eeg normal eeg normal eeg normal eeg sleep eeg normal eeg normal eeg sleep eeg normal eeg normal eeg sleep eeg normal eeg normal

eeg normal eeg i cant make anything out of this ross said frowning it looks like hes dozing on and off and hes gotten a couple of stimulations but she shook her head isnt there another display mode as she spoke the computer produced another report adding it to the column of numbers normal eeg people gerhard said in mock irritation they just cant handle machine data it was true machines could handle column after column of numbers people needed to see patterns on the other hand machines were very poor at recognizing patterns the classic problem was trying to get a machine to differentiate between the letter b and the letter d a child could do it it was almost impossible for a machine to look at the two patterns and discern the difference ill give you a graphic display gerhard said he punched buttons wiping the screen after a moment crosshatching for a graph appeared and the points began to blink on damn she said when she saw the graph whats the matter gerhard said hes getting more frequent stimulations he had none for a long time and then he began to have them every couple of hours now it looks like one an hour so gerhard said what does that suggest to you she said nothing in particular it should suggest something quite specific she said we know that bensons brain will be interacting with the computer right yes and that interaction will be a learning pattern of some kind its just like a kid with a cookie jar if you slap the kids hand every time he reaches for the cookies pretty soon he wont reach so often look she drew a quick sketch now she said thats negative reinforcement the kid reaches but he gets hurt so he stops reaching eventually hell quit altogether okay sure gerhard said but let me finish if the kid is normal it works that way but if the kid is a masochist it will be very different she drew another curve here the kid is reaching more often for the cookies because he likes getting hit it should be negative reinforcement but its really positive reinforcement do you remember cecil no gerhard said on the computer console a new report appeared stimulation oh shit she said its happening whats happening benson is going into a positive progression cycle i dont understand its just like cecil cecil was the first monkey to be wired with electrodes to a computer that was back in the computer wasnt miniaturized then it was a big clunky computer and the monkey was wired up by actual wires okay cecil had epilepsy the computer detected the start of a seizure and delivered a countershock to stop it okay now the seizures should have come less and less frequently like the hand reaching for the cookies less and less often but instead the reverse happened cecil liked the shocks and he began to initiate seizures in order to experience the pleasurable shocks and thats what benson is doing i think so gerhard shook his head listen jan thats all interesting but a person cant start and stop epileptic seizures at will they cant control it the seizures are involuntary she said thats right you have no more control over them than you do over heart rate and blood pressure and sweating and all the other involuntary acts there was a long pause gerhard said youre going to tell me im wrong on the screen the computer blinked im going to tell you she said that youve cut too many conferences you know about autonomic learning after a guilty pause no it was a big mystery for a long time classically it was believed that you could learn to control only voluntary acts you could learn to drive a car but you couldnt learn to lower your blood pressure of course there were those yogis who supposedly could reduce oxygen requirements of their body and slow their heartbeats to near death they could reverse intestinal peristalsis and drink liquids through the anus but that was all unproven and theoretically impossible gerhard nodded cautiously well it turns out to be perfectly possible you can teach a rat to blush in only one ear right ear or left ear take your pick you can teach it to lower or raise blood pressure or heartbeat and you can do the same thing with people its not impossible it can be done how he asked the question with unabashed curiosity whatever embarrassment he had felt before was gone well with people who have high blood pressure for instance all you do is put them in a room with a bloodpressure cuff on their arm whenever the blood pressure goes down a bell rings you tell the person to try to make the bell ring as often as possible they work for that reward a bell ringing at first it happens by accident then pretty soon they learn how to make it happen more often the bell rings more frequently after a few hours its ringing a lot gerhard scratched his head and you think benson is producing more seizures to be rewarded with shocks yes well whats the difference he still cant have any seizures the computer always prevents them from happening not true she said a couple of years ago a norwegian schizophrenic was wired up and allowed to stimulate a pleasure terminal as often as he wanted he pushed himself into a convulsion by overstimulating himself gerhard winced richards who had been watching the computer console suddenly said somethings wrong what is it were not getting readings any more on the screen they saw ross looked and sighed see if you can get a computer extrapolation of that curve she said see if hes really going into a learning cycle and how fast she started for the door im going to see whats happened to benson the door slammed shut gerhard turned back to the computer friday march breakdown the seventh special surgical floor was quiet there were two nurses at the station one was making progress notes in a patients chart the other was eating a candy bar and reading a movie magazine neither paid much attention to ross as she went to the chart shelf opened bensons record and checked it she wanted to be certain that benson had received all his medications and to her astonishment she found that he had not why hasnt benson gotten his thorazine she demanded the nurses looked up in surprise benson the patient in seventen she glanced at her watch it was after midnight he was supposed to be started on thorazine at noon twelve hours ago im sorry may i one of the nurses reached for the chart ross handed it to her and watched while she turned to the page of nursing orders mcphersons order for thorazine was circled in red by a nurse with the cryptic notation call ross was thinking that without heavy doses of thorazine bensons psychotic thinking would be unchecked and could be dangerous oh yes the nurse said i remember now dr morris told us that only medication orders from him or from dr ross were to be followed we dont know this dr mcphee so we waited to call him to confirm the therapy it dr mcpherson ross said heavily is the chief of the nps the nurse frowned at the signature well how are we supposed to know that you cant read the name here she handed back the chart we thought it looked like mcphee and the only mcphee in the hospital directory is a gynecologist and that didnt seem logical but sometimes doctors will put a note in the wrong chart by mistake so we all right ross said waving her hand all right just get him his thorazine now will you right away doctor the nurse said she gave her a dirty look and went to the medicine locker ross went down the hall to room the cop sat outside bensons room with his chair tipped back against the wall he was reading secret romances with more interest than janet would have thought likely she knew without asking where he had gotten the magazine he had been bored one of the nurses had given it to him he was also smoking a cigarette flicking the ashes in the general direction of an ashtray on the floor he looked up as she came down the hall good evening doctor good evening she stifled an impulse to lecture him on his sloppy demeanor but the cops werent under her jurisdiction and besides she was just irritated with the nurses everything quiet she asked pretty quiet inside she could hear television a talk show with laughter someone said and what did you do then there was more laughter she opened the door the room lights were off the only light came from the glow of the television benson had apparently fallen asleep his body was turned away from the door and the sheets were pulled up over his shoulder she clicked the television off and crossed the room to the bed gently she touched his leg harry she said softly harry she stopped the leg beneath her hand was soft and formless she pressed down the leg bulged oddly she reached for the bedside lamp and turned it on flooding the room with light then she pulled back the sheets benson was gone in his place were three plastic bags of the kind the hospital used to line wastebaskets each had been inflated and then knotted shut tightly bensons head was represented by a wadded towel his arm by another officer she said in a low voice youd better get your ass in here the cop came bounding into the room his hand reaching for his gun ross gestured to the bed holy shit the cop said what happened i was going to ask you the cop didnt reply he went immediately to the bathroom and checked there it was empty he looked in the closet his clothes are still here when was the last time you looked into this room but his shoes are gone the cop said still looking in the closet his shoes are missing he turned and looked at ross with a kind of desperation where is he when was the last time you looked into this room ross repeated she pressed the bedside buzzer to call the night nurse about twenty minutes ago ross walked to the window and looked out the window was open but there was a sheer drop of seven stories to the parking lot below how long were you away from the door look doc it was only a few minutes how long i ran out of cigarettes the hospital doesnt have any machines i had to go to that coffee shop across the street i was gone about three minutes that was around eleventhirty the nurses said theyd keep an eye on things great ross said she checked the bedside table and saw that bensons shaving equipment was there his wallet his car keys all there the nurse stuck her head in the door answering the call what is it now we seem to be missing a patient ross said i beg your pardon ross gestured to the plastic bags in the bed the nurse reacted slowly and then turned quite pale call dr ellis ross said and dr mcpherson and dr morris theyll be at home have the switchboard put you through say its an emergency tell them benson is gone then call hospital security is that clear yes doctor the nurse said and hurried from the room ross sat down on the edge of bensons bed and turned her attention to the cop where did he get those bags the cop said she had already figured that out one from the bedside wastebasket she said one from the wastebasket by the door one from the bathroom wastebasket two towels from the bathroom clever the cop said he pointed to the closet but he cant get far he left his clothes took his shoes a man with bandages and a bathrobe cant get far even if he has shoes he shook his head i better call this in did benson make any calls tonight no last month look lady i dont need any of your lip right now she saw then that he was really quite young in his early twenties and she saw that he was afraid he had screwed up and he didnt know what would happen im sorry she said yes tonight he made one call the cop said about eleven did you listen to it no he shrugged i never thought his voice trailed off you know so he made one call at eleven and left at eleventhirty she walked outside to the hallway and looked down the corridor to the nurses station there was always somebody on duty there and he would have to pass the nurses station to reach the elevator hed never make it what else could he have done she looked toward the other end of the hall there was a stairway at the far end he could walk down but seven flights of stairs benson was too weak for that and when he got to the groundfloor lobby there hed be in his bathrobe with his head bandaged the reception desk would stop him i dont get it the cop said coming out into the hallway where could he go hes a very bright man ross said it was a fact that they all tended to forget to the cops benson was a criminal charged with assault one of the hundreds of querulous types they saw each day to the hospital staff he was a diseased man unhappy dangerous borderline psychotic everyone tended to forget that benson was also brilliant his computer work was outstanding in a field where many intelligent men worked on the initial psychological testing at the nps his abbreviated wais iq test had scored he was fully capable of planning to leave then listening at the door hearing the cop and the nurse discuss going for cigarettes and then making his escape in a matter of minutes but how benson must have known that he could never get out of the hospital in his bathrobe he had left his street clothes in his room he probably couldnt get out wearing those either not at midnight the lobby desk would have stopped him visiting hours had ended three hours before what the hell would he do the cop went up to the nurses station to phone in a report ross followed along behind him looking at the doors room was a burns patient she opened the door and looked inside making sure only the patient was there room was empty a kidneytransplant patient had been discharged that afternoon she checked that room too the next door was marked supplies it was a standard room on surgical floors bandages suture kits and linen supplies were stored there she opened the door and went inside she passed row after row of bottled intravenous solutions then trays of different kits then sterile masks smocks spare uniforms for nurses and orderlies she stopped she was staring at a blue bathrobe hastily wadded into a corner on a shelf the rest of the shelf contained neatly folded piles of white trousers shirts and jackets worn by hospital orderlies she called for the nurse its impossible ellis said pacing up and down in the nurses station absolutely impossible hes two days a day and a half postop he couldnt possibly leave he did janet ross said and he did it the only way he could by changing into an orderlys uniform then he probably walked downstairs to the sixth floor and took an elevator to the lobby nobody would have noticed him orderlies come and go at all hours ellis wore a dinner jacket and a white frilly shirt his bow tie was loosened and he was smoking a cigarette she had never seen him smoke before i still dont buy it he said he was tranked out of his skull with thorazine and never got it ross said never got it whats thorazine the cop said taking notes the nurses had a question on the order and didnt administer it he had no sedatives and no tranquilizers since midnight last night christ ellis said he looked at the nurses as if he could kill them then he paused but what about his head it was covered with bandages someone would notice that morris who had been sitting silently in a corner said he had a wig youre kidding i saw it morris said what was the color of the wig in question the cop said black morris said oh christ ellis said ross said how did he get this wig a friend brought it to him the day of admission listen ellis said even with a wig he cant have gotten anywhere he left his wallet and his money there are no taxis at this hour she looked at ellis marveling at his ability to deny reality he just didnt want to believe that benson had left he was fighting the evidence fighting hard he called a friend ross said about eleven she looked at morris you remember who brought the wig a pretty girl morris said do you remember her name ross said with a sarcastic edge angela black morris said promptly see if you can find her in the phone book ross said morris began to check the phone rang and ellis answered it he listened then without comment handed the phone to ross yes ross said ive done the computer projection gerhard said it just came through you were right benson is on a learning cycle with his implanted computer his stimulation points conform to the projected curve exactly thats wonderful ross said as she listened she glanced at ellis morris and the cop they watched her expectantly its exactly what you said gerhard said benson apparently likes the shocks hes starting seizures more and more often the curve is going up sharply when will he tip over not long gerhard said assuming that he doesnt break the cycle and i doubt that he will then hell be getting almost continuous stimulations at sixfour am you have a confirmed projection on that she asked frowning she glanced at her watch it was already thats right gerhard said continuous stimulations starting at sixfour this morning okay ross said and hung up she looked at the others benson has gone into a learning progression with his computer hes projected for tipover at six am today christ ellis said looking at the wall clock less than six hours from now across the room morris had put aside the phone books and was talking to information then try west los angeles he said and after a pause what about new listings the cop stopped taking notes and looked confused is something going to happen at six oclock we think so ross said ellis puffed on his cigarette two years he said and im back on them he stubbed it out carefully has mcpherson been notified hes been called check unlisted numbers morris said he listened for a moment this is dr morris at university hospital he said and its an emergency we have to locate angela black now if angrily he slammed down the phone bitch he said any luck he shook his head we dont even know if benson called this girl ellis said he could have called someone else whoever he called may be in a lot of trouble in a few hours ross said she flipped open bensons chart it looks like a long night wed better get busy the freeway was crowded the freeway was always crowded even at am on a friday morning she stared ahead at the pattern of red taillights stretching ahead like an angry snake for miles so many people where were they going at this hour janet ross usually took pleasure in the freeways there had been times when she had driven home from the hospital at night with the big green signs flashing past overhead and the intricate web of overpasses and underpasses and the exhilarating anonymous speed and she had felt wonderful expansive free she had been raised in california and as a child she remembered the first of the freeways the system had grown up as she had grown and she did not see it as a menace or an evil it was part of the landscape it was fast it was fun the automobile was important to los angeles a city more technologydependent than any in the world los angeles could not survive without the automobile as it could not survive without water piped in from hundreds of miles away and as it could not survive without certain building technologies this was a fact of the citys existence and had been true since early in the century but in recent years ross had begun to recognize the subtle psychological effects of living your life inside an automobile los angeles had no sidewalk cafes because no one walked the sidewalk cafe where you could stare at passing people was not stationary but mobile it changed with each traffic light where people stopped stared briefly at each other then drove on but there was something inhuman about living inside a cocoon of tinted glass and stainless steel airconditioned carpeted stereophonic tapedecked poweroptioned isolated it thwarted some deep human need to congregate to be together to see and be seen local psychiatrists recognized an indigenous depersonalization syndrome los angeles was a town of recent emigrants and therefore strangers cars kept them strangers and there were few institutions that served to bring them together practically no one went to church and work groups were not entirely satisfactory people became lonely they complained of being cut off without friends far from families and old homes often they became suicidal and a common method of suicide was the automobile the police referred to it euphemistically as single unit fatalities you picked your overpass and hit it at eighty or ninety foot flat to the floor sometimes it took hours to cut the body out of the wreckage moving at sixtyfive miles an hour she shifted across five lanes of traffic and pulled off the freeway at sunset heading up into the hollywood hills through an area known locally as the swish alps because of the many homosexuals who lived there people with problems seemed drawn to los angeles the city offered freedom its price was lack of supports she came to laurel canyon and took the curves fast tires squealing headlamps swinging through the darkness there was little traffic here she would reach bensons house in a few minutes in theory she and the rest of the nps staff had a simple problem get benson back before six oclock if they could get him back into the hospital they could uncouple his implanted computer and stop the progression series then they could sedate him and wait a few days before relinking him to a new set of terminals theyd obviously chosen the wrong electrodes the first time around that was a risk they accepted in advance it was an acceptable risk because they expected to have a chance to correct any error but that opportunity was no longer there they had to get him back a simple problem with a relatively simple solution check bensons known haunts after reviewing his chart theyd all set out to different places ross was going to his house on laurel ellis was going to a strip joint called the jackrabbit club where benson often went morris was going to autotronics inc in santa monica where benson was employed morris had called the president of the firm who was coming to the offices to open them up for him they would check back in an hour or so to compare notes and progress a simple plan and one she thought unlikely to work but there wasnt much else to do she parked her car in front of bensons house and walked up the slate path to the front door it was ajar from inside she could hear the sound of laughter and giggles she knocked and pushed it open hello no one seemed to hear the giggles came from somewhere at the back of the house she stepped into the front hallway she had never seen bensons house and she wondered what it was like looking around she realized she should have known from the outside the house was an ordinary woodframe structure a ranchstyle house as unobtrusive in its appearance as benson himself but the inside looked like the drawing rooms of louis xvi graceful antique chairs and couches tapestries on the walls bare hardwood floors anybody home she called her voice echoed through the house there was no answer but the laughter continued she followed the sound toward the rear she came into the kitchen antique gas stove no oven no dishwasher no electric blender no toaster no machines she thought benson had built himself a world without any sort of modern machine in it the kitchen window looked out onto the back of the house there was a small patch of lawn and a swimming pool all perfectly ordinary and modern bensons ordinary exterior again the back yard was bathed in greenish light from the underwater pool lights in the pool two girls were laughing and splashing she went outside the girls were oblivious to her arrival they continued to splash and shriek happily they wrestled with each other in the water she stood on the pool deck and said anybody home they noticed her then and moved apart from each other looking for harry one of them said yes you a cop im a doctor one of the girls got out of the pool lithely and began toweling off she wore a brief red bikini you just missed him the girl said but we werent supposed to tell the cops thats what he said she put one leg on a chair to dry it with the towel ross realized the move was calculated seductive and demonstrative these girls liked girls she realized when did he leave just a few minutes ago how long have you been here about a week the girl in the pool said harry invited us to stay he thought we were cute the other girl wrapped the towel around her shoulders and said we met him at the jackrabbit he comes there a lot ross nodded hes a lot of fun the girl said a lot of laughs you know what he was wearing tonight what a hospital uniform all white she shook her head what a riot did you talk to him sure what did he say the girl in the red bikini started back inside the house ross followed her he said not to tell the cops he said to have a good time why did he come here he had to pick up some stuff what stuff some stuff from his study where is the study ill show you she led her back into the house through the living room her wet feet left small pools on the bare hardwood floor isnt this place wild harrys really crazy you ever heard him talk about things yes then you know hes really nutty she gestured around the room all this old stuff why do you want to see him hes sick ross said he must be the girl said i saw those bandages what was he in an accident he had an operation no kidding in a hospital yes no kidding they went through the living room and down a corridor toward the bedrooms the girl turned right into one room which was a study antique desk antique lamps overstuffed couches he came in here and got some stuff did you see what he got we didnt really pay much attention but he took some big rolls of paper she gestured with her hands real big they looked like blueprints or something blueprints well they were blue on the inside of the roll and white on the outside and they were big she shrugged did he take anything else yeah a metal box what kind of a metal box ross was thinking of a lunchbox or a small suitcase it looked like a tool kit maybe i saw it open for a moment before he closed it it seemed to have tools and stuff inside did you notice anything in particular the girl was silent then she bit her lip well i didnt really see but yes it looked like he had a gun in there did he say where he was going no did he give any clue no did he say he was coming back well that was funny the girl said he kissed me and he kissed suzie and he said to have a good time and he said not to tell the cops and he said he didnt think hed be seeing us again she shook her head it was funny but you know how harry is yes ross said i know how harry is she looked at her watch it was there were only four hours left the first thing that ellis noticed was the smell hot damp fetid a dark warm animal smell he wrinkled his nose in distaste how could benson tolerate a place like this he watched as the spotlight swung through the darkness and came to rest on a pair of long tapering thighs there was an expectant rustling in the audience it reminded ellis of his days in the navy stationed in baltimore that was the last time he had been in a place like this hot and sticky with fantasies and frustrations that had been a long time ago it was a shock to think how fast the time had passed yes ladies and gentlemen the incredible the lovely cynthia sincere a big hand for the lovely cynthia the spotlight widened onstage to show a rather ugly but spectacularly constructed girl the band began to play when the spotlight was wide enough to hit cynthias eyes she squinted and began an awkward dance she paid no attention to the music but nobody seemed to mind ellis looked at the audience there were a lot of men here and a lot of very toughlooking girls with short hair harry benson the manager said at his elbow yeah he comes in a lot have you seen him lately i dont know about lately the manager said he coughed ellis smelled sweet alcoholic breath but i tell you the manager said i wish he wouldnt hang around you know i think hes a little nuts and always bothering the girls you know how hard it is to keep the girls fucking murder thats what it is ellis nodded and scanned the audience benson had probably changed clothes certainly he wouldnt be wearing an orderlys uniform any more ellis looked at the backs of the heads at the area between hairline and shirt collar he looked for a white bandage he saw none but you havent seen him lately no the manager said shaking his head not for a week or so a waitress went by wearing a rabbitlike white fur bikini sal you seen harry lately hes usually around she said vaguely and wandered off with a tray of drinks i wish he wouldnt hang around bothering the girls the manager said and coughed again sweetly ellis moved deeper into the club the spotlight swung through smoky air over his head following the movements of the girl on stage she was having trouble unhooking her bra she did a sort of twostep shuffle hands behind her back eyes looking vacantly out at the audience ellis understood watching her why benson thought of strippers as machines they were mechanical no question about it and artificial when the bra came off he could see the ushaped surgical incision beneath each breast where the plastic had been inserted jaglon would love this he thought it would fit right into his theories about machine sex jaglon was one of the development boys and he was preoccupied with the idea of artificial intelligence merging with human intelligence he argued that on the one hand cosmetic surgery and implanted machinery were making man more mechanical while on the other hand robot developments were making machines more human it was only a matter of time before people began having sex with humanoid robots perhaps its already happening ellis thought looking at the stripper he looked back at the audience satisfying himself that benson was not there then he checked a phone booth in the back and the mens room the mens room was small and reeked of vomit he grimaced again and stared at himself in the cracked mirror over the washbasin whatever else was true about the jackrabbit club it produced an olfactory assault he wondered if that mattered to benson he went back into the club itself and made his way toward the door find him the manager asked ellis shook his head and left once outside he breathed the cool night air and got into his car the notion of smells intrigued him it was a problem he had considered before but never really resolved in his own mind his operation on benson was directed toward a specific part of the brain the limbic system it was a very old part of the brain in terms of evolution its original purpose had been the control of smell in fact the old term for it was rhinencephalon the smelling brain the rhinencephalon had developed million years ago when reptiles ruled the earth it controlled the most primitive behavior anger and fear lust and hunger attack and withdrawal reptiles like crocodiles had little else to direct their behavior man on the other hand had a cerebral cortex but the cerebral cortex was a recent addition its modern development had begun only two million years ago in its present state the cerebral cortex of man was only years old in terms of evolutionary time scales that was nothing the cortex had grown up around the limbic brain which remained unchanged embedded deep inside the new cortex that cortex which could feel love and worry about ethical conduct and write poetry had to make an uneasy peace with the crocodile brain at its core sometimes as in the case of benson the peace broke down and the crocodile brain took over intermittently what was the relationship of smell to all this ellis was not sure of course attacks often began with the sensation of strange smells but was there anything else any other effect he didnt know and as he drove he reflected that it didnt much matter the only problem was to find benson before his crocodile brain took over ellis had seen that happen once in the nps ellis had watched it through the oneway glass benson had been quite normal and suddenly he had lashed out against the wall striking it viciously picking up his chair smashing it against the wall the attack had begun without warning and had been carried out with utter total unthinking viciousness six am he thought there wasnt much time what is it some kind of emergency farley asked unlocking the door to autotronics you could say so morris said standing outside shivering it was a cold night and he had been waiting half an hour waiting for farley to show up farley was a tall slender man with a slow manner or perhaps he was just sleepy he seemed to take forever to unlock the offices and let morris inside he turned on the lights in a rather plain lobbyreception area then he went back toward the rear of the building the rear of autotronics was a single cavernous room desks were scattered here and there around several pieces of enormous glittering machinery morris frowned slightly i know what youre thinking farley said youre thinking its a mess no i well it is but we get the job done i can tell you that he pointed across the room thats harrys desk next to hap hap farley gestured to a large spidery metal construction across the room hap he said is short for hopelessly automatic pingpong player he grinned not really he said but we have our little jokes here morris walked over to the machine circled around it staring it plays pingpong not well farley admitted but were working on that its a dod department of defense grant and the terms of the grant were to devise a pingpongplaying robot i know what youre thinking youre thinking it isnt an important project morris shrugged he didnt like being told what he was thinking all the time farley smiled god knows what they want it for he said of course the capability would be striking imagine a computer that could recognize a sphere moving rapidly through threedimensional space with the ability to contact the sphere and knock it back according to certain rules must land between the white lines not off the table and so on i doubt he said that theyll use it for pingpong tournaments he went to the back of the room and opened a refrigerator which had a big orange radiation sign on it and beneath authorized personnel only he removed two jars want some coffee morris was staring at the signs thats just to discourage the secretaries farley said and laughed again his jovial mood bothered morris he watched as farley made intant coffee morris went over to bensons desk and began checking the drawers what is it about harry anyway how do you mean morris asked the top drawer contained supplies paper pencils slide rule scribbled notes and calculations the second drawer was a file drawer it seemed to hold mostly letters well he was in the hospital wasnt he yes he had an operation and left were trying to find him now hes certainly gotten strange farley said uhhuh morris said he was thumbing through the files business letters business letters requisition forms i remember when it began farley said it was during watershed week morris looked up from the letters during what watershed week farley said how do you take your coffee black farley gave him a cup stirred artificial cream into his own watershed week he said was a week in july of youve probably never heard of it morris shook his head that wasnt an official title farley said but that was what we called it everybody in our business knew it was coming you see what was coming the watershed computer scientists all over the world knew it was coming and they watched for it it happened in july of the informationhandling capacity of all the computers in the world exceeded the informationhandling capacity of all the human brains in the world computers could receive and store more information than the billion human brains in the world thats the watershed you bet it is farley said morris sipped the coffee it burned his tongue but he woke up a little is that a joke hell no farley said its true the watershed was passed in and computers have been steadily pulling ahead since then by theyll lead human beings by fifty to one in terms of capacity he paused harry was awfully upset about that i can imagine morris said and that was when it began for him he got very strange very secretive morris looked around the room at the large pieces of computer equipment standing in different areas it was an odd sensation the first time he could recall being in a room littered with computers he realized that he had made some mistakes about benson he had assumed that benson was pretty much like everyone else but no one who worked in a place such as this was like everyone else the experience must change you he remembered that ross had once said that it was a liberal myth that everybody was fundamentally the same lots of people werent they werent like everybody else farley was different too he thought in another situation he would have dismissed farley as a jovial clown but he was obviously bright as hell where did that grinning comic manner come from you know how fast this is moving farley said damned fast weve gone from milliseconds to nanoseconds in just a few years when the computer illiac i was built in it could do eleven thousand arithmetical operations a second pretty fast right well theyre almost finished with illiac iv now it will do two hundred million operations a second its the fourth generation of course it couldnt have been built without the help of other computers they used two other computers full time for two years designing the new illiac morris drank his coffee perhaps it was his fatigue perhaps the spookiness of the room but he was beginning to feel some kinship with benson computers to design computers maybe they were taking over after all what would ross say about that a shared delusion find anything interesting in his desk no morris said he sat down in the chair behind the desk and looked around the room he was trying to act like benson to think like benson to be benson how did he spend his time i dont know farley said sitting on another desk across the room he got pretty distant and withdrawn the last few months i know he had some trouble with the law and i knew he was going into the hospital i knew that he didnt like your hospital much how is that morris asked not very interested it wasnt surprising that benson was hostile to the hospital farley didnt answer instead he went over to a bulletin board where clippings and photos had been tacked up he removed one yellowing newspaper item and gave it to morris it was from the los angeles times dated july the headline read university hospital gets new computer the story outlined the acquisition of the ibm system computer which was being installed in the hospital basement and would be used for research assistance in operations and a variety of other functions you notice the date farley said watershed week morris stared at it and frowned i am trying to be logical dr ross i understand harry i think its important to be logical and rational when we discuss these things dont you yes i do she sat in the room and watched the reels of the tape recorder spin across from her ellis sat back in a chair eyes closed cigarette burning in his fingers morris drank another cup of coffee as he listened she was making a list of what they knew trying to decide what their next step should be the tape spun on i classify things according to what i call trends to be opposed benson said there are four important trends to be opposed do you want to hear them yes of course do you really yes really well trend number one is the generality of the computer the computer is a machine but its not like any machine in human history other machines have a specific function like cars or refrigerators or dishwashers we expect machines to have specific functions but computers dont they can do all sorts of things surely computers are please let me finish trend number two is the autonomy of the computer in the old days computers werent autonomous they were like adding machines you had to be there all the time punching buttons to make them work like cars cars wont drive without drivers but now things are different computers are becoming autonomous you can build in all sorts of instructions about what to do next and you can walk away and let the computer handle things harry i please dont interrupt me this is very serious trend number three is miniaturization you know all about that a computer that took up a whole room in is now about the size of a carton of cigarettes pretty soon itll be smaller than that there was a pause on the tape trend number four benson began and she clicked the tape off she looked at ellis and morris this isnt getting us anywhere she said they didnt reply just stared with a kind of blank fatigue she looked at her list of information benson home at picked up blueprints gun and tool kit benson not seen in jackrabbit club recently benson upset by uh computer installed suggest anything to you ellis asked no ross said but i think one of us should talk to mcpherson she looked at ellis who nodded without energy morris shrugged slightly all right she said ill do it it was am the fact is ross said weve exhausted all our options time is running out mcpherson stared at her across his desk his eyes were dark and tired what do you expect me to do he said notify the police the police are already notified theyve been notified from the beginning by one of their own people i understand the seventh floor is swarming with cops now the police dont know about the operation for christs sake the police brought him here for the operation of course they know about it but they dont really know what it involves they havent asked and they dont know about the computer projection for am what about it he said she was becoming angry with him he was so damned stubborn he knew perfectly well what she was saying i think their attitude might be different if they knew that benson was going to have a seizure at six am i think youre right mcpherson said he shifted his weight heavily in his chair i think they might stop thinking about him as an escaped man wanted on a charge of assault and they would begin thinking of him as a crazy murderer with wires in his brain he sighed right now their objective is to apprehend him if we tell them more theyll try to kill him but innocent lives may be involved if the projection the projection mcpherson said is just that a computer projection it is only as good as its input and that input consists of three timed stimulations you can draw a lot of curves through three graph points you can extrapolate it a lot of ways we have no positive reason to believe hell tip over at six am in actual fact he may not tip over at all she glanced around the room at the charts on his walls mcpherson plotted the future of the nps in this room and he kept a record of it on his walls in the form of elaborate multicolored charts she knew what those charts meant to him she knew what the nps meant to him she knew what benson meant to him but even so his position was unreasonable and irresponsible now how was she going to say that look jan mcpherson said you began by saying that weve exhausted all our options i disagree i think we have the option of waiting i think there is a possibility he will return to the hospital return to our care and as long as that is possible i prefer to wait youre not going to tell the police no if he doesnt come back she said and if he attacks someone during a seizure do you really want that on your head its already on my head mcpherson said and smiled sadly it was am they were all tired but none of them could sleep they stayed in telecomp watching the computer projections as they inched up the plotted line toward a seizure state the time was and then ellis smoked an entire pack of cigarettes and then left to get another morris stared at a journal in his lap but never turned the page from time to time he glanced up at the wall clock ross paced and looked at the sunrise the sky turning pink over the thin brown haze of smog to the east ellis came back with more cigarettes gerhard stopped working with the computers to make fresh coffee morris got up and stood watching gerhard make it not speaking not helping just watching ross became aware of the ticking of the wall clock it was strange that she had never noticed it before because in fact it ticked quite loudly and once a minute there was a mechanical click as the minute hand moved another notch the sound disturbed her she began to fix on it waiting for that single click on top of the quieter ticking mildly obsessive she thought and then she thought of all the other psychological derangements she had experienced in the past deja vu the feeling that she had been somewhere before depersonalization the feeling that she was watching herself from across the room at some social gathering clang associations delusions phobias there was no sharp line between health and disease sanity and insanity it was a spectrum and everybody fitted somewhere on the spectrum wherever you were on that spectrum other people looked strange to you benson was strange to them without question they were strange to benson at am they all stood and stretched glancing up at the clock nothing happened maybe its sixfour exactly gerhard said they waited the clock showed still nothing happened no telephones rang no messengers arrived nothing ellis slipped the cellophane wrapper off his cigarettes and crumpled it the sound made ross want to scream he began to play with the cellophane crumpling it smoothing it out crumpling it again she gritted her teeth the clock showed then mcpherson came into the room so far so good he said smiled bleakly and left the others stared at each other five more minutes passed i dont know gerhard said staring at the computer console maybe the projection was wrong after all we only had three plotting points maybe we should run another curve through he sat down at the console and punched buttons the screen glowed with alternative curves streaking white across the green background finally he stopped no he said the computer sticks with the original curve that should be the one well obviously the computer is wrong morris said its almost sixthirty the cafeteria will be opening anybody want to have breakfast sounds good to me ellis said he got out of his chair jan she shook her head ill wait here awhile i dont think its going to happen morris said you better get some breakfast ill wait here the words came out almost before she realized it okay okay morris said raising his hands he shot a glance at ellis and the two men left she remained in the room with gerhard do you have confidence limits on that curve she said i did gerhard said but i dont know any more weve passed the confidence limits already they were about plus or minus two minutes for ninetynine percent you mean the seizure would have occurred between sixtwo and sixsix yeah roughly he shrugged but it obviously didnt happen it might take time before it was discovered it might gerhard nodded he didnt seem convinced she returned to the window the sun was up now shining with a pale reddish light why did sunrises always seem weaker less brilliant than sunsets they should be the same behind her she heard a single electronic beep ohoh gerhard said she turned what is it he pointed across the room to a small mechanical box on a shelf in the corner the box was attached to a telephone a green light glowed on the box what is it she repeated thats the special line he said the twentyfourhour recording for the dog tag she went over and picked up the telephone from its cradle she listened and heard a measured resonant voice saying should be advised that the body must not be cremated or damaged in any way until the implanted atomic material has been removed failure to remove the material presents a risk of radioactive contamination for detailed information she turned to gerhard how do you turn it off he pressed a button on the box the recording stopped hello she said there was a pause then a male voice said whom am i speaking to this is dr ross are you affiliated with the a short pause the neuropsychiatric research unit yes i am get a pencil and paper i want you to take an address down this is captain anders of the los angeles police she gestured to gerhard for something to write with whats the problem captain we have a murder here anders said and weve got some questions for your people three patrol cars were pulled up in front of the apartment building off sunset the flashing red lights had already drawn a crowd despite the early hour and the morning chill she parked her car down the street and walked back to the lobby a young patrolman stopped her you a tenant im dr ross captain anders called me he nodded toward the elevator third floor turn left he said and let her through the crowd watched curiously as she crossed the lobby and waited for the elevator they were standing outside looking in peering over each others shoulders whispering among themselves she wondered what they thought of her the flashing lights from the patrol cars bathed the lobby intermittently with a red glow then the elevator came and the doors closed the interior of the elevator was tacky plastic paneling made to look like wood worn green carpeting stained by innumerable pets she waited impatiently for it to creak up to the third floor she knew what these buildings were like full of hookers full of fags full of drugs and transients you could rent an apartment without a long lease just month to month it was that kind of place she stepped off at the third floor and walked down to a cluster of cops outside an apartment another policeman blocked her way she repeated that she was here to see captain anders and he let her through with the admonition not to touch anything it was a onebedroom apartment furnished in pseudospanish style or at least she thought it was twenty men were crowded inside dusting photographing measuring collecting it was impossible to visualize how it had looked before the onslaught of police personnel anders came over to her he was young in his middle thirties wearing a conservative dark suit his hair was long enough to hang over the back of his collar and he wore hornrimmed glasses the effect was almost professorial and quite unexpected it was strange how you built up prejudices when he spoke his voice was soft are you dr ross yes captain anders he shook hands quickly and firmly thank you for coming the body is in the bedroom the coroners man is in there too he led the way into the bedroom the deceased was a girl in her twenties sprawled nude across the bed her head was crushed and she had been stabbed repeatedly the bed was soaked with blood and the room had the sickly sweet odor of blood the rest of the room was in disarray a chair by the dressing table knocked over cosmetics and lotions smeared on the rug a bedside lamp broken six men were working in the room one of them a doctor from the medical examiners office he was filling out the death report this is dr ross anders said tell her about it the doctor shrugged toward the body brutal methodology as you can see strong blow to the left temporal region producing cranial depression and immediate unconsciousness the weapon was that lamp over there blood of her type and some of her hair are affixed to it ross glanced over at the lamp then back to the body the stab wounds theyre later almost certainly postmortem she was killed by the blow to the head ross looked at the head it was squashed in on one side like a deflated football distorting the features of what had once been a conventionally pretty face youll notice the doctor said moving closer to the girl that shes put on half her makeup as we reconstruct it shes sitting at the dressing table over there making up the blow comes from above and from the side knocking her over in the chair spilling the lotions and crap then shes lifted up the doctor raised his arms and frowned in mock effort lifting an invisible body from the chair and placed on the bed somebody pretty strong oh yes a man for sure how do you know that pubic hair in the shower drain weve found two varieties one matches hers the other is male male pubic hair as you know is more circular less elliptical in cross section than female hair no ross said i didnt know that i can give you a reference on it if you want the doctor said its also clear that her killer had intercourse with her before the murder weve got a blood type on the seminal fluid and its ao the man apparently takes a shower after intercourse and then comes out and kills her ross nodded following delivery of the blow to the head shes lifted up and placed on the bed at this time shes not bleeding much no blood to speak of on the dressing table or rug but now her killer picks up some instrument and stabs her in the stomach several times youll notice that the deepest wounds are all in the lower abdomen which may have some sexual connotations for the killer but thats just guessing on our part ross nodded but said nothing she had decided the coroners man was a creep she wasnt going to tell him more than she had to she moved closer to the body to examine the stab wounds they were all small puncturelike in appearance with a good deal of skin tearing around the wounds you find a weapon no the doctor said what do you think it was im not sure nothing very sharp but something strong it took a lot of force to penetrate this way with a relatively blunt instrument another argument that its a man anders said yes id guess it was something metal like a blunt letter opener or a metal ruler or a screwdriver something like that but whats really interesting the doctor went on is this phenomenon here he pointed to the girls left arm which was outstretched on the bed and mutilated badly by stab wounds you see he stabbed her in the stomach and then stabbed her arm moving out in a regular way a succession of stabbings now notice when hes past the arm he continues to stab you can see the tears in the sheet and blanket they continue out in a straight line he pointed to the tears now the doctor said in my book thats perseveration automatic continuation of pointless movement like he was some kind of machine that just kept going and going thats correct ross said we assume the doctor said that it represents some kind of trance state but we dont know if it was organic or functional natural or artificially induced since the girl let him into the apartment freely this trancelike state developed only later ross realized that the coroners man was showing off and it irritated her this was the wrong time to be playing sherlock holmes anders handed her the metal dog tag we were proceeding routinely with the investigation he said when we found this ross turned the tag over in her hand i have an implanted atomic pacemaker direct physical injury or fire may rupture the capsule and release toxic materials in the event of injury or death call nps that was when we called you anders said he watched her carefully weve leveled with you he said now its your turn his name is harry benson she said hes thirtyfour and he has psychomotor epilepsy the doctor snapped his fingers ill be damned whats psychomotor epilepsy anders said at that moment a plainclothesman came in from the living room we got a trace on the prints he said theyre listed in the defense data banks of all places this guy had classified clearance from to the present his names harry benson lives in la clearance for what anders said computer work probably ross said thats right the plainclothesman said last three years classified computer research anders was making notes they have a blood type on him yeah type ao is whats listed ross turned to the doctor what do you have on the girl names doris blankfurt stage name angela black twentysix years old been in the building six weeks what does she do dancer ross nodded anders said does that have some special meaning he has a thing about dancers hes attracted to them attracted and repelled she said its rather complicated he looked at her curiously did he think she was putting him on and he has some kind of epilepsy yes psychomotor epilepsy anders made notes im going to need some explanations he said of course and a description pictures i can get you all that as soon as possible she nodded all her earlier impulses to resist the police to refuse to cooperate with them had vanished she kept staring at the girls cavedin head she could imagine the suddenness the viciousness of the attack she glanced at her watch its seventhirty now she said im going back to the hospital but im stopping at home to clean up and change you can meet me there or at the hospital ill meet you there anders said ill be finished here in about twenty minutes okay she said and gave him the address the shower felt good the hot water like stinging needles against her bare skin she relaxed breathed the steam and closed her eyes she had always liked showers even though she knew it was the masculine pattern men took showers women took baths dr ramos had mentioned that once she thought it was bullshit patterns were made to be broken she was an individual then shed discovered that showers were used to treat schizophrenics they were sometimes calmed by alternating hot and cold spray so now you think youre schizophrenic dr ramos had said and laughed heartily he didnt often laugh sometimes she tried to make him laugh usually without success she turned off the shower and climbed out pulling a towel around her she wiped the steam off the bathroom mirror and stared at her reflection you look like hell she said and nodded her reflection nodded back the shower had washed away her eye makeup the only makeup she wore her eyes seemed small now and weak with fatigue what time was her hour with dr ramos today was it today what day was it anyway it took her a moment to remember that it was friday she hadnt slept for at least twentyfour hours and she was having all the sleepless symptoms shed remembered as an intern an acid gnawing in her stomach a dull ache in her body a kind of slow confusion of the mind it was a terrible way to feel she knew how it would progress in another four or five hours she would begin to daydream about sleeping she would imagine a bed and the softness of the mattress as she lay on it she would begin to dwell on the wonderful sensations that would accompany falling asleep she hoped they found benson before long the mirror had steamed over again she opened the bathroom door to let cool air in and wiped a clean space with her hand again she was starting to apply fresh makeup when she heard the doorbell that would be anders she had left the front door unlocked its open she shouted and then returned to her makeup she did one eye then paused before the second if you want coffee just boil water in the kitchen she said she did her other eye pulled the towel tighter around her and leaned out toward the hallway find everything you need she called harry benson was standing in the hallway good morning dr ross he said his voice was pleasant i hope i havent come at an inconvenient time it was odd how frightened she felt he held out his hand and she shook it hardly conscious of the action she was preoccupied with her own fear why was she afraid she knew this man well she had been alone with him many times before and had never been afraid the surprise was part of it the shock of finding him here and the unprofessional setting she was acutely aware of the towel her stilldamp bare legs excuse me a minute she said and ill get some clothes on he nodded politely and went back to the living room she closed the bedroom door and sat down on the bed she was breathing hard as if she had run a great distance anxiety she thought but the label didnt really help she remembered a patient who had finally shouted at her in frustration dont tell me im depressed i feel terrible she went to the closet and pulled on a dress hardly noticing which one it was then she went back into the bathroom to check her appearance stalling she thought this is not the time to stall she took a deep breath and went outside to talk with him he was standing in the middle of the living room looking uncomfortable and confused she saw the room freshly through his eyes a modern sterile hostile apartment modern furniture black leather and chrome hard lines modern paintings on the walls modern glistening machinelike efficient a totally hostile environment i never would have thought this of you he said were not threatened by the same things harry she kept her voice light do you want some coffee no thanks he was neatly dressed in a jacket and tie but his wig the black wig threw her off also his eyes they were tired distant the eyes of a man near the breaking point of fatigue she remembered how the rats had collapsed from excessive pleasurable stimulation eventually they lay spreadeagled on the floor of the cage panting too weak to crawl forward and press the shock lever one more time are you alone here he said yes i am there was a small bruise on his left cheek just below the eye she looked at his bandages they just barely showed a bit of white between the bottom of his wig and the top of his collar is something wrong he asked no nothing you seem tense his voice sounded genuinely concerned probably hed just had a stimulation she remembered how he had become sexually interested in her after the test stimulations just before he was interfaced no im not tense she smiled you have a very nice smile he said she glanced at his clothes looking for blood the girl had been soaked benson must have been covered with blood yet there was none on his clothes perhaps hed dressed after taking a second shower after killing her well she said im going to have some coffee she went into the kitchen with a kind of relief it was somehow easier to breathe in the kitchen away from him she put the kettle on the burner turned on the gas and stayed there a moment she had to get control of herself she had to get control of the situation the odd thing was that while she had been shocked to see him suddenly in her apartment she was not really surprised that he had come some psychomotor epileptics feared their own violence but why hadnt he returned to the hospital she went out to the living room benson was standing by the large windows looking out over the city which stretched away for miles in every direction are you angry with me he said angry why because i ran away why did you run away harry as she spoke she felt her strength coming back her control she could handle this man it was her job shed been alone with men more dangerous than this she remembered a sixmonth period at cameron state hospital where she had worked with psychopaths and multiple murderers charming engaging chilling men why because he smiled and sat down in a chair he wriggled around in it then stood up sitting down again on the sofa all your furniture is so uncomfortable how can you live in such an uncomfortable place i like it but its uncomfortable he stared at her a faint challenge in the look she wished again that they were not meeting here this environment was too threatening and benson reacted to threats with attack how did you find me harry youre surprised i knew where you lived yes a little i was careful he said before i went into the hospital i found out where you lived where ellis lived where mcpherson lived i found out where everybody lived why just in case what were you expecting he didnt reply instead he got up and walked to the windows looked out over the city theyre searching for me out there he said arent they yes but theyll never find me the city is too big from the kitchen her kettle began to whistle she excused herself and went in to make coffee her eyes scanned the counter searching for something heavy perhaps she could hit him over the head ellis would never forgive her but you have a picture on your wall benson called a lot of numbers who did that a man named johns why would a man draw numbers numbers are for machines she stirred the instant coffee poured in milk went back out and sat down harry no i mean it and look at this what is this supposed to mean he tapped another picture with his knuckles harry come and sit down he stared at her for a moment then came over and sat on the couch opposite her he seemed tense but a moment later smiled in a relaxed way for an instant his pupils dilated another stimulation she thought what the hell was she going to do harry she said what happened i dont know he said still relaxed you left the hospital yes i left the hospital wearing one of those white suits i figured it all out angela picked me up and then and then we went to my house i was quite tense why were you tense well you see i know how this is all going to end she wasnt sure what he was referring to how is it going to end and after we left my house we went to her apartment and we had some drinks and we made love and then i told her how it was going to end that was when she got scared she wanted to call the hospital to tell them where i was he stared off into space momentarily confused she didnt want to press the point he had had a seizure and he would not remember killing the girl his amnesia would be total and genuine but she wanted to keep him talking why did you leave the hospital harry it was in the afternoon he said turning to look at her i was lying in bed in the afternoon and i suddenly realized that everybody was taking care of me taking care servicing me like a machine i was afraid of that all along in some distant detached and academic corner of her mind she felt that a suspicion was confirmed bensons paranoia about machines was at bottom a fear of dependency of losing selfreliance he was quite literally telling the truth when he said he was afraid of being taken care of and people usually hated what they feared but then benson was dependent on her and how would he react to that you people lied to me he said suddenly nobody lied to you harry he began to get angry yes you did you he broke off and smiled again the pupils were briefly larger another stimulation they were very close now hed tip over again soon you know something thats the most wonderful feeling in the world he said what feeling that buzz is that how it feels as soon as things start to get black buzz and im happy again benson said beautifully warm and happy the stimulations she said she resisted the impulse to look at her watch what did it matter anders had said he would be coming in twenty minutes but anything could delay him and even if he came she wondered if he could handle benson a psychomotor epileptic out of control was an awesome thing anders would probably end up shooting benson or trying to and she didnt want that but you know what else benson said the buzz is only nice occasionally when it gets too heavy its suffocating is it getting heavy now yes he said and he smiled in that moment when he smiled she was stunned into the full realization of her own helplessness everything she had been taught about controlling patients everything about directing the flow of thought about watching the speech patterns was useless here verbal maneuvers would not work would not help her any more than they would help control a rabies victim or a person with a brain tumor benson had a physical problem he was in the grip of a machine that was inexorably flawlessly pushing him toward a seizure talk couldnt turn off the implanted computer there was only one thing she could do and that was get him to the hospital how she tried an appeal to his intellectual functions do you understand whats happening harry the stimulations are overloading you pushing you into seizures the feeling is nice but you said yourself its not always nice no not always well dont you want to have that corrected he paused a moment corrected fixed changed so that you dont have seizures any more she had to choose her words carefully you think i need to be fixed his words reminded her of ellis the surgeons pet phrase harry we can make you feel better i feel fine dr ross but harry when you went to angelas i dont remember anything about that you went there after you left the hospital i dont remember anything memory tapes are all erased nothing but static you can put it on audio if you want and listen to it yourself he opened his mouth and made a hissing sound see just static youre not a machine harry she said softly not yet her stomach churned she was physically sick with tension again that detached part of her mind noted the interesting physical manifestation of an emotional state she was grateful for the detachment even for a few instants of it but she was also angry at the thought of ellis and mcpherson and all those conferences when she had argued that implanting machinery into benson would exaggerate his preexisting delusional state they hadnt paid any attention she wished they were here now youre trying to make me into a machine he said you all are im fighting you harry let me finish his face was taut abruptly it loosened into a smile another stimulation they were coming only minutes apart now where was anders where was anybody should she run out into the hall screaming should she try to call the hospital the police it feels so good benson said still smiling that feeling it feels so good nothing feels as good as that i could just swim in that feeling forever and ever harry i want you to try and relax im relaxed but thats not what you really want is it what do i want you want me to be a good machine you want me to obey my masters to follow instructions isnt that what you want youre not a machine harry and i never will be his smile faded never ever she took a deep breath harry she said i want you to come back to the hospital no we can make you feel better no we care about you harry you care about me he laughed a nasty hard sound you dont care about me you care about your experimental preparation you care about your scientific protocol you care about your followup you dont care about me he was becoming excited and angry it wont look so good in the medical journals if you have to report so many patients observed for so many years and one died because he went nuts and the cops killed him that will reflect badly harry i know benson said he held out his hands i was sick an hour ago then when i woke up i saw blood under my fingernails blood i know he stared at his hands curling them to look at the nails then he touched his bandages the operation was supposed to work he said but it isnt working and then quite abruptly he began to cry his face was bland but the tears rolled down his cheeks it isnt working he said i dont understand it isnt working equally abruptly he smiled another stimulation this one had come less than a minute after the one previously she knew that hed tip over in the next few seconds i dont want to hurt anyone he said smiling cheerfully she felt sympathy for him and sadness for what had happened i understand she said lets go back to the hospital no no ill go with you ill stay with you all the time it will be all right dont argue with me he snapped to his feet fists clenched and glared down at her i will not listen he broke off but did not smile instead he began to sniff the air what is that smell he said i hate that smell what is it i hate it do you hear me i hate it he moved toward her sniffing he reached his hands out toward her harry i hate this feeling he said she got up off the couch moving away he followed her clumsily his hands still outstretched i dont want this feeling i dont want it he said he was no longer sniffing he was fully in a trance state coming toward her harry his face was blank an automaton mask his arms were still extended toward her he almost seemed to be sleepwalking as he advanced on her his movements were slow and she was able to back away from him maintaining distance then suddenly he picked up a heavy glass ashtray and flung it at her she dodged it struck one of the large windows shattering the glass he leaped for her and threw his arms around her holding her in a clumsy bear hug he squeezed her with incredible strength harry she gasped harry she looked up at his face and saw it was still blank she kneed him in the groin he grunted and released her bending at the waist coughing she moved away from him and picked up the phone she dialed the operator benson was still bent over still coughing operator operator give me the police do you want the beverly hills police or the los angeles police i dont care well which do you she dropped the phone benson was stalking her again she heard the tiny voice of the operator saying hello hello benson tore the phone away and flung it behind him across the room he picked up a floor lamp and held it base outward he began to swing it in large hissing arcs she ducked it once and felt the gush of air in the wake of the heavy metal base if it hit her it would kill her it would kill her the realization pushed her to action she ran to the kitchen benson dropped the lamp and followed her she tore open drawers looking for a knife she found only a small paring knife where the hell were her big knives benson was in the kitchen she threw a pot at him blindly it clattered against his knees he moved forward the detached and academic part of her mind was still operating telling her that she was making a big mistake that there was something in the kitchen she could use but what bensons hands closed around her neck the grip was terrifying she grabbed his wrists and tried to pull them away she kicked up with her leg but he twisted his body away from her then pressed her back against the counter pinning her down she could not move she could not breathe she began to see blue spots dancing before her eyes her lungs burned for air her fingers scratched along the counter feeling for something anything to strike him with she touched nothing the kitchen she flung her hands around wildly she felt the handle of the dishwasher the handle to the oven the machines in her kitchen her vision was greenish the blue spots were larger they swam sickeningly before her she was going to die in the kitchen the kitchen the kitchen dangers of the kitchen it came to her in a flash just as she was losing consciousness microwaves she no longer had any vision the world was dull gray but she could still feel her fingers touched the metal of the oven the glass of the oven door then up up to the controls she twisted the dial benson screamed the pressure around her neck was gone she slumped to the floor benson was screaming horrible agonized sounds her vision came back to her slowly and she saw him standing over her clutching his head in his hands screaming he paid no attention to her as she lay on the floor gasping for breath he twisted and writhed holding his head and howling like a wounded animal then he rushed from the room still screaming and she slid smoothly and easily into unconsciousness the bruises were already forming long purplish welts on both sides of her neck she touched them gently as she looked into the mirror when did he leave anders said he stood in the doorway to the bathroom watching her i dont know around the time i passed out he looked back toward the living room quite a mess out there i imagine so why did he attack you he had a seizure but youre his doctor that doesnt matter she said when he has a seizure hes out of control totally hed kill his own child during a seizure people have been known to do that anders frowned uncertainly she could imagine the trouble he was having with the idea unless you had seen a psychomotor seizure you could not comprehend the unreasonable brutal violence of an attack it was completely beyond any normal life experience nothing else was like it analogous to it similar to it umm anders said finally but he didnt kill you not quite she thought still touching the bruises the bruises would get much worse in the next few hours what could she do about it makeup she didnt have any a highnecked sweater no she said he didnt kill me but he would have what happened i turned on the oven anders looked puzzled is that a cure for epilepsy hardly but it affected bensons electronic machinery i have a microwave oven microwave radiation screws up pacemaking machinery its a big problem for cardiac pacemakers now dangers of the kitchen there have been a lot of recent articles oh anders said he left the room to make some calls while she dressed she chose a black turtleneck sweater and a gray skirt and stepped back to look at herself in the mirror the bruises were hidden then she noticed the colors black and gray that wasnt like her too somber too dead and cold she considered changing but didnt she heard anders talking on the phone in the living room she went out to the kitchen to make herself a drink no more coffee she wanted scotch on the rocks and as she poured it she saw the long scratches in the wooden counter that her fingernails had left she looked at her fingernails three of them were broken she hadnt noticed before she made the drink and went out to sit in the living room yes anders was saying into the phone yes i understand no no idea well were trying there was a long pause she went to the broken window and looked out at the city the sun was up lighting a dark band of brown air that hung above the buildings it was really a lethal place to live she thought she should move to the beach where the air was better well listen anders said angrily none of this would have happened if youd kept that fucking guard at his door in the hospital i think you better keep that in mind she heard the phone slam down and turned shit he said politics even in the police department especially in the police department he said anything goes wrong and suddenly theres a scramble to see who can get stuck with it theyre trying to stick you theyre trying me on for size she nodded and wondered what was happening back at the hospital probably the same thing the hospital had to maintain its image in the community the chiefs of service would be in a sweat the director would be worrying about fundraising somebody at the hospital would get stuck mcpherson was too big she and morris were too small it would probably be ellis he was an assistant professor if you fired an assistant professor it had connotations of firing a temporary appointment who had proven himself too aggressive too reckless too ambitious much better than firing a full professor which was very messy and reflected badly on the earlier decision that had given him tenure it would probably be ellis she wondered if he knew he had just recently bought a new house in brentwood he was very proud of it he had invited everyone in the nps to a housewarming party next week she stared out the window through the shattered glass anders said listen what does epilepsy have to do with cardiac pacemakers nothing she said except that benson has a brain pacemaker very similar to a cardiac pacemaker anders flipped open his notebook you better start from the beginning he said and go slowly all right she set down her drink let me make one call first anders nodded sat back and waited while she called mcpherson then as calmly as she could she explained everything she knew to the policeman mcpherson hung up the telephone and stared out his office window at the morning sun it was no longer pale and cold there was the full warmth of morning that was ross he said morris nodded from the corner and benson came to her apartment she lost him morris sighed it doesnt seem to be our day mcpherson said he shook his head not taking his eyes off the sun i dont believe in luck he said he turned to morris do you morris was tired he hadnt really been listening do i what believe in luck sure all surgeons believe in luck i dont believe in luck mcpherson repeated never did i always believed in planning he gestured to the charts on his wall then lapsed staring at them the charts were large things four feet across and intricately done in many colors they were really glorified flow charts with timetables for technical advances he had always been proud of them for instance in he had examined the state of three areas diagnostic conceptualization surgical technology and microelectronics and concluded that they would all come together to allow an operation for psychomotor epilepsy in july of they had beaten his estimate by four months but it was still damned accurate damned accurate he said what morris said mcpherson shook his head are you tired yes i guess were all tired wheres ellis making coffee mcpherson nodded coffee would be good he rubbed his eyes wondering when he would be able to sleep not for a while not until they had benson back and that could take many hours more perhaps another day he looked again at the charts everything had been going so well electrode implantation four months ahead of schedule computer simulation of behavior almost nine months ahead but that too was having problems george and martha programs were behaving erratically and form q he shook his head form q might never get off the ground now although it was his favorite project and had always been form q on the flow chart for with human application beginning in in he would be seventyfive years old if he was still alive but he didnt worry about that it was the idea the simple idea that intrigued him form q was the logical outgrowth of all the work at the nps it began as a project called form quixoticus because it seemed so impossible but mcpherson felt certain that it would happen because it was so necessary for one thing it was a question of size for another a question of expense a modern electronic computer say a thirdgeneration ibm digital computer would cost several million dollars it drew an enormous amount of power it consumed space voraciously yet the largest computer still had the same number of circuits as the brain of an ant to make a computer with the capacity of a human brain would require a huge skyscraper its energy demands would be the equivalent of a city of half a million obviously nobody would ever try to build such a computer using current technology new methods would have to be found and there wasnt much doubt in mcphersons mind what the methods would be living tissues the theory was simple enough a computer like a human brain was composed of functioning units little flipflop cells of one kind or another the size of those units had shrunk considerably over the years they would continue to shrink as largescale integration and other microelectronic techniques improved power requirements would also decrease but the individual units would never become as small as a nerve cell a neuron you could pack a billion nerve cells into one cubic inch no human miniaturization method would ever achieve that economy of space nor would any human method ever produce a unit that operated on so little power as a nerve cell therefore make your computers from living nerve cells it was already possible to grow isolated nerve cells in tissue culture it was possible to alter them artificially in different ways in the future it would be possible to grow them to specification to make them link up in specified ways once you could do that you could make a computer that was say six cubic feet in volume but contained thousands of billions of nerve cells its energy requirements would not be excessive its heat production and waste products would be manageable yet it would be the most intelligent entity on the planet by far form q preliminary work was already being done in a number of laboratories and government research units around the country advances were being made but for mcpherson the most exciting prospect was not a superintelligent organic computer that was just a side product what was really interesting was the idea of an organic prosthesis for the human brain because once you developed an organic computer a computer composed of living cells and deriving energy from oxygenated nutrified blood then you could transplant it into a human being and you would have a man with two brains what would that be like mcpherson could hardly imagine it there were endless problems of course problems of interconnection problems of location speculative problems about competition between the old brain and the new transplant but there was plenty of time to solve that before after all in most people still laughed at the idea of going to the moon form q it was only a vision now but with funding it would happen and he had been convinced that it would happen until benson left the hospital that changed everything ellis stuck his head in the office door anybody want coffee yes mcpherson said he looked over at mor no morris said he got up out of his chair i think ill replay some of bensons interview tapes good idea mcpherson said though he did not really think so he realized that morris had to keep busy had to do something anything just to remain active morris left ellis left and mcpherson was alone with his multicolored charts and his thoughts it was noon when ross finished with anders and she was tired the scotch had calmed her but it had intensified her fatigue toward the end she had found herself stumbling over words losing track of her thoughts making statements and then amending them because they were not exactly what she had intended to say she had never felt so tired so drugged with fatigue in her life anders on the other hand was maddeningly alert he said where do you suppose benson is now where would he be likely to go she shook her head its impossible to know hes in a postseizure state postictal we call it and thats not predictable youre his psychiatrist anders said you must know a lot about him isnt there any way to predict how hell act no she said god she was tired why couldnt he understand benson is in an abnormal state hes nearly psychotic hes confused hes receiving stimulations frequently hes having seizures frequently he could do anything if hes confused anders let his voice trail off what would he do if he was confused how would he behave look she said its no good its no damned good working that way he could do anything okay anders said he glanced at her briefly and sipped his coffee why couldnt he just let it go for christs sake his desire to psych out benson and track him down was ludicrously unrealistic besides everybody knew how this was going to turn out somebody would spot benson and shoot him and that would be the end of it even benson had said she paused frowning what had he said something about how it would all end what were his exact words she tried to remember but couldnt she had been too frightened to pay close attention these are the impossible ones anders said getting up and walking to the window in another city you might have a chance but not in los angeles not in five hundred square miles of city its bigger than new york chicago san francisco and philadelphia put together did you know that no she said hardly listening too many places to hide he said too many ways to escape too many roads too many airports too many marinas if hes smart hes left already gone to mexico or to canada he wont do that she said what will he do hell come back to the hospital there was a pause i thought you couldnt predict his behavior anders said its just a feeling she said thats all wed better go to the hospital he said the nps looked like the planning room for a war all patient visits had been canceled until monday no one but staff and police were admitted to the fourth floor but for some reason all the development people were there and they were running around with horrified looks on their faces obviously worried that their grants and their jobs were in jeopardy phones rang constantly reporters were calling in mcpherson was locked in his office with hospital administrators ellis was swearing at anyone who came within ten yards of him morris was off somewhere and couldnt be found gerhard and richards were trying to free some telephone lines so they could run a projection program using another computer but all the lines were in use physically the nps was a shambles ashtrays heaped with cigarette butts coffee cups crumpled on the floor halfeaten hamburgers and tacos everywhere jackets and uniforms thrown across the backs of chairs and the telephones never stopped ringing as soon as anyone hung up on a call the phone rang again instantly ross sat with anders in her office and went over the miscellaneous crime report checking the description of benson the description was computerized but it read out fairly accurately male caucasian black hair brown eyes years old personal oddities wig and bandages on neck thought to be armed with revolver trademarks abnormal act other perseveration reason for crime suspect insane ross sighed he doesnt really fit your computer categories nobody does anders said all we can hope is that its accurate enough to allow somebody to identify him were also circulating his picture several hundred photos are being run off now and distributed around the city thatll help what happens now ross said we wait he said unless you can think of a hiding place hed use she shook her head then we wait he said it was a broad lowceilinged whitetiled room lit brightly by overhead fluorescent lights six stainlesssteel tables were set out in a row each emptying into a sink at one end of the room five of the tables were empty the body of angela black lay on the sixth two police pathologists and morris were bent over the body as the autopsy proceeded morris had seen a lot of autopsies in his day but the autopsies he attended as a surgeon were usually different in this one the pathologists spent nearly half an hour examining the exterior appearance of the body and taking photographs before they made the initial incision they paid a lot of attention to the external appearance of the stab wounds and what they called a stretch laceration appearance to the wounds one of the pathologists explained that this means the wounds were caused by a blunt object it didnt cut the skin it pulled it and caused a split in the taut portion then the instrument went in but the initial split was always slightly ahead of the deeper penetration track they also pointed out that skin hair had been forced down into the wounds in several places further evidence of a blunt object producing the cuts what kind of blunt object morris had asked they shook their heads no way to know yet well have to take a look at the penetration penetration meant the depth that the weapon had entered the body determining penetration was difficult skin was elastic and tended to snap back into shape underlying tissues moved around before and after death it was a slow business morris was tired his eyes hurt after a time he left the autopsy room and went next door to the police lab where the girls purse contents were spread out on a large table three men went through it one identifying the objects one recording them and the third tagging them morris watched in silence most of the objects seemed commonplace lipstick compact car keys wallet kleenex chewing gum birth control pills address book ballpoint pen eye shadow hair clip and two packs of matches two packs of matches one of the cops intoned both marked airport marina hotel morris sighed they were going through this so slowly so patiently it was no better than the autopsy did they really think theyd find anything this way he found the plodding routine intolerable janet ross called that the surgeons disease this urge to take decisive action the inability to wait patiently once in an early nps conference where they were considering a stagethree candidate a woman named worley morris had argued strongly for taking her as a surgical candidate even though she had several other problems ross had laughed poor impulse control she had said in that moment he could cheerfully have killed her and his murderous feelings were not relieved when ellis then said in a clinical quiet tone that he agreed that mrs worley was an inappropriate surgical candidate morris felt let down in the worst way even though mcpherson said that he thought the candidate had some worth and probably should be listed as a possible and held for a while poor impulse control he thought the hell with her airport marina huh one of the cops said isnt that where all the stewardesses stay i dunno the other cop said morris hardly listened he rubbed his eyes and decided to get more coffee hed been awake for thirtysix hours straight and he wasnt going to last much longer he left the room and went upstairs looking for a coffee machine there must be coffee someplace in the building even cops drank coffee everybody drank coffee and then he stopped shivering he knew something about the airport marina the airport marina was where benson had first been arrested on suspicion of beating up a mechanic there was a bar in the hotel it had happened there morris was sure of it he glanced at his watch and then went out to the parking lot if he hurried hed beat rushhour traffic to the airport a jet screamed overhead and descended toward the runway as morris took the airport offramp from the freeway and drove down airport boulevard he passed bars and motels and carrental offices on the radio he heard the announcer drone and on the san diego freeway there is an accident involving a truck blocking three northbound lanes computer projection of flow is twelve miles an hour on the san bernadino freeway a stalled car in the left lane south of the exeter offramp computer projection of traffic flow is thirtyone miles an hour morris thought of benson again perhaps computers really were taking over he remembered a funny little englishman who had lectured at the hospital and told the surgeons that soon operations would be done with the surgeon on another continent he would work using robot hands the signals being transmitted via satellite the idea had seemed crazy but his surgical colleagues had squirmed at the thought on the ventura freeway west of haskell a twocar collision has slowed traffic computer projection is eighteen miles an hour he found himself listening to the traffic report intently computers or not the traffic report was vital to anyone who lived in los angeles you learned to pay attention to any traffic report automatically the way people in other parts of the country automatically paid attention to weather reports morris had come to california from michigan for the first few weeks after his arrival he had asked people what the weather was going to be like later in the day or on the following day it seemed to him a natural question for a newcomer to ask and a natural ice breaker but he got very strange puzzled looks from people later he realized that he had come to one of the few places in the world where the weather was of no interest to anyone it was always more or less the same and rarely discussed but automobiles now there was a subject of almost compulsive fascination people were always interested in what kind of car you drove how you liked it whether it was reliable what troubles you had had with it in the same vein driving experiences bad traffic shortcuts you had found accidents you had experienced were always welcome conversation topics in los angeles anything relating to cars was a serious matter worthy of as much time and attention as you could devote to it he remembered as a kind of final proof of the idiocy of it all that an astronomer had once said that if martians looked at los angeles they would probably conclude that the automobile was the dominant life form of the area and in a sense they would be right he parked in the lot of the airport marina hotel and entered the lobby the building was as incongruous as its name with that california quality of bizarre mixtures in this case a sort of plasticandneon japanese inn he went directly to the bar which was dark and nearly deserted at pm there were two stewardesses in a far corner talking over drinks one or two businessmen seated at the bar and the bartender himself staring off vacantly into space morris sat at the bar when the bartender came over he pushed bensons picture across the counter you ever seen this man whatll it be the bartender said morris tapped the picture this is a bar we serve liquor morris was beginning to feel strange it was the kind of feeling he sometimes had when he began an operation and felt like a surgeon in a movie something very theatrical now he was a private eye his name is benson morris said im his doctor hes very ill whats he got morris sighed have you seen him before sure lots of times harry right thats right harry benson when was the last time you saw him an hour ago the man shrugged whats he got epilepsy its important to find him do you know where he went epilepsy no shit the bartender picked up the picture and examined it closely in the light of a glowing schlitz sign behind the bar thats him all right but he dyed his hair black do you know where he went he didnt look sick to me are you sure youre do you know where he went there was a long silence the bartender looked grim morris instantly regretted his tone youre no fucking doctor the bartender said now beat it i need your help morris said time is very important as he spoke he opened his wallet took out his identification cards credit cards everything with an md on it he spread them across the counter the bartender didnt even glance at them he is also wanted by the police morris said i knew it the bartender said i knew it and i can get some policeman down here to help question you you may be an accessory to murder morris thought that sounded good at least it sounded dramatic the bartender picked up one of the cards peered at it dropped it i dont know nothing he said he comes in sometimes thats all where did he go today i dont know he left with joe whos joe mechanic works the late shift at united united air lines thats right the bartender said listen what about this but morris was already gone in the hotel lobby he called the nps and got through the switchboard to captain anders anders here listen this is morris im at the airport i have a lead on benson about an hour ago he was seen in the bar of the airport marina hotel he left with a mechanic named joe who works for united works the evening shift there was a moment of silence morris heard the scribbling sound of a pencil got it anders said anything else no well get some cars out right away you think he went to the united hangars probably well get some cars out right away what about morris stopped and stared at the receiver it was dead in his hand he took a deep breath and tried to decide what to do next from now on it was police business benson was dangerous he should let the police handle it on the other hand how long would it take them to get here where was the nearest police station inglewood culver city in rush hour traffic even with their sirens it might take twenty minutes it might take half an hour that was too much time benson might leave in half an hour meanwhile he ought to keep track of him just locate benson and keep track of him not interfere but not let him get away either the large sign said united air lines maintenance personnel only there was a guardhouse beneath the sign morris pulled up leaned out of his car im dr morris im looking for joe morris was prepared for a lengthy explanation but the guard didnt seem to care joe came on about ten minutes ago signed in to hangar seven ahead of him morris saw three very large airplane hangars with parking lots behind which one is seven far left the guard said dont know why he went there except maybe the guest what guest he signed in a guest the guard consulted his clipboard a mr benson took him to seven whats in seven a dc thats in for major overhaul nothing doing there theyre waiting for a new engine itll be another week in there guess he wanted to show it to him thanks morris said he drove past the gates onto the parking lot and parked close to hangar seven he got out of the car then paused the fact was he really didnt know whether benson was in the hangar or not he ought to check that otherwise when the police arrived he might appear a fool he might sit here in this parking lot while benson escaped he thought hed better check he was not afraid he was young and in good physical condition he was also fully aware that benson was dangerous that foreknowledge would protect him benson was most dangerous to those who didnt recognize the lethal nature of his illness he decided to take a quick look inside the hangar to make sure benson was inside the hangar was an enormous structure but didnt seem to have any doors except for the giant doors to admit the airplane they were now closed how did you get in he scanned the exterior of the building which was mostly corrugated steel then he saw a normalsized door to the far left he got back in his car and drove up to it parked and entered the hangar it was pitch black inside and totally silent he stood by the door for a moment then heard a low groan he ran his hands along the walls feeling for a light switch he touched a steel box felt it carefully there were several large heavyduty switches he threw them one by one the overhead lights came on very bright and very high he saw in the center of the hangar a giant plane glinting with reflections from the overhead bulbs it was odd how much more enormous it seemed inside a building he walked toward it away from the door he heard another groan at first he could not determine where it was coming from there was no one in sight the floor was bare but there was a ladder near the far wing he walked beneath the high sleek tail assembly toward the ladder the hangar smelled of gasoline and grease sharp smells it was warm another groan he walked faster his footsteps echoing in the cavernous hangar space the groan seemed to be coming from somewhere inside the airplane how did you get inside it was an odd thought hed made dozens of airplane trips you always got on by a ramp near the cockpit but here in the hangar the plane was so damned enormous how could you possibly get inside he passed the two jet engines of the near wing they were giant cylinders black turbine blades inside funny the engines had never seemed so big before probably never noticed there was still another groan he reached the ladder and climbed up six feet in the air he came to the wing a gleaming expanse of flat silver nubbled with rivets a sign said step here there were drops of blood by the sign he looked across the wing and saw a man covered with blood lying on his back morris moved closer and saw that the mans face was horribly mangled and his arm was twisted back at a grotesquely unnatural angle he heard a noise behind him he spun and then suddenly all the lights in the hangar went out morris froze he had a sense of total disorientation of being suspended in air in vast and limitless blackness he did not move he held his breath he waited the injured man groaned again there was no other sound morris knelt down not really knowing why somehow he felt safer being close to the metal surface of the wing he was not conscious of being afraid just badly confused then he heard a soft laugh and he began to be afraid benson there was no reply benson are you there no reply but footsteps moving across the concrete floor steady quietly echoing footsteps harry its dr morris morris blinked his eyes trying to adjust to the darkness it was no good he couldnt see anything he couldnt see the edges of the wing he couldnt see the outline of the fuselage he couldnt see a fucking thing the footsteps came closer harry i want to help you his voice cracked as he spoke that certainly conveyed his fear to benson he decided to shut up his heart was pounding and he was breathing hard gasping for breath harry no reply but the footsteps stopped perhaps benson was giving up perhaps he had had a stimulation perhaps he was changing his mind a new sound a metallic creak quite close another creak he was climbing the ladder morris was drenched with cold sweat he still could see nothing nothing at all he was so disoriented he no longer remembered where he was on the wing was the ladder in front of him or behind another creak he tried to fix the sound it was coming somewhere in front of him that meant he was facing the tail the rear of the wing facing the ladder another creak how many steps were there roughly six feet six steps benson would be standing on the wing soon what could he use for a weapon morris patted his pockets his clothes were soaked and clinging with sweat he had a momentary thought that this was all ridiculous that benson was the patient and he was the doctor benson would listen to reason benson would do as he was told another creak a shoe quickly he slipped off his shoe and cursed the fact that it had a rubber sole but it was better than nothing he gripped the shoe tightly held it above his head ready to swing he had a mental image of the beaten mechanic the disfigured bloody face and he suddenly realized that he was going to have to hit benson very hard with all the strength he had he was going to have to try to kill benson there were no more creaking sounds but he could hear breathing and then distant at first but growing rapidly louder he heard sirens the police were coming benson would hear them too and would give up another creak benson was going back down the ladder morris breathed a sigh of relief then he heard a peculiar scratching sound and felt the wing beneath his feet shake benson had not climbed down he had continued to climb up and was now standing on the wing dr morris morris almost answered but didnt he knew then that benson couldnt really see either benson needed a voice fix morris said nothing dr morris i want you to help me the sirens were louder each moment morris had a momentary elation at the thought that benson was going to be caught this whole nightmare would soon be over please help me dr morris perhaps he was sincere morris thought perhaps he really meant it if that were so then as his doctor he had a duty to help him please morris stood im over here harry he said now just take it easy and something hissed in the air he felt it coming before it hit then he felt agonizing pain in his mouth and jaw and he was knocked backward rolling across the wing the pain was awful worse than anything he had ever felt and then he fell into blackness it was not far to fall from the wing to the ground but it seemed to be taking a long time it seemed to take forever janet ross stood outside the treatment room in the emergency ward watching through the small glass window there were six people in there taking care of morris all clustered around him she couldnt see much all she could really see were his feet he had one shoe on the other was off there was a lot of blood most of the ew people were spattered with it standing outside with her anders said i dont have to tell you what i think of this no she said the man is terribly dangerous dr morris should have waited for the police but the police didnt catch him she said suddenly angry anders didnt understand anything he didnt understand how you could feel responsible for a patient how you could want to take care of somebody morris didnt catch him either anders said and why didnt the police get him benson was gone when they got to the hangar there are several exits from the hangar and they couldnt all be covered they found morris under the wing and the mechanic on top of the wing and they were both pretty badly hurt the treatmentroom door opened ellis came out looking haggard unshaven defeated how is he ross said hes okay ellis said he wont have much to say for a few weeks but hes okay theyre taking him to surgery now to wire up his jaw and get all the teeth out he turned to anders did they find the weapon anders nodded twofoot section of lead pipe he must have got it right in the mouth ellis said but at least he didnt inhale any of the loose teeth the bronchi are clean on lung films he put his arm around janet theyll fix him up what about the other one the mechanic ellis shook his head i wouldnt place bets his nose was shattered and the nasal bones were driven up into the substance of the brain hes leaking csf through the nostrils lot of bleeding and a big problem with encephalitis anders said how do you assess his chances hes on the critical list all right anders said he walked off ross walked with ellis out of the emergency ward toward the cafeteria ellis kept his arm around her shoulders this has turned into a horrible mess he said will he really be all right sure he was kind of goodlooking theyll get his jaw back together hell be fine she shuddered cold cold she said and tired very tired she had coffee with ellis in the cafeteria it was and there were a lot of staff people eating ellis ate slowly his movements showing fatigue its funny he said what i had a call this afternoon from minnesota they have a professorship in neurosurgery to fill asked me if i was interested she didnt say anything isnt that funny no she said i told them i wasnt considering anything until i was fired here he said are you sure thatll happen arent you he said he stared across the cafeteria at all the nurses and interns and residents in white i wouldnt like minnesota he said its too cold but its a good school oh yes a good school he sighed a fine school she felt sorry for him and then suppressed the emotion he had brought it on himself and against her advice for the last twentyfour hours she had not allowed herself to say i told you so to anyone she had not allowed herself to think it for one thing it wasnt necessary to say it for another it would not be useful in helping benson which was her chief concern but she didnt have much sympathy now for the brave surgeon brave surgeons risked other peoples lives not their own the most a surgeon could lose was his reputation well he said i better get back to the nps see how things are going you know what what i hope they kill him ellis said and he walked away toward the elevators the operation began at pm she watched from the overhead glass viewing booth as morris was wheeled into the or and the surgeons draped him bendixon and curtiss were doing the procedure they were both good plastic surgeons they would fix him up as well as anybody possibly could but it was still a shock to watch as the sterile gauze packs were taken away from morriss face and the flesh exposed the upper part of his face was normal though pale the lower part was a red mash like butchers meat it was impossible to find the mouth in all the redness ellis had seen that in the emergency ward it was shocking to her now even at a distance she could imagine the effect much closer she stayed to watch as the drapes were placed over the body and around the head the surgeons were gowned and gloved the instrument tables set in position the scrub nurses stood ready the whole ritual of preparing for surgery was carried out smoothly and efficiently it was a wonderful ritual she thought so rigid and so perfect that nobody would ever know and the surgeons themselves probably didnt consider that they were operating on a colleague the ritual the fixed procedure was anaesthetic for the surgeon just as gas was anaesthetic for the patient she stayed a few moments longer and then left the room as she approached the nps she saw that a cluster of reporters had cornered ellis outside the building he was answering their questions in clear bad humor she heard the words mind control repeated several times feeling slightly guilty she cut around to the far entrance and took the elevator to the fourth floor mind control she thought the sunday supplements were going to have a field day with mind control and then there would be solemn editorials in the daily papers and even more solemn editorials in the medical journals about the hazards of uncontrolled and irresponsible research she could see it coming mind control christ the truth was that everybodys mind was controlled and everybody was glad for it the most powerful mind controllers in the world were parents and they did the most damage theorists usually forgot that nobody was born prejudiced neurotic or hungup those traits required a helping hand of course parents didnt intentionally damage their children they merely inculcated attitudes that they felt would be important and useful to their children newborn children were little computers waiting to be programmed and they would learn whatever they were taught from bad grammar to bad attitudes like computers they were undiscriminating they had no way to differentiate between good ideas and bad ones the analogy was quite exact many people had remarked on the childishness and the literalness of computers for example if you could instruct a computer to put on your shoes and socks the computer would certainly reply that socks could not be fitted over shoes all the important programming was finished by the age of seven racial attitudes sexual attitudes ethical attitudes religious attitudes national attitudes the gyroscope was set and the children let loose to spin off on their predetermined courses mind control what about something as simple as social conventions what about shaking hands when you meet someone facing forward in elevators passing on the left having your wineglass on the right hundreds of little conventions that people needed in order to stereotype social interaction take away any of them and you produce unbearable anxiety people needed mind control they were glad to have it they were hopelessly lost without it but let a group of people try to solve the greatest problem in the world today uncontrolled violence and suddenly there are shouts from all sides mind control mind control which was better control or uncontrol she got off at the fourth floor brushed past several policemen in the hallway and went into her office anders was there hanging up the telephone and frowning we just got our first break he said oh her irritation dissipated in a wave of expectancy yes anders said but ill be damned if i know what it means what happened bensons description and his pictures are being circulated downtown and somebody recognized him who a clerk in building and planning in city hall he said benson came in ten days ago building and planning files specifications on all public structures erected within city limits and they administer certain building codes ross nodded well benson came in to check specs on a building he wanted to review electrical blueprints said he was an electrical engineer produced some identification ross said the girls at his house said hed come back for some blueprints well apparently he got them from building and planning what are they for university hospital anders said he has the complete wiring system for the entire hospital now what do you make of that they stared at each other by eight oclock she was almost asleep standing up her neck was hurting badly and she had a headache she realized that she didnt have a choice any more either she got some sleep or shed pass out ill be on the floor if you need me she told anders and left she walked down the corridor of the nps past several uniformed cops she no longer noticed them it seemed as if there had always been cops in the hallways for as long as she could remember she looked into mcphersons office he was sitting behind his desk head on his shoulder sleeping his breath came in short ragged gasps it sounded as if he were having nightmares she closed the door quietly an orderly walked past her carrying filled ashtrays and empty coffee cups it was strange to see an orderly doing cleaning duties the sight triggered a thought in her mind something unusual some question she couldnt quite formulate it nagged at her mind but she finally gave up on it she was tired she couldnt think clearly she came to one of the treatment rooms and saw that it was empty she went in closed the door and lay down on the examination couch she was almost instantly asleep in the lounge ellis watched himself on the oclock news it was partly vanity and partly morbid curiosity that made him do it gerhard was also there and richards and the cop anders on the screen ellis squinted slightly into the camera as he answered the questions of a group of reporters microphones were jammed up toward his face but he seemed to himself calm that pleased him and he found his answers reasonable the reporters asked him about the operation and he explained it briefly but clearly then one asked why was this operation done the patient ellis answered suffers from intermittent attacks of violent behavior he has organic brain disease his brain is damaged we are trying to fix that we are trying to prevent violence no one could argue with that he thought even mcpherson would be pleased with it as a polite answer is that common brain damage associated with violence we dont know how common it is ellis said we dont even know how common brain damage alone is but our best estimates are that ten million americans have obvious brain damage and five million more have subtle brain damage fifteen million one reporter said thats one person in thirteen pretty quick ellis thought hed figured it out later as one in fourteen something like that he replied on the screen there are two and a half million people with cerebral palsy there are two million with convulsive disorders including epilepsy there are six million with mental retardation there are probably two and a half million with hyperkinetic behavior disorders and all of these people are violent no certainly not but an unusually high proportion of violent people if you check them have brain damage physical brain damage now that shoots down a lot of theories about poverty and discrimination and social injustice and social disorganization those factors contribute to violence of course but physical brain damage is also a major factor and you cant correct physical brain damage with social remedies there was a pause in the reporters questions ellis remembered the pause and remembered being elated by it he was winning he was running the show when you say violence i mean ellis said attacks of unprovoked violence initiated by single individuals its the biggest problem in the world today violence and its a huge problem in this country in more americans were killed or attacked in this country than have been killed or wounded in all the years of the vietnam war specifically the reporters were in awe we had murders rapes and cases of aggravated assault all together a third of a million cases of violence that doesnt include automobile deaths and a lot of violence is carried out with cars we had deaths in autos and three million injuries you always were good with figures gerhard droned watching its working isnt it ellis said yeah flashy gerhard sighed but you have a squinty untrustworthy look thats my normal look gerhard laughed on the screen a reporter was saying and you think these figures reflect physical brain disease in large part ellis said in large part one of the clues pointing to physical brain disease in a single individual is a history of repeated violence there are some famous examples charles whitman who killed seventeen people in texas had a malignant brain tumor and told his psychiatrist for weeks before that he was having thoughts about climbing the tower and shooting people richard speck engaged in several episodes of brutal violence before he killed eight nurses lee harvey oswald repeatedly attacked people including his wife on many occasions those were famous cases there are a third of a million cases every year that are not famous were trying to correct that violent behavior with surgery i dont think thats a despicable thing i think its a noble goal and an important goal but isnt that mind control ellis said what do you call compulsory education through high school education the reporter said and that ended the interview ellis got up angrily that makes me look like a fool he said no it doesnt anders the cop said saturday march termination she was being pounded beaten senseless by brutal jarring blows she rolled away and moaned come on gerhard said shaking her wake up jan she opened her eyes the room was dark someone was leaning over her come on come on wake up she yawned the movement sent streaks of pain down through her neck what is it telephone for you its benson that jolted her awake faster than she would have thought possible gerhard helped her sit up and she shook her head to clear it her neck was a column of pain and the rest of her body was stiff and aching but she ignored that where telecomp she went outside into the hallway blinking in the bright light the cops were still there but they were tired now eyes dulled jaws slack she followed gerhard into telecomp richards held out the phone to her saying here she is she took the receiver hello harry across the room anders was listening on an extension i dont feel good harry benson said i want it to stop dr ross whats the matter harry she could hear the fatigue in his voice the slow and slightly childlike quality what would one of those rats say after twentyfour hours of stimulation things arent working very well im tired we can help you she said its the feelings benson said theyre making me tired now thats all just tired i want them to stop youll have to let us help you harry i dont believe you will you have to trust us harry there was a long pause anders looked across the room at ross she shrugged harry she said i wish you never did this to me benson said anders checked his watch did what the operation we can fix it for you harry i wanted to fix it myself he said his voice was very childlike almost petulant i wanted to pull out the wires ross frowned did you try no i tried to pull off the bandages but it hurt too much i dont like it when it hurts he was really being quite childlike she wondered if the regression was a specific phenomenon or the result of fear and fatigue im glad you didnt pull but i have to do something benson said i have to stop this feeling im going to fix the computer harry you cant do that we have to do that for you no i m going to fix it harry she said in a low soothing maternal voice harry please trust us there was no reply breathing on the other end of the line she looked around the room at the tense expectant faces harry please trust us just this once then everything will be all right the police are looking for me there are no police here she said theyve all gone you can come here everything will be all right you lied to me before he said his voice was petulant again no harry it was all a mistake if you come here now everything will be all right there was a very long silence and then a sigh im sorry benson said i know how its going to end i have to fix the computer myself harry there was a click and then the buzz of a disconnection ross hung up anders immediately dialed the phone company and asked whether they had been able to trace the call so that was why he had been looking at his watch she thought hell anders said and slammed the phone down they couldnt get a trace they couldnt even find the incoming call idiots he sat down across the room from ross he was just like a child she said shaking her head what did he mean about fixing the computer i suppose he meant tearing out the wires from his shoulder but he said he tried that maybe he did maybe he didnt she said hes confused now under the influence of all the stimulations and all the seizures is it physically possible to pull out the wires and the computer yes she said at least animals do it monkeys she rubbed her eyes is there any coffee gerhard poured her a cup poor harry she said he must be terrified out there across the room anders said how confused do you suppose he is really very she sipped the coffee is there any sugar left confused enough to mix up computers were out of sugar gerhard said ran out a couple of hours ago i dont understand she said he had wiring plans for the hospital anders said the main computer the computer that assisted in his operation is in the hospital basement she set down her coffee cup and stared at him she frowned rubbed her eyes again picked the coffee up then set it down once more i dont know she said finally the pathologists called while you were asleep anders said they determined that benson stabbed the dancer with a screwdriver he attacked the mechanic and he attacked morris machines and people connected with machines morris was connected with his own mechanization she smiled slightly im the psychiatrist around here im just asking is it possible sure of course its possible the telephone rang again ross answered it nps pacific telephone liaison here a male voice said weve rechecked that trace for captain anders is he there just a minute she nodded to anders who picked up the phone anders speaking there was a long pause then he said would you repeat that he nodded as he listened and what was the time period you checked i see thank you he hung up and immediately began dialing again you better tell me about that atomic power pack he said as he dialed what about it i want to know what happens if its ruptured anders said then turned away as his call was put through bomb squad this is anders homicide he turned back to ross ross said hes carrying around thirtyseven grams of radioactive plutonium pu if it breaks open youll expose everyone in the area to serious radiation what particles are emitted she looked at him in surprise ive been to college he said and i can even read and write when i have to alpha particles she said anders spoke into the phone anders homicide he said i want a van at university hospital right away weve got a possible radiation hazard pending man and immediate environment may be contaminated with an alpha emitter pu he listened then looked at ross any possibility of explosion no she said no explosive anders said he listened all right i understand get them here as quickly as you can he hung up ross said do you mind telling me whats going on the phone company rechecked that trace anders said theyve determined that there were no calls into the hospital from the outside at the time benson called none at all ross blinked thats right anders said he must have called from somewhere inside the hospital ross stared out the fourthfloor window at the parking lot and watched as anders gave instructions to at least twenty cops half of them went into the main hospital building the rest remained outside in little groups talking together quietly smoking then a white bombsquad van rumbled up and three men in gray metalliclooking suits lumbered out anders talked to them briefly then nodded and stayed with the van unpacking some very peculiar equipment anders walked back toward the nps alongside her gerhard watched the preparations benson wont make it he said i know she said i keep wondering if there is any way to disarm him or immobilize him could we make a portable microwave transmitter i thought of that gerhard said but its unsafe you cant really predict the effect on bensons equipment and you know itll raise hell with all the cardiac pacemakers in other patients in the hospital isnt there anything we can do gerhard shook his head there must be something she said he continued to shake his head besides he said pretty soon the incorporated environment takes over theoretically gerhard shrugged the incorporated environment was one of the notions from the development group of the nps it was a simple idea with profound implications it began with something that everybody knew that the brain was affected by the environment the environment produced experiences that became memories attitudes and habits things that got translated into neural pathways among brain cells and these pathways were fixed in some chemical or electrical fashion just as a common laborers body altered according to the work he did so a persons brain altered according to past experience but the change like the calluses on a workers body persisted after the experience ended in that sense the brain incorporated past environments our brains were the sum total of past experiences long after the experiences themselves were gone that meant that cause and cure werent the same thing the cause of behavior disorders might lie in childhood experiences but you couldnt cure the disorder by eliminating the cause because the cause had disappeared by adulthood the cure had to come from some other direction as the development people said a match may start a fire but once the fire is burning putting out the match wont stop it the problem is no longer the match its the fire as for benson he had had more than twentyfour hours of intense stimulation by his implanted computer that stimulation had affected his brain by providing new experiences and new expectations a new environment was being incorporated pretty soon it would be impossible to predict how the brain would react because it wasnt bensons old brain any more it was a new brain the product of new experiences anders came into the room were ready he said i can see weve got two men for every basement access two for the front door two for the emergency ward and two for each of the three elevators ive kept men away from the patientcare floors we dont want to start trouble in those areas considerate of you she thought but said nothing anders glanced at his watch twelveforty he said i think somebody should show me the main computer its in the basement she said nodding toward the main building over there will you show me sure she said she didnt really care she no longer maintained any illusions about her ability to affect the outcome of events she realized that she was in the grip of an inexorable process involving many people and many past decisions what would happen would happen she walked down the corridor with anders and found herself thinking about mrs crail it was odd she hadnt thought of mrs crail in years emily crail had been her first patient as a psychiatric resident years ago the woman was fifty her children grown her husband bored with her she was suicidally depressed janet ross had taken the case with a sense of personal responsibility she was young and eager and she fought mrs crails impulses like a general fighting a war marshaling resources planning strategies revising and updating battle plans she nursed mrs crail through two unsuccessful suicide attempts and then she began to realize that there were limits to her own energy skills and knowledge mrs crail was not improving her suicidal attempts became more crafty eventually she succeeded in killing herself but by that time ross had fortunately detached herself from the patient as she was detached from benson now they had reached the far end of the corridor when behind them from telecomp they heard gerhard shout janet janet are you still here she returned to telecomp with anders following along curiously inside the computer room the console lights were flickering unsteadily look at this gerhard said pointing to one printout console current program terminated program change in program change the main computer is going to a new program gerhard said so what we didnt instruct that whats the new program i dont know gerhard said we didnt instruct any change ross and anders watched the console new program reads as then there was nothing no further letters appeared on the screen anders said what does it mean i dont know gerhard said maybe another timesharing terminal is overriding us but that shouldnt be possible we locked in priority for our terminal for the last twelve hours ours should be the only terminal that can initiate program changes the console flashed up new letters new program reads as machine malfunction all programming terminated terminated terminated terminated terminated terminated terminated terminated terminated what gerhard said he started to punch buttons on the console then quit it isnt accepting any new instructions why not something must be wrong with the main computer in the basement ross looked at anders you better show me that computer he said then as they watched one of the consoles went completely dead all its lights blinked off the tv screen shrank to a single fading white dot a second console went off then a third the teleprinter stopped printing the computer has shut itself down gerhard said it probably had help anders said he went with ross to the elevators it was a damp evening and cold as they hurried across the parking lot toward the main building anders was checking his gun turning it sideways to catch the light from the parkinglot lamps i think you should know one thing she said its no good threatening him with that he wont respond rationally to it anders smiled because hes a machine he just wont respond if he has a seizure he wont see it wont recognize it wont react appropriately to it they entered the hospital through the brightly lit main entrance and walked back to the central elevator banks anders said wheres the atomic pack located beneath the skin of his right shoulder where exactly here she said pointing to her own shoulder tracing a rectangle that size yes about the size of a pack of cigarettes okay anders said they took the elevator to the basement there were two cops in the elevator car and they were both tense fidgety hands touching their guns as they rode down anders nodded to his own gun you ever fire one of these no never at all no he didnt say anything after that the elevator doors opened they felt the coolness of the basement air and looked down the corridor ahead bare concrete walls unpainted overhead pipes running along the ceiling harsh electric lighting they stepped out the doors closed behind them they stood for a moment listening they heard nothing except the distant hum of power equipment anders whispered anybody usually in the basement at night she nodded maintenance people pathologists if theyre still going the pathology labs are down here yes wheres the computer this way she led him down the corridor straight ahead was the laundry room it was locked for the night but huge carts with bundles of laundry were outside in the corridor anders eyed the bundles cautiously before they moved on to the central kitchens the kitchens were shut down too but the lights were on burning in a vast expanse of whitetiled rooms with stainlesssteel steam tables in long rows this is a short cut she said as they went through the kitchen their footsteps echoed on the tiles anders walked loosely holding his gun slightly ahead barrel pointed out to the side they passed through the kitchen and back into another hallway it was almost identical to the one they had left anders glanced at her questioningly she knew he was lost she remembered the months it had taken her to learn her way through the basement turn right she said they passed a sign on the wall employees report all accidents to your supervisor it showed a man with a small cut on his finger further down was another sign need a loan see your credit union they turned right down another corridor and approached a small section containing vending machines hot coffee doughnuts sandwiches candy bars she remembered all the late nights when she had been a resident in the hospital and had come down to the vending machines for a snack the old days when being a doctor seemed like a good and hopeful thing to be great advances would be made during her lifetime it would be exciting she would be a part of it anders peered into the vending area then paused he whispered have a look at this she looked astonished every machine had been smashed there were candy bars and sandwiches wrapped in plastic strewn across the floor coffee was pouring in short arterial spurts from the coffee vender onto the floor anders stepped around the puddles of coffee and soda and touched the dents and tears in the metal of the machines looks like an axe he said where would he get an axe fireextinguisher stations have them i dont see the axe here he said looking around the room then he glanced at her she didnt reply they left the vending area and continued down the corridor they came to a turn in the tunnels which way now left she said and she added were very close ahead of them the hall took another turn ross knew that hospital records was around the turn and just beyond that the computer the planners had located the computer near the records room because they eventually hoped to computerize all the hospital records suddenly anders froze she stopped and listened with him they heard footsteps and humming somebody humming a tune anders put his finger to his lips and gestured to ross to stay where she was he moved forward toward the turn in the corridor the humming was louder he paused at the turn and looked cautiously around the corner ross held her breath hey a male voice shouted and suddenly anderss arm flicked around the corner like a snake and a man sprawled across the floor skidding down the hall toward ross hey a bucket of water sloshed across the floor ross saw that it was an elderly maintenance man she went over to him what the shhh she said a finger to her lips she helped the man back to his feet anders came back dont leave the basement he said to the man go to the kitchen and wait dont try to leave his voice was an angry hiss ross knew what he was saying anyone who tried to leave the basement now was likely to be shot by the waiting cops the man was nodding frightened and confused its all right ross said to him i didnt do nothin theres a man down here we have to find ross said just wait until its over stay in the kitchen anders said the man nodded brushed himself off and walked away he looked back once shaking his head she and anders continued along the corridor turned a corner and came to the records section a large sign sticking out from the wall said patient records anders looked at her questioningly she nodded they went inside records was a giant space filled with floortoceiling shelves of patient records it was like an enormous library anders paused in surprise lot of bookkeeping she said is this every patient the hospital ever had no she said every patient seen in the last five years the others are stored in a warehouse christ they moved down the parallel stacks of shelves quietly anders leading with his gun occasionally he would pause to look through a gap in the shelves to another corridor they saw no one at all anybody on duty here should be she scanned the rows of charts the record room always impressed her as a practicing doctor she had an image of medical practice that involved large numbers of patients she had treated hundreds seen thousands for a single hour or a few weeks yet the hospital records ran into the millions and that was just one hospital in one city in one country millions and millions of patients we have a thing like this too anders said you lose records often all the time he sighed so do we at that moment a young girl no more than fifteen or sixteen came around the corner she carried a stack of records in her arms anders had his gun up in an instant the girl looked dropped the records and started to scream quiet anders hissed the scream was cut off abruptly to a kind of gurgle the girls eyes were wide im a policeman anders said he flicked out his shoulder wallet to show the badge have you seen anyone here anyone this man he showed her the picture she looked at it and shook her head youre sure yes i mean no i mean ross said i think we should go on to the computer in some way she was embarrassed at frightening the girl the hospital hired high school and college students parttime to do the clerical work in records they werent paid much ross herself remembered when she had been frightened at about the same age she had been walking in the woods with a boy they had seen a snake the boy told her it was a rattlesnake and she was terrified much later she learned he had been teasing her the snake was harmless she had resented all right anders said the computer which way ross led the way out anders turned back once to the girl who was picking up the charts she had dropped listen he said if you do see this man dont talk to him dont do anything except shout your bloody head off you understand she nodded and then ross realized that the rattlesnake was real this time it was all real they came out into the corridor again and continued down it toward the computer section the computer section was the only refinished part of the basement the bare concrete floor changed abruptly to blue carpeting one corridor wall had been knocked out to install large glass windows that looked in from the corridor to the room that housed the main banks of the computer ross remembered when the computer was being installed it seemed to her that the windows were an unnecessary expense and she had mentioned it to mcpherson better let the people see whats coming mcpherson had replied what does that mean it means that the computer is just a machine bigger and more expensive than most but still just a machine we want people to get used to it we dont want them to fear or worship it we want them to see it as part of the environment yet every time she passed the computer section she had the opposite feelings the special treatment the hallway carpeting and the expensive surroundings served to make the computer special unusual unique she thought it significant that the only other place in the hospital where the floor was carpeted was outside the small nondenominational chapel on the first floor she had the same sense here a shrine to the computer did the computer care if there were carpets on the floor in any case the employees of the hospital had provided their own reaction to the spectacle inside the glass windows a handwritten sign had been taped to the glass do not feed or molest the computer she and anders crouched down below the level of the window anders peered over cautiously what do you see she said i think i see him she looked too she was aware that her heart was suddenly pounding her body was tense and expectant inside the room there were six magnetic tape units a broad lshaped console for the central processor a printer a cardpunch reader and two disc drive units the equipment was shiny sharpedged gleaming it sat quiet under even fluorescent lighting she saw no one just the equipment isolated alone it reminded her of stonehenge the vertical stone columns then she saw him a man moving between two tape units white orderlys coat black hair its him she said wheres the door anders asked for no good reason he was checking his gun again he snapped the revolver chamber closed with a loud click down there she pointed down the corridor to the door perhaps ten feet away any other entrances or exits no her heart was still pounding she looked from anders to the gun and back to anders okay you stay down anders pressed her down to the floor as he spoke then he crawled forward to the door he paused got to his knees and looked back at her once she was surprised to see that he was frightened his face was taut his body hunched tensely he held the gun stiffly forward by his straight arm were all afraid she thought then with a loud slam anders knocked the door open and flung himself on his belly into the room she heard him shout benson and then almost immediately there was a gunshot this was followed by a second shot and a third she could not tell who was firing she saw anderss feet sticking out of the door as he lay on the carpeting gray smoke billowed out through the open door and rose lazily in the corridor there were two more shots and a loud scream of pain she closed her eyes and pressed her cheek to the carpet anders shouted benson give it up benson it wont do any good she thought didnt anders understand still more shots in rapid succession suddenly the glass window above her shattered and large slabs of glass fell over her shoulders onto her hair she shook it off and then to her astonishment benson landed on the corridor floor beside her he had thrown himself through the glass window and landed quite close to her his body was just a few feet from her she saw that one leg was bloody red seeping onto the white trouser leg harry her voice cracked strangely she was terrified she knew she should not be afraid of this man that was a disservice to him a betrayal of her profession and a loss of some important trust but she was afraid nonetheless benson looked at her eyes blank and unseeing he ran off down the basement corridor harry wait never mind anders said coming out of the computer room sprinting after benson holding his gun stiffly in his hand the policemans posture was absurd she wanted to laugh she heard bensons running footsteps echoing faintly down the tunnel then anders turned a corner continuing after him the footsteps blended in staccato echoes and then she was alone she got to her feet dazed feeling sick she knew what was going to happen now benson like a trapped animal would head for one of the emergency exits as soon as he appeared outside where it was safe to shoot the waiting policemen would gun him down all the exits were covered there was no possible escape she didnt want to be there to see it instead she went into the computer room and looked around the main computer was demolished two magnetic tape banks were knocked over the main control panel was riddled with fine round punctures and sparks sputtered and dripped from the panel toward the floor she ought to control that she thought it might start a fire she looked around for a fire extinguisher and saw bensons axe lying on the carpet in a corner and then she saw the gun curious she picked it up it was surprisingly heavy much heavier than she expected it felt big and greasy and cold in her hand she knew anders had his gun therefore this must be bensons bensons gun she stared at it oddly as if it might tell her something about him from somewhere in the basement there were four gunshots in rapid succession they echoed through the labyrinthine hospital tunnels she walked to the broken windows and looked out at the tunnels she saw nothing heard nothing it must be finished she thought the sputtering hissing sound of sparks behind her made her turn there was also a slapping sound repetitive and monotonous she saw that one of the magnetic tape reels had spun out and the edge of the tape was slapping against the hardware spindle she went back to the reel and turned it off she glanced up at one of the display consoles which was now printing ermina over and over ermina ermina then there were two more gunshots not so distant as the others and she realized that somehow benson was still alive still going she stood in a corner of the demolished computer room and waited another gunshot very close now she ducked down behind one of the magnetic tape banks as she heard approaching footsteps she was aware of the irony benson had been hiding behind the computers and now she was hiding cowering behind the metal columns as if they could protect her in some way she heard someone gasping for breath the footsteps paused the door to the computer room opened then closed with a slam she was still hidden behind the tape bank and could not see what was happening a second set of running feet went past the computer room and continued down the corridor fading into echoes everything was quiet then she heard heavy breathing and a cough she stood harry benson in his torn white orderlys clothes his left leg very red was sprawled on the carpet his body halfpropped up against the wall he was sweating his breath came in ragged gasps he stared straight ahead unaware of anyone else in the room she still held the gun in her hand and she felt a moment of elation somehow it was all going to work out she was going to get him back alive the police hadnt killed him and by the most unbelievable stroke of luck she had him alone to herself it made her wonderfully happy harry he looked over slowly and blinked he did not seem to recognize her for a moment and then he smiled hello dr ross it was a nice smile she had the brief image of mcpherson with his white hair bending over to congratulate her on saving the project and getting benson back alive and then she remembered quite incongruously how her own father had gotten sick and had suddenly had to leave her medicalschool graduation ceremonies why did she think of that now everything is going to be all right harry she said her voice was full of confidence it pleased her she wanted to reassure him so she did not move did not approach him she stayed across the room behind the computer data bank he continued to breathe heavily and said nothing for a moment he looked around the room at the demolished computer equipment i really did it he said didnt i youre going to be fine harry she said she was drawing up a schedule in her mind he could undergo emergency surgery on his leg that night and in the morning they could disconnect his computer reprogram the electrodes and everything would be corrected a disaster would be salvaged it was the most incredible piece of luck ellis would keep his house mcpherson would continue to expand the nps into new areas they would be grateful they would recognize her achievement and appreciate what she dr ross he started to get up wincing in pain dont try to move stay where you are harry i have to stay where you are harry bensons eyes flashed briefly and the smile was gone dont call me harry my name is mr benson call me mr benson there was no mistaking the anger in his voice it surprised her and upset her she was trying to help him didnt he know that she was the only one who still wanted to help him the others would be just as happy if he died he continued to struggle to his feet dont move harry she showed him the gun then it was an angry hostile move he had angered her she knew she shouldnt get angry at him but she had he grinned in childish recognition thats my gun i have it now she said he still grinned a fixed expression partly from pain he got to his feet and leaned heavily against the wall there was a dark red stain on the carpet where his leg had rested he looked down and saw it im hurt he said dont move youll be all right he shot me in the leg he looked from the blood up to her his smile remained you wouldnt use that would you yes she said if i had to youre my doctor stay where you are harry i dont think you would use it benson said he took a step toward her dont come closer harry he smiled he took another step unsteady but he maintained his balance i dont think you would his words frightened her she was afraid that she would shoot him and afraid that she would not it was the strangest set of circumstances alone with this man surrounded by the wreckage of a computer anders she shouted anders her voice echoed through the basement benson took another step his eyes never left her face he started to fall and leaned heavily on one of the disc drive consoles it tore his white jacket at the armpit he looked at the tear numbly it tore stay there harry stay there its like talking to an animal she thought do not feed or molest the animals she felt like a lion tamer in the circus he hung there a moment supporting himself on the drive console breathing heavily i want the gun he said i need it give it to me harry with a grunt he pushed away from the console and continued moving toward her anders its no good benson said theres no time left dr ross his eyes were on her she saw the pupils expand briefly as he received a stimulation thats beautiful he said and smiled the stimulation seemed to halt him for a time he was turned inward enjoying the sensation when he spoke again his voice was calm and distant you see he said they are after me they have turned their little computers against me the program is hunt hunt and kill the original human program hunt and kill do you understand he was only a few steps away she held the gun in her hand stiffly as she had seen anders hold it but her hand was shaking badly please dont come closer harry she said please he smiled he took another step she didnt really know what she was going to do until she found herself squeezing the trigger and the gun discharged the noise was painfully loud and the gun snapped in her hand flinging her arm up almost knocking her off her feet she was thrown back against the far wall of the computer room benson stood blinking in the smoke then he smiled again its not as easy as it looks she gripped the gun in her hand it felt warm now she raised it but it was shaking worse than before she steadied it with the other hand benson advanced no closer harry i mean it a flood of images overcame her she saw benson as she had first met him a meek man with a terrifying problem she saw him in a montage of all the hourlong interviews all the tests all the drug trials he was a good person an honest and frightened person nothing that had happened was his fault it was her fault and elliss fault and mcphersons fault and morriss fault then she thought of morris the face mashed into a red pulp deformed into butcher meat dr ross benson said youre my doctor you wouldnt do anything to hurt me he was very close now his hands reached out for the gun her whole body was shaking as she watched the hands move closer within inches of the barrel reaching for it reaching for it she fired at pointblank range with remarkable agility benson jumped and spun in the air dodging the bullet she was pleased she had managed to drive him back without hurting him anders would arrive any minute to help subdue him before they took him to surgery bensons body slammed hard into the printing unit knocking it over it began to clatter in a monotonous mechanical way as the keys printed out some message benson rolled onto his back blood spurted in heavy thick gushes from his chest his white uniform became darkly red harry she said he did not move harry harry she didnt remember clearly what happened after that anders returned and took the gun from her hand he moved her to the side of the room as three men in gray suits arrived carrying a long plastic capsule on a stretcher they opened the capsule up the inside was lined in a strange yellow honeycomb insulation they lifted bensons body she noticed they were careful trying to keep the blood off their special suits and placed him inside the capsule they closed it and locked it with special locks two of the men carried it away a third went around the room with a geiger counter which chattered loudly somehow the sound reminded her of an angry monkey the man went over to ross she couldnt see his face behind the gray helmet he wore the glass was fogged you better leave this area the man said anders put his arm around her shoulders she began to cry postscript a note on psychomotor epilepsy since the publication of this book in its hardcover edition several neurologists have advised me that the syndrome of psychomotor epilepsy is incorrectly portrayed in significant ways these professionals emphasize that psychomotor epileptics are no more prone to criminal behavior than other individuals in society they also agree that a psychomotor epileptic in the midst of a seizure is unlikely to injure anyone except by accident they regard complex purposeful aggressive behavior in the course of a seizure to be either extremely rare or nonexistent when pressed to explain the welldocumented incidents of assault by psychomotor epileptics these neurologists argue that such assaultative behavior even when repetitive sudden and inappropriate is not actual seizure activity some refer to it as epileptiform behavior others say that epilepsy per se is not the issue they argue that any kind of brain damage whether it produces epilepsy or not may lead to episodic loss of inhibitions governing violent behavior whether or not one finds these explanations satisfactory it seems unarguable that most neurologists who treat psychomotor epileptics as patients have found their patients to be very different from harry benson in the terminal man the overwhelming majority of psychomotor epileptics are not violent or sexually disturbed their seizures are under good control and they lead rich and rewarding lives holding good jobs and raising families in the face of considerable controversy among clinical neuroscientists i am persuaded that the understanding of the relationship between organic brain damage and violent behavior is not so clear as i thought at the time i wrote the book i believe that this is a research area that will prove enormously fruitful in the coming years but in the meantime i am concerned that i may have inadvertently hampered the attempts of wellcontrolled epileptics to function in a society that still retains a lingering prejudice against epilepsy michael crichton los angeles december
