andy grants pluck chapter i the telegram a telegram for you andy said arthur bacon as he entered the room of andy grant in penhurst academy a telegram repeated andy in vague alarm for the word suggested something urgent probably bad news of some kind he tore open the envelope and read the few words of the message come home at once something has happened mother what can it be thought andy perplexed at any rate mother is well for she sent the telegram what is it asked arthur i dont know you can read the telegram for yourself must you go home asked arthur in a tone of regret yes when is there a train at three this afternoon i will take it i must go and see dr crabb but wont you come back again i dont know i am all in the dark i think something must have happened to my father dr crabb was at his desk in his library it was saturday afternoon and school was not in session when andy knocked at the door come in said the doctor in a deep voice andy opened the door and entered dr crabb smiled for andy was his favorite pupil come in grant he said what can i do for you give me permission to go home i have just had a telegram i will show it to you the doctor was a man of fiftyfive with a high forehead and an intellectual face he wore glasses and had done so for ten years they gave him the appearance of a learned scholar as he was dear me he said how unfortunate only two weeks to the end of the term and you are our primus i am very sorry sir but perhaps i may be able to come back do so by all means if you can there is hardly a pupil i could not better spare thank you sir said andy gratefully there is a train at three oclock i would like to take it by all means and let me hear from you even if you cant come back i will certainly write doctor thank you for all your kindness penhurst academy was an endowed school on account of the endowments the annual rate to boarding scholars was very reasonable only three hundred dollars including everything the academy had a fine reputation which it owed in large part to the high character and gifts of dr crabb who had been the principal for twentyfive years he had connected himself with the school soon after he left dartmouth and had been identified with it for the greater part of his active life andy had been a pupil for over two years and was an excellent latin and greek scholar in a few months he would be ready for college dr crabb was anxious to have him go to dartmouth his own alma mater being convinced that he would do him credit and make a brilliant record for scholarship indeed it was settled that he would go his parents being ready to be guided by the doctors advice from penhurst to arden where andys parents lived was fifty miles starting at three oclock the train reached arden station at five as andy stepped on the platform he saw roland hunter the son of a neighbor how are you andy said roland with a cheerful greeting how do you happen to be coming home is it vacation no i was summoned home by a telegram is are they all well at home yes so far as i know andy breathed a sigh of relief i am glad of that he said i was afraid some one in the family might be sick i dont think so i would have heard living so near father is well then come to think of it i heard he had a bad headache at any rate it isnt anything serious are you going home if you are ill walk along with you we can do better than that ive got uncles buggy on the other side of the depot ill take you bag and baggage thank you roland my bag is rather heavy and as it is a mile to the house i shall be glad to accept your offer bundle in then said roland merrily i dont know but i ought to charge you a quarter thats the regular fare by stage all right charge it if you like rejoined andy smiling are your folks all well oh yes especially lily you and she are great friends i believe oh yes answered andy with a smile she thinks a good deal more of you than she does of me girls dont generally appreciate their brothers i believe if i had a sister i presume she would like you better than me roland dropped andy at his fathers gate it may be said here that mr grant owned a farm of fifty acres that yielded him a comfortable living when supplemented by the interest on three thousand dollars invested in government bonds on the farm was a house of moderate size which had always been a pleasant home to andy and his little brother robert generally called robbie andy opened the gate and walked up to the front door valise in hand the house and everything about it seemed just as it did when he left at the beginning of the school term but andy looked at them with different eyes then he had been in good spirits eager to return to his school work now something had happened he did not yet know what mrs grant was in the back part of the house and andy was in the sitting room before she was fully aware of his presence then she came in from the kitchen where she was preparing supper her face seemed careworn but there was a smile upon it as she greeted her son then you got my telegram she said i didnt think you would be here so soon i started at once mother for i felt anxious what has happened are you all well yes thank god we are in fair health but we have met with misfortune what is it nathan lawrence cashier of the bank in benton has disappeared with twenty thousand dollars of the banks money what has that to do with father he hasnt much money in that bank your father is on mr lawrences bond to the amount of six thousand dollars i see answered andy gravely how much will he lose the whole of it this then was what had happened to a man in moderate circumstances it must needs be a heavy blow i suppose it will make a great difference said andy inquiringly you can judge your fathers property consists of this farm and three thousand dollars in government bonds it will be necessary to sacrifice the bonds and place a mortgage of three thousand dollars on the farm how much is the farm worth not over six thousand dollars then fathers property is nearly all swept away yes said his mother sadly hereafter he will receive no help from outside interest and will besides have to pay interest on a mortgage of three thousand dollars at six per cent one hundred and eighty dollars yes altogether then it will diminish our income by rather more than three hundred dollars yes andy that is about what my education has been costing father said andy in a low voice he began to see how this misfortune was going to affect him i am afraid faltered mrs grant that you will have to leave school of course i must said andy speaking with a cheerfulness which he did not feel and in place of going to college i must see how i can help father bear this burden it will be very hard upon you andy said his mother in a tone of sympathy i shall be sorry of course mother but there are plenty of boys who dont go to college i shall be no worse off than they i am glad you bear the disappointment so well andy it is of you your father and i have thought chiefly since the blow fell upon us who will advance father the money on mortgage mother squire carter has expressed a willingness to do so he will be here this evening to talk it over i am sorry for that mother he is a hard man if there is a chance to take advantage of father he wont hesitate to do it chapter ii squire carter when mr grant entered the room he seemed to andy to have grown five years older his face was sad and he had lost the brisk cheerful manner which was habitual to him has your mother told you he asked yes father then he added with indignation what a wicked man mr lawrence must be i suppose he was tempted said mr grant slowly here is a note i received from him this morning andy took the envelope from his fathers hand and opening it read the following lines old friend perhaps by the time you receive this letter you will have heard of the wrong i have done you and yours and the loss i have brought upon you it is to me a source of the greatest sorrow for i fear you will never recover from it i am just ready to go away i cannot stay here to receive punishment for it would tie my hands and prevent my making reparation as i hope some day to do why did i go wrong i cant explain except that it was infatuation in a moment of madness i took some of the funds of the bank and risked them in wall street i lost and went in deeper hoping to be more fortunate and replace the stolen money that is the way such things usually happen i can say no more except that it will be my earnest effort to give you back the money you will lose by me it may take years but i hope we both shall live long enough for me to do it nathan lawrence andy read this letter in silence and gave it back to his father do you believe he is sincere he asked yes he has many good points and i believe he really feels attached to me he has taken a strange way to show it he was weak and yielded to temptation there are many like him do you believe he will ever be able to make up the loss i dont know he is a man of fine business talent and may be able in time to do something but his defalcation amounts to twenty thousand dollars we must try to make the best of it father you have been spending three hundred dollars a year for me besides the expense of my clothes if that is saved it will make up your loss of income but my dear boy i dont like to sacrifice your prospects it wont be sacrificing them said andy with forced cheerfulness it will only change them of course i must give up the thought of a college education but i may make a success in business it will be very hard upon you said mr grant sadly no father i wont deny that i shall be sorry just at first but it may turn out better for me in the end you are a good boy to take it so well andy i had no right to risk so much even for a friend like lawrence you have known mr lawrence for many years have you not father yes we were schoolboys together i thought him the soul of honor but i ought not to have risked threequarters of my estate even for him you cant be blamed father you had full confidence in him yes i had full confidence in him sighed mr grant and he may yet be able to make up the loss to you though andy said this he only said it to mitigate his fathers regret for he had very little confidence in the missing cashier or his promises he was repaid by seeing his father brighten up you have cheered me andy he said i dont care so much for myself but i have been thinking of you and your mother and we have been thinking of you father said mrs grant it might be worse i dont see very well how that could be we are in good health thank god and your reputation is unblemished compare your position with that of nathan lawrence forced to flee in disgrace under a load of shame you are right wife he is more to be pitied than i am is he a married man father no that is he is a widower while we are spared to each other we must trust in god and hope for the best mother tells me you expect to get part of the money you need from squire carter said andy yes he has promised to take a mortgage of three thousand dollars on the old place i have heard he is a hard man father i dont think he is influenced by kindness i cant afford to inquire into his motives it is enough that he will furnish the money but for that i might have to sell the farm and then we should be quite helpless about seven oclock squire carter made his appearance andy opened the door for him he was a tall floridfaced man with an air of consequence based upon his knowledge that he was the richest man in the town goodevening andrew he said for he was always formal so you are home from school yes sir when did you come this afternoon sir i suppose you heard of your fathers misfortune yes sir ha it is very sad very sad indeed i quite feel for your father i am trying to help him out of his trouble he was a very foolish man to risk so much on that rascal lawrence andy was disposed to agree with the squire but he did not like to hear his father blamed i think he realizes that he was unwise squire carter said andy wont you walk in i suppose your father is at home said the squire as he stepped into the front entry yes sir he was expecting you andy opened the door of the sitting room and the squire entered mr grant rose from the rockingchair in which he was seated and welcomed his visitor i am glad to see you squire he said take a seat by the fire thank you said the squire with dignity i came as i said i would i do not desert an old neighbor because he has been unfortunate but for his patronizing tone his words would have awakened more gratitude as it was his manner seemed to say see how kindhearted i am somehow andy felt more and more sorry to think his father must be indebted to such a man it is getting quite fallish said the squire rubbing his hands i suppose i am more sensitive to cold as my home is heated throughout with steam i hope we shall be able to make you comfortable squire carter returned mrs grant who had entered the room in time to hear this last speech oh yes mrs grant i always adapt myself to circumstances that is very kind in you andy was tempted to say but he forbore it would not do to offend the village magnate i see you have sent for andrew observed the squire with a wave of his hand toward the boy yes i shall not be able to keep him at penhurst academy any longer very sensible decision of yours no doubt it cost you a pretty penny to keep him there the school charge is three hundred dollars a year bless my soul how extravagant you will excuse my saying so but i think you have been very unwise it really seems like a wasteful use of money dont you believe in education squire asked mrs grant yes but why couldnt he get all the education he needs here because there is no one here who teaches latin and greek and what good would latin and greek do him i dont know anything of latin and greek and yet i flatter myself i have succeeded pretty well i believe i am looked up to in the village eh no doubt you occupy a prominent position squire but the boy had a fancy for the languages and wanted to go to college i shall not send my son to college though of course i can afford it perhaps he doesnt care to go no the boy is sensible he will be satisfied with the advantages his father enjoyed supposing your boy had gone to college what would you have made of him he thought he would have liked to prepare himself for a teacher or professor its a poor business neighbor grant a schoolmate of mine became a teacher the teacher of an academy and i give you my word hes as poor as poverty money isnt everything squire its a good deal as in your present circumstances you must admit but we may as well come to business chapter iii andy leaves the academy you need to raise three thousand dollars i believe neighbor grant began the squire yes squire three thousand dollars is a good deal of money i realize that said mr grant sadly i was about to say it is a good deal to raise on the security of the farm the farm cost me six thousand dollars it would fetch only five thousand now it wouldnt fetch that at a forced sale but for my losses i wouldnt consider an offer of less than six thousand of course you are attached to it and that gives it a fancy value in your eyes it is good land and productive then it is well situated and the buildings are good well tolerable said the squire cautiously however thats neither here nor there you want three thousand dollars and i have agreed to let you have it i will take a mortgage for two years the interest being as usual six per cent two years repeated farmer grant uneasily yes i am not sure that i can spare the money longer than two years i give you that time to pay it off but it will be impossible for me to pay it off in two years in fact it will take all my income to live and pay the interest of course that isnt my lookout do you mean that you will foreclose in two years not necessarily i may not need the money so soon besides you may find some one else to take it off my hands cant you say five years squire pleaded the farmer squire carter shook his head no you can take it or leave it i am not at all anxious to take the mortgage and if my terms are not agreeable we will consider the negotiations at an end i wont make any difficulty squire i accept your terms that is sensible i cant for my part see how five years would have been more favorable to you than two my son andrew is sixteen by the time he is twentyone he might help me theres not much chance of that unless he marries a fortune said the squire jocosely i suppose you will keep him at home to help you on the farm we havent talked the matter over yet i will consult his wishes as far as i can he cant earn much money on the farm what are you going to do with your son conrad will probably be a merchant or a banker said the squire pompously with your means you can select any path in life for him true as my son he will have a great advantage well as our business is arranged i will leave you if you will call at lawyer towers office tomorrow at noon the papers can be drawn up and i will give you a check for the money thank you squire i will meet the appointment if you dont want andrew to work on the farm i will turn over his case in my mind and see if i can get him a position thank you i should be glad to have him well started in some business where he can raise himself as the term of the academy was so nearly completed andy went back with his fathers permission to remain till vacation he sought an interview at once with dr crabb the principal and informed him of the necessity he was under of leaving the institution i am really sorry andrew said the doctor you are one of my best pupils i am not sure but the best there is scarcely one that i would not sooner lose i shall be willing to take you for half price that is for one hundred and fifty dollars till you are ready for college thank you dr crabb replied andy gratefully you are very kind but even that sum my father in his changed circumstances would be unable to pay besides it would be quite out of my power to go to college even if i were prepared it is a thousand pities said the principal with concern if you must leave you must i am not sure but i should be willing to take you gratuitously thank you but i feel that i ought to go to work at once to help my father it is not enough that i free him from expense no doubt you are right i respect you for your determination you need not hesitate to apply to me at any time in the future if you see any way in which i can be of service to you i think it will help me if you will give me a letter of recommendation which i can show to any one from whom i seek employment i will give you such a letter with great pleasure and the doctor sitting down at his desk wrote a firstclass recommendation of his favorite pupil there was general regret in the academy when it was learned that andy must leave them one little boy of twelve dudley cameron a special favorite of andy came to him to ask if there was no way by which he could manage to stay no dudley i am too poor said andy if i write to papa and ask him to send you a thousand dollars will you stay asked the little boy earnestly no dudley you mustnt do anything of the kind even if your father liked me as well as you do and would give me the money i could not take it i must go to work to help my father you will write to me sometimes andy yes i will be sure to do that the little fellows warmhearted offer and the expressions of sympathy and regret on the part of his schoolmates cheered andy it was pleasant to think that he would be missed on the closing day he received the first prize for scholarship from the hands of dr crabb you will take my best wishes with you andy said the venerable principal let me hear from you when you have made any business arrangement the farewells were said and andy set out on his return home he was leaving the old life behind him a new one lay before him but what it was to be he could not foresee he reached arden in due course and set out to walk home he had barely started when he heard his name called looking around he saw conrad carter the squires only son on his bicycle so youve come home from the academy said conrad curiously yes answered andy briefly he never could bring himself to like conrad who made himself offensive and unpopular by his airs of superiority indeed there was no boy in arden so thoroughly disliked as conrad youll have a pretty long vacation went on conrad with a significant laugh yes i suppose so oh well its the best thing for you i thought it foolish when your father sent you off to the academy if the arden grammar school is good enough for me it is good enough for you there is nothing to prevent your going to the academy i know that my father could afford it even if it cost a good deal more you wanted to go to college didnt you yes it was very foolish for a poor boy like you of course your age and experience make your opinion of value said andy with a sarcasm which he did not care to conceal i advise you not to be too independent returned conrad displeased are you going to work on the farm i may till i get a situation ill speak to father he might take you for an errand boy i dont think that place would suit me why not i want to go into some mercantile establishment and learn business thats what i am going to do when i get through school of course there is no hurry in my case i suppose not i suppose you know that my father has taken a mortgage on your fathers farm yes i know that if your father cant pay the mortgage when it is due father will have to take the farm andy made no answer but thought conrad more disagreeable than ever by way of changing the conversation he said thats a new bicycle isnt it yes i got tired of the old one this is a very expensive one wouldnt you like to own a bicycle yes of course you never will then i must be content without one well i must leave you ill come around soon and see you ride a horse to plow as conrad sped away on his wheel andy said to himself i shouldnt like to be rich if it made me as disagreeable as conrad chapter iv preparing for the picnic the change in his fathers circumstances had come so suddenly that andy could not immediately decide upon a plan of securing employment he was not idle however there was work to do on the farm and he took off his uniform for penhurst academy was a military school and donned instead a rough farm suit in which he assisted his father if he felt a pang of regret he did not show it for he did not wish to add to his fathers grief over his imprudent act of friendship it was while he was at work hoeing corn that conrad carter came up one day and leaning against the fence looked at andy with an amused expression oho youve turned farmer in earnest he said yes for the time being answered andy composedly you look fine in your overalls do you think so thank you for the compliment you might as well keep on you will probably succeed better as a farmer than in business i mean to succeed in anything i undertake youve got a comfortable opinion of yourself while you on the contrary are modest and unassuming what do you mean asked conrad coloring i meant to compliment you but if you dont like it i will take it back suppose i say that you are neither modest nor unassuming if that is the way you are going to talk to me i will go away said conrad haughtily it is a little imprudent considering considering what that my father can turn you all out at the end of two years if that is the way you are going to talk to me i shall be glad to have you go away as you just threatened pride and poverty dont go together very well said conrad provoked i dont want to be either proud or poor returned andy smiling that fellow provokes me thought conrad however hell repent it some time in five minutes his place was taken by valentine burns an intimate friend of andys his father kept the village store and was one of the leading citizens of arden hard at work i see andy he said dont you want to help me no im too lazy i have to work in the store out of school hours you know are you going to the picnic what picnic theres a sundayschool picnic next thursday afternoon both churches unite in it all the young people will be there you would have heard of it if you hadnt been absent at school i will certainly go there are so few amusements in arden that i cant afford to miss any i suppose there will be the usual attractions yes and an extra one besides theres a gentleman from the city staying at the hotel who has offered a prize of ten dollars to the boy who will row across the pond in the shortest time the distance is about half a mile isnt it yes a little more i suppose you will go in for the prize val you have a nice boat to practice in no amount of practice would give me the prize i dont excel as a rower who is expected to win conrad carter confidently counts on securing the prize there is no boy in arden that can compete with him except well except whom andy grant i dont know said andy thoughtfully i can row pretty well that is i used to but i am out of practice why dont you get back your practice i have no boat then use mine said valentine promptly you are very kind val how many days are there before the picnic five in five days you can accomplish a great deal i should like to win the ten dollars i want to go to the city and look for a place and i dont want to ask father for the money ten dollars would carry you there nicely and give you a day or two to look around true well val i will accept your kind offer is conrad practicing yes he is out every afternoon i cant go till after supper then begin this evening you know where i keep my boat i will be at the boathouse at halfpast six and you can meet me there all right you are a good friend val i try to be but it isnt all friendship what else then i want conrad defeated he is insufferable now and if he wins the prize he will be worse than ever prospect pond was a little distance out of the village it was a beautiful sheet of water and a favorite resort for picnic parties conrad carter valentine burns and two or three other boys and young men had boats there and a man named serwin kept boats to hire but the best boats belonged to valentine and conrad it was rather annoying to conrad that any one should have a boat as good as his own but this was something he could not help he consoled himself however by reflecting that he was a better oarsman than valentine he had been out practicing during the afternoon accompanied by john larkin a neighbors son john stood on the bank and timed him well john how do i row he asked when he returned from his trial trip you did very well said john there wont be any one else that can row against me eh i dont think of any one valentine has as good a boat i dont admit that said conrad jealously i would just as soon have his as yours said john independently but he cant row with you i should think not jimmy morris is a pretty good rower but he has no boat of his own and would have to row in one of serwins boats you know what they are he couldnt come up to me no matter in what boat he rowed said conrad well perhaps not i dont know well you ought to know john larkin my opinions my own conrad said john manfully all the same you are mistaken if valentine would lend his boat to jimmy we could tell better he wont do it he will want it himself said conrad as matters stand now i think you will win the prize i think so myself it may be thought surprising that nothing was said of andy grant and his chances but in truth his boy friends in arden had never seen him row during the last two years as a matter of fact he had been the champion oarsman of penhurst academy but this they did not know during his vacations at home he had done very little rowing his time being taken up in other ways i wonder whether andy grant can row said john larkin conrad laughed he can hoe corn and potatoes better than he can row i fancy he said hes a firstrate fellow said larkin warmly hes poor and proud thats what he is i called at the farm this morning and he insulted me are you sure it wasnt the other way look here john larkin if you dont treat me with more respect i wont associate with you do as you like said john independently id just as soon associate with valentine or andy my father can buy out both their fathers that dont make you any the better fellow why are you so anxious to win this prize is it the money you are after no if i want ten dollars my father will give it to me it isnt the money but the glory that i think of if i had your practice id go in for it myself i shouldnt mind pocketing ten dollars no doubt it would be welcome to you let me try your boat for a few minutes you can have it for ten minutes i would like it long enough to row over the course you can have it that long im going over it again myself as soon as i have got rested from the last trial john larkin got into the boat and rowed very creditably but was soon called in by the owner of the craft john began to ask himself what benefit he got from associating with conrad who showed his selfishness on all occasions i wish he would get beaten after all thought john but i dont know who there is to do it valentine is only a passable rower and jimmy morris has no boat of his own conrad came back in good spirits he had beaten his former record by threequarters of a minute im sure of the prize he said in exultation chapter v the boat race as andy rowed only in the evening and conrad practiced in the afternoon it chanced that the coming rivals never met nor was conrad aware that andy proposed to dispute the prize with him even at first valentine was surprised and pleased to observe how andy handled the oars before the evening was over he demonstrated the fact that he was a firstclass oarsman much to the satisfaction of his friend you must have had a good deal of practice at the gymnasium said valentine yes the director of the gymnasium who is an allaround athlete gave the boys special instruction by which we all profited he was a graduate of harvard and an old member of the university crew that accounts for it your rowing has a style to it that conrad cannot show probably he has never had any instructions whatever he has accomplished has come by practice he pulls a strong oar but there is a roughness and lack of smoothness about his work still he gets over the water pretty fast and that counts how does his speed compare with mine as you rowed tonight i think the race would be a close one but this is only the first evening keep on practicing daily and i will bet on you every time andy looked pleased i am glad to hear you say this he said i shall not row for glory but for the ten dollars which i shall find very useful you have a fine boat val how does conrads compare with yours i should hardly know how to choose between them his boat is a fine one but mine is quite as good and i suppose there is no other on the pond as fine no serwins boats are old style and have been in use for years if you rowed in one of those against conrad you would be sure to be beaten then if i win i shall be indebted to you for the victory valentine smiled i should be glad to think i had anything to do with gaining the prize for you even indirectly but it will be due in a large measure to your own good rowing only keep up your practicing i will do so i want you to win and besides i want conrad to lose i hope he wont hear anything of your entering the race two days before the picnic valentine happened to meet conrad at his fathers store are you going to enter the boat race at the picnic asked the latter i am not certain you have the only boat that can compare with mine have you been practicing any i have been rowing a little i shall have to look out said conrad but his manner did not indicate apprehension probably the prize will go either to you or me thank you for the compliment suppose we have a little trial by ourselves it may do us both good i dont mind when shall it be say tomorrow afternoon very well i will be at the pond at four oclock all right the two boys met according to agreement and the race took place conrad beat easily by eight lengths although valentine exerted himself to the best of his ability that settles it said conrad triumphantly you cant row against me i am afraid you are right returned valentine with an air of chagrin you will need more practice though you row fairly well i think you pull the best oar next to me said conrad in a patronizing tone yes i see that i must practice more there will be no need for me to practice said conrad to himself ive got a dead sure thing it might have been supposed that conrad would be indifferent to the money value of the prize offered but he had extravagant tastes and found his allowance from his father though a liberal one insufficient for his needs he began to consider in what way he would spend the money which he considered as good as won at length the day for the picnic dawned the day previous had been unpleasant and there had been considerable anxiety lest the weather should prove unpleasant but greatly to the general satisfaction it was bright with sunshine and the temperature was delightful the young people of both societies turned out en masse and looked forward to a good time the race had been fixed for halfpast three oclock at that hour the superintendent of the sunday school came forward and said owing to the liberality of mr gale of new york a boarder at the hotel a prize of ten dollars has been offered to the best oarsman who may compete for it boats will start from the pier and the course will be to the opposite bank of the pond and back i am sure that this will prove a very attractive feature of our picnic boys who intend to compete will now present themselves the first to come forward was conrad carter he was dressed in a handsome boating costume and his manner indicated great confidence he looked around for valentine but the latter made no motion toward the shore though his boat was in the pond drawn up with the rest arent you going to row valentine asked conrad in surprise no i have lent my boat to andy grant at the same time andy in his ordinary attire came forward and stepped into valentines boat conrad arched his brows in surprise he had been disappointed to find that valentine would not row but he was quite as well pleased at the prospect of beating andy he was rather surprised however as he had never heard that andy could row he must be a fool to think of rowing against me he said to himself next came jimmy morris who took his place in one of serwins boats two other boys also appeared in hired boats one of them being dennis carlyle a friend of john larkin when the boats were in line a superintendent gave the signal conrad got the first start the others kept together a length or two behind conrad andy did not appear to be exerting himself but his strokes showed a smoothness that was lacking in any of the rest mr gale the donor of the prize who was himself a good rower took notice of him who is that boy he asked pointing to andy i dont think i have seen him before it is andy grant the son of farmer grant why havent i seen him before he has been absent at school at penhurst academy he knows how to row see how he handles his oars i didnt know he was a rower he is and a good one i shouldnt be surprised if he wins the race what against conrad carter asked the superintendent incredulously yes it is easy to see that he has been trained while conrad though he pulls a strong oar rows like a country amateur conrad was so intent upon his own work that he had not had an opportunity of watching his competitors when he had nearly reached the point selected on the other bank he turned about and saw andy close behind him andy was not apparently exerting himself but pulled a strong steady stroke and seemed quite free from excitement for the first time conrad saw that he was a competitor not to be despised after the turn conrad and andy led the procession next came jimmy morris and last of all dennis carlyle the latter managed to catch a crab and in his attempt to right himself tumbled into the water dont mind me he called out humorously i am only taking a bath so the other contestants kept on in the same order but this was not to continue suddenly andy made a spurt and forged ahead of conrad the young aristocrat could hardly believe his eyes when he saw valentines boat impelled by a competitor whom he had despised take the leading place he flushed with vexation and made a desperate effort to regain his lost position but he was excited and did not use his strength to the best advantage to his great annoyance he saw that andy was continuing to gain upon him and that without any great effort his smooth steady stroke was most effective even the unpracticed eye could see his superiority to any of his competitors when the goal was reached he was five lengths ahead of conrad and twelve lengths ahead of jimmy morris it was a genuine surprise to the spectators and a great shout went up three cheers for andy grant andy smiled and he raised his hat in acknowledgment of the compliment mr gale pressed forward and greeted the young victor you have done yourself credit he said you know how to row where did you learn at penhurst academy i was trained by a harvard oarsman he understood his business and so do you i have great pleasure in presenting you with the prize with a sullen look conrad listened to those words without a word he sprang on shore and as soon as he could turned his back upon the picnic conrad is terribly disappointed said valentine you have made yourself famous andy chapter vi a liberal offer thoroughly mortified and crestfallen conrad went home he hoped to go up to his room without observation but his father noticed his entrance well conrad he said with a smile did you carry off the honors at the picnic no i didnt answered conrad bitterly did valentine burns defeat you no who did win the prize andy grant squire carter was amazed can he row he ejaculated yes a little but he beat you i tell you how it was father said conrad who had decided upon his story i was well ahead till we got halfway back when i got a terrible pain in my arm i must have strained it i think of course i couldnt do anything after that and andy who was next to me went in and won squire carter never thought of doubting conrads story his pride extended to his family and all connected with him and he felt satisfied that conrad was the best rower in the village where did the grant boy learn to row he asked i heard him tell mr gale that he learned at the academy you dont think he is equal to you of course he isnt i am miles ahead of him it was very unfortunate that your arm gave out you had better speak to your mother and she will put some arnica on it i will said conrad cunningly i would rather have had any boy beat me than that upstart andy grant he will put on no end of airs besides i shall miss the money that at any rate i can make up to you here are two fivedollar bills thank you father said conrad as with much satisfaction he pocketed the bills it was lucky i thought about the strain he said to himself all the same it is awfully humiliating to be beaten by that beggar how do you think conrad accounts for his defeat andy said valentine the next day i cant tell he says he strained the muscles of his arm andy smiled if it will make him feel any better i have no objection to that explanation his father has given him ten dollars so he will not lose any money but he wont get any of the boys to believe his story the money is very acceptable to me said andy if i had lost my father couldnt have made it up to me at five oclock on his way to the post office andy met mr gale walter gale was a young man about twentyfive he had a pleasant face and his manner was genial he had a strong sympathy with boys and he was a favorite with them well andrew he said have you recovered from your exertions in the boat race oh yes i am used to rowing and felt very little fatigue i hear that conrad is very much mortified by his defeat i believe he is he felt sure of winning and he would have done so if you had remained out of the list he told valentine burns that he strained the muscles of his arm and that this defeated him i should think better of him if he would acknowledge that he was fairly beaten are you at leisure this evening yes sir then call upon me at the hotel i shall be glad to know you better this invitation andy was very glad to accept he was drawn to the young man and felt that he was likely to prove a sincere friend at seven oclock he left the farmhouse and on arriving at the hotel found mr gale sitting on the piazza i was looking for you said the young man come up to my room he led the way to a front corner apartment on the second floor it was the best room in the hotel and he had furnished it in the most comfortable and attractive manner pictures hung on the walls and there was a bookcase containing a goodly array of volumes what a pleasant room exclaimed andy yes i have tried to make myself comfortable what i lack most is society i wonder that you are content to live in the country are you not accustomed to the city yes but i had a severe sickness in the spring and the doctors recommended me to absent myself for a time from the excitement of the town and take up my residence in the country didnt that interfere with your business walter gale smiled fortunately or unfortunately he answered i have no business until two years since i was employed in an insurance office in the city the death of an uncle has made me pecuniarily independent so that i had leisure to be sick you look in good health now yes but i have a nervous temperament and am obliged to be careful now tell me about yourself you have been for some time at penhurst academy yes for two years do you go back there no my father has met with serious losses and can no longer afford to send me i must stay at home and help him and this is a disappointment to you yes i was expecting to go to college in a few months i believe your father is a farmer yes do you expect to assist him on the farm till i can get something to do i shall try to get some business situation business pays better than farming i suppose you are a good latin and greek scholar yes that is i like the languages and stood high in my classes my own education is limited though i am rich now i was a poor boy at sixteen i had made some progress in latin and commenced greek when my fathers failure obliged me to seek employment the uncle who has now made me rich would do nothing for me so i left school half educated you would be able to make up deficiencies now suggested andy that is what i have been thinking of if i can get a satisfactory teacher i dont think you can find a classical teacher in arden i know of one if he would be willing to undertake the task who is it asked andy puzzled andrew grant answered this young man with a smile do you mean me asked andy with a wondering face certainly you are fresh from school and i am sure you would be competent to teach me but i am only a boy age has nothing to do with a teachers qualifications except as to discipline you wouldnt find me a very advanced pupil i had read one book in caesar when i was compelled to leave school and had begun to translate greek a little now the question is are you willing to teach me if you think i am competent mr gale i dont doubt that we will begin if you like next monday perhaps in order to avoid village gossip it will be well to pass yourself off as my private secretary indeed i will employ you a little in that way also i shall be very glad to serve you in any way then come tomorrow morning at nine and remain with me till twelve now about the compensation fix that to suit yourself mr gale i am almost ashamed to ask anything the laborer is worthy of his hire andy suppose i pay you six dollars a week to begin with the money will be very acceptable but i am afraid you will be overpaying me i will take my risk of that on the whole i will call it nine dollars a week and we will spend the afternoon together also i will send to the city for a boat and you shall give me lessons in rowing andys eyes sparkled nothing would please him better and the prospect of earning nine dollars a week made him feel like a millionaire chapter vii an encounter with a tramp it is hardly necessary to say that andys parents were equally surprised and pleased at his new engagement you will like that better than working on the farm i expect andy said sterling grant yes father i am willing to work but i dont feel much interest in farming it is hard work and poor pay andy but i like it i was brought up to it when a boy and there is nothing else i can do andy is already beginning to get some advantage from his education said mrs grant andy reported for duty and during the first morning made up his mind that he should enjoy his new employment mr gale really desired to acquire a knowledge of latin and greek and worked faithfully to andy it was like a review of his own studies and he experienced a satisfaction in the rapid progress of his pupil he felt quite at home with mr gale though their acquaintance had been so brief when twelve oclock came he was really sorry what time shall i come over this afternoon mr gale he asked at two oclock can you borrow your friend valentines boat i have sent for one but it may be several days before it arrives oh yes i am sure val will let me have it he is a very goodnatured boy i will be glad to pay for its use i dont think hed accept anything then i will make him a present before he returned to the hotel andy saw valentine and obtained the loan of his boat at three oclock mr gale and andy started from the boathouse and again andy became a teacher the young man was a good rower but andy was able to give him some points sometimes they sat idle and let the boat float at will about four oclock conrad came down for his usual afternoon row he was surprised and not altogether pleased at meeting andy and his companion why are you not hoeing potatoes he asked ive got a vacation answered andy with a smile are you out for a row inquired mr gale pleasantly yes answered conrad sullenly though walter gale had nothing to do with his defeat he could not quite forgive him for awarding the prize to andy he felt mortified whenever he thought of it and wished mr gale to understand that he was not inferior to andy i was unlucky the other day he said i strained my muscles or i would not have been beaten that was lucky for me then said andy goodnaturedly i didnt care so much for the money but if i had been in my usual form i should have gained the prize then you wouldnt object to a second race said walter gale quietly what do you mean if you would like to try it again over the same course i will put up five dollars conrad hesitated he would not object to winning five dollars indeed he wished very much to have that sum but he was not quite so sure that he could beat andy as he claimed to be should andy win again he would be obliged to concede his superiority no he said after a pause i dont think i care to race again then i will make you another offer but not so good a one i row a little myself indeed andy is training me so that i hope soon to row better if you will row against me i will pay you two dollars that will be the prize but suppose you win then i keep the two dollars myself it will cost you nothing ill row said conrad eagerly very well we will appoint andy umpire or referee whatever you call it conrad was not altogether pleased with this selection but he waived his objections and the race was rowed andy giving the signal conrad won by a dozen lengths mr gale making a very good second you have won conrad said the young man goodnaturedly here is the prize conrad pocketed the bill with a good deal of satisfaction i will row you any day he said walter gale shook his head i must wait till i have improved he said or you will beat me every time conrad would much prefer to have beaten andy but the two dollars gave him not a little satisfaction mr gale must be rich he reflected i wish i could get in with him as andy has to work on the farm he said i shall be glad to go out with you any afternoon thank you but i have made an arrangement with andy that will save him from the necessity of farm work conrad opened his eyes in surprise later in the evening when he met andy at the village store he asked how much does mr gale pay you for going with him the arrangement is private conrad or i would tell you how much are you with him i go to the hotel at nine oclock in the morning what do you do then he calls me his private secretary do you get as much as three dollars a week i am sorry i cant tell you oh well if it is such a profound secret you seem to have got in with him he treats me very kindly is he rich i dont know but i presume he is i dont see what keeps him in such a dull hole as arden when he could live in the city and be in the midst of things at any rate it is lucky for me that he chooses to stay here what on earth does he want of a private secretary demanded conrad perhaps you had better ask him probably he only hires you out of pity i wont trouble myself about his motives as long as he appears to like having me with him several days passed the mornings were spent in study the afternoons on the pond there had been no change in the program so that andy was surprised when one morning mr gale said we will omit our lessons this morning i am going to send you to benton on an errand very well sir i have an account with the bank and will send a check by you to be cashed all right sir i will engage a top buggy for you at the hotel stable i suppose you are used to driving oh yes sir and i suppose you know the way to benton i have been there a good many times then there will be no trouble when do you want me to start at eleven oclock that would get you home late to dinner you may therefore stop and dine at the hotel in benton this would make it a days excursion andy liked driving and the visit to benton would be a pleasure to him i will run home and tell mother i shall not be back to dinner he said very well be back here at eleven oclock all right sir when andy reached the hotel on his return he found the buggy ready harnessed to it was the best horse in the hotel stable a pleasant journey to you said walter gale smiling at andy from the piazza thank you sir andy drove off at good speed it was a bright clear morning the air was invigorating and his spirits rose he reflected upon his good luck in having found such a friend as walter gale he had been unfortunate to be sure in being compelled to leave school but the hardship was very much mitigated by mr gales friendship he had gone twothirds of the way when he overtook a man whose bloated look and shabby clothing proclaimed him to belong to the large class of tramps whose business seems to be to roam through the country in quest of plunder the man looked up as andy reached him i say boy he called out give me a lift wont you andy was kindhearted but he was repelled by the unsavory look of the man who asked him this favor he felt that it would be very unpleasant to have such a man sitting beside him in the buggy i think you must excuse me he said what for asked the man with a scowl are you too proud to take in a poor man i dont object to you being poor answered andy but you look as if you had been drinking the man replied by an oath and bending over he picked up a goodsized stone and flung it at the young driver fortunately his condition made his aim unsteady and the stone flew wide of the mark andy whipped up the horse and was soon out of danger chapter viii a moment of danger andy did not examine the check till he reached the bank in benton then glancing at it before he presented it to the payingteller he found that it was for one hundred and twentyfive dollars how will you have it asked the teller twentyfive dollars in small bills the rest in fives and tens answered andy as instructed by mr gale the bills were counted out and placed in his hands to andy they seemed a large sum of money and indeed the roll was big enough to convey that impression as he left the bank he saw the familiar but not welcome face of the tramp who had stopped him glued against the pane he had attended to some errands before going to the bank which allowed the fellow time to reach it in season to watch him i wonder if he saw me putting away the bills thought andy however in a town like benton there was little chance of robbery the tramp looked at him with evil significance as he left the bank give me a dollar he said i cant answered andy i saw you with a big roll of bills they are not mine give me enough to buy a dinner then growled the tramp why should i give you anything you threw a stone at me on the road the tramp turned away muttering and the glance with which he eyed andy was far from friendly as directed andy went over to the hotel and got dinner he took the opportunity to dispose of the bills putting all the large ones in his inside vest pocket the small bills he distributed among his other pockets andy started for home at two oclock he felt some responsibility remembering that he had a considerable sum of money with him this made him anxious and he felt that he should be glad to get home safe and deliver his funds to mr gale probably he would not have thought of danger if he had not met the tramp on his way over the road for the most part was clear and open but there was one portion perhaps a third of a mile in length bordered by trees and underbrush it was so short however that it would be soon passed over but about the middle of it a man sprang from the side of the road and seized the horse by the bridle it did not require a second look to satisfy andy that it was the tramp the crisis had come andys heart was in his mouth he was a brave boy but it might well make even an older person nervous to be stopped by an illlooking tramp who was without doubt a criminal let go that bridle called andy in a tone which in spite of his nervousness was clear and resolute so i will when i have got what i want answered the tramp what do you want look at me and you can tell what i want i presume you want money but i have none to give you you are lying you have plenty of money about your clothes i said i had no money to give you didnt i see you get a roll of bills at the bank very likely you did but what about that i want some of them i wont take all but i am a poor man and i need them more than the man you are taking them to whom do you think i am taking them to squire carter he is the only man in arden that keeps no much money in the bank you are mistaken the money is not his whose then i dont feel called upon to tell you well thats neither here nor there i want some of it ill be content with half whoever owns it you wont get any let go the horse or ill run you down youre a smart kid but you are no match for me i dont scare worth a cent listen to me said andy if you should succeed in robbing me you would be caught and sent to jail how will that suit you it wouldnt be the first time ive been in jail id just as soon be there as to tramp around without a cent of money andy was not surprised to hear that he had to deal with an exconvict he understood that this man was a desperate character he saw that he was a strong powerful man in the full vigor of life any contest between them would be most unequal he was but sixteen and the tramp was near forty what could he do ill tell you what ill do he said willing to try an experiment ive got two dollars of my own ill give you that if youll let go my horses bridle and give me no more trouble the tramp laughed mockingly do you take me for a fool he asked why do you think i will be satisfied with two dollars when you have a hundred in your pocket two dollars wouldnt last me a day i have nothing to do with that it is all i mean to give you then i shall have to help myself his cool impudence made andy angry and he brought down the whip forcibly on the horses back naturally the animal started and nearly tore himself from the grasp of the tramp so that is your game said the fellow between his closed teeth if you try that again ill pull you out of the buggy and give you such a beating as you never had before andy remained cool and selfpossessed to carry out his threat the tramp would have to let go of the bridle and in that case andy determined to put his horse to his paces the tramp relaxed his hold and the horse stood stockstill finding his attempt to get away futile well said the tramp you didnt make much by that move did you did you make any more by jove youre a cool kid but after all youre only a kid now do as i tell you what is that put your hand in your pocket and take out fifty dollars youve got as much havent you yes thats right speak the truth you may have more but fiftyll do me do you expect me to give you fifty dollars yes i do i dont mean to do it andy had satisfied himself that the tramp had no weapon and this encouraged him he could not hold the horse and attack him at one and the same time but with a revolver he would have been at his mercy besides andys ears were keen and he thought he heard the sound of wheels behind him the tramps attention was too much occupied and perhaps his hearing was too dull to catch the sounds as yet faint thus it was that the other team was almost upon them before the tramp was aware of it the newcomer was saul wheelock a blacksmith a strong powerful man fully six feet in height and with muscles of steel he had seen the buggy standing still on the highway and he could not understand the cause until he got near enough to see the tramp at the horses head he sprang from the wagon he was driving and before the vagabond was fully sensible of his danger he had him by the coat collar what are you about he demanded giving him a rough shake the tramp turning found he was in the hands of a man whom he was compelled to respect he cared nothing for rank or learning but physical force held him in awe he stood mute unprepared with an excuse why its you andy said the blacksmith why did this rascal stop you he wants me to give him money ive just been to the bank in benton to draw out some for mr gale at the hotel why you scoundrel exclaimed the indignant blacksmith shaking the tramp till his teeth chattered so youre a thief are you let me go whined the tramp i havent taken anything im a poor unfortunate man if i could get any work to do i wouldnt have been driven to this no doubt youre a church member said the blacksmith in a sarcastic tone let me go ill promise to lead a good life this young man says hell give me two dollars ill take it and go dont give him a cent andy you can go but ill give you something to remember me by he gave the tramp a vigorous kick that nearly prostrated him and then getting into his wagon said ill keep along with you andy i dont think youll have any more trouble the tramp slunk into the woods baffled and disappointed if looks could have annihilated the sturdy blacksmith his span of life would have been brief chapter ix conrads scheme when andy told mr gale the story of his adventures on the trip to benton he received cordial congratulations on his courage you have shown a great deal of pluck andy he said the next time you have occasion to go over to the bank for me i will accompany you now if you are not too tired i want you to go down to the pond i have something to show you they walked side by side till they reached the pond andys curiosity was not specially excited he talked with mr gale on different topics and had hardly time to consider what it was he was to see but when he reached the boathouse he saw floating at the small pier an elegant rowboat built of cedar and much handsomer than either conrads or valentines oh what a beauty he exclaimed yes said mr gale quietly you will have quite the best boat on the pond i exclaimed andy in surprise yes for the boat is yours but i dont understand stammered andy it is plain enough said walter gale with a pleasant smile the boat is yours i give it to you how can i thank you exclaimed andy grasping his friends hand i cant believe that this beautiful boat is mine you will realize it after a while let me tell you how i got it it was built for a rich young man in new york one of the four hundred i believe but as he received an unexpected invitation to go abroad for two years he authorized the builder to sell it for him at a considerable reduction from the price he paid so it happens that i was able to secure it for you now let us go out for a row it will be the trial trip fifteen minutes later conrad got into his boat and started out it was not long before his eyes were attracted to the new boat he could see at once for he was a judge that it was far more elegant and costly than his own and he was seized by a pang of envy his own boat seemed to him quite inferior though but a short time before he had regarded it with pride he was curious to see the craft and pulled up to it that is a fine boat you have there mr gale he said so i think returned the young man i feel quite satisfied with it when did it come down i only received it this morning how much did it cost asked conrad who was not troubled by bashfulness a small fortune answered walter gale with a smile i am afraid i must decline to give the exact figures i asked because i may ask my father to buy me one like it conrad was perfectly well aware that such a request would be promptly denied squire carter was not disposed to be extravagant and he had even hesitated for some time before incurring the outlay required for conrads present boat the new boat was so elegant so graceful and so thoroughly finished in every part that conrad could not help coveting it he was not very much to be blamed for it was one that would captivate the fancy of any boy who was fond of the water i should like to try the boat some time mr gale he said if the owner is willing i am returned the young man the owner why doesnt it belong to you asked conrad in surprise no it belongs to andy that boat belong to andy grant exclaimed conrad with an incredulous frown yes i have given it to him you will have to ask his permission i shall be glad to have you try it said andy pleasantly thank you but i dont think i care for it replied conrad coldly he felt a pang of mortification to think that the farmers son should have a boat so much superior to his own if you change your mind let me know said andy conrad is jealous remarked walter gale he doesnt like to have you own a boat that is superior to his i think you are right mr gale if the case were reversed i would not mind because you are not disposed to be envious or jealous when conrad returned home there was a cloud upon his brow it was easy for any one to see that he was in bad humor what is the matter conrad asked his father you look as if you had lost your best friend i hate andy grant exploded conrad his eyes flashing with anger why what has andy done now you havent had a fight have you no i wouldnt demean myself by fighting with him what is it then he is always doing something to annoy me i am still in the dark he has got a new boat far handsomer than mine i shouldnt wonder if it cost twice as much squire conrad was surprised where did he get it he inquired it was a present from mr gale the young man at the hotel he must like young grant very much it is ridiculous that a poor boy should own such a boat i dont see how we can help it said the squire philosophically he did not take the superiority of andys boat so much to heart as his son ill tell you how you can make it right father how by buying me a boat as good or better than the new one why should i buy you another boat the one you have is only six months old and it cost me a pretty penny i assure you that may be but i shall not feel any more satisfaction in it now that andy has a better one all this is foolish my son then you wont buy me a new boat most certainly i wont said the squire firmly conrads countenance fell but another idea came to him suppose andy is willing to exchange with me for something to boot you say the boat is a fine one elegant you may offer him ten dollars wont you say fifteen father i assure you it is worth much more than that difference you can offer him ten dollars and see what he has to say to it conrad managed to see andy the next day and made him the offer do you think i would part with mr gales gift said andy indignantly he wouldnt care and ten dollars is a good deal of money said conrad insinuatingly if you offered me fifty dollars i would say the same i am not particularly in want of money i suppose you say that because you are earning three dollars a week who told you how much mr gale paid me asked andy smiling then he does get three dollars a week reflected conrad he redoubled his entreaties but andy refused firmly half an hour later conrad met on the street a shabby figure with whom we are already acquainted it was the tramp who figured in an encounter with andy when on his way to benton young gentleman said the tramp with a whine you look rich and generous cant you spare a poor man a trifle you look as if you drank replied conrad with brutal frankness your nose is red thats owing to a skin disease i have belonged to the temperance society for five years humph you dont look like it why dont you work because i can find nothing to do here a contemptible suggestion offered itself to conrad if you will do something for me and keep mum ill give you two dollars ill do it if it isnt too hard then ill tell you what it is theres a boat on the pond that belongs to an enemy of mine he is always crowing over me now if youll manage this evening to set it on fire ill give you two dollars how shall i set it on fire with a match no ill supply you with some shavings a few pieces of board and some pitch there wont be any trouble about it who owns the boat conrad described andy thats the boy who but never mind ill do it once convinced that in this way he could get revenge on the boy who had humiliated and got the best of him the tramp was only too willing to help conrad in his scheme when conrad went home at nine oclock after supplying the tramp with combustibles he said to himself there wont be much left of andys boat in the morning chapter x the tramps mistake conrad went to bed with the comfortable conviction that before morning andys beautiful boat would be ruined i am sorry to say that the meanness of the act which he had instigated did not strike him whatever feeling he had was of exultation at the injury done to his enemy as he persisted in regarding andy it did seem a pity that such an elegant boat should be destroyed if andy would only have agreed to exchange for ten even fifteen dollars to boot this would have been avoided he was a fool not to accept soliloquized conrad he will regret it when he sees what has happened he got up at the usual hour and took breakfast every time the bell rang he thought it might be some one to bring him the desired news just after supper andy met his friend valentine and told him of the beautiful gift he had received come down and look at it val he said it is elegant valentines curiosity was excited and he at once accepted the invitation he uttered an exclamation of surprise when he saw the new boat it is a little beauty he said it is far ahead of conrads or of mine conrad wants to exchange he offered me ten dollars to boot you wouldnt think of accepting no it is worth much more than that besides it is mr gales gift and even if he had offered fifty dollars i should still refuse and you would do right too but are you going to leave it out all night i shall have to i have no boathouse to put it in there is room in my boathouse for two boats said valentine i will help you put it inside thank you val i will be glad to pay you rent for the use of the place i dont want any money andy i will do it out of friendship thank you but you mustnt forget that i am quite able to pay thats true and i am glad of it but all the same i dont want any money i wonder conrad doesnt have a boathouse he tells me his father has promised him one he has not yet decided upon a location the two boys got into andys boat and rowed it a few rods till they reached the boathouse there was no difficulty in putting it away the boathouse was double and there was room for two boats i will have another key made andy so that you can get at your boat when i am not with you all right that will be very nice how do you like mr gale tiptop i was very fortunate to fall in with him it will be a great loss to me when he goes away is he thinking of going soon i dont think so i hope not it was later in the evening when the tramp went down to the pond provided with the shavings and other combustibles which conrad had provided conrad after meeting him had gone home at once he thought it more prudent in view of the plot in which he was engaged to avoid suspicion by not being seen in company with the tramp give me the two dollars now said the tramp when the fuel was handed him do you think i am a fool answered conrad sharply if i should do that you would go off and not do the work ill do the work fast enough i want to get even with that young rascal what do you know him i have met him answered the tramp evasively he played me a mean trick and i want to get even with him what sort of a trick was it i will tell you some other time i havent time now i wish i had a hatchet what for then if the fire didnt spoil the boat id hack it up i think i can get you a hatchet but you must not leave it on the bank for my fathers initial c is on it all right ill be careful the hatchet was delivered to the tramp a little later about eight oclock the tramp went down to the lake and looked for andys boat there was but one in sight conrads but he never doubted that this was the one he was to destroy he waited till halfpast eight when he considered it dark enough for his purpose he carefully laid the shavings in one end of the boat covered them over with pieces of board which with the help of the hatchet he split into smaller pieces and then set them on fire the flames blazed fiercely and did considerable damage to the boat not ruining it however but to finish the work he used the hatchet and hacked vigorously at the woodwork till it was mutilated and its usefulness and beauty spoiled the tramp contemplated this work with satisfaction ive done the job pretty well he chuckled to himself id like to be lookin on when the boy sees it now that he had done the job he wanted his pay conrad had agreed to meet him at an old ruined barn not far from his house at eight oclock in the morning it wont do to call for me earlier he said for it might excite suspicion from the breakfast table conrad directed his steps to the barn the tramp was sitting outside smoking a pipe ive been waiting for you he said i havent had any breakfast did you do the job did i well i reckon that boat aint no good any more do you think any one saw you do it no it was pretty dark and there wasnt no one round it may have been found out by now give me the two dollars and ill be off you are sure you did the job you are not deceiving me no im not you can go and see for yourself this however did not seem prudent conrad wished some one else to discover the ruined boat after all there was no reason to doubt the tramps word his avowed hostility to andy made it quite certain that he had done his work heres the money he said and heres the hatchet i wish it was back in the toolhouse where it belongs thought conrad however ill manage to get it back without any one seeing me he decided to return to the barn at once carrying the hatchet with him he was not to do it without observation just before he reached the barn he met john larkin what are you doing with the hatchet conrad oh i have been using it in the pasture i didnt know but you were going to imitate george washington and cut down a cherry tree perhaps i have said conrad with a smile he felt in good humor for his plan had been carried out he was aching to see just how badly andys boat was injured and as there was no school it being saturday he proposed to john larkin to go down to the pond suppose we have a row john he said well take a trip across the pond all right they were perhaps thirty rods from the pond when they met jimmy morris coming from it he seemed excited he had been running and was breathless whats the matter jimmy asked john larkin jimmy looked toward conrad who naturally guessed the cause of his excitement oh conrad he said it is such a pity i am so sorry for you why are you sorry for me demanded conrad sharply because your boat is ruined it is all hacked up and has been set on fire my boat you mean andy grants no i dont come and see for yourself chapter xi conrads disappointment with his mind in a whirl and still believing that it was andys boat which had been injured instead of his own conrad pushed on rapidly toward the pond yet he had an instinctive fear that his informant might be correct when he reached the point where his boat had been moored he used his eyes eagerly it was all true his boat his beautiful boat with which he had been perfectly satisfied till andy received a better was scorched and hacked up till it was clear he could never use it again and andys boat was not visible anywhere tears of rage filled conrads eyes it is a terrible mistake he ejaculated mistake what do you mean asked john larkin conrad reflected that his words were betraying him i dont know what i am saying he replied vaguely yes i do i believe andy grant did this andy grant repeated jimmy morris why should he injure your boat because he hates me andy isnt that kind of a boy besides he has a newer and much handsomer boat himself there it was that was what stung conrad his boat was second to andys as the three boys stood on the bank a small boy named peter hill came up he lived in the house nearest the boats did you see any one near the boat peter asked john larkin yes i seed a big tramp in de boat he set it on fire that explains it conrad exclaimed jimmy morris i saw the tramp myself in the village pooh said conrad i dont believe it but i seed him burnin de boat persisted little peter then why didnt you tell somebody all de folks was away and i didnt dare to go near it he had a hatchet too i say conrad let us hunt for the tramp and if we find him have him arrested for obvious reasons this proposal of john larkin did not meet conrads approval he was afraid of what the tramp would tell ill ask my father what to do he replied evasively the mischief is done and there is no help for it conrad was already looking more cheerful an idea had come to him now that the boat was destroyed his father might be willing to buy him another and if so he might be persuaded to buy one as good as andys perhaps better he turned to go home and let the boys know that he did not care for company on the way not far from his own house he encountered the tramp at the sight of this man whose stupid blunder had cost him his boat his eyes blazed with anger but this the tramp did not see he slouched up to his young employer saying with a cunning grin well did you see it did i see it repeated conrad boiling over with fury yes i did i did it pretty well didnt i i guess the boat isnt good for much now you stupid fool blazed out conrad it is my boat that you ruined i have a great mind to have you arrested your boat it was the boat you pointed out to me no it wasnt it was my own boat then where was the other boat i didnt see but one i dont know but you might have had sense enough to know that youd got the wrong boat the tramps hopes fell he had intended to ask for another dollar from conrad but he saw now that there was no chance whatever of his obtaining it youd better get out of town as soon as you can said conrad roughly why should i demanded the tramp sullenly because you were seen destroying the boat who saw me a small boy who lives at the next house you might be arrested if i am ill tell the truth ill tell who put me up to it and ill deny it do you think any one would believe your word against mine especially as it was my boat that was ruined the tramp saw the logic of this remark and walked away he was seen no more in the village now ill tackle father thought conrad he directed his steps homeward and informed the squire of what had happened his father frowned and looked displeased if you are not smart enough to take care of your boat he said coldly you will have to suffer the consequences but i dont see how i am to blame have you any idea who did the mischief perhaps andy grant did he doesnt like me i dont think that very probable you can charge him with it if you think best but i thought you told me he had a new boat of his own so he has a perfect beauty it is ever so much better than mine i wish well what do you wish that you would buy me one like his well i like that after losing your boat through your own carelessness you want me to invest a large sum in another must i go without one then asked conrad in dismay it looks that way conrad resorted to earnest entreaties he was willing now to accept any sort of boat for he was fond of rowing but squire carter had just heard unfavorable reports from his broker about a speculation he had entered into and he was inflexible what a fool i was reflected conrad bitterly my boat was a good one even if it wasnt as fine as andys and now i have none i shall have to borrow his or valentines when i want to go out rowing later in the day he met andy andy had heard of conrads loss and was full of sympathy conrad he said its a shame about your boat being destroyed yes it is pretty hard the boys say a tramp did the mischief i think it very likely there was a tramp about town yesterday i saw him myself what could have been his object ruining the boat would not benefit him it might have been out of revenge he asked me for a quarter and i wouldnt give it to him this explanation occurred to conrad on the spur of the moment cant you have him arrested he is probably out of town by this time i suppose you will have a new boat yes after a while i will lend you mine any time you wish thank you said conrad but he spoke coldly and ungraciously it seemed to him humiliating to receive any favors from a poor boy like andy grant two weeks later when andy went over to the hotel as usual to meet his employer and pupil mr gale said i have some news for you i hope it is good news i dont know that you will consider it so i shall have to leave you for a time andys face fell this certainly was bad news i have received a letter this morning continued walter gale from an uncle living in the interior of pennsylvania he is not an old man i dont think he is much over fifty but he writes me that he is near his end the doctor says he may live three months certainly not over six he has always been a bachelor and i believe owns coal mines of considerable value i was always a favorite of his and now that he is so sick he wants me to go out and be with him in the closing weeks of his life i suppose you will go said andy and he looked very sober i think it is my duty dont you yes i suppose it is your duty andy began to think what he should do he had had an easy and profitable engagement with mr gale but this would now be over and he would have to go back to farm work or try to get a place in the village store the latter would yield him only two dollars and a half a week which seemed to him very small compared with what he now received i shall miss you very much mr gale he said i hope you will i shall certainly miss you it will seem very dull going to work on the farm after my pleasant days with you you wont need to go to work on the farm unless you choose to do so but i must earn something i cannot be idle oh i forgot to tell you what arrangements i propose to make for you andy looked up eagerly chapter xii something unexpected our separation will only be temporary continued mr gale but i do not wish to leave you unprovided for during my absence i shall allow you five dollars a week while i am away andy brightened up how kind you are mr gale he said i dont think you ought to do this walter gale smiled i can very well afford it he said so we will regard the matter as settled how soon must you go i shall start tomorrow my preparations will be easily made how would you like to go to new york to see me off i should be delighted answered andy i have only been to new york twice in my life then you will enjoy the day you can take the afternoon train home at the farm mr and mrs grant heard with regret of mr gales departure but they were pleased to hear that andy would be in receipt of an income how will you fill up your time andy asked his father i have my books and will keep up my latin and greek i will pay you four dollars a week and you can hire a boy for that to help you i think i can spend my time more profitably in studying do you think mr gale will return he has promised to do so i am to see him off tomorrow are you going to trust that boy alone in new york asked his aunt jane with asperity why what could happen to me asked andy indignantly you might get run over i am not a little boy aunt jane i can take care of myself you may meet with an accident for all your smartness i think andy is old enough to take care of himself said his father mildly oh well have it your own way you cant say but ive warned you and she sniffed severely i wonder what makes aunt jane so disagreeable thought andy perhaps youd like to go and take care of him suggested mr grant with a smile you are old enough to take care of yourself you neednt twit me with my age sterling said jane with an injured sniff i dont old age is honorable this made matters worse you talk as if i was seventyfive i dont consider myself an old person in spite of the melancholy presentiment of aunt jane andy set out for new york with mr gale an hour and a half brought them to the metropolis i should like to show you something of the city andy said his companion but i shall have to spend the time in shopping i shall see something of the city if i go about with you that is true at one oclock they went to the sinclair house on broadway to dine they selected a table where there was but one other guest who seemed known to walter gale goodmorning mr flint said the young man ah its you walter is it returned the other a stout man whose hair was beginning to grow gray yes i havent seen you for a long time where have you been rusticating in a connecticut town is the young man with you a brother but no i remember that you have no brother he isnt related to me but i think as much of him as if he were his name is andrew grant a good name is he attending school he has recently left school if he were seeking a position i could find a place for him in your own employ yes i have a boy but i dont find him reliable or faithful he will leave me on saturday night andy said his friend how would you like to enter mr flints employ very much answered andy eagerly at the same time he wondered what was the nature of mr flints business then after dinner we will walk together to mr flints store in union square there is my card said mr flint andy received it and read the name f flint union square jewelry the two men conversed together and when dinner was over they walked up broadway to fourteenth street turning the lefthand corner they soon reached a jewelry store of modest appearance but evidently containing a valuable stock a youth with lightbrown hair who seemed to have been born tired was leaning against the counter this doubtless was the boy who was not satisfactory john said mr flint have you carried the parcel to fortyeighth street no sir answered the boy why not i thought it would do just as well after lunch there you are mistaken put on your hat at once and go said his employer sharply you see went on mr flint after the boy had started the trouble i have with john he needs to be looked after continually you wont have that trouble with andy no i think not walter gale accompanied mr flint to the back part of the store where they held a conversation in a low tone presently walter gale came back and signified to andy that they must be going mr flint will expect you to present yourself for duty on tuesday morning he said you will reach the store at eight oclock all right sir on returning to the street walter gale said i propose to take the next train for philadelphia you may accompany me to the cortlandt street station can you find your way from there to the grand central depot yes sir you will get there in time to take the afternoon train back to arden you havent asked me what salary you are to receive i should like to know sir five dollars a week which is better than is generally paid to a new boy will it pay my expenses mr gale asked andy doubtfully no but you remember that i promised you five dollars a week instead of paying it to you i will give you a note to mrs norris who keeps a comfortable boarding house on clinton place she knows me well and will assign you a room looking to me for payment that will leave you five dollars a week for your personal expenses clothing etc i shall be rich mr gale thanks to your kindness mind andy i am to have you back whenever i want you probably i may spend some weeks with my uncle and during this time you may as well work for mr flint do you think i shall suit him asked andy with some anxiety i feel sure of it you will find him strict in business but kind and reasonable i shall expect to hear from you soon after you enter upon your duties i shall find life pretty dull at my uncles house and your letters will bring something of the excitement of the outside world to me i will write you every week mr gale if it wont be asking too much of you i shall be glad to have you do so andy crossed the ferry with mr gale and then returning at once took the four oclock train for arden his news created considerable stir at home all were pleased except aunt jane brother she said are you going to trust andy alone in new york yes jane he must begin to rely upon himself some time and he may as well begin now its temptin providence in my opinion it might be so with some boys but i have faith in andys prudence and good sense he aint any different from other boys as you will find but in spite of these ominous words andy made arrangements to leave arden on monday morning he looked forward eagerly to his new life in new york chapter xiii andy leaves home conrad was not slow in learning of mr gales departure from the hotel the intelligence pleased him for as he supposed it threw andy out of employment he sought an early opportunity of speaking to him on the subject at five oclock in the afternoon the mail came in at the post office among those who congregated there at the time were conrad and andy so youve lost your place began conrad abruptly what do you mean asked andy mr gale has left town hasnt he yes where has he gone to pennsylvania to stay with an uncle who is very sick do you think he will come back to arden i dont know but i think it is doubtful i suppose then you will go back to work on the farm andy smiled things might be worse he said yes i think it is the best thing you can do why do you think so oh well you are a poor boy and there is nothing else for you to do did you ever think of becoming a farmer i should say not replied conrad haughtily i shall probably be a lawyer or a merchant i might become a merchant myself some day conrad laughed when you do he said let me know i will by the way you wont want that boat of yours now why not you wont get time to use it ill give you twenty dollars for it it is not for sale answered andy firmly it will be after a while said conrad in a selfsatisfied tone i will see the time when you will be glad enough to get the money i offer during the few days that andy remained at home he did some work on the farm mr grants boy helper was sick with a cold and andy stepped into his place the next time of conrads meeting him he was at work digging potatoes conrad smiled and nodded he felt quite friendly as he witnessed what he considered andys humiliation my father may give you a little job he said as he leaned over the fence what is it he needs some work done round the house he will pay you fifty cents a day when can you come just at present i am too busy if i can spare the time i will let you know i like to see upstarts brought down to their level thought conrad andy grant wont be putting on any more airs i reckon on monday morning andy stood on the platform of the railroad station with a goodsized gripsack in his hand he was about starting for new york to enter upon his duties at the jewelry store swinging a light cane conrad carter appeared on the platform with his father who was going to the city on business with a good deal of surprise he recognized andy where are you going he asked abruptly with a glance at the gripsack to new york answered andy what business have you there i have a position in a store on union square i shall be pleased to have you call when you are in the city conrad was greatly surprised what kind of a store is it he asked a jewelry store i havent a card with me but will send you one conrad didnt appear to be glad at andys good fortune he had made up his mind that his humble rival as he chose to consider him would be obliged to work on the farm and now he had found a way to avoid it i think your father will have to find some one else to assist him andy continued you see i shall be otherwise occupied what pay will you receive if you will excuse me i would rather not tell oh just as you like where will you live will you sleep in the store no i am to board on clinton place with a mrs norris did you know about this when we were talking the other day yes why didnt you tell me i would have done so if i had known how much interest you took in my plans the rumble of the approaching train was heard and andy was obliged to enter a car it chanced that it was unusually full and andy found but one vacant seat the one beside squire carter the squire now noticed andy for the first time where are you going andrew he asked to new york sir on any special errand i am going to work there indeed what kind of a place i shall have a place with mr flint of union square a jeweler i suppose mr gale obtained you the place yes sir i am not sure that you are acting wisely i doubt if you can make expenses what are you to be paid five dollars a week that is very fair pay for a boy of your age but it wont go very far in new york i suppose new york is an expensive place to live in said andy noncommittally yes you will have to pay all your wages for board your other expenses will have to come out of your fathers pocket i may be advanced it will be a good while first you seem to be acting very injudiciously this remark did not trouble andy as his board was to be paid by mr gale his salary would be practically ten dollars a week but this he did not care to tell country boys are always in a stew to get work in the city observed the squire if they would only take the advice of their elders they would see that it is better to stay in the country they think probably that there is more chance of advancement in the city horace greeley never would have risen to distinction if he had remained in his native village ahem there are exceptions what is the number of the store where you will be employed andy told him i may call in upon you some time i am often in the city on business i shall be glad if you will said andy sincerely it will seem pleasant to me to see an arden face andy got out of the cars at the grand central depot he was not quite sure of his way to clinton place but he was not in the least disturbed he was naturally selfreliant he asked the question of a gentleman and was advised to take a fourth avenue car through the tunnel as far as eighth street but he thought he should prefer to walk as it would enable him to enjoy the sights and scenes of the metropolis all these were fresh and interesting to him he had gone but a dozen steps from the depot when a plausible stranger of thirtyfive years apparently stopped him young man may i have a word with you he asked if you wish i speak to you because i judge from your appearance that you have a good kind heart i hope you are right sir i am very awkwardly placed my sister is very sick in yonkers and has sent for me on my way to the depot in a horse car i had my pocket picked and i have not enough money to get to the bedside of my poor sister if you would kindly lend me a quarter andy was kindhearted and he was not versed in city wiles he put his hand in his pocket and drew out a twentyfivecent silver coin i am glad to help you he said as he passed the coin to the applicant you have a noble heart i thank you said the stranger feelingly andy felt pleased to think that he had done the man a favor but his satisfaction was shortlived a stout pleasantlooking man who had caught sight of the conference addressed him did you give that man any money he asked yes sir what did he need it for his pocket had been picked and he wanted to go to yonkers to visit his sick sister his new friend laughed thats a new story he said the man is an arrant fraud your money will be spent for drink he has no sick sister this was quite a shock to andy he saw that he had been victimized and must hereafter be on his guard against plausible strangers chapter xiv the first day in new york by dint of a little inquiry andy found his way to mrs norris boarding house in clinton place it was a plain threestoryandbasement house of brick and looked thoroughly respectable andy took a general view of it and thought he should take it to his country eyes it looked quite aristocratic it was higher than any house in arden even squire carters he ascended the steps and rang the bell it was answered by a swedish girl named eva a blond girl of the true scandinavian type is mrs norris at home he asked she is upstairs was the reply i should like to see her who shall i tell her calls she wont know my name tell her it is some one with a letter from mr walter gale wont you step in she ushered andy into a small reception room opening from the hall it was a very small room provided with a sofa one chair and a writing desk just over the sofa hung an engraving of washington crossing the delaware andy sat down on the sofa and placed his gripsack in front of him there was nothing to occupy his mind so he sat patiently wondering what sort of a looking woman the landlady might be soon there was a rustle of garments and a stout pleasantlooking lady of perhaps fifty wearing a small cap set off with red ribbons entered the room mrs norris said andy inquiringly rising out of respect yes i am mrs norris eva told me you had a letter from mr i didnt catch the name mr walter gale oh yes mr gale i know him very well did he ever board here no he boarded at one of the hotels mr gale is a rich man she took the letter and read it mr gale asks if i can take you to board and offers to pay your board he must be a great friend of yours he is i hope the arrangement will be satisfactory quite so i couldnt wish any better paymaster than mr gale are you going to work in the city yes i have a place in mr flints jewelry store on union square really that is quite a hightoned place i got my best spoons there have you got a room for me asked andy a little anxiously yes ive got a small hall bedroom i suppose you didnt expect a square room it would be too expensive it wouldnt be if you had a roommate theres a gentleman on the third floor front a mr warren he is sickly and writes for some of the papers he told me he would like a roommate but perhaps you would prefer a small room alone i should then ive a small room on the same floor it was occupied till last week by a music teacher but he was three weeks behind in his rent and i had to let him go its a trying business keeping a boarding house mr grant suggested andy yes thats a good name i suppose youre in nowise related to the general no i wish i was if you will follow me upstairs ill show you the room you can bring your valise andy took it in his hand and followed the landlady up two flights of stairs she panted a little being a stout lady but andy would have run upstairs if he had been alone on the upper floor there were three rooms the doors of all being open that is mr warrens room said mrs norris pointing to the front apartment it was a room of about fourteen feet square and was neatly furnished it contained a double bed and the usual chamber furniture it will accommodate two gentlemen nicely said mrs norris perhaps after you get acquainted with mr warren you may strike up a bargain to room with him i dont think i should like to room with a sickly gentleman well there is something in that one night mr warren had a fit i dont know what kind of one and rolled onto the floor i room just underneath and i was very much frightened it would have frightened me too if i had roomed with him well fits aint very pleasant i allow who rooms in the third room next to mine a young man of eighteen named perkins i dont rightly know what sort of a place he is in i think its a neckwear store on spring street andy was rather glad to learn that there was one boarder somewhere near his own age he did not think he should enjoy the acquaintance of mr warren he was prejudiced against him by the knowledge that he was sickly and had fits there are other boarders on my second floor you will make their acquaintance at the table what are your hours for meals mrs norris we have lunch from twelve to one breakfast is from seven to nine and we have dinner from six to seven though in the case of a boarder who is kept later by business we stretch a point and try to accommodate him i hope that will suit you oh i am sure it will shall you be at lunch today no i dont think so i am going to explore the city a little very few of my boarders are present at lunch still there is a bite for them if they do come i would like to wash if you will send up some water and a towel eva will bring them right up have you soap of your own yes gentlemen often prefer providing their own if you will give me your name in full i will enter it on my books my name is andrew grant very well what is your rate of board mr gale will pay it but i should like to know what it is five dollars a week for your room mr warren pays seven but he has a large room to himself if you should decide to room with him i shall charge you five dollars apiece thank you i dont think we shall come to any agreement she went downstairs and andy surveyed his room with interest it was certainly small quite the narrowest room he had ever seen there was one window from which he had a view of the back yard rather a forlornlooking space there was a cat perched on the high board fence separating the yard from that of the adjoining house andy liked cats and called out pussy the cat looked up and mewed her recognition and acknowledgment of the friendly overture then eva came up with a pitcher of water and a towel will one do you she asked the rest are in the wash and ill bring you another this evening one will be sufficient for the present so youre comin here to live she said sociably yes eva i hope you dont have fits like mr warren i dont think i ever had one yet answered andy with a smile im glad of that im afraid of gentlemen that have fits eva went downstairs and andy proceeded to make his ablutions it was a dusty day and the water was refreshing after he had washed his face and hands he opened his gripsack and took out his brush and comb which he placed on a tiny bureau in one corner of the room it contained two drawers and in one of them he put away the contents of the valise by this time it was halfpast ten and he put on his hat and went downstairs he went out into the street and after a moment of indecision walked to broadway he thought he could not do better than to walk down this wonderful thoroughfare of which he had heard so much it did occur to him that he might report at the jewelry store but he would see enough of that hereafter and he preferred to take a little walk about the city andy used his eyes to good advantage he looked in at the shop windows and watched the human tide that swept by him finally he found himself accosted by one of the passersby my young friend could you oblige me with a quarter to take me to newark my pocket has been picked and all this seemed familiar andy looked up and recognized at once the stranger whom he had relieved in front of the grand central depot when did you get back from yonkers he asked abruptly i never was in yonkers i gave you a quarter only an hour or two ago to get to your sick sister in yonkers muttering that there was some mistake the man hurried away looking confused i wonder if i shall ever meet him again thought andy chapter xv andys opposite neighbor andy walked about the city using his eyes industriously at one oclock he went into a restaurant on park row where he got a fair lunch for twentyfive cents this was more than he intended to pay usually but on this first day in the city he did not care to go back to the boarding house after lunch he made his way to the entrance of the brooklyn bridge and got into one of the cars he enjoyed the prospect visible from the windows and felt that this alone would pay him for visiting new york just before they reached the other end there was a cry of alarm from a stout german woman who sat on the other side of the car ive been robbed she exclaimed my purse is gone of course this attracted general attention was there much in the purse madam asked a kindlooking elderly man yes there was six dollars it was a great deal to me are you sure you had it when you entered the car yes i took it out of my pocket when i paid for a ticket i think your pocket must have been picked sitting next to the woman was a man who seemed absorbed in reading a morning newspaper even the womans complaint did not appear to excite his attention this led andy to move his head to get a nearer view of him he started in surprise it was the adventurer whom he had already met twice that morning he had little doubt that he was the thief it was perhaps somewhat rash to hazard a charge without proof but he felt indignant and could not resist the impulse i think that man has your purse he said pointing to the individual behind the newspaper this is an outrage exclaimed the latter with assumed anger i am a boston merchant he was respectably dressed and the charge did not seem very plausible my boy you should be careful how you make such charges said his next neighbor reprovingly but andy was not abashed i know something of that man he said quietly i have met him twice this morning has he robbed you no but he asked me to give him a quarter to take him to his sick sister in yonkers this was at the grand central depot an hour or two later i met him on broadway and he wanted money to take him to newark the boy is entirely mistaken said the adventurer at the same instant under cover of the newspaper he adroitly let the stolen purse drop to the floor at his feet by this time the cars had reached the brooklyn end of the bridge why there is your purse exclaimed the adventurer with a sudden glance downward you must have dropped it oh thank you sir said the poor woman overjoyed i hope you wont suspect a gentleman again said the thief in lofty indignation no i wont sir i was sure you didnt take it andy who had seen the trick smiled but he was satisfied with the recovery of the purse the passengers looked puzzled they had not made up their minds as to the guilt or innocence of the man charge with the theft you see young man said andys neighbor in a tone of reproof you were mistaken andy smiled again i saw him drop the purse on the floor he answered quietly bless my soul are you sure yes sir the passengers left the car andy and the thief among them andy lost track of his acquaintance till as they reached fulton street he heard some one hissing in his ear boy you are too fresh ill get even with you yet then the thief passing him rapidly got into a myrtle avenue car and this was the last he saw of him for that day andy walked about the streets of brooklyn for a while and returned by fulton ferry then he went back to his boarding place arriving there between three and four oclock as he went up to his room he noticed that the door of the large room opposite was open a young man of about thirty was sitting in a rockingchair reading he was of medium height and sallow complexion he wore his hair long and had a high narrow forehead i suppose that is the man who has fits thought andy the young man had noticed andys entrance into his own room and rising from the rockingchair crossed the hall and knocked lightly at the door come in said andy i suppose this is mr grant began the young man bowing i am mr warren and live in the room opposite wont you come in and sit down asked andy with a glance at the only chair the room contained dont let me take your only chair ill sit on the bed if you dont mind make yourself at home mr warren said andy with easy cordiality so you know my name mrs norris spoke to me of you did she what did she say asked the young man showing some curiosity i think she said you were literary that you wrote for some of the magazines yes i am very fond of writing do you write not for publication ah yes i see you would be rather young for an author are you connected with any particular magazine no i am a free lance i contribute to several i have just sent an article to the century andy was rather surprised for he knew that the century held high rank among contemporary magazines it did not occur to him that any one might send an article to that magazine but that to have it accepted and published would be a different matter i suppose you enjoy writing yes there is nothing i like so well perhaps you will show me some of your articles i can show you a poem which appeared last week in the village paper at home thank you i should like to see it mr warren went up to his room and speedily returned with a small weekly paper on the front page at the head of the first column was a short poem by g byron warren this was the first stanza which mr warren volunteered to read aloud id like to be a robin and flit from bough to bough id pour sweet music on the air if god would teach me how i dont quite like that last line he said looking up from the paper can you suggest any improvement you might say and charm the pensive cow suggested andy mischievously true that might be a striking figure i will consider it when i revise the poem for publication in book form the rest of the poem was of similar quality i dont think they would accept that for the century thought andy do you devote yourself to literary work or are you in business he asked i may go into business but at present i only write i send a letter once a month to the greenville banner i suppose they pay oh ah yes answered the poet in a hesitating voice but the terms are strictly confidential if you ever pick up any incidents in your daily walks mr grant i shall be glad if you will communicate them to me that i may weave them into my correspondence with pleasure then it occurred to andy to tell his neighbor about the street adventurer whom he had met three times that morning capital exclaimed warren i will get that into my next letter i see mr grant you have an observing eye you would make a good reporter for one of the city dailies do you think so asked andy feeling complimented i am sure of it how long have you lived in the city mr warren about three months some time i will tell you why i came here he continued with an air of mystery i shall be glad to hear i will tell you now for i see you have a sympathetic soul i loved and my love was returned but a heartless parent interposed and separated two loving hearts he took out his handkerchief and wiped his eyes andy hardly knew whether to laugh or to express sympathy i suppose that often happens he said rather lamely perhaps he may yet repent i live in that hope when i have become famous i will go back and offer myself again to sophia i suppose you have had no heart experiences as yet mr grant not as yet but i can sympathize with you i am so glad you have come i shall make you my confidential friend then the conversation drifted into other channels chapter xvi andy at work punctually as the clock struck eight the next morning andy entered the store of mr flint on union square he looked for his employer but the jeweler seldom arrived before nine his residence being in harlem behind the counter arranging the goods in one of the cases was a man with reddish hair who might at a guess be thirtyfive years of age it was mr flints head clerk simon rich who had been absent when andy made his first call what can i do for you boy he asked superciliously is mr flint in no you can tell me your business i have come here to work oh this exclamation was longdrawn out mr rich then proceeded to examine andy from head to foot in a manner which was extremely offensive andy understood that for some reason this man would be his enemy he would have understood his hostility better had he known that the boy just discharged was the head clerks nephew i suppose you are well acquainted with the business remarked rich with a sneer i know nothing about it humph you stand a chance of being very useful i hope to become familiar with it soon said andy coloring suppose you sweep out to begin with he pointed out the broom and andy went to work i wish he were a more agreeable man thought andy i am afraid he will make my position unpleasant here a customer came in and mr rich was occupied for the next ten minutes the customer a lady bought a gold chain shall i send it asked the clerk yes but not till twelve oclock to what address she gave a number on fiftysixth street very well there will be an errand for you said rich as he put back the chains not selected andy nodded he felt that he would rather be absent on an errand than in the company of simon rich where did mr flint pick you up inquired rich this was rude but andy felt that it would not be politic to get into a quarrel with the head clerk so soon we met at lunch he said where at the sinclair house had you never seen him before no queer that he should engage you at such short notice he was acquainted with the gentleman i was with what name walter gale yes i have seen him are you related to mr gale no are you aware that the boy you have displaced john crandall is my nephew no sir i didnt know it i am sorry he has lost his place he is a good boy but mr flint became prejudiced against him did he say anything about him when he engaged you i believe he said that he was not satisfactory but as i did not know him i did not notice another customer came in and at nine oclock mr flint entered i see you are on hand he said pleasantly to andy yes sir when did you come to the city yesterday sir have you a boarding place yes sir in clinton place i was recommended to it by mr gale that is well mr rich this is the new boy so he told me said rich coldly have you had any customers yes sir there is one article to be sent a gold chain to mrs mason of fiftysixth street any time mentioned twelve oclock you can send andrew at that time very well sir andy was very glad of his employers presence it checked any manifestation of rudeness on the part of the clerk at quarter to twelve a box containing the chain was handed to andy addressed to mrs mason did you notice the lady who purchased the chain asked mr flint yes sir i wish this box placed in her hands ask her to give you a receipt for it yes sir here is money for car fare you may go to lunch after delivering the box yes sir andy took a broadway car and just after twelve reached the house the door was opened by a manservant i have a parcel for mrs mason said andy all right ill take it i am only to deliver it into her hands she isnt at home then i will wait for her she said she would be here at twelve the man was about to speak rudely when a lady mounted the steps are you from mr flint she asked yes madam i am mrs mason i remember you said andy bowing will you be kind enough to give me a receipt certainly step into the hall and i wont keep you waiting long andy sat down why didnt you give me the parcel boy asked the servant because you are not mrs mason i had strict orders to deliver it to her humph that is being mighty particular i have nothing to do with mr flints rules mrs mason returned almost immediately here is the receipt and thank you she said pleasantly andy bowed and opened the door to go out i am afraid i have interfered with your lunch she said i am going to it now thank you my lunch is just ready perhaps you will accept an invitation to lunch with me i shall be very glad to do so andy had been brought up as a gentleman and was not at all embarrassed as some boys would have been by this attention from a lady follow me then she said as she led the way downstairs to the front basement a small table was set there and mrs mason pointed to a seat you are my only guest she said my boy is out of town just at present shall i help you to some cold chicken thank you besides the chicken there was bread and butter some kind of preserve and hot tea it was all very plain but andy enjoyed it i ought to know the name of my guest said mrs mason my name is andrew grant have you been long at mr flints this is my first day i hope you will find the situation a pleasant one you are not a city boy no i came from arden they were waited upon at table by gustave the man who had treated andy rudely he did not look at all pleasant at having to wait upon the boy from flints and evidently considered his mistress very eccentric mrs mason gossiped pleasantly and evidently enjoyed her young company that is better than eating alone she said as she rose from the table i feel quite well acquainted with you andrew you must come up sometime when my boy is at home he is a year or two younger than you but i think you will get on together i shall be very glad to come replied andy gratefully thank you for all your kindness he went back to the store at once you are back early said mr flint yes sir mrs mason invited me to lunch and that saved time simon rich looked surprised his nephew had never received so much attention from a customer chapter xvii andys fellow boarders as time went on andy became sensible that simon rich was indeed no friend of his he was watched with a cold vigilance that was nothing less than a lookout for imperfections andy saw that it would be necessary for him to be unusually careful and attentive to his duties mr flint on the other hand was always kind and cordial notwithstanding the slighting words from mr rich one day when andy returned from lunch he found a boy talking with simon rich he recognized him as his predecessor the boy john crandall looked at him with an illnatured glance as simon rich did not see fit to introduce him he did not speak when rich went out to lunch john crandall accompanied him dont you think there is any chance of my getting back uncle simon asked john not at present that boy you saw seems to have the inside track with mr flint what sort of a boy is he hes too fresh i dont like him what made mr flint take him on heaven knows i dont do you think he is likely to stay not if i can help it cant you prejudice mr flint against him i will if i can i am looking for a chance to get him into trouble but it isnt easy as he is a goodygoody sort of a boy he tries to get in with people you know mrs mason of fiftysixth street yes i have carried purchases there the very first day he was here he went there with a chain and she invited him to lunch you dont mean it exclaimed john in surprise she never took any notice of me they went to the dairy restaurant on union square for lunch uncle simon said john when they were going out cant you give me fifty cents you know i havent a cent of money now that my salary is stopped what do you want fifty cents for demanded his uncle frowning i want to go to the grand opera house tonight i havent been to the theater for two weeks and you cant expect to while you are not earning anything but that isnt my fault pleaded john yes it is you neglected your duties at flints and he saw it that is why you lost your place it is pretty hard going about without a cent of money in your pocket then you should have kept your place have you been around to look for another position no i thought you would get me back into flints i dont think there is much chance but i will try to get the other boy out i hope youll do that i hate the sight of him i feel as if he had turned me out of my place how do you like the new boy mr rich asked the jeweler at the end of the first week i dont care much for him said simon rich coldly what is the matter with him does he neglect his work no rich admitted unwillingly what have you against him then he has a sneaking way about him on the contrary he seems to me to be unusually frank and open he is trying to get into your good graces well that is proper isnt it yes but well i think he will bear watching surely you dont suspect him of dishonesty still waters run deep said the clerk sententiously mr flint smiled to himself as he turned away he understood that the secret of his head clerks prejudice was the fact that andy had taken the place of his nephew meanwhile andy had got well acquainted at his boarding house besides mr warren he found his next neighbor sam perkins quite sociable sam was a youth of eighteen and was employed in a furnishinggoods store on lower broadway he was fortunate in the location of his store as he finished work at halfpast five and was able to be at supper at the regular hour he seemed rather fond of dress and indulged in a variety of showy neckties being able to get them at wholesale rates he introduced himself to andy the first evening what pay do you get he asked five dollars a week i get seven but its too small a man cant live on it why my car fare costs me sixty cents a week it must be rather a tight squeeze the folks at home allow me two dollars a week besides you see the governors got money but i tell you money melts away in new york no doubt there are a good many ways of spending money here suppose we go to the theater tonight i would rather wait a while this is my first night in the city have you got acquainted with old warren you mean the occupant of the large room opposite yes i have talked with him a little how do you like him i dont know him well enough to judge said andy cautiously hes a crank and soft at that pretends that he is literary and writes for the magazines he does doesnt he yes he writes for them but i dont think his articles get printed he just sits round and writes and isnt any company at all i have tried to get him to go to the theater but he wont once i was hard up hadnt but a nickel and asked him to lend me a quarter he wouldnt very likely he hasnt got much money thats right did you ever see such shabby neckties as he wears he hasnt your advantages about getting new neckties said andy with a smile for he had already learned where sam was at work how do you like the tie i have on its a stunner isnt it asked sam complacently its very showy i get a new necktie every week you see i get them at half price girls always notice your necktie then i dont think theyll pay me much attention your tie is too sober thats a fact better let me bring you one i can get it half off they wont know but its for me thank you i may by and by accept your offer now i dont want to spend any extra money at the table andy was introduced to a mr and mrs osborn who did not appear to be long married she was tall angular and thirtyfive he was at least five years younger he had married her for her money but she let him have little advantage of it dealing it out in small sums he occupied a small clerkship at eight dollars a week out of which he had to pay his own board while his wife who had an income from property of a thousand dollars a year defrayed her own expenses and occasionally allowed him a dollar or two he was much better looking than his wife and it was this perhaps that made her jealous if he looked at another woman the particular object of her jealousy was a miss manson who held a business position at an uptown milliners she was pleasant and piquant there was also a mr kimball who was a salesman at hearns he liked to discuss financial problems and felt that he should have been a banker but found no one to talk with as mr osborns ideas on finance were elementary indeed mrs osborn was the only one at the table who was competent to converse with him on his favorite subject miss manson may i pass you the sugar asked mr osborn on the first occasion of andys appearing at dinner miss manson can reach the sugar bowl herself interposed mrs osborn with a reproving frown i like to be neighborly my dear said her husband deprecatingly i see you do miss manson smiled and so did others at the table who detected mrs osborns jealousy have you read the presidents financial message mr osborn asked mr kimball no i dont take any interest in such things i have read it mr kimball said mrs osborn and i approve his recommendations so do i with one exception returned mr kimball and they began a conversation in which none of the other boarders took an interest when supper was over andy and sam went for a walk mr warren excused himself on the ground that he was writing a poem for one of the magazines so you are with a jeweler said sam i may come up and buy a ring some day do you allow a discount to friends i dont know yet i will favor you if i can chapter xviii a plot against andy some six weeks later about the middle of the forenoon a western union telegraph boy entered the store and handed mr flint a telegram tearing it open the jeweler read the contents and seemed quite agitated mr rich he said turning to the head clerk i have bad news my only brother is dangerously sick this dispatch says that if i wish to see him alive i must start at once where does he live in denver colorado that is a long way off yes i dont see how i can leave the business but i cannot bear to think of my brother dying without my seeing him again i think sir that i can keep things straight i have been with you for six years true and you know the business thoroughly besides you can write or telegraph me if need be every day i will do so sir you can depend on me besides you will have andrew to help you he is a good and faithful boy to this simon rich made no reply but there was a look on his face that boded no good for andy i think i will go home at once and get ready it is necessary that i should start immediately i shall have no time to give you directions but i will write you as soon as i reach denver very well sir said simon rich smoothly make your mind quite easy all will go well during your absence half an hour later when andy returned from an errand mr flint was gone i have a message for mr flint said andy as he entered the store you can give it to me i was told to deliver it to mr flint personally you will find that rather a hard job young man said rich with a sneer i dont understand you returned andy in surprise mr flint is on his way to denver by this time does he go on business he has received news that his only brother lies there at the point of death how long will he be gone asked andy who began to understand that this was likely to prove bad news for him probably not less than three weeks of course i shall manage the store while he is away did you hear that yes and i want you to understand continued rich in a bullying tone that i wont stand any nonsense from you you will have to attend strictly to business i shant be such an easygoing boss as mr flint i always aim to do my duty said andy you will find it best to do so while i am in charge now dont stand gaping there but go to work andy was moved to an angry reply but thought it prudent to refrain he realized that for three weeks and probably longer he was to be at the mercy of a man who evidently disliked him how he should be able to stand it he did not know he determined however to do his duty as well as he knew how and not to reply when the head clerk was insolent and abusive about an hour later simon rich gave him a postal which he directed him to drop in the nearest mail box it was addressed to john crandall andys predecessor and ran thus dear john come around as soon as you can i have news for you your uncle simon rich about four oclock john crandall entered the store andrew said rich you may go to the branch post office at ninth street and get a dollars worth of postage stamps andy understood that stamps were not needed and that the errand was devised to get him out of the way however it was his duty to obey when he was fairly out of the store john asked with some curiosity what is the news you were going to tell me uncle simon mr flint has started for colorado and i am in full charge of the store answered rich with a triumphant smile golly thats great news exclaimed john now you can discharge that cub and get me in again i mean to but you will have to wait a few days why need i because i must have a good excuse for bouncing him mr flint will inquire you know i should think it would be easy to invent one well not altogether easy but i have a plan you see the boy is one of the goodygoody kind who has no bad habits if i could catch him playing pool or anything of that kind there would be no trouble but he is one of your model boys like me suggested john i never took you for a model boy still you are my nephew and i must do the best i can for you what is the plan you have thought of i havent fully decided but come in tomorrow and i may think of something by that time i wish i was here now it will be good fun now that old flint is gone be careful not to say old flint before andrew he might repeat it to the boss when he returns if he should i would punch his head said john promptly i dont think i would advise you to do that said simon rich shrewdly why not i could lick him with one hand if you ever get into a fight with him you will need two he is strong and muscular you seem to be taking his part uncle simon not at all but i wont shut my eyes to facts andrew is much stronger than you are john did not look well pleased but his uncle added in this case however it is not a matter of strength we must use cunning all right uncle you know best of course of course i know best all you have to do is to be guided by me we must get rid of him in such a way that mr flint will approve of my action it will be a great day for me when i take his place exactly be patient and it will come about meanwhile i want you to treat him as a friend why so that he wont suspect that there is any conspiracy against him i see you are a smart one uncle simon i flatter myself that i know what i am about returned rich complacently andy was considerably surprised at the kindness with which he was treated during the next few days by the head salesman he had expected something very different he began to think he had misjudged mr rich he was still more surprised when the next day at his lunch hour he was invited to the dairy kitchen by john crandall he did not care to accept but john insisted upon it and he thought it would be rude to refuse john chatted very pleasantly during the meal and andy was both surprised and pleased have you got a new place he asked no but uncle thinks he can get me one before long i hope it will be a good one oh i think it will said john showing his teeth and smiling significantly so passed several days and andy began to think that mr rich had become his friend but at length the storm broke one day as he entered the store he noticed that simon rich was looking grave and stern andrew he said without preface something very disagreeable has happened what is it mr rich a gold watch has disappeared from this case a valuable one asked andy innocently it is one that retails at fifty dollars i would not have had this occur during mr flints absence for twice that sum have you any idea of what has become of it not at present but as you and my nephew are in the store so much of course you would have opportunities of taking it uncle simon said john who was present i insist on your searching me i will do so though i am sure neither you nor andrew is at fault search me too mr rich said andy fearlessly nothing was found on john but thrusting his hand into the upper pocket of andys vest simon rich drew out a folded paper what is this he cried a pawn ticket for a gold watch what does this mean let me see it said andy dumfounded it was a ticket issued by a third avenue pawnbroker for a gold watch on which ten dollars appeared to have been loaned the name of the borrower appeared as a grant miserable boy said the salesman severely so you have turned thief what a hypocrite you must be i dont know what it means faltered andy quite overwhelmed chapter xix andy is discharged you dont know what it means repeated simon rich in a sarcastic tone probably not i understand it do you think i stole a watch and pawned it mr rich demanded andy with spirit there seems to be absolute proof of your dishonesty will you explain how otherwise this pawn ticket is found in your pocket i cant explain it nor can i understand it all i can say is that i never saw it before you must think i am a fool to be deceived by such a story i cant believe that andy pawned a watch said john crandall hypocritically will you be kind enough to inform me who did then asked his uncle with pretended severity i cant guess nor any one else i fancy of course andrew after this proof of your dishonesty i cannot retain you in my or rather in mr flints employment mr rich will you do me a favor what is it will you go with me to the pawnbroker who issued the ticket and ask him if he ever saw me before i have no time to go on such a foolish errand can you give me the ten dollars you obtained for the watch i didnt obtain a dollar nor a cent for the watch i know nothing about it probably you have laid it away somewhere or spent it that is not true and i am sure you dont believe it yourself no impudence young man i am forced to believe it i have treated you kindly since mr flint went away and that is sufficient to show that i wish to do you no injustice is this true or not i have no fault to find with your treatment except now i shall continue to act as your friend i might have you arrested and your conviction would be certain with the evidence i have in my possession but i will not do it i will redeem the watch at my own expense and be content with discharging you i believe there is a plot against me said andy pale but firm it will come out some time when do you wish me to go at once i will pay you to the end of the week but i could not feel safe in retaining your services any longer john will you oblige me by taking andrews place till i have a chance to secure another boy yes uncle simon but i dont want to feel that i have had anything to do with andys discharge you have not no one is responsible for it but himself then i will stay while you need me i dont want to leave you in a hole simon rich went to the money drawer and drew out a fivedollar bill here is your pay to the end of the week he said i prefer to accept pay only to today replied andy as you please andy walked out of the store feeling crushed and overwhelmed he was all at sea concerning the pawn ticket he could not understand how it got into his pocket he formed a resolution he would go around to the pawnbrokers and see if he could obtain any information he found the pawn shop without difficulty it was a small apartment but seemed quite full of goods of all varieties a small man of perhaps sixty was behind the counter seated in a rockingchair sewing an old lady was to be seen in the rear of the shop andy had never before been in a pawn shop and would have been interested in examining it if his errand had not been so serious he walked up to the counter well young man what is your business asked the old man do you remember lending some money on a new gold watch last monday was the watch stolen asked the pawnbroker with shade of anxiety you will have no difficulty about it it will be redeemed how much did i lend on it ten dollars yes i remember can you remember who brought it in no except that it was a boy about your size did he look like me i cant remember you see i have so many customers i remember said the old lady speaking up he was about your size it was not i no he was thinner than you and he was dark complexioned a light began to dawn upon andy this description fitted john crandall do you remember what kind of an overcoat he wore it was a light overcoat thank you will you please remember this if you are asked did the young gentleman own the watch he was employed by another party but i cannot tell you any more at present the watch will probably be redeemed by a man about thirtyfive dont mention to him that any one has asked you questions about it all right i shall be glad to oblige you you are sure it was not stolen the man who sent the boy was not dishonest you will have no trouble it was a new watch and i thought it might be stolen we poor pawnbrokers have a hard time if we take stolen property we get into trouble but how can we tell if the rings and watches they bring in are stolen very true i can see that you must sometimes be puzzled do those who pawn articles generally give their own names very seldom they almost always give wrong names that sometimes leads to trouble i remember a gentleman who mislaid his ticket and he could not remember what name he gave if he had we might have overlooked the loss of the pawn ticket as it was we did not know but he might be a fraud though i think it was all right and the watch he pawned was his own thank you for answering my questions i am sorry to have troubled you said andy politely oh it is no matter rejoined the old man who felt very favorably impressed by andys good looks and frank open manner as andy went out of the shop he experienced a feeling of relief he saw that he would be able to prove his innocence through the testimony of the pawnbroker and his wife he was in no hurry it would do when mr flint returned he did not want the friendly jeweler to think that he had been dishonest it was clear that he was the victim of a conspiracy and that the plot had been engineered by simon rich and carried out by his nephew as andys board was paid by walter gale he would not be distressed by want of employment but would be able to remain in new york he might obtain another position though he foresaw that it would be useless to apply to simon rich for a letter of recommendation he had not gone more than a hundred feet when he met a boy whom he knew named james callahan how do you happen to be here andy he asked are you on an errand for the firm i have left them why is that they or rather the clerk charged me with stealing a gold watch and pawning it where asked the boy in some excitement andy pointed out the pawnbrokers shop from which he had just come i saw john crandall coming out of there yesterday you did yes i am not surprised the pawnbroker described to me the boy who pawned the watch and i recognized john from the description what does it all mean mr flint has gone out west and mr rich and john have conspired to get me into trouble when were you discharged less than an hour since who has taken your place john crandall james callahan whistled i see he said it was thundering mean what are you going to do about it wait till mr flint comes home give me your address i may want to call you as a witness callahan gave his number on ninth avenue i will note it down how are you going to get along while you are without a place asked james with friendly solicitude i have a friend who will pay my board good i am glad to hear it now thought andy i have a chain of proof that will clear me with mr flint that is what i care most about chapter xx an invitation to dinner andy reached his boarding house at four oclock what brings you home so early mr grant asked warren whose door was open is business poor it is with me answered andy i am discharged you dont tell me so how did it happen my employer is out west and the head salesman has discharged me and engaged his nephew in my place its a shame what shall you do about it wait till mr flint gets home i hope you wont leave us no i think not of course you will miss your salary i wish i could lend you some money but i have not heard from the article i sent to the century if accepted they will send me a large check thank you mr warren i shall be able to get along for the present soon sam perkins arrived with a new and gorgeous necktie glad to see you andy he said wont you go with me to the star theater this evening i cant sam i have no money to spare i thought you got a good salary just at present i have none at all i have been discharged i am sorry for that i wish there was a vacancy in our place i should like to get you in there thank you that is quite friendly andy was about to go down to supper when eva the servant came upstairs theres a messenger boy downstairs wants to see you mr grant she said in some surprise andy went downstairs to see the messenger he was a short boy of fourteen tom keegan by name i have a letter for andrew grant he said give it to me i am andrew grant heres a dime thank you said the boy in a tone of satisfaction for his weekly income was small andy opened the letter it was written on fashionable note paper at the top of the paper was a monogram formed of the letters h and m here is the letter my dear mr grant i shall be glad to have you take dinner with me at seven oclock i should have given you earlier notice but supposed you would not be back from the store till six oclock you will meet my son roy who is a year or two younger than yourself and my brother john crawford both will be glad to see you yours sincerely henrietta mason what is it andy asked sam you can read the note by george andy you are getting into fashionable society couldnt you take me along too i am afraid i am not well enough acquainted to take such a liberty ill tell you what ill do for you ill lend you my best necktie sam produced a gorgeous red tie which he held up admiringly thank you sam said andy but i think that wont suit me as well as you what are you going to wear andy took from the bureau drawer a plain black tie that exclaimed sam disgusted that is awfully plain it suits my taste excuse me andy but i dont think youve got any taste andy laughed goodnaturedly certainly my taste differs from yours he said i suppose youll have a fine layout id like to go to a fashionable dinner myself ill tell you all about it when i get back just mention that youve got a friend a stylish young man whom theyd like to meet that may bring me an invitation next time andy laughed so far as i am concerned sam he said i wish you were going but you have an engagement at the star theater so i have i almost forgot andy had very little time for preparation but made what haste he could and just as the public clocks struck seven he rang the bell of mrs masons house i am glad you received my invitation in time said the lady so am i returned andy nothing could have been more welcome just then roy and her brother mr crawford entered roy was a very pleasantlooking boy with darkbrown hair and a dark complexion he was perhaps two inches shorter than andy this is roy said mrs mason i am glad to see you said roy offering his hand andy felt that he should like his new boy friend next he was introduced to mr crawford a stout gentleman of perhaps forty looking very much like his sister i have heard my sister speak of you so often that i am glad to meet you andy he said affably thank you sir john lead the way to the dining room said his sister so they filed downstairs and took their seats at the table mr crawford sat at the head opposite his sister while roy and andy occupied the sides when dinner was nearly over mr crawford remarked i believe andy you are in the employ of mr flint the jeweler i was answered andy surely you have not left him exclaimed mrs mason no i have been discharged i am surprised to hear it i thought you were a favorite with mr flint so i was he does not know i have been discharged you puzzle me mr flint is in colorado and mr rich his head salesman has taken the opportunity to discharge me and put his nephew in my place but surely he would not venture to do this without some pretext he claims that i took a watch from the case and pawned it of course that is untrue yes and i am in a position to prove it when mr flint returns andy told the story of his visit to the pawn shop and the discovery he made there this is a shameful plot said mrs mason indignantly i am afraid you are in trouble deprived of your income fortunately i have no board to pay that is paid by the gentleman who procured me the situation presently they went upstairs roy said his mother we will excuse you for an hour while you are getting your latin lesson i dont like latin mother grumbled roy at least not tonight i am afraid i cant fix my thoughts on the lesson i want to be with andy what are you studying in latin roy asked andy caesar if you wish i will help you can you asked roy joyfully i have been through caesar and virgil also when i left the academy i was studying cicero roy will be glad of your help andy said his mother i did not know you were such a scholar i was getting ready for college but my fathers losses required me to break off andy proved such an efficient helper that roy found himself at leisure in half an hour in the meantime mrs mason asked her brother what do you think of my protege he seems a manly and attractive boy cant you find something for him to do i will talk with him presently and then decide chapter xxi new prospects after roy with andys assistance had prepared his lesson in caesar john crawford began to converse with him with a view of forming a judgment of his business qualifications are you especially interested in the jewelry line he asked no sir it was merely chance that led me to mr flints store i see you are a latin scholar what career did you expect to follow if your fathers misfortune had not interrupted your education i dont think i should care for a profession i prefer a life of business you have had no special business in view no sir i think i could adapt myself to any that i had an opportunity to follow what pay did you receive from mr flint five dollars a week i will tell you why i am inquiring i am in the real estate business in rather a large way i have a boy in the office who is not suited to his position he is a good scholar but has no head for business i have made up my mind to discharge him on saturday would you like his place very much sir i can only offer you five dollars a week but as soon as you make yourself worth more i will raise you that is quite satisfactory mr crawford as soon as mr flint returns i can get a recommendation from him i am quite sure i shall like your business better my sisters recommendation is sufficient thank you john said mrs mason if you become interested in the business and show an aptitude for it there will be a chance to rise it depends upon that if you only work for the money you wont rise i understand mr crawford and i am satisfied mother said roy i wish you would engage andy to come here evenings and help me with my lessons i should learn twice as fast besides i should like his company roy was an only child and it was the desire of his mothers heart that he should acquire a good education her means were ample and her disposition generous i dont know but andy would feel too tired after being in your uncles office all day to teach you in the evening she said would you andy asked roy no i should enjoy reviewing my old studies with you then i will engage you said mrs mason you can come here at eight every evening i will do so with pleasure and for compensation i will pay you as much as my brother does i wouldnt charge anything for helping roy said andy it would only be a pleasure to me andrew said mr crawford i am afraid you will never make a business man if you are willing to work on those terms my advice to you is to accept my sisters offer she can afford to pay you what she offers and you have your living to make i shall insist upon paying said mrs mason though i appreciate andys generous offer thank you very much with such an income i shall feel rich i am so glad you are going to help me andy said roy well have bully times i dont think julius caesar ever made use of such an expression roy said his uncle when do you wish me to come down to business mr crawford asked andy you may as well come tomorrow and get broken in before your regular engagement commences i shall be glad to do so for this week you need only stay till three oclock in the afternoon there isnt much doing after that when andy went home it will not be wondered at if he was in a state of exhilaration his discharge from the jewelers had turned out to his advantage his income was now ten dollars a week and he had no board to pay he certainly ought to lay up money he said to himself that now he would not go back to mr flints even if he had the chance when he entered his room he found sam perkins waiting for him i have been thinking andy he said that i might be able to get you into our store i will speak to mr chambers tomorrow there is no occasion sam though i thank you for your kind offer i have a place what already ejaculated sam in amazement what chance have you had to hunt up a place the place hunted me up answered andy with a smile i met a gentleman at dinner who offered to take me into his employment what business real estate what is the firm john crawford co i know of the house the office is on lower broadway it is a big firm i am glad of that how much are you to get five dollars a week wont you find it hard to live on that i have got another place too what do you mean i am to help a boy about his latin in the evening i shall get five dollars a week for that too what ten dollars a week in all you are right i give you credit for your mathematical talent why andy you are born to good luck i wish i was paid ten dollars a week said sam rather enviously but i didnt know you understood latin you dont know how learned i am said andy smiling when will you get time for your pupil in the evening i am sorry for that i shant often meet you if you are to be occupied day and evening too we shall meet at breakfast and supper i shant leave here to go uptown till halfpast seven but you cant go to the theater i am willing to give that up for five dollars a week so would i be if i hear of any other boy who needs a latin tutor i will recommend you the next morning andy reported at mr crawfords office the office he found to be a large one consisting of three rooms one of them small and appropriated to mr crawfords special use in the outer rooms were two or three clerks and a boy the last james grey was a goodnatured looking fellow but he had no force or efficiency he had already received notice that he was to be discharged on the coming saturday i suppose you are coming in my place said he to andy i suppose so i am sorry that i shall be throwing you out of a position oh you neednt mind i am to be telephone boy at an uptown hotel my cousin got the place for me i am glad of that it will be a soft snap i think what are the hours i go on at five oclock in the afternoon and stay till midnight will you like that oh well i can lie abed the next morning till ten or eleven oclock and i wont have much to do when i am on duty i shall buy a lot of dime novels and that will fill up the time how do you like the real estate business oh soso i guess ill like being a telephone boy better andrew you may go round with james and he will give you a little idea of your duties said mr crawford james you can go to the post office now all right sir i hope you will soon get another place i have got one already sir indeed i am very glad i am to be a telephone boy i wish you success as they walked to the post office together james remarked mr crawford is a nice man but i guess i dont hustle enough for him i think i can hustle said andy then youll suit him on saturday night when james was paid his salary he received five dollars extra as a present andy thought this very kind and considerate on the part of his new employer to his surprise he too was paid half a weeks salary something he did not expect chapter xxii john crandall seeks to injure andy though simon rich had succeeded in reinstating his nephew in the store in place of andy he was not altogether happy john crandall was naturally lazy and inefficient and his temporary discharge did not seem to have improved him when sent out on errands he loitered and had more than once put his uncle to considerable inconvenience he obliged to admit to himself that andy had been more satisfactory in the midst of this experience john preferred a request to have his salary raised a dollar a week you know very well that i have no authority to raise your wages said his uncle sharply why not uncle simon you have taken me back on your own authority and i begin to think that i have made a great mistake perhaps youd like to have the country boy back again i am not sure but i would he did not stay away so long on errands as you do i wonder what he is doing said john starting off on a new tack i dont suppose he can get a new place if you see him you might ask him to call said simon rich why asked john suspiciously i may discharge you and take him back in that case i will tell mr flint about pawning the watch simon rich looked at his nephew with anger mingled with dismay he began to see now that to a certain extent he had put himself in johns power you treacherous young rascal i have a great mind to wring your neck he said wrathfully uncle simon observed john significantly i guess youd better not act hastily what a fool i was to put myself in the power of that cub soliloquized the head salesman john saw the effect of his words and decided to follow them up dont you think you can raise my wages he asked no i dont you will be lucky if you stay here till mr flint comes back after that i cant protect you he will probably be angry to see you back here i shall have to tell him that i took you in temporarily now i will give you some advice if you want to remain here permanently turn over a new leaf and work faithfully in that case i can speak well of you and mr flint may be induced to retain you john began to think that this might be good advice and for a day or two paid more attention to his duties i wonder i dont see andy somewhere he said to himself i am out a good deal and i ought to meet him he is probably hunting up positions it was not till tuesday afternoon that he did see him andy had been sent to the st denis hotel to meet a customer of the firm as he came out he fell in with john john was the first to see him hello andy he exclaimed how are you getting along pretty well thank you i suppose you havent struck a job yet oh yes i have you have ejaculated john in surprise what kind of a job i am in a large real estate office down town did they take you without a recommendation no my uncle wouldnt give you one i wouldnt ask him for one who did recommend you then mrs mason of west fiftysixth street i know she is one of our customers yes probably she hasnt heard of your being suspected of pawning a watch from our stock you might tell her perhaps i shall john said to himself what pay do you get five dollars a week i didnt think you would get a place andy smiled i presume mr rich did not care to have me get another place he thought you would have to go back to the country i am better off than when i was in the jewelry store said andy how are you getting along oh firstclass i hope you will be able to keep the place i didnt know but you might be wanting to come back i wouldnt go back if i had the chance john was pleased to hear this he was afraid that mr flint might not be satisfied with his uncles explanation and that somehow the truth might come out you must excuse me now said andy i ought to go back to the office at once john returned to the jewelers full of excitement whom do you think i met just now uncle simon he asked andy yes did you speak with him yes i suppose he is hunting for a place no he has got one where is he working in a real estate office down town he is getting five dollars a week i didnt think he could get a place without a recommendation he was recommended by one of our customers mrs mason i see well that is lucky for him simon rich spoke indifferently he was rather glad that andy had found a place as mr flint would be less likely to find fault with his dismissal not so john he had never forgiven andy for superseding him and he felt aggrieved that he had so soon found employment thinking it over there came to him a mean suggestion he might be able to get andy discharged from his present place as his uncle seemed indifferent and might not approve of his contemplated action he decided to say nothing about it that evening after supper he made his way up to west fiftysixth street and sought out the residence of mrs mason he rang the bell can i see mrs mason he asked what name shall i mention say it is a boy from mr flints mrs mason received the message in some surprise what could a boy from flints have to say to her however she entered the parlor where john crandall was waiting to see her you are from mr flints she asked yes maam what business can you have with me i have bought no jewelry lately i know it mrs mason it isnt about jewelry i wish to speak what then i met today a boy who was lately employed by our firm andrew grant well he said you had recommended him to a real estate firm down town i did so perhaps you didnt know that he had been discharged from our place for dishonesty i begin to understand thought mrs mason and she sat down and examined john curiously did he steal anything yes maam answered john glibly he took a watch a gold watch out of the case and pawned it that was bad and you have come up to tell me of it you are very considerate did mr rich send you or do you come of your own accord i came of my own accord i thought you were deceived in the boy what do you think i ought to do i thought you would take back the recommendation and get the boy discharged can you wait here half an hour while i consider what is best to be done oh yes maam i guess ive put a spoke in his wheel thought john in about half an hour the door opened and to johns amazement andy walked in you here he gasped yes i hear you have been warning mrs mason against me i thought she ought to know that you were sent away from our store in disgrace i have something to say to you said andy quietly i have been to the pawnbrokers and got a description of the boy who pawned the watch john turned pale i see you understand andy went on who did it so do i and so does mrs mason you wont make anything by your attempt to injure me goodevening john crandall left the house without a word he began to be alarmed suppose andy tells flint he soliloquized no matter he cant prove it but he felt uneasy nevertheless he did not say anything to his uncle about his visit chapter xxiii mr flints return mr crawford was something more than an ordinary real estate dealer he was thorough and painstaking in whatever he undertook in his private office he had a library of volumes relating to architecture practical building real estate law etc this andy discovered and he asked his employer if he might borrow books therefrom mr crawford seemed pleased but he asked do you think you will feel any interest in such dry volumes i shall not read for interest but for improvement answered andy if i am to follow up this business i want to find out all i can about it you are an unusually sensible boy said mr crawford i am sure you will succeed i mean to if it is possible from this time john crawford felt an added interest in andy and took pains to push him forward and gave him practical information about real estate how do you like andy john asked mrs mason not long afterward he is a treasure he does credit to your recommendation i am very much pleased to hear you say so i consider him a remarkable boy roy gets much higher marks at school since andy began to help him in his lessons one day andy was sent up to the grand central depot on an errand he arrived just as a train came in from the west what was his surprise to see mr flint getting out of a parlor car mr flint he cried joyfully andy exclaimed the jeweler it seems pleasant to see a home face but how do you happen to be up here at this time did mr rich send you then you have not heard began andy heard what that i have been discharged from your store when did this happen asked the jeweler abruptly about two weeks ago rich never wrote me about it who is in your place john crandall his nephew the boy i discharged yes sir mr flints face assumed a stern look this will have to be explained he said what was the pretext for discharging you dishonesty he charged me with stealing a gold watch and pawning it ridiculous then you dont believe me guilty certainly not thank you mr flint tell me the circumstances please excuse me now mr flint i am in a real estate office and am on an errand if you like i will call at your house and explain in the meantime i will let mr rich give you his version call this evening andy it will have to be between seven and halfpast seven as i have a pupil in the evening come to supper at my house as soon after six as possible very well sir mr flint had telegraphed to simon rich of his coming but through some mistake the telegram did not reach him so that he was quite taken by surprise when his employer entered the store i had no idea you were anywhere near new york mr flint he said didnt you get my telegram from buffalo mr rich no sir i hope you are well just then john crandall came in from an errand you here said the jeweler where is andy grant i was obliged to discharge him replied rich nervously why very much to my surprise i discovered that he had stolen a gold watch from the case what evidence had you of it i found the pawn ticket in his pocket he pawned it on third avenue this surprises me very much said the jeweler quietly andrew did not strike me as a dishonest boy i was amazed sir i could hardly believe my eyes what led you to search for the ticket i knew that the watch must have been taken either by him or john who came into the shop occasionally i accordingly searched both and you found the ticket in andrews pocket yes sir what did he say did he admit the theft no he brazened it out but of course the evidence was overwhelming so you discharged him yes i did not dare to have him remain and you engaged your nephew in his place yes sir john happened to be here and knew something of the duties so i engaged him temporarily subject of course to your approval where is andrew now have you seen him since john saw him one day where was it john on broadway near the st denis hotel he said he had a place where in a real estate office i suppose you gave him no recommendation mr rich no sir i couldnt do it conscientiously of course now that you have returned if you are dissatisfied with johns being here we can advertise for another boy i will take a day to consider it i shall only stay here half an hour and then go up to the house when mr flint left the store simon rich said the old man took andys discharge more quietly than i anticipated do you think he will let me stay uncle simon i cant tell yet one thing i must tell you you wont stay long unless you turn over a new leaf and attend to your duties ill do that never fear what i am afraid of is that andy will come around and tell a lot of lies i dont think it will work you see the pawn ticket was found in his pocket he cant get over that very well john knew more than his uncle of the nature of andys defense and he could not help feeling apprehensive soon after six oclock andy made his appearance at mr flints house where he was cordially received i have heard the story of mr rich andy he said now let me have your defense i can give it very briefly the watch was pawned by john crandall of course it was given him by mr rich how did you find that out i went around to the pawnbrokers and obtained a description of the boy who pawned the watch it tallied exactly with johns appearance that was not all i met the same day a boy named jimmy callahan he saw john coming out of the pawnbrokers the day before the charge was made against me that is pretty conclusive can you explain how the ticket was put in your pocket no sir that puzzles me it could easily be done no doubt now do you want to return to my employ no sir i think not i am in a real estate office and i think there is more chance for me to rise how did you obtain the position through mrs mason of west fiftysixth street she has been a very good friend to me the gentleman who employs me is her brother i shall be sorry to lose you andy but i wish you to consult your own interest as to john crandall i shall discharge him at once i will not permit him to profit by the conspiracy against you can you stay this evening no sir i am helping mrs masons son roy in his latin lessons for this i am paid five dollars per week you seem to be very well provided for i must say yes sir i have been fortunate the next day mr flint notified simon rich that he was acquainted with the manner in which evidence had been procured against andy then he turned to the nephew the watch was pawned by you john he said under the direction of your uncle no sir said john if andy grant has told you this he has told a lie the matter is easily settled come around with me to the pawnbrokers john stammered and finally confessed of course i cannot retain your services after this you mr rich may remain till the end of the month i shall then feel obliged to make a change never were two conspirators more quickly punished simon rich repented bitterly yielding to the temptation to injure andy his malice had recoiled upon himself chapter xxiv andy makes an investment andy wrote to his friend walter gale who it will be remembered was watching in pennsylvania by the bedside of his uncle giving him an account of his change of business he received the following reply i felt indignant when i read your news of the conspiracy of simon rich but was pleased that it led to your advantage i am inclined to think that you will find your new business a better one than the jewelry trade the latter if you went in for yourself would call for a large capital in the real estate business capital is not so much needed as good judgment and a large lot of acquaintances i am not personally acquainted with mr crawford but know him by reputation as an energetic and honorable business man if you do not find your income adequate all you have to do is to apply to me i will send you fifty dollars or more at any time now as to the prospects of my return they are remote my uncle seems cheered by my presence and his health has improved he cannot live more than a year or two at the best but when i came here it seemed to be only a matter of months i shall remain while i can do him good when mr flint returns he will do you justice you can afford to wait as your income is larger than before you suggest that i need not continue to pay your board this however i intend to do and will advise you to lay aside some money every week and deposit in a savings bank the habit of saving is excellent and cannot be formed too early i am lucky to have such a friend reflected andy as he finished reading this letter i will try to make myself worthy of such good fortune at the end of six months andy had acquired a large practical acquaintance with the real estate business he displayed a degree of judgment which surprised mr crawford you seem more like a young man than a boy he said i am not at all sure but i could leave my business in your hands if i wished to be absent this compliment pleased andy he had also been raised to seven dollars a week and this he regarded as a practical compliment one evening on his return from west fiftysixth street he strayed into the fifth avenue hotel where he sat down to rest in the reading room two men were sitting near him whose conversation he could not help hearing i own a considerable plot in tacoma said one i bought it two years since when i was on my way back from california i should like to sell the plot if i could get a purchaser if the northern pacific railroad is ever completed the land will be valuable replied the other true but will it ever be completed that date will be very remote i fancy i dont think so i would buy the land myself if i had the money but just at present i have none to spare how much did you invest a thousand dollars you might sell perhaps through a real estate agent the real estate agents here know very little of western property i should not know to whom to apply andy thought he saw a chance to procure business for his firm gentlemen he said will you excuse my saying that i am in a real estate office and think you can make some satisfactory arrangement with us at the same time he handed the owner of the tacoma property a card of the firm crawford repeated his friend yes that is a reputable firm you cannot do better than adopt the young mans suggestion andy grant had written his name on the card you are rather young for a real estate agent mr grant remarked the lot owner andy smiled i am only a subordinate he said has your principal ever dealt in western property asked mr bristol not to any extent but i have heard him speak favorably of it i will call at your office tomorrow forenoon then andy apprised mr crawford of the appointment made i shall be glad to see your acquaintance andy said mr crawford i have advices from a friend of mine in washington that the railroad is sure to be completed within a short time this land will be worth buying have you any money i have a hundred dollars in a savings bank answered andy then i will give you a quarter interest in the purchase and you can give me a note for the balance which at present you are unable to pay i am sure we shall make a good deal of money within a short time and i want you to reap some advantage as it will have come to me through you thank you sir i shall be very glad to have a share in the investment about eleven oclock james bristol who proved to be a resident of newark new jersey presented himself at the office and was introduced by andy to mr crawford andy has told me of your business said the real estate agent you have some property in tacoma yes i was persuaded to invest in some two years since now i need the money do you think you can find me a customer what do you ask for it a thousand dollars the same price i paid is it eligibly situated if the town ever amounts to anything it will be in the business part how many lots will it divide into twentyfive of the usual city dimensions then i think i will take it off your hands part i will reserve for myself and a part i will allot to a friend can you pay me cash yes i will make out a check at once mr bristol breathed a sigh of satisfaction i dont mind telling you he said that i am very glad to realize on the investment i have to meet a note for five hundred dollars in three days and i was at a loss to know how to raise the money then the transaction will be mutually satisfactory rejoined mr crawford well andy said his employer when his customer left the office we are now western land owners i will draw up a note which i will get you to sign for a hundred and fifty dollars and you can assign to me the money in the savings bank i shall expect interest at the rate of six per cent i shall be very glad to pay it sir it was a satisfaction to andy to think that he had made an investment which was likely ere many years to make him golden returns he began to read with interest the accounts of the growth and development of the west and decided to be unusually economical in the future so as to be able to pay up the note due to mr crawford that he might feel that he owned his western property without incumbrance while andy as a rule dressed neatly there was one respect in which he did not win the approval of his neighbor sam perkins i should think a boy with your income would be more particular about his neckties said sam whats the matter with my neckties sam are they not neat yes but they are plain such as a quaker might wear why dont you get a showy tie like mine andy smiled as he noticed the gorgeous tie which his friend wore i dont like to be showy he said youll never attract the attention of the girls with such a plain tie as you wear now when i walked on fifth avenue last sunday afternoon as many as twenty girls looked admiringly at my tie that would make me feel bashful sam let me bring you one from the store like mine you shall have it at the wholesale price no i think not it wouldnt be as becoming to me as to you i dont want to be considered a dude i dont mind it next week im going to buy a pair of patent leathers they will be really economical as i shall not have to spend money on shines one saturday afternoon when andy was walking through one of the quiet streets west of bleecker his attention was drawn to a small boy apparently about eleven years old who was quietly crying as he walked along the sidewalk he had never seen the boy before that he could remember yet his face wore a familiar expression chapter xxv squire carters relatives andy was kindhearted and the boys evident sorrow appealed to him he went forward and placed his hand on the boys shoulder what is the matter he asked i went to the bakers to buy some bread for mother and the baker tells me that the quarter is a bad one let me look at it the coin had a dull appearance and a greasy feeling it was unquestionably counterfeit yes it is bad said andy is your mother poor very poor answered the boy this quarter was all the money she had and now we shall have no supper whom do you mean by we my little brother and myself andy intended at first simply to give the boy a good coin for the bad one but he saw that there was a call for something more do you live near here he asked yes sir just across the street i will go back with you to the bakers and then i will go with you to see your mother perhaps i can help her the boy put his hand confidingly in andys and the two went a little distance to the bakers now make your purchases said andy if you have brought back that bad quarter i wont take it announced the baker sharply i will pay you said andy quietly then its all right the boy brought me a very bad quarter i have to look sharp for a good many bad coins are offered me andy produced a genuine silver piece and the bread was handed to the boy with the change the boy looked at it hesitatingly it is yours he said to andy no i have changed quarters with you i will keep the bad one again he looked at the boy and again the resemblance to some familiar face puzzled him what is your name he asked ben carter carter that explained it the boy looked like conrad carter though he had a pleasanter expression have you an uncle philemon he inquired how did you know asked the boy in surprise because you look like conrad carter he is my cousin and you are poor yes your uncle is considered rich i know he is but he wont do anything for mother andy was now all the more desirous of seeing the boys family i know your uncle he said do you think he knows you are so poor yes for mother has written to him by this time they had reached the place which ben called home go upstairs and i will follow said andy they went up two flights and the boy opened a door at the top of the landing there was a woman not far from forty in the room on her face was a look of settled sorrow at her knee was a small boy five years of age she looked at andy inquiringly mother said ben here is the bread i couldnt have bought it for the quarter was bad if this boy had not given me another quarter this young gentleman corrected the mother no mrs carter i am a boy and i prefer to be called so i came up with ben for i find that he is related to squire carter of arden whom i know very well you know philemon carter yes he lives in arden that is my birthplace mrs carters countenance fell philemon carter was my husbands brother she said but there is little friendship between us he is reputed rich and we are poor i see you wonder at that when my husbands father died philemon was executor it was understood that he was worth twentyfive thousand dollars yet of this amount my poor husband received but one thousand i may be uncharitable but i have always felt that philemon cheated us out of our rightful share i should not be surprised i never liked squire carter he always seemed to me to be a selfish man he has certainly acted selfishly toward us does he know of your poverty yes only two weeks since in a fit of despair i wrote to him for help here is his answer she handed a letter to andy he instantly recognized the handwriting of the magnate of arden shall i read it he asked yes do so and let me know what you think of it this was the letter sophia i have received your letter and am surprised that you should expect me to help support you you are my brothers widow it is true but your destitution is no fault of mine my brother was always shiftless and unpractical and to such men good luck never comes he might at any rate have insured his life and so made comfortable provision for you you cannot expect me to repair his negligence you say you have two boys one eleven years of age he is certainly able to earn money by selling papers or tending an office as for myself i am not a rich man but have always been careful to meet my expenses and provide for the future i too have a son conrad whom i think it my duty to educate and start in life any money i might send you would be so much taken from him i advise you to apply to some charitable society if you need temporary assistance it will be much better than to write me begging letters yours truly philemon carter this is a very coldblooded letter said andy indignantly he might at least have inclosed a fivedollar bill he inclosed nothing i shall never apply to him again philemon carter is considered to be one of the richest men in arden he is taxed for twentyfive thousand dollars and is probably worth double that sum people wonder where he got all his money a part of it is my husbands rightful share of the estate i have no doubt can you do nothing about it how can i i am poor and have no influential friends he denies everything i will think of that mrs carter i know a lawyer down town who may some time look into the matter for you in the meanwhile is there any special work you can do before i was married i was for a time a typewriter i will see if i can hear of a situation of that kind the lawyer i spoke of may require an operator i would thankfully accept such a position does ben earn anything he makes a little selling papers he ought to be going to school at his age if i could get any work to do i would send him mrs carter will you accept a little help from me andy drew a fivedollar bill from his pocketbook and tendered it to the widow but she said can you spare this it is a large sum and you are only a boy probably not earning much i am a boy but i am handsomely paid for my services besides i have good friends to whom i can apply if i run short of money heaven bless you said mrs carter earnestly you cannot tell how much good this money will do me this morning i was utterly discouraged i felt that the lord had forsaken me but i was mistaken he has raised up for me a good friend who hopes to be of a good deal more service to you i must leave you now but i shall bear you in mind and hope soon to be the bearer of good tidings i will take down your address and call upon you again soon will you allow me to offer you a suggestion certainly then send out and buy some meat this dry bread is not sufficient for you dont be afraid to spend the money i leave with you i will see that you have more as andy left mrs carters humble home he felt more than ever the cold and selfish character of the man who himself living luxuriously suffered his brothers family to want chapter xxvi mr warren and his success andy told mr crawford about the poor family he had visited and what he had done to help them you must let me refund the money andy said his employer five dollars is a good deal for a boy to give dont forget that i have a double income mr crawford i would prefer that this money should come from me if you are willing to give another five dollars it will be appreciated then i will make it ten will you take charge of this bill and give it to mrs carter with the greatest pleasure mr crawford you have no idea what happiness it will give the family i am glad you called my attention to their needs if i could do anything more to help them you can if you know any one who wants a typewriter is the boy able to work a typewriter no but the mother is before her marriage she was in a lawyers office that is a fortunate suggestion i have a college friend a classmate at columbia mr gardner who has just parted with his typewriter who is about to be married may i call at his office and ask for the situation for mrs carter yes it is on nassau street andy seized his hat and went over to the lawyers office it was nassau street in the vanderbilt building he went up in the elevator and found mr gardner in i come from mr crawford said andy he says you need a typewriter are you a typewriter no i ask for the position for a lady and he told the story you say she has had experience in a lawyers office yes sir that will make her more desirable when can she call i will have her here tomorrow morning at any hour say ten oclock a little before perhaps the lawyer was a pleasantlooking man of medium age and andy felt sure that he would be a kind and considerate employer after office hours and before going up to his pupil andy called at the humble home of mrs carter the widows face brightened as she saw him you are my good friend she said you are welcome my employer mr crawford sends you this and andy displayed the bill it is a godsend it will enable me to pay my rent due on saturday and give me three dollars over but that is not all i have procured you a situation as typewriter in a lawyers office you will have to be on hand tomorrow morning a little before ten the office is mr gardners at nassau street i can hardly believe in my good fortune i will be there can you leave the children i will ask my neighbor mrs parker to look after them what a good young man you are she exclaimed gratefully not young man boy corrected andy with a smile wont you stay and take a cup of tea thank you mrs carter but i have an evening engagement oh by the way i forgot to say that mr gardner will pay you ten dollars a week i shall feel rich i shall no longer be worried by thoughts of starvation some time you might consult mr gardner about your brotherinlaws withholding your share of the estate he will be able to advise you andy felt a warm glow in his heart at the thought of the happiness he had been instrumental in bringing to the poor family he had learned the great lesson that some never learn that there is nothing so satisfactory as helping others we should have a much better world if that was generally understood the next day andy received a letter from his stanch friend valentine burns he read it eagerly for it brought him some home news and in spite of his success he had not forgotten arden and his many friends there this was the letter dear andy how long it seems since i saw you you know that you were my most intimate friend and of course i miss you very much to be sure there is conrad who seems willing to bestow his company upon me as my father happens to be pretty well off but i look upon conrad as a snob and dont care much about him when we met yesterday he inquired after you whats your friend andy grant doing in the city he is in a real estate office i replied humph how much does he get paid five dollars that is probably more than he earns but it isnt much to live upon i didnt care to tell him that you had another income but said dont you think you could live on it i couldnt live on ten dollars a week said conrad loftily but then i havent been accustomed to live like andy grant it must be pleasant to you to know that conrad feels so much interest in your welfare sometimes i see your father he looks careworn i suppose he is thinking of the difficult position in which he is placed i am sorry to say that last week he lost his best cow by some disease i heard that he valued it at fifty dollars i hope that you wont let this worry you the tide will turn some time i saw your mother day before yesterday she is glad of your success but of course she misses you she always receives me very cordially knowing that we are intimate friends i wish i could see you andy you have no idea how i miss you i like quite a number of the boys but none is so near to me as you were well andy i must close come to arden soon if you can it will do us good to see you and i think even conrad will be glad as it will give him a chance to pump you as to your position your affectionate friend valentine burns so father has lost his best cow old whitey said andy thoughtfully if i were not owing money to mr crawford for the land in tacoma i would buy him a new one but some time i hope the land will be valuable and then i can make the loss good to father the reader has not i hope forgotten andys fellow lodger s byron warren mr warren was always writing something for the century the atlantic or some other leading magazine but never had been cheered by an acceptance the magazine editors seemed leagued against him but one evening when andy returned from the office he found mr warren beaming with complacence you look happy tonight mr warren he said yes answered the author look at that he held out to andy an eightpage paper called the weekly magnet and pointed out a story of two columns on the second page under the title andy read by s byron warren it was called the magicians spell a tale of sunny spain i congratulate you said andy when did you write the story last winter how does it happen to be published so late you see i sent it first to scribners then to harpers and then to the atlantic they didnt seem to fancy it so i sent it to the magnet i hope they paid you for it yes answered warren proudly they gave me a dollar and a half for it isnt that rather small well it is small but the paper is poor the editor wrote to me that he would be glad to pay me ten dollars for such a sketch when they are more prosperous i suppose you will write again you must feel greatly encouraged i have been writing another story today i shall mail it to them tomorrow i hope the magnet will prosper for your sake thank you i hope so too ah andy you dont know how it seems to see your own words in print said the author i am afraid i never shall mr warren i was not intended for an author oh i think you might write something said warren patronizingly no i shall leave the literary field to you chapter xxvii andy makes a commission mr crawford was busy in his office when a gentleman of fifty entered i hope you are at leisure crawford he said but i am not mr grayling i am unusually busy i wanted you to go out and show me that house in mount vernon which you mentioned to me the other day my wife is desirous of moving from the city for the sake of the children wont tomorrow do tomorrow i shall be busy myself today is so fine that i managed to get off cant you manage to go no grayling i cant possibly be spared from the office is there no one you can send with me mr crawford hesitated a moment then as his eye fell upon andy he had a sudden thought i will send this young man he said mr grayling smiled he seems quite a young man he said yes said mr crawford with an answering smile he is several years short of forty if you think he will do i shall be glad of his company wait five minutes and i will give him the necessary instructions have you ever been in mount vernon andy asked his employer yes sir i have a boy friend there and i once spent a sunday there mr grayling wishes to purchase a residence there i shall place him in your charge and give you an order for the key i will mention some points to which i wish you to call his attention andy was pleased with the commission it seemed like a step in advance thank you mr crawford for your confidence in me if you succeed in selling the house to mr grayling i will give you one per cent commission i will do my best sir i have no claim to anything except through your kindness now let me see how much business ability you have andy and the prospective purchaser took the cars at the grand central station and in forty minutes found themselves in mount vernon at the depot much to his satisfaction andy found his friend tom blake what brings you here andy asked tom in surprise i have come to show the griffith house to this gentleman can you direct me to it i will go with you thank you tom you will be doing me a favor is it far little more than half a mile shall we walk or ride mr grayling walk by all means it is a charming day and a walk will do me good they reached the house it was a spacious country residence in good condition and mr grayling was favorably impressed the key was procured and they entered the interior bore out the promise of the exterior the rooms were well and even handsomely finished they were twelve in number and there was a goodsized bathroom i wonder if the plumbing is good said mr grayling i will test it as far as i can said andy you seem to have a good deal of experience for one so young no sir not very much but i have made a careful study of the subject mr crawford has a good architectural library and i have made use of it after a careful inspection andy made a favorable report of course he said if i am mistaken we will make matters right that will be satisfactory what is your price for the house eight thousand dollars mr grayling after a brief consideration said that seems reasonable i will buy the house how soon can you give me possession in a week very good then our business seems to be concluded we will catch the next train back to the city would you mind giving me a memorandum stating that you will buy the house i will do so we will stop at a stationery store and i will make it out when andy reentered mr crawfords office the real estate agent inquired how does mr grayling like the house he has bought it is it possible at what figure eight thousand dollars good i was authorized to take two hundred dollars less if need be he asked no reduction i hope he wont change his mind he wont here is his written agreement to take the house excellent did he offer this assurance no sir i asked for it andy you have succeeded admirably i shall have great pleasure in keeping my promise and paying you eighty dollars or one per cent on the purchase money that will be very acceptable mr crawford i dont often earn eighty dollars in one day in reply to mr crawfords inquiries andy gave a detailed account of his visit and his employer drew a check for eighty dollars which he placed in his hands now that i see what you can do he said i shall send you out again perhaps you will find my services too expensive no in addition to my regular percentage i receive an extra hundred dollars for getting the full eight thousand dollars andy cashed the check and deposited the money in a savings bank he did not pay it to mr crawford on account of the land in tacoma for it occurred to him that he might have occasion to use it in this he proved correct three weeks later he received a letter from his father sterling grant was a farmer little used to writing letters and andy knew that there must be some special reason for his writing at this time he opened the letter quickly and this was what he read dear andy i am in trouble next tuesday the semiannual interest on squire carters three thousand dollars falls due and i have but twenty dollars to meet it my crops have not been up to the average i have lost my best cow and somehow everything seems to have gone against me i expected to sell ten tons of hay and have had but seven to spare this alone made a difference of sixty dollars i saw the squire yesterday and told him how i was situated i asked him if he would kindly wait for the greater part of the interest accepting twenty dollars on account he at once refused i am sorry you have been unlucky mr grant he said but of course i am not responsible for your misfortune the three thousand dollars i lent you i regard strictly as an investment had i supposed the interest would not be paid promptly i should of course have declined to lend you will have to meet the interest or take the consequences i have tried to borrow the money in the village but thus far i have been unable to do so i may have to sell two of my cows but that will cripple me for as you know i depend a good deal on selling milk and butter of course this worries me a good deal i dont know why i write to you for with your small pay it is hardly likely that you can help me still if you have ten or fifteen dollars to spare it will aid me if your friend mr gale were near at hand perhaps he would advance a little money i might get along with selling one cow in that case two would cripple me let me know at once what you can do that i may make plans your mother is as well as usual except that she is worried we both send love your affectionate father sterling grant when andy read this letter he felt with a thrill of joy that he had it in his power to relieve his father from anxiety he had with the commission received recently from mr crawford a hundred and fifty dollars in the bank he withdrew eighty dollars of this and then explaining to mr crawford his reason for it asked for time for a visit home certainly andy said the real estate agent can i lend you any money no sir i have enough as he could not leave till the next day he telegraphed his father in this way dont worry i shall reach home tomorrow andy chapter xxviii andys visit home when andy stepped on the station platform at arden he looked about him to see if any of his friends were in sight to his great satisfaction he saw valentine burns who had come to escort an aunt to the cars where did you drop from andy he asked in surprise from the city i am going to stop over sunday good i am delighted to see you and i to see you you are my dearest friend except conrad valentine smiled of course no one is so near to me as he well whats the news the only news i know of comes from conrad i hope it isnt true what did he say that your father couldnt pay the interest on the mortgage held by his father and was going to be turned out though the squire might take your two best cows and call it even he seems to be a good friend of the family doesnt he remarked andy quietly it isnt true is it it is true that father hasnt money enough to pay the interest what will happen then you forget that he has a rich son said andy with a smile can you help him out that is what i am here for i am very glad to hear it said valentine with an air of relief even if i didnt like your family i wouldnt like to see conrad triumph over you come around this evening val we shall have plenty to talk about i will when andy entered the farmhouse he received a warm welcome from his mother and a cordial grasp of the hand from his father who was less demonstrative but there was an air of grave anxiety on the faces of both i am glad to see you andy said sterling grant but i wish you had come under more cheerful circumstances we are in a good deal of trouble i have come to get you out of it can you asked the farmer in surprise yes how much have you got toward the interest only twenty dollars and the whole sum is ninety dollars i can give you the seventy dollars you require where did you get the money have you borrowed it no it belongs to me i will explain later now i am hungry and while mother is looking for some lunch for me we will talk about other matters i am very much relieved andy i will go and tell the squire i shall be able to meet the interest dont do it father we will leave him to suppose it will not be paid and see what course he intends to pursue dont breathe a word to undeceive him i will do as you say andy though i dont know your object do you still like your place in new york yes i am learning the business fast and have good hopes for the future mr crawford is an excellent man and takes an interest in me that is good after all things are brightening when i got up this morning i felt about discouraged i telegraphed you not to worry father meanwhile mrs grant was preparing an appetizing lunch for her son she knew just what he liked when it was placed on the table he did full justice to it it tastes better than anything i get in the city mother he said i didnt suppose our plain table would compare with city meals theyre not in it with you said andy i am only afraid i shall make myself sick by overeating mrs grant was greatly pleased that andy had not lost his taste for home fare how you have grown andy she said and you are looking so well too do you have to work very hard hard work agrees with me mother no i dont hurt myself i wish i could be here when the squire comes for the interest andy said later he will call this evening you will see him said sterling grant then i shall be sure to stay at home meanwhile at the house of squire carter there was a conference between father and son conrad had a new and bright idea he had always coveted andys boat which as we know was much better than his own had been it occurred to him that here would be a good opportunity to get it for a trifle pa he said will you do me a favor what is it asked his father suspiciously you know i havent got a boat now wont you let mr grant pay part of the interest in andys boat what do i want with the boat asked the squire impatiently pa you can make a great bargain i hear that it cost seventyfive dollars you can allow the farmer twenty dollars and sell it for forty dollars cash i dont know about that but the squires tone was less decided he liked a bargain and he knew that there was some reason in what conrad said mr grant might not feel at liberty to sell his sons boat he argued andy would let him he thinks a good deal of his family ill think of it but i intended to propose taking two of his cows that you can do next time probably he wont have the interest six months from now ill see about it there is one other thing you would have a better chance to sell the boat for a profit than the cows well conrad i will think of it as i said i am going around to farmer grants this evening and i will broach the subject later in the day conrad met jimmy morris have you heard the news conrad asked jimmy what is it andy grant is in arden he arrived from the city this morning i am glad to hear it why are you and andy such great friends it isnt on account of friendship its on account of business what business i cant tell you but you will very likely hear soon conrad hoped to meet andy and broach the subject of buying the boat he decided from his knowledge of the farmers son that much as he valued his boat he would be willing to sacrifice it for the sake of his father in this thought he paid an unconscious tribute to andy for in similar circumstances he would have been incapable of anything so unselfish about halfpast seven andy looking out of the window saw the stately and dignified figure of squire carter coming up the front path the squire is coming father he said i want you to look sober just as if you were unprepared to pay the interest squire carter had already been informed by conrad that andy was in the village he showed no surprise therefore when he saw him he had also been down to the river and taken a look at andys boat he could see that it was a very handsome one and doubtless worth as much as conrad reported so you have come home andrew he said yes squire carter you havent lost your place have you no sir i have come home on a visit ahem you arrived at an unfortunate time for your father he has had bad luck things seem to have gone against him so i heard sir if you had been at home to help him on the farm things would have been different maybe i hope to help him by staying in the city that isnt very likely i dont approve for my part of boys leaving home to work i think i shall succeed in the end sir ahem i have no doubt you think so but boys like you havent much judgment i suppose you know that interest is due on the mortgage for the first six months and that your father cant meet it i have heard so squire carter as a friend of your father i have a plan to propose that may make things easy for him i am glad to see you for a part of my business is with you chapter xxix the interest is paid andy was surprised by the squires words he could not conjecture what business squire carter could have with him first said the squire may i ask mr grant whether you can pay the interest on the mortgage which i hold when it comes due i have only twentyfive dollars at my command now squire carter perhaps something may turn up between now and next tuesday that is extremely likely said the squire in a tone of sarcasm have you anything to propose are you willing to wait a month no sir i am not it will be extreme folly on my part do you expect to come into a fortune within thirty days no sir so i presume however i have a plan to propose i did intend to say that i would allow you fifty dollars for your two best cows but even that would not pay the deficit i believe your son owns a boat i do said andy looking up he began to understand the squires plan i am willing to allow twenty dollars for it as my son has taken a fancy to it and his own boat was destroyed through the malice of a tramp this with fifty dollars for your two cows would pay the interest all but twenty dollars which you say you are able to pay in cash squire carter my cows are of a choice breed and are worth fifty dollars each they would not fetch that sum indeed twentyfive dollars each is all that you would have any chance of getting if you doubt it you may try to get an offer elsewhere what should i do without the cows i depend on the butter and milk i obtain from them for a good part of my cash income that is your lookout said the squire shrugging his shoulders you dont appear to have much consideration for me business is business mr grant you owe me ninety dollars if you cant pay me in one form you must in another i would like to say a word squire carter said andy the boat for which you offer twenty dollars cost mr gate seventyfive i dont believe it i have his word for it very likely but it wouldnt be the first case where a man overstated the price of his purchase mr gale would not deceive me in that way have it as you like the boat is secondhand now and worth far less than when it was new persisted the squire there is considerable difference between twenty dollars and seventyfive well i might stretch a point and call it twentyfive as conrad is desirous of having the boat in that case there would be five dollars coming to you which you would doubtless find very handy i think i shall have to decline your offer squire carter and leave your poor father in trouble i thought better of you squire carter was surprised to find that both andy and his father were cool and apparently not suffering anxiety he had thought they would be sad and would resort to entreaties does it strike you squire carter that you are trying to drive a very hard bargain with my father and myself you offer a very low sum for the cows and for my boat if you can get more anywhere else you are quite at liberty to do so said the squire in a tone of indifference he felt that father and son were in his power and that he would have his own way in the end i dont think we shall sell at all said andy calmly what ejaculated the squire not sell at all do you think i will allow the interest to remain unpaid the interest will be paid how where will you get the money i will supply my father with what he needs you talk like a fool said the squire sharply do you think i will allow myself to be humbugged by a boy no sir but you can rely upon what i say have you borrowed the money from mr gale i have not seen mr gale for several months he does not know of my fathers pecuniary trouble if he did i think he would come to his and my assistance as to the boat i value it not only on account of its intrinsic worth but because he gave it to me conrad cannot have it squire carter was much irritated besides he did not believe that andy would really be able to furnish his father with the help he needed i am not easily deceived andrew grant he said it is useless for me to remain here any longer i will only say that if the interest is not paid on tuesday next your father must take the consequences he is ready to pay it now before it is due if you will give him a receipt wh what ejaculated the squire in amazement i mean what i say father will you give the squire writing materials and ask him to make out a receipt is this straight are you really able to pay the interest now yes sir you need have no fear on that score when my father wrote me about his difficulty i procured the money and i have it here half incredulous squire carter made out the receipt and a roll of bills was handed to him he counted them carefully and put them in his wallet the money is correct he said stiffly i am glad you are able to pay it thanks to andy here said his father with a grateful look at his son all is well so far but if your son has borrowed the money it will have to be repaid i didnt borrow it squire carter do you mean to say that you have been able to save it up out of your boys wages i received it from my employer for special services squire carter left the house not altogether satisfied he had received his interest but he had hoped to profit by the farmers needs and get what would have been of considerably greater value than the money in this he had been disappointed but six months hence interest will be due again he reflected by way of consolation this time the grants were lucky but wont be so all the time besides when the mortgage falls due it will take more help than the boy can give to settle it when the squire reached home he found conrad waiting to see him well pa he said am i going to have the boat no answered his father shortly why not you said you would get it for me they wouldnt sell then how will they pay the interest it is paid already conrad opened his eyes wide with amazement where did the money come from the boy advanced it to his father you must be joking pa where could andy get ninety dollars he only had to supply seventy as to where it came from i cant tell you had better ask him so i will its a shame i cant have the boat he wants too much for it how much does he want i dont know if he will let you have it for thirty dollars you can buy it thank you pa its the same as mine a boy like andy cant afford to refuse thirty dollars i dont know he seems a mighty independent sort of boy conrad lost no time in trying to purchase the boat of andy but of course without success i would rather keep it myself was the reply but you cant use it not at present perhaps but i may be able to some time besides mr gale gave it to me and i shouldnt be willing to part with it at any rate i wouldnt sell for thirty dollars never mind conrad said his father when the next interest is payable andrew will probably be glad to accept your offer andy enjoyed the short visit home he managed to see the boys with whom he was most intimate and promised to look out for positions in the city for two of them at home his presence was a source of comfort and joy to his mother it gladdened him to see the bright look on her face which had been grave and anxious when he arrived on monday morning he set out for new york on an early train feeling that his visit had been in every way a success several boys were at the station to see him off but among them he did not perceive conrad carter chapter xxx an unexpected proposal three months later when andy entered the office one morning he found mr crawford in a thoughtful mood i wish you were older andy he began abruptly why sir because i have a commission i could then intrust to you then i am too young for it now i am afraid so and yet but i will tell you what it is and see if you consider yourself equal to it how old are you now seventeen sir i will explain myself i am intimately acquainted with the men who are engineering the northern pacific railroad and i have reliable advices that work will at once be resumed on it and probably the road will be completed in less than a year i suppose this will raise the price of our land in tacoma precisely still i think it will not be advisable to sell for some time to come my object is rather to buy more land i should think it would be a good idea the time to buy is now before the public learn of the probable early completion of the railroad if i could spare the time from my business i would go out there at once i should think it would pay mr crawford doubtless it would but i cannot arrange to leave now i expect to have some large transactions in real estate during the next two or three months i see the difficulty sir i will come to the point do you think you could go to tacoma look carefully over the ground and secure desirable lots for me i think i could sir under instructions from you that is what i had in view when i said i wished you were older you could at any rate rely upon my faithfully carrying out your instructions i am sure of that and i also have considerable confidence in your good judgment at any rate i will take the risk what day is today thursday make preparations to start on monday can you do so yes sir andy felt a thrill of delight at the prospect held out to him he had always felt a strong desire to see the great west but had realized that he should probably have to wait a good many years before his wish was gratified it had been a dream but now his dream bade fair to become actuality i will prepare a general letter of instructions and make such suggestions as may occur to me continued mr crawford i will excuse you from office work for the balance of the week in order that you may make the necessary preparations as the northern pacific road was not completed it was decided that andy should go to san francisco by the union pacific and central pacific roads and take steamer thence to puget sound you can stay in san francisco three days said mr crawford considerately it will give you a chance to rest and see the city on monday andy started on his long journey he wrote a brief letter to his mother as follows dear mother i am going west on some business for mr crawford i will write you on the way you are at liberty to tell this to any one in arden but i dont care to have the extent of my journey known you may think i am young for such a trip but i have no fears the business is important but it is simple and i hope to carry it through successfully in haste your loving son andy however mrs grant was not the first one to hear of andys trip it so happened that at the station andy met conrad carter who had just come into the city for a day how do you happen to be here asked conrad in surprise i am leaving the city i suppose you are discharged and going home remarked conrad loftily no i am going on some business for my employer how far do you go my first stop will be chicago conrad was amazed is this straight he asked yes you are going on business for the firm yes mr crawford must be a fool why to send an ignorant country boy to chicago andy smiled mr crawford has succeeded very well in business and i dont think he is a fool he must be infatuated with you if he is that is lucky for me how long do you expect to be away i cant say i cant tell how long it will take me to transact my business i wish pa would let me go to chicago said conrad enviously you are a poor boy and yet you travel more than i your time will come conrad has your employer given you much money to travel with i am to draw on him for what i want say wont you write me a letter from chicago i wish i had known you were going i would have asked pa to let me go with you andy was amused at conrads change of front he knew very well that conrad was no more his friend than before but that his notions were strictly selfish however he promised to write to him if he could get time and made the promise in good faith i wish valentine were going with me he thought but i should not enjoy conrads company andys journey to chicago was uneventful about two hours before the train arrived a tall man left his seat on the opposite side of the car and seated himself beside andy goodmorning he began i suppose like me you propose to stop in chicago for about twentyfour hours answered andy and then you go on further yes sir how far i cannot tell you definitely answered andy who thought it wise to be on his guard could you oblige me with small bills for a ten i am owing a dollar to the porter andy took out a largesized wallet from an inner pocket and opened it it contained about fifty dollars in bills of different denominations i am afraid i cannot accommodate you he said unless two fivedollar bills will answer your purpose i am afraid it wont help me i am sorry said andy politely he did not observe the covetous glance of the stranger as he noted the large wallet and its contents it occurred to him afterward that his companion had not produced the bill he wished changed oh well said the stranger carelessly it doesnt matter i can get the bill changed at the depot are you traveling on business he inquired yes sir so am i i represent the firm of arnold constable in new york doubtless you have heard of them oh yes they are well known i have been in their employ for five years before that i worked for claflin indeed you do not mention the name of your firm no i am traveling on private business for the head of the firm ah yes i dont wish to be inquisitive you do right to keep the business to yourself you see it is not my business just so you are young for a business agent that is true but i am growing older every day exactly so good joke andys companion laughed quite heartily rather to the surprise of his young acquaintance i am very glad to have met you you see i am very social and cant stand being alone by the way where do you stop in chicago at the sherman house good hotel i have stopped there often still there is nothing as homelike as a private house i have a friend living in the city who keeps a firstclass boarding house and only charges transient guests a dollar and a quarter a day i wish you could be induced to go there with me at the hotel you will have to pay three or four dollars now andy was naturally economical and thought it would be praiseworthy to save money for mr crawford he inquired the location of the boarding house and imprudently decided to act on his companions proposal chapter xxxi the trap andy left the depot with his new acquaintance who gave his name as percival robinson and following his lead boarded a horse car which took them both a distance of three miles to the southern part of the city as they went on dwellings became scattering your friends house seems quite out of the way said andy yes but chicago is a city of distances it really doesnt make much difference where you stop street cars will carry you anywhere still it would be pleasanter to be centrally located but by going some way out you get cheaper accommodations that is true thought andy and i have time enough at length robinson signaled to the conductor to stop andy followed him out of the car they seemed to be in the very outskirts of the city robinson led the way to a rather shabby brick house standing by itself it was three stories in height this is where my friend lives he said walking up the front steps and ringing the frontdoor bell two minutes later the door was opened by a redhaired man in his shirt sleeves hello tom he exclaimed i thought his name was percival andy said to himself my young friend and i will stay overnight with you said robinson all right come in a door on the left was opened and andy saw a sanded floor and on one side of the room a bar go in there a minute said robinson while i speak to my friend andy went in and picked up a copy of the clipper from the table the only paper in the room in five minutes the two returned ill take your gripsack said the man in shirt sleeves i will show you to your room they went up two flights of stairs to a room on the third floor it was a small apartment about ten feet square with a double bed in one corner i guess youll both be comfortable here said the landlord i think i would rather have a room to myself said andy by no means satisfied sorry we cant accommodate you but the house is full it didnt look so but then the lodgers might be out andy thought for a moment he would go downstairs and take a car back to the central part of the city but he was afraid his action would seem strange and he made no objection i guess well get along together said robinson in an easy tone andy didnt think so but he found it awkward to make objections i will take a wash he said seeing that the pitcher on the washstand contained water all right returned robinson just make yourself at home ill go downstairs youll find me there left alone andy reproached himself for his too ready yielding to the plans of his companion he wondered why he had done so mr crawford didnt ask me to be economical he reflected he is willing i should pay ordinary prices at a hotel i think i have been very foolish however i am in for it it will serve as a lesson to me which i will remember hereafter he looked out of the window there was a lot behind the hotel if it was a hotel covered with ashes tin cans and other litter i am sure thought andy this isnt the kind of hotel mr crawford wished me to stay at when he had washed he went downstairs as he passed the door of the barroom he saw mr robinson inside sitting at the table with a bottle and a glass before him come in grant and have some whisky he said thank you but i dont care for whisky perhaps you would prefer beer i dont care to drink anything thank you you dont mean to say youre a temperance crank yes i think i am oh well do just as you please by the way it is the rule here to pay for board in advance how much is it a dollar and a quarter please said this redhaired man who stood behind the bar andy paid over the money i thought perhaps you would stay more than one day no i have little time i shall have to leave tomorrow i think mr robinson i will go out and take a walk all right supper will be ready in two hours andy nodded he had a great mind to go upstairs and get his gripsack then he would be able to go where he pleased he went out and began to walk about in the neighborhood of the hotel it did not seem to be a very pleasant quarter of the city and it was certainly a good distance from the center i shant learn much about chicago if i stay here he thought again he execrated his folly in so weakly yielding to the representations of a man he knew nothing about he walked for half an hour and then returned slowly there didnt seem to be much to look at and his walk had no interest for him not far from the hotel he met a welldressed boy and was impelled to speak to him do you live near by he asked no but i have an uncle living in that house over there i came to spend the day with my cousins i am a stranger in this city i met a man who took me to that brick house he recommended it as a cheap boarding place do you know anything about it i know that it has a bad reputation will you tell me what you know about it you will be doing me a favor the bar does a good business in the evening i have heard of several cases where men who put up there complained of being robbed thank you i am not much surprised to hear it have you taken a room there yes i am afraid i was foolish i hope you wont be robbed thats all i should like to get out but i am afraid if i come downstairs with my grip they would try to stop my going where is your room at the back part of the house looking out on the lot ill tell you what you can do said the other boy after a moments thought have you paid anything for your room yes but i dont mind that then drop your grip out of the window ill catch it i will then you can take a car and go down into the city do you know the way to the sherman house certainly if you will go there with me ill make it worth your while all right i was just about going home anyway then ill go upstairs and get my bag andy went to his room opened the window and looking down saw his new boy friend are you ready he asked yes you neednt try to catch it theres nothing in it that will break fling her out andy did so now come down youll find me here an hour later supper was served percival robinson and three other men likewise patrons of the barroom sat down the landlord himself was one of the party where is the kid he asked i saw him go out an hour ago said one of the guests he has probably come back and is in his room said robinson i will go up and call him he went upstairs quickly and entered the room assigned to andy and himself it was empty the boy has taken a long walk he said to himself then he looked about for andys grip it occurred to him that he would have a good opportunity to examine its contents he started in surprise and dismay for the grip was gone he must have given me the slip he exclaimed did any one see the boy go out with his gripsack he asked as he returned i saw him go out but he had nothing in his hand answered the landlord well hes gone bag and baggage returned robinson very much annoyed at any rate he has paid his bill said the landlord complacently bother his hotel bill muttered robinson roughly i meant to have a good deal more than that have you any idea where he has gone i think he may have gone to the sherman house ill go there after supper and see if i can find him chapter xxxii a critical moment guided by his boy companion andy found the sherman house and registered there the change was a very satisfactory one and he enjoyed the comfortable room to which he was assigned after a hearty supper he took a seat in the office and watched with interest the crowds that surged in and out of the hotel presently he saw a familiar figure entering it was his late companion percival robinson the latter was not long in recognizing the boy he walked up to the chair on which andy was seated and addressed him with a look of anger so i have found you have i he said roughly andy knew that this man had no right to interfere with him and answered coolly so it seems why did you play me such a mean trick boy my name is andrew said andy with dignity what right have you to speak to me in this manner ill tell you presently you have made a nice return for my kindness i know of no kindness you got acquainted with me on the train and took me to a house where i didnt care to stop why didnt you care to stop there because i found that it didnt have a good reputation my employer wouldnt care to have me stay at such a house you are mighty independent for a young boy i want you to return the pocketbook of which you relieved me andy was startled at this reckless charge what do you mean he demanded hotly you know that this is a falsehood well see if you will brazen it out if you dont give me back the pocketbook which i have no doubt you have in your pocket at this moment i will have you arrested andy began to feel nervous he was a stranger in chicago there was no one to identify him or vouch for his honesty what if this man should carry out his threat and have him arrested however andy had pluck and didnt intend to surrender at discretion this conversation had attracted the attention of two or three guests of the hotel who were disposed to look with suspicion upon andy his accuser appeared like a man of good position being well dressed and with an air of assurance one old gentleman who was fond of giving advice said reprovingly my boy you will find it best to hand the gentleman his pocketbook it is sad to see one so young guilty of theft perhaps the boy is not guilty suggested another guest i am in the employ of a gentleman in new york said andy and this man is scheming to rob me you are perfectly shameless said robinson encouraged by what the old gentleman had said i will give you just five minutes to return my pocketbook or i will have you arrested andy felt that he was in a tight place but his wits had not deserted him as you claim the pocketbook he said perhaps you will tell how much money there is in it i cant tell exactly replied robinson i spend money liberally and i have not counted the money lately that is quite reasonable said the old gentleman i dont know how much money there is in my wallet what is there besides money in the pocketbook asked andy following up his advantage i think there are a few postage stamps answered robinson at a guess you certainly have a good deal of assurance young man said the old gentleman in a tone of reproof if i were in this gentlemans place i would summon a policeman at once i prefer to give the boy a chance said robinson who had his own reasons for not bringing the matter to the knowledge of the police i dont want to get him into trouble i only want my money back you are more considerate than he deserves said andys critic and by the way here is the hotel detective officer will you come here please here is a case that requires your attention the hotel detective a quietlooking man approached robinson was far from thanking the old gentleman for his officiousness he feared recognition what is the matter asked the detective coming up and eying robinson sharply the old gentleman volunteered an explanation the detective seemed amused so this man charges the boy with robbing him he asked yes sir and we all believe that he has good grounds for doing so i dont believe it said the gentleman who had already spoken for andy what have you to say my boy asked the detective turning to andy only that i made the acquaintance of this man on the train he induced me to go to a small hotel on the outskirts of the city on the ground that i could board there cheaply what i saw and heard there excited my suspicions and i left the place without his knowledge taking my pocketbook with you i incautiously laid it on the bed when i went up later i found that it and you had disappeared do you hear that officer asked the old gentleman triumphantly i do answered the detective then turning to robinson with a change of tone he asked how did you get so much money tom maitland robinson turned pale he saw that he was recognized i will let the matter drop he said i dont want to get the boy into trouble he turned toward the door but the detective was too quick for him you will have to go with me he said you have been trying a bold confidence game i shall have to lock you up gentlemen said robinson turning pale will you permit this outrage it is an outrage said the old gentleman hotly my friend inquired the detective do you know this man no but then let me introduce him as tom maitland one of the cleverest confidence men in chicago he produced a pair of handcuffs which he deftly slipped over the wrists of percival robinson and led him out of the hotel andy was satisfactorily vindicated and it must be admitted enjoyed the discomfiture of the old gentleman who slunk away in confusion when andy set out on his journey he intended to go to tacoma by way of san francisco but found as he proceeded that he could go by the northern pacific as far as it was built and proceed the rest of the way by stage and over puget sound this seemed to him to afford greater variety and he adopted the plan some hundreds of miles east of his destination he took the stage it was rather a toilsome mode of traveling but he obtained a good idea of the country through which he was passing at that time stage robberies were frequent nor have they wholly ceased now among the stage robbers who were most dreaded was a certain dick hawley who had acquired a great reputation for daring and was known to have been engaged in nearly twenty stage robberies as they approached that part of the route in which he operated there was a great anxiety manifested by the passengers and especially by a thin cadaverouslooking man from ohio do you think we shall meet dick hawley today driver he asked i cant say sir i hope not how often have you met him three times did he rob the stage every time yes were there many passengers on board asked andy nearly ten every time and they allowed one man to rob them wait till you meet him said the driver shrugging his shoulders if he stops the stage i shall die of fright said the cadaverouslooking man i know i shall have you a good deal of money with you asked a fellow passenger i have ninetyseven dollars and a half answered the other soberly better lose that than die if you give it up there wont be any danger of bodily injury the cadaverouslooking man groaned but did not reply gradually they ascended for they were among the mountains till they reached a narrow ledge or shelf scarcely wider than the stage on one side there was a sheer descent of hundreds of feet and great caution was requisite just at the highest point a horseman appeared around a curve and stationed himself directly in front of the stage with a revolver pointed at the driver stop and give up your money or i fire he exclaimed it was the dreaded highwayman dick hawley chapter xxxiii a sudden tragedy the driver pulled up short the passengers realized that something had happened and the nervous man put his head out of the window instantly a change came over his face we are all dead men he groaned it is the highwayman andy felt startled in spite of his pluck and so did the other passengers i would jump out and confront the scoundrel said a determinedlooking man but there is no room we are on the verge of a precipice what will happen exclaimed the cadaverouslooking man in an agony of terror i suppose we shall be robbed that will be better than tumbling over the precipice oh why did i ever leave home i dont know ask me something easier said the resolute man in disgust such a man as you ought never to stir from his own fireside stop the coach and pass over your watches and pocketbooks cried dick hawley in a commanding tone by way of exciting alarm and enforcing his order he fired one charge of his revolver the consequences he did not anticipate the terrified stage horses alarmed by the report got beyond control of the driver and dashed forward impetuously the highwayman had hardly time to realize his danger when his horse was overthrown and pushed over the precipice along with its rider while the stage dashed on the last that the passengers saw of dick hawley was a panicstricken face looking upward as he fell rapidly down toward the rocks at the bottom hes gone we are saved exclaimed the cadaverouslooking man joyfully that is if the coach doesnt tumble after him but the coach was saved had the horses swerved in their course all would have been killed as it was the dangerous place was safely crossed and the stage emerged upon a broad plateau the driver stopped the horses and dismounting from the box came around to the coach door i congratulate you gentlemen he said we had a close shave but we are out of danger dick hawley will rob no more stages driver you are a brave man you have saved us said one of the passengers it was not i it was the horses then you did not start them up no i should not have dared to do it they were frightened by the revolver and took the matter into their own hands dick hawley was foolhardy had he ever stopped a stage at this point before yes he did so last year and succeeded yes he made a big haul this time he has met his deserts there were no further incidents that deserve recording in andys journey it is needless to say that he enjoyed it the scenes through which he passed were new and strange to him it was a country he had never expected to see and for this reason perhaps he enjoyed it the more at last he reached tacoma it was irregularly built on a hillside there were no buildings of any pretensions all its importance was to come he put up at the tacoma house a hotel of moderate size and after dinner he went out to see the town he sought out the plot of lots owned jointly by mr crawford and himself and found that they were located not far from the center of the business portion of the town it took no sagacity to foresee that the land would rise in value rapidly especially after the northern pacific railroad was completed in the afternoon feeling tired he sat in his room and read a book he had picked up at a periodical store a book treating of the great northwest the partitions were thin and noises in the adjoining room were easily audible his attention was drawn to a sound of coughing and a groan indicating pain it was evident that the next apartment was occupied by a sick man andys sympathies were excited it seemed to be a forlorn position to be sick and without attention in this remote quarter after a moments hesitation he left his own room and knocked at the other door come in was the reply in a hollow voice andy opened the door and entered on the bed lay a man advanced in years with hollow cheeks and every appearance of serious illness i am afraid you are very sick said andy gently yes i have an attack of grip i am afraid i will have to pass in my checks oh it isnt as bad as that said andy in a reassuring tone have you no one to take care of you no everybody here is occupied with schemes for moneymaking i cant get any one to look after me for love or money then you have no near friend or relative in tacoma no nor i may say anywhere else i have a niece however in syracuse she is at school she is the only tie the only one on whom i have any claim if you need money began andy feeling a little delicate about offering pecuniary assistance no i have no need of that kind i suppose i look poor for i never cared about my personal appearance but i am one of the largest owners of real estate in tacoma besides having some thousands of dollars in a san francisco bank but what good will it all do me here i am sick and perhaps near death i will do what i can for you said andy i am myself a visitor in tacoma i came on business for a new york gentleman i am authorized to buy lots in tacoma when you are better i will make you an offer for your land if you care to sell help me to get well and you shall have it on your own terms you will need some one besides myself do you authorize me to hire an attendant yes i shall be glad to have you do so i begin to hope for recovery through your assistance i had given myself up for lost then i will go out and see what i can do do you authorize me to pay liberally for the service of a nurse pay anything fifty dollars a week if necessary i can afford it i will go out at once i will see if i can buy some oranges andy left the hotel and walked toward the steamboat wharf it was deserted except by two persons a young man of thirty bronzed by exposure to the weather who looked like a farmer stood beside a plain cheap trunk on which sat a woman somewhat younger who had a weary and anxious look the young man her husband doubtless seemed troubled goodafternoon said andy pleasantly are you in any trouble is there anything i can do for you well my boy im in a tight place i came here from iowa with my wife expecting to meet a cousin who had promised to get me employment i find he has left tacoma so here i am with less than five dollars in my pocket and no prospect of work im not a coward but i dont mind saying im afraid to think of what will become of us an idea came to andy here was a chance to secure a nurse is your wife used to sickness he asked could she take care of a sick man the woman brightened up i took care of my father for a year she answered im a middlin good nurse shes the best nurse i know of put in her husband all right then i can find you employment an acquaintance of mine an old man as old probably as your father is sick with grip at the tacoma house he will pay you liberally can you come with me at once yes and be glad to come then you will be paid twentyfive dollars a week why thats a fortune said the woman amazed come with me at once and your husband can follow at his leisure maria thats what i call a streak of good luck said her husband overjoyed go along with this young man and ill get a cheap room somewhere in town ill take the trunk along with me he shouldered the small trunk and his wife went off with andy in a few minutes she was installed in the sick chamber and soon showed that she understood her business a doctor was sent for and seth johnson for this was the sick mans name was soon made comfortable he ratified andys bargain and paid besides for mrs grahams board at the hotel he did not gain rapidly for his strength was at a low ebb but he improved steadily the husband found employment in a couple of days and their temporary despondency gave place to hope and courage youve done better for me than my cousin would have done andy said graham a few days later youve set me on my feet and im not afraid now but ill get along chapter xxxiv seth johnsons gift it was four weeks before seth johnson became convalescent his system was run down and he was in a very critical state when found by andy careful nursing saved him when able to get out he accompanied andy to show him his lots the plot was about as large as mr crawfords but was a little further from the center of the town it would make about twentyfive lots of the average size how much will you take for the entire plot asked andy i dont want to sell the whole said johnson i thought you meant to leave tacoma for good so i do but i propose to give onefifth of the land to a friend then let me know how much you will take for the remaining fourfifths will five thousand dollars be too much i will buy it at that figure said andy promptly you dont ask me to whom i intend to give the fifth which i reserve it is probably no one whom i know on the contrary it is one whom you know well it is yourself andy looked his amazement but how have i deserved such a gift he asked you have saved my life if you had not found and befriended me i should not have been living at this moment all that a man hath will he give in exchange for his life the bible says i dont give all but i give merely onefifth of my land i have ten thousand dollars besides in san francisco i am deeply grateful to you mr johnson i am a poor boy and this unexpected gift will help me to carry out some plans for the benefit of my father who is in an embarrassed condition i advise you not to sell the land till you can sell at an advanced price i shall not do so when the northern pacific is completed i am sure lots will be much higher to be sure you are young and can wait i am old and i have no particular desire to make money i have enough to see me through when andy started for new york he had the company of seth johnson it was agreed that the final arrangements for the transfer of the lots should take place in mr crawfords office they reached the city without adventure and andy with his new friend reported at his employers i hope you are satisfied with what i have done mr crawford said andy thoroughly so you have made a good purchase i shall pay you five hundred dollars as an acknowledgment of the service you have rendered me but mr crawford mr johnson has already given me five lots true but this is his gift not mine you must not be afraid of becoming too rich you will need all your money yes sir but not for myself i can now relieve my fathers anxiety do you intend to tell him the amount of your good fortune i will only tell him of your gift on the basis of the sum which mr crawford paid for the other fourfifths andys share of mr johnsons land amounted to twelve hundred and fifty dollars but when three months later active operations for the extension and completion of the railroad commenced it could easily have been sold for double but andy was too sagacious to sell in a year his fathers mortgage would be payable and he wanted to be prepared for that meanwhile andy devoted himself with energy to mastering the details of the real estate business perhaps because he now himself owned real estate he became very much interested in it he was not able often to visit arden but he never let a week pass without writing a letter home it was usually addressed to his mother as his father was more accustomed to guiding the plow than the pen he also heard occasionally from his boy friends no letters were more welcome than those of valentine burns about three months before the mortgage became due he received the following from valentine dear andy i wish i could see you oftener but i know you are busy and getting on that is a great satisfaction to me your last letter informing me that you had been raised to fifteen dollars a week gave me much pleasure i wanted to tell conrad only you didnt wish to have me he is getting prouder and more disagreeable every day he really seems to have a great spite against you though i cannot understand why i met him the other day and he inquired after you he hasnt been to arden lately he said no i answered he is too busy probably he cant afford the railway fare said conrad i think he is getting good pay i said i know better he isnt getting over six dollars at most said conrad did he tell you so i asked no but i heard on good authority he replied i wish i were getting that i said you wouldnt want to live on it he rejoined well perhaps not i admitted he wont long have a home to come back to said conrad after a pause why not i inquired my father holds a mortgage on his fathers farm and it will fall due in three months he answered surely he wont foreclose surely he will returned conrad old grant will have to leave the farm and go to the poorhouse or at any rate to some small place like the sam martin house it contains four rooms and is good enough for a bankrupt this made me uneasy i hope andy you will find some friend who will be able and willing to advance money to pay the mortgage when it falls due i hear squire carter is treating with a city man to buy the place he evidently feels sure that it will come into his possession when andy read this portion of the letter he smiled i suspect conrad and his father will be disappointed he said to himself the city man will have to look elsewhere for an investment one day andy had a pleasant surprise just in front of him on broadway he saw a figure that looked familiar the tall bent form and long white hair he recognized at once as belonging to dr crabb the principal of penhurst academy he pressed forward dr crabb he exclaimed it is long since we have met i hope you are well dr crabb surveyed him with a puzzled look andy had grown so much that he could not place him i suppose you are one of my old pupils he said but i shall have to ask your name dont you remember andy grant bless my soul is it possible why you have grown much taller and larger yes sir i dont want to stand still and what are you doing now i am in business in this city that is well but it is a great pity you could not have remained at school i thought so myself at the time i left but im quite reconciled to the change now doubtless you are doing your duty wherever you are in what business are you engaged i am in a real estate office i hope you are making fine wages i receive fifteen dollars a week bless my soul why that is all i pay my head assistant you must be giving great satisfaction and how is your father he is pretty well sir but his loss of property has worn upon him naturally did i not understand that he had to mortgage his farm yes sir i hope there is no danger of foreclosure there might be sir but when the danger comes i shall be able to help him i am not much of a capitalist andy i understand latin and greek better than i do investments but if a loan of a few hundred dollars will help him i shall be willing to let him have it thank you very much dr crabb but my employer mr crawford will give me all the help i need i am truly pleased to hear it i wish you were able to return to the academy you were our primus and i did not like to spare you you might in time have succeeded me i hope it will be a long time before you require a successor doctor i shall confine my ambitions to succeeding in my business chapter xxxv the return of an old friend one afternoon andy was busy writing in the office when he heard himself called by name and looking up saw walter gale who had just entered mr gale he exclaimed joyfully rising and grasping the hands of his friend so you know me upon my word you have grown so that i find it difficult to recognize you yes i believe i have grown taller and more manly i need not ask if you are well your appearance answers that question i was never better and you enjoy your work immensely but when did you reach the city this morning as you see i have lost no time in looking you up shall you stay here now yes answered gale gravely my poor uncle is dead his sickness was a painful one and he is better off i am glad you are to be in the city i hope to see you often you will if i can have my way i have hired a handsome and roomy flat on madison avenue and i expect you to come and live with me i shall be delighted to do so if you will let me pay my share of the expenses you will pay me with your company i will receive no other pay my uncle has left me all his property at least a hundred thousand dollars and i was rich before i will certainly accept your offer since i am sure you will like to have me you were teaching a boy i believe yes but he is so well advanced now that he does not need my assistance i am free to accept your kind offer call upon me this evening and arrange to move tomorrow i am very lonely and want young and cheerful company when andy called upon his friend in the evening he found him sumptuously lodged the next evening he moved in what news from arden andy asked mr gale nothing much except that squire carter is expecting to foreclose the mortgage on fathers farm next week is that so we must not permit that no i have a thousand dollars in bank and i shall ask mr crawford tomorrow if he will advance me two thousand on some lots i own in tacoma that will not be necessary i will myself advance the full amount and you can pay me whenever you sell your lots that is very kind mr gale and relieves me very much dont overestimate the kindness i have more money than i know what to do with there are others in the same position who would not help me i am your friend that makes the difference when you go to arden i will go too it will be pleasant for me to see the place where i passed so enjoyable a summer and made so good a friend i shall be delighted to have your company mr gale two evenings later as andy was walking up broadway toward his new home he saw a familiar figure in front of him the figure of a boy about his own age evidently the boy had been drinking and could not walk straight once as he turned half around andy with a start recognized john crandall who had treated him so meanly at mr flints he had no reason to like him but his compassion was aroused john said andy linking his arm in his how do you happen to be in this condition who are you hiccoughed john i am andy grant dont you know me yes you used to be at mr flints where are you taking me he asked suspiciously to my room i will take care of you tonight what are you doing now i was in a place on wall street but i got bounced yesterday i took the money they paid me and got drunk that was foolish where is your uncle he has gone to chicago im awful unlucky andy if you will turn over a new leaf and stop drinking ill see if i cant get you another place will you asked john hopefully dont you hate me no i should think you would i got you out of flints you did me a service without intending it youre a good fellow hiccoughed john im sorry i treated you so mean im not since it led to my securing my present place but we must turn down here where do you live on madison avenue madison avenue you must be a swell andy smiled if you work hard you may become a swell too when they entered the flat john stared about him in amazement how can you afford to live in such a fine place he said because a friend bears the greater part of the expense now let me help you undress we have a spare room and i will let you occupy it in the morning i will wake you up for breakfast john crandall was soon fast asleep a few minutes later mr gale came in we have a visitor tonight said andy a friend of yours he may become so but thus far he has been anything but that andy told the story of johns attempt to injure him and yet you befriend him yes wouldnt you walter gale smiled tell me your reasons he said i have no grudge against him besides if we only benefit those whom we like there isnt much credit in that exactly there isnt much credit in my doing you favors dont think i am ungrateful mr gale i appreciate all you have done for me i understand you andy and i like you better for what you have done what further plans have you i should like to get john a place and give him a chance to redeem himself he needs a friend badly he shall have one we will both help him when john crandall awoke the next morning he was himself again the effects of his intoxication had passed off and he seemed ashamed of the predicament in which andy had found him have you any home john asked andy no that is i have a room but i spent all the money that was coming to me and they wont let me stay i dont know what i shall do he said despondently if mr gale and i will find you a new place will you try to keep it yes i will then we will stand by you you can stay here till i come from the office this afternoon and i will find you a boarding place you are a good fellow andy you are my very best friend i will try to be and i will try to deserve your kindness before the week was out john had a new place on pearl street and was an inmate of the boarding house in clinton place where andy stayed when he first came to the city he really turned over a new leaf and became a favorite and trusted employee in the pearl street store andy had saved him chapter xxxvi sad forebodings the day which had been so eagerly awaited by squire carter dawned at last the mortgage on sterling grants farm was due and he intended to foreclose there was a gentleman from the city who had taken a fancy to the farm and had offered him eight thousand dollars for it the squire hoped to obtain it by foreclosure at less than five thousand this would be taking advantage of the farmer but as the squire said to himself complacently business is business these words are used as an excuse for a great many mean acts at supper time the evening before sterling grant looked sad and troubled wife he said i am afraid we shall have to bid goodby to the old farm tomorrow do you really think the squire will foreclose sterling i know he will i called on him today and begged and pleaded with him to extend the mortgage another year but it was all in vain i dont see how people can be so hardhearted said mrs grant indignantly its the squires nature he says that business is business i thought perhaps andy might do something he has five hundred dollars and maybe a little more it would do no good wife i hinted that i might be able to pay a part of the mortgage but the squire wouldnt hear of it he said the whole or none i am sure andy would help us if he could i know that but the mortgage is for three thousand dollars it is quite beyond his ability to lift i am afraid you are right sterling said his wife with a sigh i thought perhaps andy would be here by this time it would do no good to come unless he brought the money with him he may come yet by the seven oclock train we had better not count on that or we shall only be the more disappointed what shall you do sterling if the squire takes the farm there will be some money left but i am afraid not much isnt the place worth six thousand dollars yes but it wont fetch that at a forced sale the squire told me this afternoon that it wasnt worth more than fifteen hundred dollars over and above the face of the mortgage it would be wicked to sell for that we must be content with what we can get after supper the farmer took his hat and walked slowly and soberly about the farm he felt that it was his farewell till now it had been his tomorrow it would pass from his possession it is hard he sighed but it cant be helped at any rate we wont starve there was a small house with half an acre of land attached on the outskirts of the village which he could get at a moderate rental he had inquired about it and had made up his mind to secure it but it is humble objected his wife we must not be proud wife he said we can make it look homelike with our furniture in it but what will you do for an income sterling i can work out by the day perhaps the man who buys our farm i hear the squire has got a purchaser for it will employ me to work out by the day at your age sterling said his wife indignantly it will be hard but if it is necessary i can do it but i want to help sterling i can get sewing to do no no i wont consent to that then i wont consent to your working by the day well we wont discuss it tonight we will let the future take care of itself just then the noise of wheels was heard and a buggy stopped at the door i do believe its andy exclaimed mrs grant joyfully it was andy a minute later he was in the house i am late he said i lost the regular train and had to get off at stacy six miles away but i got a man from the stable to bring me over i am glad to see you andy said his mother and so am i added sterling grant though it is a sad time why a sad time father the squire will foreclose tomorrow no he wont foreclose father i will stop it but how can you prevent it my son by paying the three thousand dollars father have you got the money asked his father incredulously yes but how dont ask me any questions father be satisfied with the knowledge that i have got it heaven be praised said the farmer fervently i dont think squire carter will say that chapter xxxvii conclusion a little before twelve oclock on the following day squire carter rang the bell at the farmhouse door he was dressed with scrupulous neatness and there was a smile of triumphant anticipation on his face andy answered the bell walk in squire he said ha so you are home andy yes sir ahem your father has been unfortunate then you intend to foreclose yes i need the money and must have it isnt that rather hard on an old neighbor you are a boy andy and dont understand business is business well come in mr and mrs grant were sitting by the fireplace they looked calm not sorrowful as the squire anticipated ahem my friends i am sorry for you said the squire in a perfunctory way life is full of disappointments as we read in the scriptures what do you propose to do with the farm squire asked the farmer calmly i may sell it if i can find a purchaser i havent thought much about it that is right squire it isnt well to count your chickens before they are hatched it was andy who spoke andrew you are very flippant said the squire displeased i apprehend that there is very little doubt as to my having the farm to sell what do you suppose is going to become of my father that is not for me to say if i run the farm i may hire him to work on it he has made up his mind to work on it with or without my permission said the squire with a sneer exactly so i dont understand you said the squire with dignified displeasure i presume not but you will understand better when i say that he stands prepared to pay off the mortgage and the farm will remain his impossible ejaculated the squire turning pale quite possible sir have you the mortgage with you yes here is a release which you will please sign father you had better pay the squire at once mr grant took out a big wallet and counted out thirty onehundreddollar bills i believe that is correct squire he said no it isnt you havent paid the interest snarled the squire here is another hundred dollars that will cover it ten minutes later squire carter left the farmhouse with a heavy frown upon his face he was bitterly disappointed and the money did not console him this was not the last of his disappointments his brothers widow in new york sued him for an accounting of his fathers estate and he was obliged not long afterward to pay her five thousand dollars this put the widow and her son in a comfortable position but seriously embarrassed the squire who had lost money by illadvised speculation two years later he had to sell his fine place and take a much humbler one half a mile from the village conrad was obliged to seek a place and is bitterly humiliated because he receives but four dollars a week while the boy he used to look down upon is prosperous and successful andy has sold out his property in tacoma to such advantage that he counts himself worth twenty thousand dollars he continues to live in handsome style with his friend walter gale and is to be taken into partnership in the real estate office by mr crawford when he attains the age of twentyone of the less important characters in our story it may be said that byron warden has had a story published in the nickel library and is very proud of this measure of success he continues to write poems for the century and other prominent magazines they always come back to him respectfully declined but he cherishes the hope that some day he will receive a more favorable answer valentine burns holds a place in mr crawfords office and is giving excellent satisfaction simon rich formerly head clerk for mr flint has proved a defaulter and is a fugitive in canada sam perkins still dazzles the world with his showy neckties but thus far has only risen to ten dollars a week mr grant and his wife are happy in andys success and there is no danger of the farm passing from their possession quite unexpectedly the farmer has received a check from nathan lawrence the defaulting cashier of the benton bank for a thousand dollars with assurance that in time the entire three thousand dollars will be paid up after all father writes andy it was lucky for me that i had to leave school it was the beginning of my present prosperity the end
