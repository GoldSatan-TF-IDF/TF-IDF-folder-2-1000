mercedes lackey the last thing i expected when i woke up that morning was to find myself running for my life with my clothing in one hand and the other hand holding a sheet rather insecurely about my impressive torso wait let me back that up a bit first please understand that i have no illusions about myself i know what my talents are charm rugged good looks wit a great voice and an instinct for how to make a lady very happy i know what my flaws are the desire to do as little actual work as possible coupled with a taste for all the finer things in life and a tendency to stretch the truth paperthin these two things make me the ideal candidate for no actual job but they make me very good at being company for females face it ladies you really do not want to know that your butt looks like the rear end of a brood mare in this dress yes alas i am a manwhore now that we have the technicalities out of the way let me add that i specialize in ladies of a certain age those who so they tell me and so i will fervently believe as long as i am with them are underappreciated by the husbands because oh yes i only specialize in married ladies that way if anything happens they have a husband to deal with the consequences and most of them actually are underappreciated in the class i deal with exclusively those husbands will have gone out and gotten themselves one or more pretty young mistresses so why i ask you is the sauce for the gander not just as appropriate for the goose i had somewhat worn out my welcome in the western part of hardorn so i had crossed into the eastern part of valdemar a country with which i was just marginally familiar hardorn was rather more to my liking lots of rich merchant wives lots of rich minor nobility lots of husbands who were always somewhere else however id temporarily run out of the former and since i was illequipped to fend for myself for very long i took the very nice farewell present from my last friend and got a ride with her cousins trade caravan west her cousin was a widow and i made an exception to my rule of wives only and we passed the time pleasantly enough in her plush little wagon they left me in a little town called winefold which produced strangely enough not wine but a pungent little berry that they liked to use in hardorn to flavor alcohol geniver it was called and collecting the harvested and dried berries there was the end of the road for the caravan so i bid the immensely grateful have i mentioned that ladies of a certain age are always enthusiastically grateful widow a fond and somewhat teary farewell got the best room in the inn for now i didnt intend to be paying for it long and set about looking over my prospects they seemed rosy a lady of the correct age and more than correct income spouse away and supposedly unappreciative and charms that while a bit on the weathered side were still well charming and besides candlelight is always flattering like me the campaign was easy enough pity on the poor stranger with only a few halting phrases of valdemaran in the marketplace a meal or two together at the inn a meal or two together at her manse a brief overnight trial of my paces certain key phrases exchanged and understood and there you go i was quite satisfied with the results of the evening and was looking forward to leaving my room at the inn and setting up in a guest room as a cousinin fact i was mulling over just those arrangements while idly tracing circles on the bare shoulder next to mine when my musings were rudely interrupted by five men bursting into the bedroom with drawn swords and daggers one of them was richly attired also of a certain age but of a dismayingly athletic build with the outraged expression on his face that told me he was either a husband or a brother now this sort of thing happens in bardic songs all the time the sort with seven hundred verses to them therere about two hundred to get to the bedroom and then comes the part where the outraged husband says get up it will never be said i slew a sleeping man allows the subject of the song to get up and presumably get dressed though that never seems to be mentioned no matter how many verses there are arm himself and even strike the first blowpresumably so the spouse can claim selfdefense this usually takes about another hundred verses the rest of the song describes how the subject is cut down mangled dismembered eviscerated hung up for all to see has various bits pecked out by crows while women lament and finally is buried beneath a willow which weeps for him eternally i was not going to be around for those several hundred verses thank you especially not the killing and dismembering part out of careful habit and no few close calls i keep all my clothing right at hand in an easyto carry bundle when i go to bed with a lady so as the outraged gentleman opened his mouth i was already halfway out the window clothing in one hand sheet held around me as best i could the advantage of going out a window is that your pursuers if there are more than one always manage to get themselves jammed up trying to follow you by the time they sort themselves out youve got a lead on them small problem being in a little town however they were going to know where to find me or rather my belongings which meant i had to get there before they did fortunately it was early enough good lord not even dawn what kind of uncivilized barbarians were these that i didnt attract too much attention sprinting through the streets in nothing but a sheet bad idea going in through the door but the inn building was a single sprawling story all at ground level i had left my shutters unlatched but closedi had all my money with me and in a town this small stealing my clothing and other gear would be pretty foolhardy since it would be immediately recognizable id nipped in grabbed my gear pulled on my pants and boots and nipped out again by the time they came roaring up to the door which the innkeepers servant was only just opening for the day i saw all this from my vantage point hiding in the thatch of a roof across the street and that was where i stayed figuring i would wait until the fuss died down then get a ride out with a farmer or something but the fuss didnt die down this fellow was persistent first he made the innkeeper turn out my room to prove i wasnt in it then he made the innkeeper turn out all the vacant rooms to prove i wasnt hiding in them then he made the innkeeper turn out all the other guests to prove i wasnt with one of them then he ransacked the stable then he and his four bully boys began searching the rest of the town fortunately none of them thought to look up in the thatch of roofs i suppose they figured that someone of my sort wouldnt know how to climb silly fellows windows arent always on the ground floor however this left me with a real problem by the time they were done the entire town would know about me and i hadnt been here long enough to round up any allies which meant not only could i not find a real place to hide out but it was going to be hard to find a way out of town which was when i saw it the armysupply wagon train wed passed this thing on our way in and my hostess had told me what it was because i honestly had never seen anything like it in my life the main roads here in valdemar all had this groove running down the middle which i had assumed wrongly was some sort of gutter in fact it was a slot for a guiding wheel for a peculiar sort of thing that she called a wagon trainas in trailing along behind these people didnt have a lot of bandits if any on their main roads so they didnt need a lot of guards on the wagons that carried common supplies which meant they really only needed people to drive and care for the dray animals and if they could hitch a lot of wagons together they didnt need as many of them the problem with that was that pulling a lot of wagons was difficult they tended to stray off the road but not if you had a guidewheel in the center of each that dropped down into that groove down the middle ingenious really so there it was pulling through town twenty mules at the front a couple of drivers fifteen wagons each carrying two tons the last wagon in the string carried the supplies for the men and the mules and had two spare mules tied to the back they wouldnt stop in town theyd stop once at midday to water the animals and again at night because they wouldnt stop in town and because they belonged to the army called the guard here no one would bother searching these wagons ideal i watched for my opportunity and as soon as the street was clear i was down off that roof and in under the canvas flap at the rear of one of the middle wagons a quick survey of the tightly packed interior showed me the only way to get to the front of the wagon was over the top of the crates i was hoping that since all the wagons looked alike thats an army for you there would be a space at the front with a drivers area that you couldnt actually pack goods into i was rightthough let me tell you it was a tight squeeze to get in there under the canvas roof and i had to be careful and inch my way along so no one would notice a moving bulge there was a drivers bench all right with the canvas stretched down tight across the front of the wagon giving me just enough room to settle no one would look up here if anyone did inspect this thing theyd look at the back at most i made myself comfortable with my pack and my stolen sheet waited until we were well clear of town just in case and then resumed my interrupted sleep i woke again when they stopped the mules at noon for watering when the voices were distant i took a quick look at the crates that surrounded me and could hardly believe my luck when i saw they were all labeled field rations at least i wasnt going to starve i spent the rest of the afternoon slowly and carefully prying the side off one of the crates sure enough it was packed full of bars of something covered in what felt like wax when i got a bar out i saw that it actually was wax the sort some cheeses are coated in it peeled right off with the help of my knife and the bar proved to be dried fruit and meat pounded together just about as hard as ironwood i spent the rest of the afternoon whittling slivers off and eating them id had worse i got thirsty i made up for it by sucking on a few peppermints that i keep to make sure i have pleasant breath i was lucky that it didnt get too hot and i could manage to hold off thirst for a while but i was looking forward to getting out and finally getting a drink let me tell you id have to find something to hold water though because the only time id be able to get any would be late at night when the drovers slept maybe i could find something in the supply wagon it took a lot of patience to just sit there getting thirstier and thirstier and it was worse when we finally stopped for the night but finally the voices at the fire whose glow i could see through the canvas side of the tent ebbed into silence i got out and to make a long story short i did find a bucket i didnt think anyone would miss since it was buried in the back of the supply wagon that was when i realized that all they did was unhitch the teams and picket them they left the wagons in the road all night i suppose it didnt matter it wasnt as if anyone was going to run into them in the dark days went by that way which i whiled away by getting into the wagon oneoff from the front and listening to the drovers talk i was going to need a lot of practice in understanding valdemaran of which i had barely a grasp i did get better over time and i was anticipating getting out in a larger townuntil i managed to puzzle out from something that they were saying that they were about to head deep into the wilderness wilderness was not where i wanted to go oh no i dont do well in wilderness im not a wilderness sort of fellow that was when i figured it was time for me to steal whatever i was going to need for what i thought would be a day or two until i found a farm and a way on to civilization so once the drovers settled down for the night and snores told me that a tempest wouldnt wake them i did just that i loaded my pack with those ration bars grabbed a wineskin off the back of the supply wagon plus a tinderbox and followed the road until it was dawn then i got off the road and hid for a while just in case they actually realized something was missing and backtracked by midmorning though i figured i was safe and got back onto the road i didnt want to stay on it for too long though because it would only take me farther into trouble so the first time i saw another roadthis one plain dirt with some grass growing on it and no groovei took it roads always go somewhere right i figured this one would lead me to a farm or better still a village only it didnt by midafternoon i knew i was going to have to sleep outdoors and i knew enough to know i needed to find some water too so i did and i did ive mentioned im not a wilderness sort of fellow right it was the worst night of my life i mean the worst i tried making a sort of bed out of leaves only the leaves were home to some sort of ants and they got into my clothing and bit the hell out of me so i gave up and tried to sleep on bare dirt but that sucked all the heat out of my body and i spent most of the night shivering the fire i made smoked and i kept hearing things out in the woods that sounded big really big bears wolves whatever it was kept prowling around and around my campsite and i did tell you im not a fighting sort of fellow right i finally did get to sleep around about dawn im not sure what exactly woke me up but when i did wake up all at once i could hardly believe my luck because standing right in front of me on the other side of my fire was a fantasticlooking white horse now there was my way out of here provided i could catch it i knew how to ride bareback its one of those things thats useful to know in case your lady wants to get a romantic ride along a beach or a river and maybe swim with the horses you dont want a saddle on them if you do thatit gets wet and you make the grooms angry at you when you bring the horses back because they are the ones that have to make sure everything dries out right i was still fully dressed of course so i got up slowly and carefully and felt in my pack for my silk rope yes silk rope its something i have with me in case the ladynever mind lets just say it comes in useful when ladies want something to ah keep me from going anywhere it fell right into my hand i could hardly believe my luck the horse stared at me i made soothing sounds at it and straightened up rope held behind my back it didnt move i walked toward it slowly and casually behind my back i got the rope into a loop to throw around its neck the closer i could get to it the better it let me just walk up to it and drop the loop around its neck and that was when it suddenly snaked out its neck grabbed the back of my tunic in strong white teeth and shook me like a dog shakes a rag what the hell do you think youre doing said a voice in my head something else came crunching through the underbrush and as the horse dropped me at its feet and with a contemptuous toss of its head shook off the rope another big white horse emerged from between two bushes i looked wildly around for the owner of the voice hes all weve got destin said another voice we missed the wagon train we cant get her to them and they cant backtrack hell have to do i just wanted to make sure he knew we were nothing to fool about with the new horse snorted with contempt and stamped a foot he looks about as useful as teats on a boar i suddenly realized that there was no one else around but the two horses i knew i wasnt asleep or hallucinating so the voices had to be comingfrom them of course the voices are coming from us you moron said the second voice as the second horse put his face down to mine and let those blue eyes burn contempt at me were companions and unfortunately we dont have hands but you do so youre going to help us imwait what now i was beginning to think id fallen and hit my head that id been poisoned by something that had bitten me in the night or had come down with a fever and i was hallucinating i vaguely recalled something about white horses in valdemar but i hadnt paid much attention at the time i never expected to be here after all it didnt make any sense to come here where i didnt know the language or the laws or well anything else what was it about white horses you up on your feet youre coming with us that was the second voice in my head the one belonging to the horse whose face was right in mine what were doing is mindspeaking were companions we are the equivalent of constables or city guards except we can enforce law in the entire country all i could do was blink thats ridiculous i said whod obey a horse one huge silver hoof stamped the earth right between my knees the threat was well obvious you will if you know whats good for you the horse said ominously now get your pack and get on one of us youre coming with us several thoughts flitted through my mind butlook i was in the middle of nowhere with limited food limited water and no idea what to do with myself out here it just did not make sense to argue with the creature hopefully wherever they were taking me was going to at least have shelter with more luck it would have a nice lady i could wrap around my finger and convince her to get me away from these things companions whatever those were so i did what i was told at first i had a sort of death grip on the things mane but within a few paces i realized that not only was i in no danger of falling off this was probably the best ride id ever had in my life id have really enjoyed it except of course that i was being carried off into the woods by a couple of possiblydemonic creatures disguised as horses that could talk in my head tends to make a man a little nervous i was hoping at least theyd take me toward something like civilization but no they left the road for a trail they left the trail for a path they left the path for something that might have been a thready little track wherever we were headed it was obviously not civilization uh i said finally i should point out that im a city sort of fellow youve got two working arms two working legs and something akin to a brain not much of one but we dont need much of one that was the second voice which was coming from the thing that i wasnt riding great just great by implication that meant they were heading even deeper into the wilderness yes we are heading even deeper into the wilderness the voice said somehow conveying both sarcasm and a great deal of glee at my discomfort there are bears i knew there would be bears the thought flitted through my mind again that i could jump off but i couldnt outrun these beasts and the thick stuff on either side of this pitiful excuse for a trail was going to trip me up as much as it would impede them assuming it did they had tough horsehide not tender human skin and that was when they shouldered through some branches that slapped me in the face of course and we came out into a clearing a lovely little clearing a meadow really with a pond and a little cottage and a well a cottage i brightened immediately at least i wouldnt be sleeping with ants tonight even as i thought that the second beast grabbed me by the belt and unceremoniously pulled me off the first one i yelled and something white stirred in the long grass next to the cottage door the beast didnt let me go gods it was strong it carried me by the belt over to whatever was there and then dumped me and i could see that the something was a rather pretty girl in white she was younger than my usual sort probably younger than me redhaired and greeneyed roundfaced without looking dollish and clearly in a lot of pain im no healer but her left leg and arm did not look at all right she looked up at me and grimaced hes the best we could do millissa said the first horse apologetically i know you need a healer but there isnt one close and if you dont get things straightened up soon i know she said out loud believe me i know she looked as hard at me as she could through the pain all right fancyman im herald millissa the ladies all call me i stopped myself my names donnat stains call me don all right don what do you know about dislocations and bone setting nothing i said honestly how bad is this things havent seized up yet so she bit her lip just do what they show you i think we can manage what they a very clear image came into my mind first i needed to deal with her leg the horses were pretty certain it was broken but that it was a clean break working very very slowly i straightened the leg under their direction pulling on it to align the broken bone feeling it to make sure it was aligned that poor girl was as white as her clothing and her hair was soaked with sweat before i was done but she never once cried out the horses showed me how to bind up the leg to keep the bone in place then it was time to deal with her shoulder they had me go inside the cottage and wrestle out a table i put her on the table with her arm dangling over the edge then held her wrist in one hand and slowly began pulling her arm downward increasing the pull a little at a time i gently rocked her arm at the wrist while keeping her shoulder pushed against the table and slowly very slowly i felt the shoulder slip back into the socket until at last she gave a little cry the first yet that was full of pained relief if there can be such a thing after that following the horses directions on how to tie up her arm and shoulder was easy they didnt have to tell me what to do next it was pretty obvious there were packs and a saddle lying on the ground and i figured smart as these things were each of them had probably stripped the other before going for help there was a bedroll right on top i may be a city sort of fellow but i know how to make up a bed and before too long i had her in the cottage in a bed made up on one of the bedboxes there that was when she passed out not that i blamed her the pain must have been incredible frankly ive seen strong men who endured less pain with more complaining i certainly had now at this point i figured that i was done this was a stout little cottage stone walls and floor a real fireplace strong shutters on the windows which i suspected the evil beasts could close a strong wooden roof with slate tiles a door as thick as my thumb she was fine for now one of these things could go off for some help while the other stood guard in fact i was going to volunteer to ride off on the notquiteasmean one to do just that provided that they left me there which i presumed would be civilization when the mean one planted himself across the doorway you are not going anywhere neither are we now i am considered an easy sort of fellow but i was just about ready to take an ax to this things he do it and youre paste fancyman the beast reared slightly and i backed away from the door so fast i tripped over my own feet we were on our way to meet something which is still coming this way we have to be here for it and someone human has to be here with two good legs and two good arms besides that its a good seven dayseven as fast as we can gobetween us and help and we dont have hands you tell me how were to feed her get her drink and all the rest of it all right put that way i could see his point the girl might or might not get fevered she certainly wouldnt be able to take care of herself so is one of you going to go i asked seriously here im i gulped my skills are not exactly that of even a healer apprentice the thing shook its head i wasnt joking about the bears or other things heralds like millissa have enemies and were not entirely certain that the fall we took was an accident with three of us you can take the day watch and ardred and i can take the night with one of us at the door and one out patrolling the perimeter with only two its more difficult since you arent the fighting type well there was that the best i could do would be to yell a warning once what we are waiting for is here millissa will be healed enough to ride and we can all get out of here or else the help weve already asked for will be here waitwhat how did same way we talk in your head only at a distance it takes another of us or some human who is very strong in this power oh well if we were seven days from the first vestiges of civilization then we were probably farther than that from whatever this help was i didnt imagine that these white monsters were all that thick on the ground even here exactly i gritted my teeth for a moment i was beginning to resent their ability to read my thoughts whats a herald i asked finally the beast snorted tossed his head and walked off great the first voice sort ofmurmured at me ah im ardred sorry about destin hes touchy and right now hes feeling very angry at himself for what happened to millissa ill be happy to answer your questions the horse wasnt in sight i sighed this was going to take a lot of getting used to and meanwhile well the girl was going to need food and drink eventually and i needed a bed and although there is a style i am accustomed to im not altogether incapable of some basic tasks provided that ive not been dropped nearly naked into the middle of a howling wilderness fine i said aloud going out to fetch the packs mine included lets start with whats a herald the first thing that millissa did when she woke up was try to knock out my brains with a dish i could see why she and destin were paired by this time there was a small fire in the cottageexcuse me waystationfireplace and there was food of a sort cooking over it that was thanks to ardred who talked me through how to make it my knowledge does not include cooking there was tea brewingthat i knew how to make myself i had a bed in another of the boxesardred had been kind enough to show me where there was some bracken that wasnt home to insects and i did have a cloak to lay over it all the gear was in the waystation i knew more or less what a herald was and what a companion was it didnt entirely make sense as in i wasnt at all sure why anyone would trust the dealing out of laws to creatures as illtempered as destin was much less something that looked like a horse for the gods sake but well not my kingdom so i had put down a dish on the side of the girls bed as i leaned over to check on her and the next thing i knew shed grabbed it with her good hand and broken it over my head fortunately it was a very cheap dish so it broke easily and without braining me but i ended up on my behind on the floor staring at her ow i said very much aggrieved what did you do that for i completely forgot where i was and spoke hardornen she stared back at me wildeyed as if she were going to find something else to hit me with then as if someone had inserted a different person into her body her expression changed and she flushed and winced a little ah oh sorry she said in passable hardornen i forgot where i was and i thought you were attacking me i was going to feed you i pointed out crossly rubbing my head were now short a dish thank you therere metal ones in my pack she retorted as if i were going to go rummaging through your pack i scoffed i have standards you know which you refuse to rise above she murmured then said louder well go ahead you have my permission its the one with the frying pan handle sticking out of it lovely she had a frying pan which she would doubtless use to brain me if she got the chance i made a note to keep it well out of her reach but i did go rummage and got out the dishes she mentioned i didnt give her the well whatever the mess it was i had cooked in them though id use the metal ones she could use the pottery one less thing for me to worry about i wondered if she would ask me what was happening but the changing expressions on her face led me to believe that the damn horses were just talking to her directly and i wouldnt need to say anything im sure the mean one was giving her an earful mindful whatever bastard i thought hard about glue dogfood and fiddle bows i could have sworn i heard a snicker she was a little apologetic later but when i tried my signature smoldering look on her she threatened me with another dish so i gave up that as a bad idea obviously she was going to be immune to my considerable charms perhaps she favored other women or maybe you arent as charming as you think i grimaced sourly and the gall was even more bitter when she giggled obviously that miserable bonerack destin hadnt bothered to keep his thoughts private was there no way to keep my thoughts private a very faint whisper almost so unobtrusive that i didnt even hear it drifted into the back of my head order him to stay out of your mind i didnt wait i just looked out the nightdarkened doorway and barked stay out of my head dammit a man is entitled to some privacy talk to me if you want but keep your snooping out of my thoughts there was a sense of shocked silence i looked over at the other bunk where the girl was nursing a cup of some sort of noxious medicinal tea that shed told me how to brew she was looking back at me with a certain amount of approval hes right you know she said aloud just because youre companions that doesnt give you the right to breach mindspeaking ethics well that was a bit of a surprise do they often do that sort of thing i asked tentatively rummage around at will in a strangers head that is she took another difficult gulp of tea before answering not usually in fact companions generally dont mindspeak to anyone but their chosen herald destins something of a law unto himself though and i cant always predict what hes going to decide to do i rolled my eyes fabulous and this is what you have laying down the law of the land not exactly she said finishing the tea let me see if i can explain or at least better than they did her explanation did make better sense and i could see now why the gods of this kingdom would have figured out a way to properly answer the particular prayer theyd been petitioned with and it did prevent some pretty awful abuses of power i mean i did know history and for every good monarch you generally get a nasty one and an entire herd of mediocre ones this at least made for a stable form of government what you dont think i should have an interest in politics i promise you you would be amazed what constitutes pillow talk for some women still i dont think i would be even remotely comfortable with something rummaging around in my head on a regular basis a man likes to keep some secrets after that millissa and i started to get along a bit better i was feeling positively brotherly toward her as we both drifted off to sleep or at least i was able to feel a lot more sympathy for her she was putting up with injuries that would have had most people incoherent with pain and was not really complaining about it some of that was the tea but most was that she was either really quite brave or really quite well controlled in either case i admired her now i am not the sort that tends early to bed and early to rise so the cold wet nose shoving insistently at me at the crack of dawn came as a literal rude awakening the kind that makes you start up out of sleep with an incoherent noise up said the cross voice in my head we need sleep he needed sleep i needed sleep evidently that didnt matter and i knew better than to try to just turn over and attempt to ignore him he was quite capable of hauling me out of the bed just as he had hauled me over to the cabin now ive been a little less than honest just because i havent done the usually lowly chores youd need to do in and around a little cottagewell other than the farming onesit doesnt mean that i cant or that i didnt know how it was because as soon as i was able i ran away to avoid those very chores heading straight for the city which i saw as my natural home so my skills might have been a little rusty but other than the cooking part i pretty much knew what to do by the time that millissa woke up and poor thing needed help getting to the privy id gotten things in rough order for the morning and when i carried her back and installed her in bed again she looked around with a raised eyebrow thatsnot bad she said i didnt think i knew one end of a broom from the other i finished for her oh i know i just dont like it id much rather be waited on wouldnt we all she murmured but this time with a little pained smile that let me know she intended for me to hear her i perform a very valuable service for ladies who for one reason or another need a companion i told her pointedly her eyebrows arched but i was not backing down their husbands generally have at least one and often several attractive women that they go to why shouldnt they have the same im entertaining i can tell a good story i listen and i mean really listen rather than pretend to listen and make appropriate noises i am absolutely faithful for as long as the lady cares to have me about sometimes i can even offer advice although mostly they dont want that they just want sympathy when we part ways shes the better for it and so am i she knows that she is still worthy of appreciation which raises her spirits and gives her confidence and i am heavier in the pockets i folded my arms over my chest and looked down at her and it doesnt hurt that im a handsome devil which makes her the envy of her friends millissa sniffed a little but you dont love these women on the contrary i do i said proudly i love women in general and i make a point of appreciating all there is to admire in my clients believe me sometimes that was a lot of work but it was always worth it in the end millissas look of skepticism turned to astonishment you sound like youre proud of what you do i shrugged i am why shouldnt i be my father taught us to take pride in our work though he would have seven different kinds of a fit if he knew what i was doing now well that was his fault not mine maybe if he hadnt gotten taken in by that priest and his stupid quiverfull notion of having your wife squeeze out baby after baby like a prize pig until you had so many children you couldnt remember their names and what would have been plenty for a reasonably size family got stretched so thin that no one ever had enough and everyone was starved a little especially for attention then maybe id still be there or maybe not whos to say maybe i would have run away sooner but that has very little to do with the here and now i told her im not a healer but i do have some skills that will probably help you now both eyebrows shot up i dont like massage she blinked oh if youve no objection ill take you out on the grass give you a massage and then set you so your head is hanging just over the edge of the pond and i can wash your hair i knew that would get her shed been sweating all during the ordeal of setting her leg and by now her scalp must be a torment really ha had her its one of the things i know how to do i pointed out then without giving her any time to think about it i picked her up and carried her out into the meadow then i very carefully massaged all the nonerotic muscles concentrating on making it soothing rather than actively trying to get the kinks and knots out it takes longer that way but the last thing she needed was more pain when she was a nice girlpuddle i moved her to a rock ledge on the side of the pond stripped off and used some of the soap id found on her hair then i moved her again combed it all out and spread it on the grass and left her soaking up sun while her hair dried i vaguely recalled a healer telling me once the people got better faster when they had sun i dont know about that but when i moved her back to her bed a lot of the tension and pain was gone from her face the next few days were pretty much the same except for the hair washing we talked a lot she did most of it while i did the listening though i did tell a few stories out of my own past the funny thing was that all those chores that i had loathed as a child seemed far less onerous now well it was probably just because there wasnt anyone around telling me how i could have done it better and pointing out all the ways id fallen short of perfection fine if someone else wants perfection they can have it but theres nothing wrong with just getting the job done competently and correctly and leaving it at that destin might have been a sarcastic bastard but at least he didnt nitpick me to death the first three days were fine the fourth the companions started getting restless destin even forgot to insult me i remembered that they had said that something was coming and i wondered if that something was almost here the fourth day they kept going off for runs always into the north the fifth day brought it all to a head when i woke up i could practically cut the tension millissa didnt say much to me over breakfast instead she had that listening look she got when both companions were talking to her finally as i brought her lunch she broke the silence i know youre not a fighter not even close i interrupted right well she bit her lip theres someone weve been waiting for shes close close enough to go get but there are likely to be complications it might get physical and wed planned for me to be the one to deal with that except so i take it you want me to go with ardred and the walking gluepot since you cant right id already figured something like this was coming i have an easy solution for things getting physical we run it might not be that easy she said dubiously it was my turn to snort trust me take it from someone whos done a lot of running you can always run he has a point that shock of shocks was destin she sighed all right then destin you and ardred take care of him and the chosen ardred raised his head suddenly shes thinking ahout running all right then get those saddles on and get out of here ill be fine you need to get to underscore her words millissa had me bring her everything in the waystation that could be thrown i admired her resourcefulness and i shuddered a little when she hefted the frying pan i got the saddles on both companions and started to mount ardred but destin shoved his way in between us he needs to be free for his chosen mount up once i was in the saddle we were off and i realized at once that we were heading for the road they were pushing it too even through the thick underbrush they were almost galloping and when we broke out into the clear they did and they were faster than any horse ive ever been on shes running ardred cried his mental voice sharp with fear hes coming after her we hit the real road the one id left several days ago and in the middle distance i could see what looked like a shabby wagon loaded down with household goods between us and the wagon was a girl a child really she had nothing on but a shift and as we pounded toward her i could see there was a man chasing her cursing we got nearer and nearer i could see her terrified eyes her thin little limbs the bruises bruises everywhere something snapped inside me and ill tell you right now i have no idea how i did this i leaned down over destins neck held out one arm and i just begged that child to run for me to jump for me here i screamed here jump she should have been terrified she should have turned right around and run the other way but something came into her face a glimmer of hope then determination and as we rushed down on her she did just that she jumped into my arms we thundered past the man thundered past the wagon loaded with stuff which looked all wrong to me in a way i couldnt put together at the time we turned and without a word or thought actually exchanged i tossed her into ardreds saddle where she stuck like a burr run i urged him dont wait for us run he did the man was on his way back toward us he was a huge bull of a man in a towering rage and im no fighter but i knew it would be a mistake to leave him there was a shovel lying under the wagon seat i leaned down and grabbed it are you thinking began destin go i shouted because the man was closing on us destin launched straight into a gallop and was up to speed in a few paces more i took a firm grip on the handle of the shovel and as we charged down on the bastard that would beat a little girl black and blue i summoned all my rage stood up in the stirrups and swung straight for his face i hit him so hard the shock nearly knocked me out of the saddle and it broke the handle of the shovel out of the corner of my eye i saw him go down we kept going i didnt look back adred did wait for us and the little girl clinging to his back looked at me with both hope and fear hes never going to follow us i told her hes never going to hurt you again i certainly hoped he wasnt because my arms were still tingling from the shock of that hit the little thing burst into tearsand jumped out of ardreds saddle for me i realized it at the last minute fortunately and caught her and she clung to me and cried ardreds eyes rolled with alarm but i just smiled at him its all right she just needs someone to hold her the gods know id held plenty of women in my time whod just needed someone to hold them i held her safe all the way back to the waystation it took some coaxing to get her to let go of me but between us millissa and i managed and wewell igot her filthy rags stripped off her gave her a wash put her into one of my shirts which was certainly big enough on her to be a dress fed her and put her to bed over the next day millissa got her story out of her the man had been some distant relative when her parents died hed come and taken everything portable and her hed beaten her and starved her made her do work that was far past her strength and then beat her when she couldnt manage it she had whatever it was that made a herald and ardred had heard her crying for him but he had known he was never going to be able to get her away on his own so hed recruited millissa to help her name was rose and she stayed glued to me like a dayold chick to its mother i did what i always do for a female who is hurt and frightened and mourning i soothed her i listened to her i held her and let her cry i promised her that ardred would always take care of her and i let her cry some more the next day that help finally came another herald and a healer who would stay with millissa until she was fit to travel while the new herald escorted rose and ardred to wherever these heralds lived then came the hitch rose refused to leave me she clung to me and wailed and i couldnt persuade her to stop finally ardred solved it i can carry two he said firmly so that was how i arrived in haven about a candlemark after sunset with a weary little girl in my arms who after a good two weeks of solid work from me had finally decided that she didnt have to be afraid any more and could start to leave the terror and learn to live i handed her over to the collegium people ardred was led away and and i know what youre thinking youre thinking i turned around saw one of those blasted white busybodies looked into her eyes and nope didnt happen no interfering knowitall with hooves just a tired but cheerful fellow in green robes who had come to see to rose and now was standing next to me well he said i suppose youve figured it out my bewildered expression told him otherwise he laughed ah right you arent used to the mindgifts where you come from are you all right ill just tell you straight out the reason the companions could talk to you is that youre gifted like a herald but different you could have knocked me over with a feather i am i said feeling stupid he nodded i felt you at work from half a day away and let me tell you my lad we are going to be right glad to have you if you care to stay and learn to use what youve got properly youre a mindhealer son thats what youve been doing all your lifeusing your gift i thought things id never put together began tumbling into place things millissa had told me the things id been doing how id worked with little rose huh well it wasnt as if i had anything better to do and there was nothing saying i couldnt keep well the healer raised an eyebrow at me oh yes youre still going to be very popular with the women i found myself grinning he grinned back and clapped me on the back come along then healer trainee don were just in time for supper chapter catch fire draw flame rosemary edghill and denise mccune south of the yvedan hills in the places where constant border clashes between karses army and valdemars defenders were merely worrisome news and not terrifying reality the land softened spreading itself into rolling hills and lush fields north of the jaysong hills the farmsteads were built more of wood than stone the farmstead walls were built to stop wandering chickens and not armed raiders and shutters were not barred with iron here no man or woman slept with a sword beneath the pillow to arm against danger that comes in the night north and east of the jaysong hills nearbut not too nearthe hardorn border where the east trade road ran straight and smooth toward haven the tents of summerfair sprouted each midsummer from full moon to full moon a city of tents and pavilions appeared in the cup of the goldendale a city to which all the north came to sell and to buy why are we here elade grumbled despite the fact that the summerfair peace hadnt been broken within living memoryand despite the fact that her sword had been peacebound as had every other weapon at the fairher gaze roved over the fairgoers as though any might rise to menace them why is anyone anywhere meran answered his teeth flashed white as he smiled at her and he hitched his bag higher on his shoulder seeing the fair in elades company was a bit like taking a leopard for a walk the other fairgoers gave them a wide berth despite the knot of yellow ribbons that bound her sword to its sheath you look like aaa bard meran asked his eyes round with feigned innocence but i am a bard sweet elade elade slanted a sideways look at merans crimson tunic you dont have to look like one she huffed it was true that no one would take elade for anything but what she was short cloak high boots studded leather bracers and chain mail tunic all proclaimed her identity as a mercenary soldier elade had no reason ever to conceal herself unlike the rest of them in the places they travelledand with the work they didit was far better he and the others not travel garbed in bards scarlet or healers green or not that we could ever get gaurane into whites without knocking him unconscious first meran thought why not he asked it was fun to tease elade it would be very wrong of me to do otherwise only thinki might enter all the competitions and carry off every prize elade snorted youd have to be better than everyone else to do that meran she pointed out hey bard here he protested journeyman bard elade corrected just as if she could tell the difference between the playing of a journeyman and a master elade insisted all music was nothing more than catsqualling elade its summerfair meran dropped the teasing and set out to convince her in earnest we have a whole fortnight where nobodys trying to kill us you should enjoy yourself well be back on the border soon enough i like the border elade said you know who your friends are there and your enemies only elade meran thought could say something like that and mean it when our work is finding those whose minds had been warped by karsite demons and working to save them minds and lives alike the touched hid their damage from themselves and the demons that overshadowed them were clever at concealing themselves often the only clue was in the way people or animals nearby had died it was a pattern theyd all become adept at following in the moonturns since gaurane had gathered them together we need supplies meran said changing the subject to one less likely to produce an unwinnable argument bowstringsharpstringsmedicines the soldiers who held the border and the holders who farmed it were seldom willing to part with what stocks they had not even for gold and silver it would be different if gaurane were willing to askall doors opened to a heraldbut meran knew better than to raise the topic with him gauranes out of brandy you mean elade said but the gibe was without real malice behind it do you really want to listen to him complain about his hangover the question startled a laugh from elade no but it doesnt take two full sennights to pick up a few supplies it does not meran agreed but if you can think of a better way to get hedion to rest im sure wed all like to hear it ah i see elade said its a trick all the best things in life are meran said but not on us this time so we might as well enjoy ourselves while were here he took elades arm and tugged her gently toward the merchants street and that means you should come and look at the pretty things instead of trying to terrify some poor horse trader into giving you an honest price on a new pack mule we wouldnt need a new pack mule if the last one hadnt been eviscerated elade grumbled but she came when meran had been a child singing for coppers on the streets of haven hed dreamed of being able to walk into the shops and purchase anything he chose his gift had gained him entrance to the collegium and there hed dreamed of a rich patronwhose fortune he might share most bards entered a noble household upon achieving journeyman status for it could be the work of years to produce the song or poem that elevated a bard from journeyman to master meran had been as surprised as anyone when he found himself choosingupon taking the scarletto travel true a bard could hope for a meal and a bed at any inn he stopped at but it was hardly as certain as it would be for a herald traveling bards slept rough and cold in a hayrick or outbuilding more often than not and they paid for their bread and beer like everyone else even as he chose that path meran castigated himself for a fool and yet year followed year and the store of songs hed made grew and still he did not turn his steps back toward haven hed never realized what he was looking for until the shaggy man in the tattered threadbare clothes came to the inn where he was singing and told him there was a patient who needed his attention beg pardon my good fellow meran said but as you see i am not the one you seek i wear the scarlet not the green the shaggy man gave a sharp bark of laughter we already have a healer he answered thats why we need you hed been curious so he followed he played the healer to sleep that night and the next and he played to soothe the healers patient on the third and as the days passed meran had come to realize this was what hed been seeking all unknowing all along it was unheard of of course bards sang of great deeds they didnt do them and the street urchin hed been would have mocked the idea that his hearts desire was to serve anything but himselfor even his gift once it woke were he making a song of this it would be healer hedion who held them all together and gave them their purpose but in fact it was gaurane who was their leadergaurane who would not be called herald gaurane whom meran had never seen entirely sober who refused to acknowledge the companion who followed him everywhere like an exceptionally large and very white dog gauranes story would make such a song as would be any bards master work except meran didnt know the tale and had never asked elade who had joined them a moonturn later had asked elade had a knack for asking inconvenient questions which had gotten her turned out of her free company but if shed received an answer meran didnt know it how gaurane and hedion had met why gaurane could not hear his own companion why rhoses was content to follow his chosen along the border rather than seeking help for him why if there was healing to be done hedion didnt do itall were mysteries meran was content to leave unplumbed it was only at times like this when the summerfair merchants bright and glittering wares lay spread for display like the fabled treasurecave of the legendary queen lilyant of bai that meran spared a thought for the life hed once thought to live even elade was drawn to the splendor along the street of merchants though her eye was caught by the table of blades while meran lingered before the scentsellers booth he wondered if he could persuade elade that oil of violets was a necessity vital enough to expend some of their scant resources upon a woman stepped up to the table and meran drew back courteously he did not truly intend to buy after all and it was only polite to leave room for those who did as the two women buyer and seller dickered over the price and kind and quality of the wares meran let his gaze and his attention wander the street of merchants was only a very small part of summerfair for the truly exotic and the truly costly one must seek out havens harvestfair or the shops of her high street summerfair was for the farmers and holders of the south it sold horses and mules pigs and chickens cows and goats and it was also a hiring fair for harvest was coming when every hand would be needed meran had known nothing about the farmers year when hed left haven since then hed come to know it ran opposite to the year the townfolk kept spring was for planting and autumn was for harvesting winter was for doing all the tasks of making and mending there was no other time for but summer was a time of near leisure with a practiced ear he followed the sound of the bargaining paying no real attention its cadence told him the transaction was drawing to a close when a new note was added to the song here mistress let me hold that for you meran turned toward the speaker young dressed in clothing that was plain but of good quality with something of the look of iftel to himno odd thing when valdemar lay open to any who wished to live in peace he smiled as he held out his hand and the farmwife placed a plump sack of coins into it meran was about to turn away againso the woman had a manservant there was nothing odd in thatwhen he saw the young man step smoothly away from the table tucking the money pouch into his tunic as he did meran would have raised the hue and cry or even moved to stop him were it not that the woman gave no indication anything was amiss in a moment the young man had disappeared into the crowd my purse where is it the indignant cry behind him summoned merans attention again help thief ive been robbed it didnt make any sense meran said a candlemark later i watched her hand him her purse and a moment later it was as though shed forgotten she had theyd found gaurane and hedion at the alesellers nearest their lodging there was always someone willing to rent space to travelers who had not provided their own accommodation on the border they could always find an inn or a village to lodge them in exchange for a song or two if it was not giving them lodging for hedions sake here entertainment could be had for the asking but beds required coin maybe they were working together elade said sounding puzzled fairs are made for thieving gaurane said he took a long pull from his tankard of ale and sighed appreciatively thieves everywhere he tipped it up again draining it and reached for merans cup theres a whole pitcher of ale in front of you meran said indignantly whisking his cup out of reach yes gaurane said and if i drink it it will be gone ill buy you another one meran said then kicked himself when gaurane smiled beatifically good lad i knew i could depend on you she handed him her purse and then she said shed been robbed hedion frowned clearly still trying to make sense of the puzzle of the three at the table entitled to wear the colors of one of the schools of the collegium only meran was dressed in accordance with his rank everyoneeven eladehad been firmly against hedion wearing his healers tunic here summerfair was supposed to be a holiday for all of them hedion most of all even nowa full sennight after the last mindhealing hed performedhedions face was pinched and drawn and he clenched his hands to stop their constant trembling when he thought no one saw meran knew without having to be told that left to himself hedion would pit his strength against the impossible task hed set himself until he dropped from exhaustion no one man could stem the tide of damage the karsite demoncallers caused but hedion mindhealer would try if not for gaurane meran knew hedion would have broken beneath his burden already she swore someone must have taken it meran said the scentseller told her shed handed it to her servant but she swore she had no servant gaurane finished in the tones of one who knows how the tale ends meran nodded in agreement she was quite indignant about it too he said dryly so he could hardly have been her partner hedion said she loses her coin she doesnt buy the scentsellers wares and the man escapes a mystery the only mystery im interested in solving is how long i am to stare at the bottom of my tankard before it is full again gaurane said it was certainly a mystery but hardly one they were likely to solve the heralds of valdemar were charged with keeping the peace and meting out justice but gaurane insisted he was no herald rhoses presence notwithstanding meran doubted the man still owned a traveling uniform much less a set of formal whites as for rhoses saddle and silverbelled bridle there were some things it was better not to wonder about no they could hardly look to gaurane to hunt their quarry but meran disliked thieves it was one thing to steal when you had to steal or starvehed done that often enough before bard meloree found him it was another thing to steal for sport or out of greed the man hed seen with mistress therets purse looked well fed and clean which was more to the point and his clothes had been of good quality and in good condition if you want to be a guardsman im sure theyd take you on elade said in a low voice you didnt have to come with me meran answered easier than buying you out of the stocks gaurane would complain about the waste of coin and hedion would worry if you can get hedion to worry youre doing better than gaurane is he said absently his gaze never leaving the crowds around them hedion worries elade said as long as its about somebody else im sure even you notice that point meran said he didnt know what he was looking foror rather he did know but he wasnt sure hed see it anywhere there was money there was thievery but the style of thievery varied from city to countryside there might be a few cutpurses working a crowd like this but it was unlikely the experts at that craft would travel all the way to goldendale to ply their trade here you were more likely to find snatchandgrab artists horse traders selling spavined nags as sound or even an oldfashioned mugging or two what hed seen the day before didnt fit any of those categories it was trickery but what kind there see him thats the man meran kept his voice lowthough there was no possibility of being overheard in the crowds noiseand nodded toward a piesellers stall as he watched the same man hed seen yesterday walked up to the table and pointed toward the shelves the pieman reached back and took down a pie he handed it over smiling though meran watched closely he did not see any money exchanged wait here ill get him elade took off like a hound thats suddenly seen a rabbit break cover the man dropped the pie and bolted he and elade vanished into the crowd meran sighed not the way he would have done it but he had no doubt elade would catch their culprit then they could ask him what hed done with mistress therets purse since there was no chance of catching up to elade he settled himself to wait it was half a candlemark before elade returned she was alone i cant believe he outran you meran said what elade asked blankly oh no i caught up to him quickly enough but he said he wasnt the man i was after so i let him go for a long moment meran stared at her he said he was innocent and you believed him elade simply stared back at him looking cross then her eyes widened and she looked utterly horrified come on meran said sighing its time to consult an expert there was no place in all of valdemar where a herald and a companion would not be made welcome in fact there were several heralds at summerfair for one of a heralds duties was to hear disputes and give judgment and another was to keep the peace and those whose circuits brought them near the great fairs made sure to attend them the only time things became awkward was when one traveled with a companion whose herald flatly refused to acknowledge himself as a herald they found rhoses with three other companions in an open space behind one of the larger pavilions one of them was probably with a herald trainee on progress while the other two would be the companions of the heralds working the fair in his time at the collegium meran had become used to the sight of the dazzling white creatures who held the peace and safety of valdemar in their charge but no matter how much the herald candidates insisted they were easily distinguishable hed never been able to tell one companion from another but it was certainly rhoses who came walking over to them ears pricked forward in curiosity when he reached them he nudged hedion hard in the chest hedion staggered backward oh not you too he said theyd had to find hedion before coming for rhoses while rhoses could hear them perfectly well it would be a rather onesided conversation since no one but hedion could hear him not even gaurane a pause i am hedion protested here i am doing nothing at all meran had gotten used to listening to only half a conversation in the past several moonturns it had never stopped him from being curious about the half he couldnt hear you know him better than i do hedion said darkly come on then rhoses tossed his head and once again meran had the sense of a conversation taking place just beyond the range of hearing rhoses walked forward and hedion fell into step beside him few of those the little party passed gave them a second glance before hed left haven meran would have thought it impossible for anyone to mistake a companion for a horse but many of valdemars citizens never saw a companion at alland many of those who did were woefully unobservant at least in merans opinion a bard was trained to observe so that the things they saw could be used to add life and heart to the songs they crafted you see meran saidhed quickly learned to speak to rhoses in the same way hed speak to hedion weve run into something a bit odd theres a man here at the fair with the power to make elade change her mind elade thumped himhardin the shoulder with her fist ow meran said ruefully rubbing the bruise and that part isnt the problem but hes a thief and im not sure how hes doing it a bard should know all the mind gifts hedion translated rhoses reply even if he is a mere journeyman a lifted eyebrow conveyed the irony meran couldnt hear meran bowed mockingly without breaking step i did pay attention to my teachers you know all i can tell you is what it isnt not mindspeech not farspeaking not even overshadowing people just believe him not compulsion hedion rhoses asked you think i wouldnt recognize the kissing cousin of the bardic gift meran demanded indignantly he sighed i only saw him up close once he admitted if he was using influence he did it faster and stronger than ive ever thought was possible apparently he used it on elade directly hedion said answering the silent question elade scowled ferociously if thats what it was ill make sure he never does it again once i catch him i chased him through the crowd i caught him he she hesitated and her next words were spoken with obvious reluctance he told me id made a mistakethat he wasnt the man i was after and hedion prompted and i let him go i realized id grabbed the wrong man and i let him go i would have gone on thinking that too if meran hadnt opened his big mouth would you rather not know youd been an idiot meran demanded children hedion said or it might have been rhoses who knew so meran said if its a gift i wondered if you knew what it was and if its that strong why hasnt someone come for him a companion i mean rhoses seemed to be thinking the matter over before answering companions only come for future heralds hedion finally relayed but elade said puzzled i think he means our nameless friend doesnt have the morals to be a herald hedion said no one knew what qualities companions looked for in their chosen the people they brought to the collegium were as diverse as the people of valdemar but all of them had that something that meant they would someday don heralds whites and dedicate their lives to service i suppose that includes gaurane meran added with the usual puzzlement the thought brought if there was an ideal herald then gaurane was sort of the antiherald theyd reached their lodging i suppose id better hedion began gaurane staggered through the doorway squinting painfully at the daylight oh its you he said regarding rhoses without any sign of welcome i suppose it was inevitable come along then if youre coming he turned and strode away you had to walk quite a way before you left the outskirts of summerfair behind but at least meran was used to walking beside him elade kept up an endless nearly inaudible grumbling but at last theyd put a good mile between themselves and the nearest fair straggler gaurane located a convenient rock sat down with a grunt and reached into his tunic for the everpresent flask maybe someone can tell me why this is our problem he said after he drank you he regarded elade balefully hate being got round with mindmagic and you now meran was his target never saw a wasp nest you didnt want to poke you have a death wish this was for hedion and that is a compendium of all the virtues he finished gesturing toward rhoses and none of this has to do with karse how resistant are heralds to mindmagic meran asked im not asking you he added hurriedly im asking him all of them looked at rhoses it depends hedion finally quoted gaurane snorted cant fool one of the circus ponies you know that damned well he said harshly but you can fool a herald hedion said speaking for himself now if healers gift works on them so do the others depending on the herald you dont need a strong gift to be chosen or even one of the mind gifts at all rhoses tossed his head hedion paused listening when we are not with our chosen we only know what they know yes it is possible what he means is even if you dragged your man right up to one of those idiot meddlers in their pretty white suits its even odds hed convince them to let him go again sooner or later gaurane said irritably and we still arent thief takers so why is it our problem thieves are cautious meran said slowly a thought had been taking shape in his mind from the first time hed run into their gifted thief even now he wasnt entirely sure of the shape of it youd say it would be more cautious not to steal at all i know but imagine you have no choice or just think you can get away with it even so nobody wants to be caught so a thiefa career thief a professionaldoesnt take risks but imagine there are no risks imagine youll never be caughtor if youre caught youll never be punished once you were sure of that what might you do you mean hell do worse elade said flatly maybe meran said we cant risk it hedion said firmly but if youve guessed right meran how do we catch him or keep our hands on him once we have he looked toward gaurane and meran knew rhoses must be speaking but whatever he said hedion didnt repeat it carjoris lor was a happy man why shouldnt he be when the whole world was his treasure sack from the moment hed made up his mind to come west to find his fortune fortune had found him hed always lived by his wits hed grown up traveling from farm to farm following the work and a quick tongue and a gift of invention had saved young carjoris from countless beatings in his itinerant world theft had few consequences it would be a year and more before a laborers caravan returned and by then the theft would have been forgotten he was not clever enough to seenot thenthat the things a child might steal were small and easily forgotten but that the theft of clothes or boots or coin would be mourned and long remembered hed been shocked when upon their return to a place hed nearly forgotten his family was accused of stealingand outraged when they cast him out you never cared where things came from in all the years i brought you things you never asked but in the end you cared more about being welcome back in some mudhole than you did about me but it was an old injury now half forgotten he wasnt sure when it was that the lies he told as he wandered from town to town began to be taken for truth at first he thought it was his clevernessor their stupidity but later he came to realize it was magic whatever he saidwhatever he wantedwould be taken as truth it was a pity it never lasted long once he was out of sight his victims remembered their own truths no matter how hard he tried to settle down hed always had to keep moving then one day hed heard that in valdemar no one believed in magic people who didnt believe in magic would surely be ripe for the plucking when he reached valdemar hed been careful and cautious at first using his magic for small things things no one could say did them any harm but the fact it worked had made him bolder a country fair was just the place to test his powers and after that a fine horse and fine clothes and a pocket full of goldand no one ever again telling me what to do today carjoris decided to visit the horse fair he did not fear arresteven the guardswoman whod chased him yesterday hadnt been immune to his magic if anyone accused him all he had to do was say he was innocent theyd believe him he moved quickly past the lines of mules the brokendown hacks the plow horses and cart horses there at the end of the street were the creatures he sought their coats gleamed like satin and silk and a man who rode one of those fine mares or geldings would be seen instantly for a man of wealth and stature and a man who looked to buy would be feted like a prince he passed a shaggy unkempt fellow loitering nearbyobviously some poor fool looking to exchange a days work for a meal and a bed perhaps i shall hire a servant he thought as he walked toward the horse seller his mind on a pleasant afternoon of wine and flattery then something struck him and carjoris knew nothing more he did not know how long it had been when at last consciousness returned he was lying on the ground with a sack on his head he groaned and rolled over with a grunt someone had put a sack over his head he pawed it away and sat up wincing at the brightness of the sun hello a voice said pleasantly carjoris blinked the voice belonged to the ruffian hed seen near the horse sellers the man was sitting on a rock holding a wineskin a white horsesuperior to any of the beasts carjoris had been admiringstood behind him though since it had neither saddle nor bridle it clearly didnt belong to the stranger the rock was in the middle of a field and the field was in the middle of nowhere what happened to me carjoris asked his mouth was dustdry he spat to clear it i hit you over the head with a club the stranger said im gaurane who are you carjoris blinked certain he could not have heard correctly im thirsty give me the wine he held out his hand but instead of handing over the wineskin gaurane laughed sorry thirsty i dont share its mine carjoris said give it to me gaurane simply shook his head save your breath my son your tricks arent going to work on me he tapped the side of his head deaf as a post carjoris got to his feet painfully and looked around they werent alone here as hed first thought in the distance he could see three people watching them im leaving now he said did you know elades from sensolding gaurane asked something in his voice made carjoris hesitate sensolding thats holder lands harsh country hard people i suspect none of that means much to you but try this she learned to use a great bow almost before she could walk the range on it is well from where shes standing to here thats her over there gaurane waved and one of the figures waved back walk away from me son and shell put an arrow into you thats murder carjoris said only if she kills you gaurane said now sit down i have a few things to say to you carjoris looked from the figures in the distance to gaurane and he sat you arent from here are you gaurane asked there wasnt anything to do but answerand hope he could find a way out of this iftel ah so likely you think you have some kind of magic power but you see magic doesnt work in valdemar we call what you can do a gift youre making a mistake carjoris said oh i dont think so elade doesnt think soyou used your power on her you know meran doesnt think sohe saw you take the purse at the scentsellers stall and me i really dont care but my friends do so were going to make sure you dont do things like that any more stealing is wrong he added virtuously i wont ever do it againi promise carjoris said desperately if he could convince the man that he repented and get the maniac to let him go well heres the thing gaurane said i dont believe you and using a gift to trick people thats even more wrong but its tempting isnt it i never took anything anybody needed carjoris said they were rich ah well thats a matter of perspective gaurane said now me i think youre a nasty little bully and i wouldnt lose a moments sleep over slitting your throat hedions got standards though so i suppose we could just dose you up with something that shuts down your giftoh dont look at me like that this is valdemar they understand the mindgifts hereand send you off to haven theyd put truth spell on you you know and when youd told them what youd been up to why theyd get someone to burn your gift out of you before they sent you off to prison or we could just do what elade suggested and slit your tongue hard to talk people into things when you cant talk carjoris looked at him for a long minute trying to judge how serious he was when gaurane did not so much as blink carjoris knew there was no escaping this disaster please he said covering his face with his hands please and then theres meran gaurane said as though carjoris hadnt spoken did you know he grew up on the streets in haven a beggar and a thief but one day a bard found him and took him off to the collegium and he never stole again he didnt have to the question is would you steal if you didnt have to carjoris lifted his head and stared at gaurane at that ray of potential salvation i wouldnt i wont he said desperately ah gaurane said sighing never lie to a drunk boy were good at seeing the truth of course you have a third choice he reached down into the grass beside him and picked something up carjoris couldnt see what it was before gaurane tossed it at his feet he looked down at it and could not believe his eyes you want me to weara collar the silver flashed in the sun its even got a lock gaurane said cheerfully bouncing a small object in his hand and the thing about this collar isoh i dont suppose you can read so let me tell you about itthe engraving on it says you should be handed over to the next herald who rides by youll recognize them theyll be the ones riding something that looks like that he jerked a thumb over his shoulder at the white horse standing patiently behind him and those things are smart and you cant trick them and they arent horses no matter what they look like and youll find yourself in valdemar before you can blink theyll probably hire you out as a laborer there so you can pay back what you stole after they burn out your gift of course ifif i wear that youll let me go carjoris stammered once he was away from here he could surely find a blacksmith to strike the collar off only what if they read it first what if they chained him up and gagged him and delivered him to one of these heralds the white horse snorted and gaurane gave a sharp bark of laughter or you wear that and come with us do what youre told we work hard harder than youve ever worked a day in your life but the reward is well worth the labor well put you to work teach you what you need to know in order to be of use if youre a good boy we might even get someone to teach you the right way to use that gift of yours someday once were convinced youre done misusing it run try to compel any of us make any troubleand youll wish id let elade put an arrow into you now carjoris shook his head trying to make some kind of sense out of all this whywhywhy he stuttered maybe you deserve a chance to be someone better maybe you were born with your gift for a reason maybe all you need is somebody to show you how to be a hero maybe im tired of listening to elade bitch about doing all the work around the camp or maybe i bet hedion youd rather take your chances in haven than do an honest days work but like i said its your choice who who do you think you are anger got the better of caution of the hardlearned lesson that the only way to survive was to smile and give soft words no matter what words were said to you me gaurane said im nobody but i was somebodyfor a while and its a funny thing but if you give someone a thing worth doing well sometimes thats worth quite a lot he got to his feet grunting with the effort times up youngster choose i he looked down at the collar at his feet trapped and trapped well that much was certain he could run and take his chances with the womans aim he could put on the collar and take his chances with finding someone to strike it from around his neck he could give himself up to one of their heralds and take his chances that their punishment would be lenient and easily survived but gaurane was watching him a little smile lingering at the edges of his lips he looked like a man who held a secret and carjoris suddenly desperately wanted to know what that secret was a hero he liked the sound of that my name is carjoris he said his hands shook as he reached for the collar it was lined in leather and the metal was warm from the sun but it still felt cold and heavy as he closed it around his throat a pleasure to meet you gaurane said without irony he tossed the lock into carjoriss lap it clinked against the metal as carjoris threaded it through the clasp and squeezed it shut come on gaurane was holding a hand down to him carjoris took it and gaurane pulled him to his feet whatwhat happens now carjoris asked he knew he ought to feel afraid or even angry at having been trapped so neatly but he didnt he didnt know what he felt now we go back to the fairshould be there by darkand you hand over everything youve stolen and meran goes and finds a herald to give it all back and tomorrow we buy you a horse and whatever else you need did i mention we spend our time living rough up on the border youll get used to it he turned and began to walk toward the others the white horse followed as it passed him it turned its head and gave carjoris a penetrating look come on if youre coming gaurane called and carjoris found himself running to catch up youve lost me a fivemark piece you know gaurane said when he reached him ah well maybe i can get hedion to go double or nothing over a moonturn you know to give him a sporting chance youll lose carjoris said with sudden confidence they walked on chapter in an instant elizabeth a vaughan the thick yellow dust caught in her throat right next to her heart the euphoria of their victory over ancar of hardorn was starting to pass the ragged cheers starting to fade selenay remembered all too well what happened next the cold harsh wind of dealing with the aftermath shed managed to keep herself together this long her officers could handle the next few minutes without her i just need a moment selenay whispered to her guards seeking the privacy of her tent they nodded taking up their positions they probably thought she wished to thank her gods or see to her own needs but the truth was not so simple once the flap was raised once shed retreated into the darkness of its shelter and its relative silence her emotions overwhelmed her she stumbled past the table of maps into her sleeping area and collapsed on her stool she dropped her head to her handsand fought to hold back tears this could not be happening not here not now not ever he is his brother she gasped then pulling in stale air and shivered she was a queen a mother a herald for the love of all the gods she was in the middle of a war fresh from a battle she never thought theyd win she should be rejoicing at their victory and dealing with the consequences thereof the dead the injured the damages to the land her people her land her kingdom instead here she was like some silly girl weeping overher heart skipped a beat he is his brother the sounds outside the flimsy canvas of her tent were muted and distant all she could hear was her heart in her ears her ragged breath in her throat and her thricedamned memories in that case gracious lady let the prince prevail upon your noble nature and present himself the young man said flinging himself at her feet in the most romantic posture possible shed been so young and so stupid dreaming of romance so gullible karathanelan prince of rethwellan had appeared as if in answer to her dreams and swept her off her feet shed fallen for him so fast so foolishly so blindly in love that shed swept all opposition aside ignoring the concerns of friends advisers even her own companion like a child with a new toy shed been stupid arrogant naive and dearest gods was it happening again it couldnt it just couldnt no this couldnt be happening shed slammed the doors and windows on that stupid dream the day her loving husband had smiled at her over the glint of his sword she could still feel that lance of fear as his friends had surrounded her and shed faced them for long moments alone never alone selenay lifted her tearful face to a beloved white head pushing its way into the tent oh caryo she whispered caryo stepped closer selenay stood and pressed her face into that warm neck feeling the soft silky mane of white absorb her tears whatever this is whatever happens we face this together caryos mindspeech carried all of the warmth of her love with it i am here for you chosen i i think its a lifebond selenay held on for dear life and let her tears flow he is his brother she wailed in despair sharing her fear caryo i cant he is his brother caryo confirmed but he is also chosen selenay lifted her tearstreaked face and drew a sharp breath he is i didnt notice he was in front of me and i was so stunned i didnt see see again caryo commanded and selenay saw again in her mindseye lord darenthallis of rethwellan his helmet in one hand stretching out his hand to kiss hers saw him lift his head saw his brownishblond hair and gazed into those hazel eyes and saw him seated on a companion her knees buckled and she went down onto the stool caryo followed lowering her head to nuzzle selenays face chosen selenay wiped at her eyesby jasan caryo said on the battlefield as is kerowyn by sayvel selenay blinked as a slow smile crept over her face oh keros going to hate whites she hiccupped a weak chuckle a snort of agreement from caryo chosen selenay frowned pushing her hair back from her face how will we deal with a mercenary company for that matter how do i explain this to king faramentha what will he say to lose his lord marshal you are thinking like a queen caryo noted shaking her mane in approval that is well why do you say that because hes standing outside your tent hesitating not sure what to say or how to say it but knowing the bond selenay felt it too vibrating between them rolan says that talia says to breathe that a lifebond is overwhelming and confusing go slow and remember that you are not the girl you were he is his brother selenay nodded slowly still nervous and unsure but the terror was ebbing away but i am queen and herald and mother of a halfgrown daughter i can handle this she put her hand on caryos neck we can handle this daren took a deep breath of heat and dust and let it out slowly he adjusted his capeand tried to brush dust from his uniform one would think you were facing your final battle the voice in his head said i am daren looked over his shoulder at the white stallion behind him companion jasan reminded him the big horse shook his white head and somehow managed to look amused daren concentrated this is going to take some getting used to he thought his head was still whirling from the last few days the confusion of the battle the victory being chosen and now the queen of valdemar was the bond between them vibrated with her nervousness echoing his it will take time jasan agreed but you should not keep her waiting daren looked back at the tent before him the queens guards were looking at him with odd expressions he wasnt sure why he was hesitating so much hed known many women been in and out of relationships like he changed garments but this his heart clenched in his chest this mattered daren pushed through the tent flap he stood in the darkness and let his eyes adjust she stood opposite him her companions head over her shoulder the table of maps between them dearest gods she was lovely golden hair blue eyes that were strong and yet like a startled does her armor was a mixture of plate and white leather and it didnt show much dust but there were smudges on her face and the trace of tears it hurt him to see her pain your majesty daren placed his hand over his heart and bowed his head lord darenthallis selenays voice trembled daren he blurted out i go by daren daren she repeated her voice trailed off and they both stood there staring at one another i didnt intend this daren said i never thought that something like this could happen i your brothers greeting jasan prompted daren pulled himself up your majesty i bring greetings from king faramentha of rethwellan he bade me say that our presence here today honors the pledge that king stefansen made to heraldprince roald preserving the honor of rethwellan and the friendship between our lands you look nothing like him selenay whispered wonder and relief in her voice daren stared back at her helplessly faram and i favor my father he replied thanel favored our mother thanel he went by karath when he was here daren shook his head in disgust thanel was what he was known by in rethwellan daren continued my old weaponsmistress called him a grekkashen thats an animal found on the plains he explained scavenges anything dead soils its own nest and eats its young selenay grimaced appropriate she murmured dropping her eyes i wish id known that before her words trailed off daren shook his head would it have made a difference ii dont know selenay answered her honesty wrung out and raw he could charm the sun out of the sky the vicious little beast daren took a step forward i am not him he said fiercely selenay lifted her head and looked at him a faint wondering in her eyes she nodded slowly and then frowned slightly i seem to remember someone telling me your weaponsmistress was shinain wasnt she daren nodded she wouldnt train thanel for any price trained me though and kero he laughed shaking his head taught us the trick we used today in fact worked out well he stared at selenay wanting her to know everything we were lovers when we were young he blurted out then covered his face with his hand oh gods why did i say that jasan whickered outside selenay coughed and daren opened his fingers to see her choking back a laugh we are not at our best she offered you traveled far to save us to save valdemar i served my king your majesty daren took shelter in a return to formality but never so joyously he paled as he thought on his journey hardorns ancar is another grekkashen what hes done to the land daren drew a shuddering breath hes not done with valdemar yet lady he looked back into those lovely blue eyes with us he lost himself in her face again just staring at her thankfully she seemed lost in his as well you have a smudge on your nose he whispered selenay blushed his heart flipped as she lifted a hand and rubbed her nose he took a step forward wanting nothing more than tobut he stopped and took a conscious and deliberate step back selenays eyes were wide questioning him your majesty daren said carefully i need to see to my people as do you we both have duties here and now but i would like to explore this possibility the possibility of us selenay nodded as would i but know this queen selenay daren set his shoulders trying to find the right words your majesty id wherever this leadsif it leads to something growing between usill not be crowned what selenay stared at him and her companion also seemed taken aback he heard the rustle of canvas behind him and jasan pushed his head into the tent daren suppressed a surge of satisfaction hed surprised them all but if this thing between us selenay gestured toward jasan being chosen you would qualify as coruler in a way that karath never she stopped herself daren nodded karath thanel whatever you decide to call him he left a taint and i will not walk in his footsteps but even more than that i do not wish to wear a crown faram deals with so much as a result of that burden and i know full well the price selenay nodded her understanding but if you would allow daren said softly i would stand with you support you in all ways all things behind the throne he smiled at her not on it selenay took a breath her eyes tearing up are you sure more than sure daren said now with your leave your majesty ill jasan bumped him in the middle of his back kiss her daren scowled and shook his head what selenay asked he thinks i should kiss you daren looked at her ruefully then glanced back at his companion were you born in a barn selenays laughter burst out like rain on his thirsty soul selenay could not restrain her laughter rising out of her relief daren gave her a boyish grin are they always that pushy he asked most times selenay said teasingly then laughed again as cayro shook her head in denial daren this is my companion cayro my lady daren bowed i believe you already know my companion jasan jasan snorted as he backed out of the tent i really really want to kiss you your maj selenay she interrupted selenay his smile lit his face he drew a breath but there is time for that well talk first before we explore other possibilities id want to really know you before daren paused do you know what i am trying to say selenay nodded her throat tight with emotion unable to speak feeling the truth of his words within the bond but youll forgive me if i hope the wait is not long daren said and id ask one favor he added his eyes sparkling selenay raised an eyebrow dont believe anything kero says i dont snore selenay laughed again and the band of pressure around her chest eased daren gave her a boyish grin and lifted his eyebrows her heart turned over at the sight im not sure how i am going to explain this to faram its going to take me a score of letters to convince him that ive been chosen and explain what that means darens eyebrows danced maybe ill tell him that jasan is a shinain battlesteed that might do it there was an offended snort from outside selenay suppressed the giggle that rose in her chest im in valdemar to stay daren said i am not going to give up jasan or you selenay of valdemar im glad selenay replied confidence flowing through her daren put on his helmet looking satisfied your majesty he swept a graceful courtly bow as he backed away selenay stepped forward suddenly reluctant to part she extended her hand daren took it gently in his and lightly touched his lips to it then he left with a flourish of his cloak selenay stood for a moment he is not his brother he is not caryo agreed and i am here always always selenay said as the tightness in her shoulders eased even more noises from without and the flap was raised the lord marshal is here to confer with you selenay rubbed her face hopefully erasing her tears let him enter she commanded a battle won majesty the lord marshal strode in with his staff but there are consequences yet to be dealt with selenay stepped to the map table lets see to it shall we she bent her head to the reports he laid out for her with a new energy no she smiled to herself more like a new anticipation and a new determination to protect valdemar and those she loved chapter a healers work daniel shull the greenhouse was worse than hed expected the tools had gotten damp from the constant storms and plants were either dying or running riot whoever had last been inside appeared to have trimmed just enough materials for their use and then run off several of the windows had been left open and drains had not been cleared resulting in a sludge that clung to everything the mess wasnt insurmountable just extensive only there shouldnt have been a mess to begin with healer serril looked around the dilapidated greenhouse with more than a bit of irritation tempered only by his fondness for the trainee standing a few feet away from him jayin waved a slightly rusted trowel in the direction of the healers collegium fury radiating from her normally placid brown eyes idiots hamfisted children delinquents fumblefingered serril interrupted her before someone came to investigate the furious ranting jayin her name backed by all of his authority was enough to stop the trainee midrant she grimaced but bowed in apology to her mentor eyes to the ground in a show of contrition the apology was certainly genuine everything else was for show serril knew from long experience he also knew that the healers whod require her contrition would be the ones most likely to accept a display and not probe deeper brone immediately came to mind she had good reason for her irritation to be sure ever since elspeth had returned the collegia and court had been all atwitter for their suddenly strange heraldmage and her even stranger allies the two hawkbrothers alone would be enough to turn anyones head add the creatures called gryphons and their younglings and it was no wonder that most of haven occupied themselves with little else gossip left the court galloped around the city and returned with three heads seven legs and no sense whatsoever the hawkbrothers were descended from the gryphons or vice versa elspeth was nothing more than a chew toy for the ravening monsters that were set to take over valdemar vanyel himself had been resurrected and somehow brought to the court and those were the tamer stories it was enough to make a cat sneeze and the normally sensible healers had mostly fallen prey to this absurdity essential duties had been let slide reports from the countryside were stacking up because the secretary was too busy loitering in the diplomatic wing hoping for a glimpse of their exotic guests despite his incessant lurking nobody quite had the heart to shoo the man away when this was probably the most excitement hed ever had the library was in disarray because nobody was thinking about putting books away the greenhouse had suffered because not one healeruntil nowhad come in to maintain it for at least a week the sensible ones had simply been overwhelmed with trying to deal with everything their counterparts should have been doing serril and jayin had valid excuses though theyd been at briarley crossing attending to the results of what was best called a string of strange luck an outbreak of the flux several broken bones and no fewer than five birthsall within two weeks time the local healer and the midwife had been swamped and grateful for their help then the day they were due to leave for haven a particularly nasty storm had blown up and made travel impractical for another two weeks when they had finally ridden into haven jayin had muttered something about hiding from the dean of the healers for a few days serril had nodded knowing exactly how she felt sadly he wouldnt be able to dodge that worthy as easily as jayin even if he hadnt planned to visit the dean to recommend that she receive her full greens for their work in briarley crossing theyd been assisting at a healing station in the north and were on their way back to haven when theyd arrived in briarley crossing just as things took a turn for the busy so of course he had to report to the dean to explain the whys and wherefores behind their late arrival and then give his report on jayin dean ostel had mostly paid attention to serrils report and his recommendation for jayin massaging his temples as if fighting off an oncoming headache serril didnt think the stocky man had a problem with his report but several months outside of haven politics made him more than a bit wary he did his best not to play the games but he knew how to watch for them and avoid the most troublesome ones the deans next words took him by surprise im afraid i cant let you rest just yet my friend i need you and your trainee to deal with the greenhouse ostel grimaced his blue eyes a touch dull underneath furrowed pale brows im not sure if youve heard the rumors but the truth is a bit more strange ive made notes for you both but the upshot is that nobody has seen to the greenhouse in about a week and i trust you not to get well distracted serril snapped back to the present and watched as jayin caught herself before she ran muddy fingers through her straight brown hair this is absurd serril i mean i can understand getting distracted by the hawkbrothers and those astounding creatures but this she gestured again the trowel gripped as delicately as a scalpel might have been slender fingers maintaining control at all times somehow the gesture took in the healers collegium bardic the heralds the palace and the surrounding cityand made it clear that she found them all lacking jayin had grown up in a traveling performers caravan and the drama learned in the tents and the wagons occasionally surfaced healers are only human and with the heir renouncing the crown on top of everything else smartest thing she could have done jayin muttered its upset the apple cart as it were and yes heraldmage elspeth was politically smart to do what she did but my goodness jayin id expect you to keep that opinion to yourself theres more than enough uproar throughout the capital without a soontobe healer interjecting her opinions in so impolitic a manner he chuckled as he dug his fingers into the next pot where a plant was barely surviving he added quietly not that the rest of them havent been but at least we can attempt to present an air of neutrality he had the healing giftlike jayin which was why theyd been pairedbut greenery responded to his particular gift quite well serril gently pulled the plant out of the pot and transplanted it to another cushioning it with his gift against the shock of the move the new soil was better suited for the plant anyway a faint surge of energy and he felt the roots wake up and settle into the new soil with what in a human hed have called a contented sigh jayin snorted since you yourself taught me about maintaining that neutrality ill presume youre teasing me especially since theres not another healer anywhere near here she stopped about to gesture yet again with the trowel when the hurried knock at the greenhouse door interrupted her serril kept himself from laughing but only barely fatigue had lowered his guard too it seemed come in he managed as the healer walked in serril thought thank goodness its tessa and not brone the healer was obviously distracted though as she began speaking tessa didnt even see the interior of the greenhouse or the two healers painted with mud fertilizer and pieces of dead plants ill need a few leaves of the woundwort no more than three and she stopped dead as she refocused on her surroundings blessed haven this place is a disaster and look at you two at that serril lost control completely sagging against the workbench and wheezing laughter to tessas obvious surprise jayin very primly placed the rusted trowel next to her and then planted her hands on her hips in the midst of his laughter serril managed to remember her pose for the next time he teased her about how you could take the girl from the theater but you couldnt take the theater out of the girl if it werent you healer tessa id tell you there was none to be had its in bad shape and might not survive another few days she steadfastly ignored her mentors further laughter instead giving him a polite yet disapproving look as jayins left eyebrow went up serril turned away to keep himself from giggling further tessa grinned at them both back less than a day and ostels already put you to work my apologies trainee jayin im on an errand for the female gryphonhydona her name isand were comparing medicinal herbs and uses she may well be a treasure trove for all that she cant use a mortar and pestle she paused a moment then continued fair enough the woundworts out of bounds why dont we pick a few leaves from the plants that will survive it then jayins eyes drooped and serril reflected that he probably didnt look much better the greenhouse had been set to rights as best as they were able floors tables and tools cleaned the plants likely to survive given as much care as possible and requests sent off for replacements for the unrecoverable ones when theyd arrived it had been midmorning they hadnt eaten all day and theyd barely made it to dinner the two of them had gotten what food was left and they now slowly made their way from the refectory toward their rooms the long day had definitely taken its toll on both of them jayin navigated the path more by memory than by actually looking at it i dont care if my bed hasnt been aired out yet im going to fall in and not get up for a week serril opened his mouth to suggest she might want to change out of her dirty clothes when a sound interrupted him it took him a moment but for anyone whod spent time in havenand at the palacethe sound of hooves chiming on the gravel path was unmistakable a companion it walked right up to serril staring at him and jayin with impossible blue eyes as if evaluating the two it nudged gently at serrils shoulder and then jayins the creature looked for all the world as if itno shewere on the verge of tears as she took a step back shifting her head in an unmistakable follow me motion jayin gaped and looked on the verge of tears serril swallowed and said your pardon but my trainee and i havent had any rest for the past day i know and if i had any other choice i wouldnt be asking this the voicedecidedly female anxious and fearfulcame from the companion in front of them there was really no other explanation jayin must have heard it as well from the strangled squeaking she made im breaking a host of rules by doing this of course but it seems to me that the rules are going to get rewritten soon enough my herald has need of your particular talents the both of you and she doesnt have much time the companion blew air through her nose in not quite a snort im layelle and my herald is mellie please please please say youll come the worry came through even without the words being spoken out loudin fact it was even more apparent this way jayin squeaked a bit moreshed had dreams once of being a heraldbut serril gave the companion a slow nod no layelle if you have need of us companion layelle then lead on well do what we can they followed layelle to the hospice meant for the most seriously wounded who could still be treated firm beds made it easier to move patients detachable wooden railings prevented accidents such as rolling off the bed and various pulleys allowed for broken limbs to be kept elevated and a quarter of the beds were meant for heralds as well since they had wide neardoors by each bed that could allow a companion to stick his or her head in during decent weather they reached mellies bed about the same time as layelle nudged open the wooden panel the evening was temperate enough that serril didnt objectfor the moment it seemed to not be raining as he looked down into the bed he sucked in air through clenched teeth shock jolting him awake mellie was tied to the bed frame as gently as possible but her wrists and ankles showed signs of resistance her sweat soaked hair flared around her head across both pillow and blankets already pale features looked ghastly against the sheets the young woman barely older than jayin muttered despite the depth of a slumber produced by the contents of the cup next to the bed serril looked over the slate board at the foot of the bed convulsions and fever were the only obvious signs of illness no bite marks from insects or snakes no unaccounted bruising to either body or head and no trouble breathingin short nothing the healers could label and treat mellie was capable of taking in light broth and milk sweetened with honey according to the notes but alone those were not enough to sustain the herald companion layelle serril began since this information isnt helping me what do you know blue eyes met his even as jayin ran a standard round of tests absently serril noted that his trainee had woken up as well it began when all the heralds in haven were struck with that headache mellie and i werent too far from here but her headache seemed particularly bad she got over it though and i didnt think about it until she started having trouble sleeping we were headed out on circuit but mellie kept insisting that we had to go back her mindspeech wasnt good enough to reach the capital and i didnt feel the same pull she did the companion paused though serril only noticed it because he was listening so hard a few nights ago we slept at a waystation mellie had been irritable all day as if she had a mild headache but it wasnt anything i felt through her the next morning she barely woke up enough to get up on me practically crying from the pain i came back here as fast as i could but nobody here seemed to know what to do jayin must have heard something in the companions mindvoice because she asked you have an idea of whats going on though dont you the brilliant white head sagged like a child caught with a hand in the candy jar the thing that caused the headache was a source of magic landing right in the middle of haven i think that woke something up in mellie maybe mage gift but here the companion paused obviously i think the mage channels were damaged in the process and the two of you are my best hope of healing those channels because each of you has worked directly on healing channels before unlike the other healers here in haven serril blinked are healing channels that similar then close enough that with the three of us mellie has a chance otherwise the companion trailed off the fear once again rising in her voice jayin put a hand on serrils arm we have to do this with the war still going on valdemars going to need all the heraldmages she can field serril knew this just as well as he knew how risky it was to go mucking about with someones channels of energy it wasnt a matter of strength in the gift patience or delicacymost gifted healers had all three it took a master level of talent to even touch the healing channels never mind that these were mage channels not healing channels but the situation needed them mellie and layelle needed them after a moment he nodded jayin get the blankets and some lanterns well need as much privacy as possible for this layelle i dont know how but you seem to know what we need to do so whatever help you can give us will be appreciated in moments the four of them were isolated from the rest of the room jayin had added a tiny bit of mint oil to the lamps reservoirs something serril wouldnt have thought of to keep the air smelling clean while they worked layelle leaned over to gently lip mellies hair then looked at the two healers here ill link to you both so that i can show you where the channels are and as serril reached for jayin to link their healing together as theyd done so often recently he felt a third presence join them female warm with hope cool with worry familiar in a way that told him that layelle knew healing in more than the abstract the three sank into mellie finding the obvious places they would ordinarily touch to bring healing but knowing that those would need to wait layelle pointed in a direction that was new to the two healers guiding them toward a place that serril immediately compared to a muscledeep cut it pulsed raw and bleeding even the faint trickle of power that he could now sense abrading the already sensitive surfaces of the channels where the channels began the healer could see that mellie had unconsciously tried to block everything off even that wasnt enough her wall only able to contain some of the energy that wanted to flow through those channels some deep part of himself hummed in both excitement and satisfaction together he and jayin would teach other healers how to look for mage channels spread the knowledge so it wouldnt be lost now that layelle had shown himand jayinwhere the channels existed the next step was to determine how best to heal them in healer trainees who had overextended themselves the healing energy itself would often help restore those channels as long as the trainees remembered not to use their gifts here though the mage energies were different enough that they couldnt just sit back and let nature take its course the channels were already so raw that mellie might never be able to use them even when healed how can we do this it was very odd hearing jayin by way of layelle the companion must be breaking even more rules to allow the three of them to communicate as if they were all gifted with mindspeech a faint flare of guilt tempered with the feeling of necessity answered his question he thought for a moment we need to insulate the channels from the mage energies layelle is there anything you can do about that trickle of energy serril felt more than heard the snort its breaking even more rules but yes odd how easy it is to see everything now that both of you are working with me amazement filled him as he watched the trickle fade entirely he couldnt tell where it was going but what mattered was that mellie no longer had the flow of energy rubbing raw channels dimly he knew that her body had finally relaxed it was a good step but only a first one now he drew jayins attention to the channels themselves we need to heal those without sealing them off or creating so much scar tissue that theyll be unusable the next words out of his trainee surprised and pleased him its like a burn more than anything else if we use our healing to create a layer of skin over the raw places that should allow the walls of the channels to recover without creating any scar tissue itll take more energy but shell recover more quickly i think layelles surprise echoed around the three of them but the companion immediately supported jayins idea if one of you creates the skin the other should be able to heal the rawness of the channels at the same time healer jayin youre brilliant if i could id stand in front of the board and dean to tell them so jayin then if you would create the skin ill start the healing not only is it your idea youve got a more delicate touch you have more than twice over earned your greens young woman and the two set to work with jayin protecting the surface of the channels while serril took on the simpler but more intense work of repairing the damage the healing went slowly as neither of them wanted to run the risk of accidentally damaging mellie or her mage channels serril couldnt be certain but he suspected that other healers had come and gone while they worked anything else simply didnt register in his awareness when they had finished their work with the channels serril was seriously drained but they couldnt stop there were areas around the channels that needed attention that nongifted healing wouldnt touch jayin was drained nearly as much as he was but he felt her determination through the link shared with layelle well finish this the right way serril felt the pride welling up in him the good healerswhether gifted or giftedhad that drive hed seen it enough in others and in that moment jayin stopped being a trainee at least in his mind that we will healer jayin her pleasure radiated through the link and the two of them reached out with their gifts to heal the remaining damage at the end of it as he slowly withdrew from the healing trance serril heard layelle one last time in his mind thank you both so very much leave the rest to the other healers the companions and the heralds the lamps had burned out a faint light streamed through the opening where layelle had been the companion slowly trudged out of sight toward companions field head held as high as it could be considering shed been just as busy as the two healers serril could barely keep his eyes open but he knew that he needed to take jayin immediately to the dean and requestno demandthat she be given her greens immediately investiture and graduation were formalities at this point in his opinion he was about to say so when the woman on the bed opened her eyes and inhaled slowly pains goon the heralds voice was creaky low and the she swallowed carefully yuzr gud fer sommat before she could say any more jayin laid a careful hand on their patients forehead of course we are the soontobehealer said with a note of pride singing through her obvious fatigue we have to be our work doesnt stop with just healing ignoring the surprised snort she stood and wavered a moment before catching her balance lets go tell the dean get my greens and thenthen maybe i can sleep they supported each other all the way to the deans office chapter a leash of greyhounds elisabeth waters the greyhounds were upset there was blood which wasnt surprising because shantells husband lord kristion and his friend teren had taken the dogs with them when they went out hunting but there was something wrong lena lady shantell said gently youll never finish your embroidery if you just sit there staring at nothing besides its rude its the wrong blood lena shivered i apologize she said aloud its very kind of you to teach me to embroider your mother would have wanted me to shantell said simply thats probably true although i dont remember her all that well it is kind of lady shantell to invite me to stay at her home and to try to teach me the things a young lady should know just because she was a friend of my mothers doesnt mean that shes obliged to do anything for me and it certainly isnt her fault that id rather be back in haven at the temple im glad that ill be going back next week i miss the animals thereand the people lena bent her head and concentrated on the embroidery whatever was bothering the dogs shed find out soon enough the men had still not returned when the tea tray was brought in and shantells son joined them jasper was ten five years younger than lena and about the age she had been when the last member of her family died lena was now a ward of the king so she took classes at the palace complex along with the herald bardic and healer trainees but she lived at the temple of thenoth lord of the beasts she had been there for the past several years ever since her giftanimal mindspeechhad started to develop shantell was a devout follower of a god who had no nameor perhaps a name too holy to be spoken lena wasnt sure whichand she used teatime to concentrate on her sons religious education they believed that their god was the only one that existed another concept that lena found strange she had however quickly learned to keep quiet about her own beliefs lady shantell didnt approve of a god who cared about animals and lenas explanation that there were plenty of other gods who cared about people had earned her a scolding for blasphemy i dont think my saying it is blasphemy if i dont worship her god and the king and all of my teachers say there is no one true way thats the law still im not going to tell her that i have animal mindspeech i dont think she would appreciate that at all but at the moment being able to talk to the dogs wasnt helping much they werent making any sense lena knew that they were still in the woods guarding the kill and waiting for somebody to carry it home but why were they so sad when the butler appeared in the doorway as soon as jasper had returned to the nursery lena hardly needed to look at his face to know that something horrible had happened lady shantell he began gently theres been an accident lord kristion was shot shantelle jumped out of her chair and hurried across the room where is he she demanded the butler actually turned pale theyre bringing his body home now lady shantell collapsed on the nearest chair and started screaming the butler stood frozen in the doorway gaping at his mistress who had probably never been anything but gentle and softspoken in her life crossing the room past her so that she could talk to the butler without trying to scream over her lena suggested that he summon her maid and the priest the butler bowed gratefully and left at a speed that was just a bit slower than flight shantell continued to scream leaving lena wishing that she could flee the room as well with the help of the housekeeper shantells maid got her to drink some sort of sedative and put her to bed the body was brought home washed and laid out in the chapel where the priest said prayers over it apparently he considered it proper for someone to be in the chapel with the body until it could be buried and lena who was in the habit of rising before dawn at the temple volunteered to take the predawn watch she found herself wide awake over an hour before she was due in the chapel and she could still hear the greyhounds in her head so she dressed quickly and went out to the kennels the kennelmaster was asleepi dont blame him he must have had a really horrible day yesterday and the dogs whined quietly and crowded around her lena stroked heads as they were shoved into her lap and tried to calm them but all too soon it was time for her watch in the chapel and the dogs were unwilling to be parted from her at least theyre quiet as long as theyre with me so i guess its better if i just take them along lena preceded the dogs into the chapel and told them to hang back so that the housekeeper who had the watch before hers left without seeing them lena sat on a bench at the head of the bier and the dogs formed a circle around the body the chapel was made of stone and was separate from the main house so it was very cold inside lena wrapped her cloak more tightly around her but it didnt help her shivering much she rose to her feet and paced around the bier envying the dogs their fur they lay quietly but she could feel them a low mumble in the back of her mind mourning for their master she heard heavy footsteps approaching and she hastily returned to the bench and bowed her head as if in prayer she wasnt sure how to pray in this situation she didnt know enough about shantells god to feel comfortable addressing him but she was pretty sure that shantell would object to prayers addressed to any other god especially in her gods chapel possibly her god would too and lena had no desire to anger him so she mostly thought about the life of lord kristion and how much everyone was going to miss him the footsteps had entered the chapel and lena had heard a thud as their owner collapsed onto a bench near the back of the chapel now she could hear weeping the choked sobs of a grown man trying unsuccessfully not to cry without raising her bowed head she cast her eyes sideways it was lord teren kristions best friendthe man who had killed him lena had heard enough of the talk when they brought the body home to know that the death had been a tragic accident the men had become separated in the woods and the arrow that lord teren loosed had not been intended to lodge in the heart of his best friend she could understand his grief and she sympathized slightlythough i still think its stupid and dangerous to loose an arrow when you are not absolutely certain of your target and i dont think theres any god that will help you if lady shantell finds you here naturally that was exactly what happened shantell had awakened at dawn as she usually did and her first act was to come to the chapel to pray she didnt see lord teren at first so she started by scolding lena for bringing the dogs into the chapel im sorry lena murmured and then stopped talking knowing that no defense could possibly appease shantell go outside and hide where nobody will see you she directed and the dogs slipped down the side aisle of the chapel and out though the door that shantell had left ajar shantell turning her head as they moved saw lord teren and started screaming again but unlike yesterday her screaming had words you murderer how dare you show your face here shantell he began i am so sorry you killed my husband it was an accident you enjoy killing you and those damned dogs if having the dogs here is distressing to you shantell i can remove them to my estate so you wont have to see them again shantells voice dropped from a scream into something that lena found much more frightening it was cold hard and intense each syllable was precisely enunciated as she said i will have every single one of them killed before i allow you to profit by what youve done she turned on her heel and stalked out of the chapel lena sank back onto the bench and shivered uncontrollably she means it she realized she really will kill them she thinks of them as dumb animals and technically theyre property lord teren she asked timidly he looked at her in surprise what is it uh lena she supplied not surprised that hed forgotten her name with all that was going on what did she mean by profit greyhounds especially trained hunting dogs are valuable animals he said with a sigh but if she thinks id kill anyone let alone my best friend just to get his dogs shes he faltered apparently unable to come up with any description he considered acceptable crazed with grief lena finished for him it was a condition she understood she didnt remember her mother much but she had adored her father and her initial reaction to his death had been very similar to shantells she had screamed wordlessly for at least half an hour and if id known what life was going to be like with my brother as my guardian id probably have screamed even longer can she really have the dogs killed she asked anxiously do they belong to her now i believe that kristions will leaves them to jasper but jaspers a child so he doesnt get to make decisions another subject i know about who is his guardian lord teren looked sick god help us all i am he buried his face in his hands lena wasnt sure whether he was praying crying or both she sat in uncomfortable silence until the steward arrived to take over the vigil and then quietly left the chapel she wasnt hungry so instead of going in search of breakfast she went to the kennels the kennelmaster was there but the dogs who had been in the chapel with her were not the only dogs in the building were minda a female who had just given birth and her six puppies to lenas surprise jasper knelt next to them sobbing disconsolately im sorry jasper she said starting to express condolences on the death of his father but he turned at the sound of her voice and flung both arms around her legs almost knocking her to the floor make her stop he begged make who stop what over jaspers sobs the kennelmaster explained looking both ill and illatease lady shantell stormed in here about half an hour ago and ordered me to kill all of lord kristions dogs jasper had come down to look at the puppies so he heard her oh lord lena detached jaspers arms sat down on the floor and put her arms around him as he crawled into her lap she looked up at the kennelmaster are you planning to obey her right away im hoping shell calm down and rescind the order even if she doesnt lena pointed out does she have the legal authority to give that order the dogs may belong to jasper nobody knows until lord kristions will is read if they are jaspers its pretty clear that he doesnt want them killed also the dogs are valuable arent they yes the kennelmaster said there are people willing to pay large sums for the puppies and the trained dogs are worth even more so even if lady shantell is jaspers guardian and we dont know that she is killing the dogs would not be in his best interests from a financial standpoint let alone an emotional one im glad i was paying attention during those classes on kingdom law so if i were you id keep stalling maybe we can get a ruling from the local magistratewho is that anyway lord teren jasper mumbled into her shoulder i dont think your mother is listening to him right now lena said ruefully she looked around innocently where are the rest of the dogs the kennelmaster frowned i dont know someone came in and let them out during the night i let them out lena said no point in lying about that even if i wanted toshantell saw them with me they were restless so i took them with me when i went to the chapel for my share of the vigil then lady shantell came in and yelled because they were there so i sent them outside but if you cant find them you cant kill them good the kennelmaster said just as long as they stay safe wherever they are he sighed wheres a herald when you need one thats a really good question lena looked down at the child in her lap jasper have you had breakfast he shook his head lets go to the kitchens and see if we can find something to eat things probably wont seem quite so bad when were not facing them with an empty stomach after making sure that jasper ate and escorting him back to the nursery lena slipped out of the house avoiding both shantell and the servants and made her way unseen into the forested portion of the estate i should be safe enough im pretty sure that nobody is going to be hunting here today she sat down on what passed for a comfortable boulder and cautiously opened her mind to the animals in the vicinity the dogs were the first to respond in moments she was surrounded by the entire pack home they asked too dangerous she sent an image of shantells raging and the kennelmaster looking sick at the thought of killing them can you find enough food here lots of rabbits and deer with the discipline she had learned at the temple lena ignored the images that accompanied the replies fortunately she had never kept rabbits as pets and maia a fellow novice who also had animal mindspeech and had taught lena much of what she knew had grown up next to the forest of sorrows so lena had some experience with how animals who were not being fed by humans regarded meals thinking of maia reminded her of the crows maia had brought a group of them a storytelling of crows she had called them to the temple with heror more accurately they had chosen to accompany her if they liked you they would do you favors like following someone and reporting back on what they did maia had taught lena how to talk to them and lena was pretty sure that at least a few of them had followed her on her journey she reached out with her mind there the crows were not nearby and she didnt want to consider what they were eating so she sent a mental picture of a herald and companion along with where and the emotion of needing help several crows lifted up above the treetops to scan the surrounding countryside and lena settled down to wait petting the dogs as they leaned against her legs between using her gift and stroking canine fur lena was half in a trance so she wasnt surprised when some unknown amount of time later a herald appeared in her vision the herald looked startled as anyone would be when a crow flew directly toward her face but even through the crows eyes lena recognized her samira was one of the heralds lena knew well and her companion clyton even deigned to speak to maia on rare occasions so it was possible that he might be able to hear her lena tried to reach his mind but apparently they were too far away samira however was a friend of maias so it didnt take her long to realize what a crow behaving unusually in this area must mean lena if you can hear me youll know that were on our way then clyton moved so fast that he was a white streak passing the crows who perched in the trees above him lena looked through their eyes as they rose to fly back long enough to figure out what route samira and clyton were taking then she pulled her concentration back into her body rose to her feet and headed through the forest toward the road so that she could intercept samira before she rode into the chaos of the household unprepared clyton almost charged right past her despite the fact that lena was standing alone in the middle of the road she had persuaded the dogs to stay out of sight in the woods whats going on lena samira asked are you all right pretty much lena replied but lord kristion is dead and things are not going well what happened to him this was samiras current circuit so she knew that lord kristion had been young and healthy he went out hunting with his best friend a couple of days ago lena took a deep breath and blurted out the rest lord teren shot him by accident and lady shantell called lord teren a murderer and now shes ordered the kennelmaster to kill all of the dogs and jaspers really upset about that samira pinched the spot where her nose met her forehead as if the muscle had gone into spasm and shook her head are you sure it was an accident lord teren says it was the servants who were with him say it was and the dogs say it was i believe them what does the magistrate say apparently lord teren is the magistrate yes thats right he is samira sighed why does lady shantell want to kill the dogs i dont know maybe because she cant kill lord teren lena shrugged its too bad her religion isnt one of the ones that teaches forgiveness of ones enemies samira looked at her oddly it does teach that are you sure she certainly isnt acting like it and she scolded me for worshiping thenoth and her own son seems to believe shell kill the dogs he was out in the kennels crying over them this morning the dogs are still in the kennels samira raised her eyebrows knowing you im surprised theres a dog on the estate she can still find minda just had puppies they cant be moved the rest arent there the kennelmaster doesnt want to follow shantells orders and if he cant find the dogs he cant kill them im sure he appreciates your help samira said dryly he seems to actually i also pointed out that there may be legal questionsthe dogs may belong to jasper instead of shantell and her husband may have named someone else as jaspers guardian thats a good argument samira admitted how likely is it lord teren said that lord kristion had named him samira groaned i can tell that this is going to be complicated she and clyton started forward at a walk that lena could easily keep pace with lets go face the noise stay in the woods lena told the dogs as she accompanied samira and clyton toward the main entrance to the estate have they set a time for the funeral yet samira asked this afternoon it is afternoon samira pointed out when this afternoon lena cast an anxious look at the angle of the sun the ninth hour she said in a small voice less than an hour from now i need to wash and change into a clean uniform and you look as though you dressed in the dark and then spent the day in the kennels and the woods i did samiras eyes closed briefly and then opened again apparently she had been mindspeaking to clyton because he stopped long enough for samira to reach down grasp forearms with lena and swing her onto clytons back whats the fastest way to reach the stables without lady shantell seeing us they left clyton being rubbed down by the stablemaster and lena turned samira over to the housekeeper to be shown to a guest room then she ran for her room washed in the nowcold water that someone had left out for her that morning and pulled on a dress that was suitable for the funeral she slipped quietly into the chapel aided by the fact that most of the household was gathered there samira resplendent in the dressy version of her whites was seated in the front next to shantell and jasper lord teren was in the back of the chapel trying to be invisible either he succeeded or shantell didnt deign to notice him and the funeral service and the burial that followed it went as well as could be expected after the funeral it was customary to read the will they gathered in the library the priest who had charge of the document lady shantell jasper who despite his young age was now lord jasper samira lena partly because jasper wanted her there and partly because samira had requested her as a neutral highborn witness and lord teren shantell protested his inclusion but the priest told her it was needful and her pietyat least for the momentovercame her wrath the moment ended abruptly when she discovered that her husband had named lord teren to be jaspers guardian should my son be forced to face his fathers murderer she demanded indignantly the priest said something about forgiveness lena couldnt make out the exact words because samiras voice overrode his normally we could ask the local magistrate to hear this case she started but shantell interrupted her hes the magistrate she exclaimed passionately do you think hell rule justly on his own actions thats why valdemar has heralds samira reminded everyone i ride this circuit so that i can hear cases where normal practice cannot be used and i believe that this one qualifies does anyone disagree shantell fell silent lord teren spoke sadly i yield this case to your judgment herald samira i agree that i am not the person to rule on it being involved myself please jasper added everyones so angry and they keep yelling the priest nodded agreement obviously this was not the situation lord kristion envisioned when i drew up his will very well samira said lord teren are you willing to answer the accusation of murder under truth spell absolutely lord teren looked grim but not at all afraid samira cast the truth spell and lena watched with fascination as a blue glow appeared over lord terens head who went hunting with you and lord kristion in addition to the two of us there were three servants and seven hunting dogs was it your arrow that shot him yes his voice held anguish but the blue glow remained steady did you intend to shoot him no never we became separated in the woods and i had no idea that he had circled around so that he was opposite me the servants were with me so they didnt know either what was he wearing teren looked blank i dont remember lena must have made some sound for samira looked at her do you know what he was wearing lena yes and it was one of the most stupid things anyone could wear to go hunting brown boots brown pants and a deerskin jacket samira looked at her incredulously deerskin are you positive of that i certainly cant blame her for not believing me thats correct the priest said i saw his body when it was brought home and thats what he was wearing samira managed to refrain from comment on lord kristions clothing choices lord teren do you swear that your shooting of lord kristion was accidental and that you had no reason or desire to kill him i do so swear despite the steady glow of the truth spell shantell cried out thats not true he wanted the dogs he said so this morning in the chapel thats not what i said lord teren protested was anyone else in the chapel with you samira asked teren pointed at lena she was i think he forgot my name again lena samira asked what did they say as lena opened her mouth to answer samira held up a hand wait im going to put a truth spell on you before you answer lena nodded her consent and sat quietly until samira gestured her to continue lady shantell came in at dawn near the end of my vigil lord teren had come in earlier and was sitting near the back of the chapel when she saw him she called him a murderer he said it was an accident and she said that he enjoyed killinghe and the dogs what he said then was that if having the dogs here was distressing to her he could remove them to his estate so that she wouldnt have to see them then she said that shed have every single one of them killed before shed let him profitand then she went to the kennelmaster and ordered the dogs killed did you hear her give that order no but when i went to the kennels as soon as i got out of the chapel jasper was there with the kennelmaster and they both said that she had ordered the dogs killed she did jasper said positively i heard her and i dont want the dogs killed and the priest said that the dogs are mine now samira held up a hand again well get back to that in a minute lord jasper lord teren did you or do you have any plans to profit from the dogs lord teren shook his head wearily no i will never hunt again my only thought was to give the dogs a home where they would not trouble lady shantell the blue glow of the truth spell remained steady samira took a deep breath and said on the charge of murder i find lord teren innocent lord kristions death was accidental he still killed my husband true but he did not murder him there is a difference my husband is dead my son is an orphan and the man who killed his father is to be his guardian shantell protested that issue is still to be resolved samira said i would be willing to cede the guardianship to lady shantell lord teren said no jasper protested shell kill the dogs jasper shantells voice was somewhere between hurt and fury would you favor your fathers killer over your own mother lena who was still holding the hand jasper had slipped into hers when the reading of the will began gave it a warning squeeze she leaned over and murmured softly into his ear theres no good reply to that question dont even try to answer it i see that we had best settle the question of the dogs before the guardianship samira said shuffling priorities what kind of dogs are we dealing with greyhounds lord teren replied trained hunting dogs not only does jasper not want them killed but they are also quite valuable it would not be in his best interests to have them killed indeed it would be a breach of duty for a guardian to order such a thing well i wont have them here and i wont let you take them shantell said furiously and i dont want them around my childhe doesnt need anything to tempt him to take up hunting lord jasper samira asked would you be willing to have the dogs live someplace else as long as they would be safe and well cared for jasper chewed on his lower lip for a moment and then nodded reluctantly ill miss the puppies but its more important that they be safe is there anyone you would trust to care for them yes lena but lena lives in haven samira pointed out thats rather far away she lives with people who like animals thank all the gods that he didnt say a god who likes animals lena samira asked lena thought quickly yes i can take them the temple of thenoth will certainly grant sanctuary to animals under the threat of death the king is sending a carriage to take me home its due in two days we should be able to transport minda and her puppies in it how many dogs are we talking about here samira asked lena ticked them off on her fingers minda six puppies and the seven hunting dogs fourteen youre willing to travel all the way to haven in a carriage with fourteen dogs lena nodded samira shook her head better you than me very well if everyone agrees that this is what should be done with the dogs she looked around the room until she got agreement however reluctant from everyone involved now with regard to the guardianship lord kristion named lord teren does anyone know his thinking on this the priest was the one to reply he felt that if he died while lord jasper was still a child he would benefit by a mans guidance so it was not that he considered lady shantell incapable of managing the estate indeed not the priest was definite on that point at least she customarily ran the estate when he was absent at court or performing military service thats true lord teren corroborated lady shantell is fully capable of running the estate and raising her son thats why im willing to resign as jaspers guardian in her favor the truth spell showed that he believed what he said samira looked skeptically at him and even more skeptically at lady shantell at the moment im not particularly impressed with the soundness of her judgment she looked from one to the other and then at the priest i therefore rule as follows for the next halfyear the two of you will be joint guardians and any decisions that affect jaspers well being or the assets of the estate must be agreed upon by both of you shantell opened her mouth to protest and samira glared at her if you are unable to work together in person your priest may serve as a mediator she looked at the priest and added if that is acceptable to him i will be happy to do anything in my power to help he replied very well samira dismissed the truth spells those are my decisions samira stayed at the estate for a pair of days ostensibly using it as a base for her duties in the surrounding area actually she told lena its partly that i want to be sure that lady shantell is calming down enough to think rationally again and that jasper is all rightbut mostly i want to see you fit fourteen dogs into a coach with you and your luggage luggage lena grinned at her im donating some of my clothing to the housekeeper for cleaning ragsits amazing how much of it got torn up in the woods while i was here so i wont have much luggage and it can go on the roof and i like dogs will you still like them when you get back to haven samira asked teasingly by the time she got back to haven lenas remaining dresses were covered with dog hair and she had a close bond with all of the dogs she had sent the crows to warn maia of the new arrivals so that there would be a place prepared for them in the kennels and maia was in the temple courtyard when the carriage arrived is there one of your fancy names for the dogs lena asked maia as they carefully carried the puppies to the kennel escorted by minda and the rest of the pack yes maia replied youve brought us a leash of greyhounds chapter warp and weft kristin schwengel no one could say for certain what had happened to triska but the disordered heap of robes and the unique necklace found inside the change circleand the mangled remains of a rather averagesized lizard just outside that circlespoke volumes the hertasi artisan had known had heard the warnings of the elders and yet she had gone outside the protective shields of the vale the residents of kveyas warned by the alliance mages had known that it was coming this final mage storm had realized that it could destroy them all if the shielding failed triska of course had known and she had still gone out the silk waits for no one she had been fond of saying usually just before leaving the vale in foul weather to harvest cocoons and the change circle where the remains had been found the locus of mutation formed by the overlap of two rippling waves of magical energy was not far from her favorite trees the ones whose silkworms always produced the strongest finest smoothest fibers when the elders showed stardance the broken chain and cracked amber stone retrieved from the pile the gift she had given to the cloth artisan she buried her grief after the first stunned moment fury was simpler covering the dark hollow loneliness that threatened the anger warmed her kept her from drowning in that aching emptiness and she fed it raging in turn at the elders at triska and at the implacable storms themselves then fled to the most private corner of the vale the secret nook she had discovered as a child running from her mothers death this time there would be no triska to find her to take her into her care and heal her hurting bringing her back to the life of the vale back then the elders of kveyas had found it amusing the human child following the hertasi when usually the lizardfolk were the dutiful aides and helpers of the tayledras since triska did not seem bothered by stardances presence the girl had been allowed to spend most of her time in the company of the clothworker sometimes seeming like a daughter sometimes an apprentice her father lived in his home vale of klissa and since at the time he was unable to care for a youngster kveyas agreed to keep her in their vale she had always been a solitary child and with the hertasi to help her she was allowed exceptional freedom even after stardance showed signs of her fathers mage gift she still stayed with triska the elders taught her and she was an apt pupil but she was more often to be found practicing her skills with the threads and fibers in triskas cliffside den than in the heavily warded practice rooms none of the tayledras were quite certain what a hertasi could or couldnt do with magic but since triska seemed unconcerned about her adopted daughters magical play the elders permitted stardance to remain with her after several years of this odd training stardance was just old enough for her mage gift to truly begin to develop into its full power and potential now though the storms had come and gone and magic was no longer the same the heartstones were weakened or empty their accumulated power drained to maintain the last desperate shields over the vales to save the people within them outside caught in a change circle triska had not been so fortunate winternight stood and respectful silence fell the storms had aged him so that his usual pallor now seemed ghostlike his energy spent and drained from him just as the oncevibrant heartstone was now emptied of all but the faintest flickers of magic his staff once used to help him direct his considerable power now served only to provide physical support and he leaned heavily on it we do not yet know the extent of damage in our own region of the pelagiris much less that of the other vales he said in response to several questioners only the strongest farspeakers have been able to communicate with them our scouts have been taking care of changebeasts as they have found them but our perimeter of safety is much closer to the vale than ever it was he paused to emphasize the reality of the damage done and the isolation of their vale off on a western edge of the pelagiris i propose that we send mages out with our border patrols and scouts one mage with a group of two or three trained fighters the mages can begin to assess the extent of the damage to the magical energy around the vale and help guide silverhearts efforts to heal it if they encounter changecreatures the mages will also recognize which might be more than physical threats what of the students someone asked even if all the magic is gone what should they be doing we cant send them out to the perimeters an immediate babble followedsome in favor of utilizing every resource the vale had others insisting that those who were not confirmed mages should not even attempt to use magic until the lasting effects of the storms were completely known winternight raised his hand and the din drifted back to quiet the students will not go to the outer perimeters but every bit of help is needed he paused again they will work within the areas where the scouts have already passed at least once where they are not likely to encounter changebeasts they will be searching these areas for trace magics studying any changes in patterns looking for subtle echoes of power a few more questions these from some of the instructors and winternight gathered those few around him for private conference stardance shook her head and shifted backward edging away from the group and drifting between the trees headed for her tooempty ekele she did not dare defy the direct command of the elders that all the magetalented and trained of kveyas attend the meeting but she had chosen to stand in a halfhidden spot on the outskirts of the assembly it is all folly anyway she thought bitterly of what use were they now that the magic had disappeared what good was anything now that triska wasshe shut down the thought before she could complete it returning to her anger to cover the aching void inside her what good was magic anyway after all it had been a centuriesgone excess of magic that had caused this nightmare maybe there was a lesson to be learned maybe their shinain cousins had the right of itmaybe it was time they did without magic entirely she was almost out of view almost free when a gentle but firm hand fell on her shoulder you too will take part in the search tomorrow windwhisperers voice though quiet was implacable what would be the point theres nothing left hostile resentment lashed through her words we dont know that for certain but we need to find out i cant be what you want she muttered to the ground unsure what the words meant even as she said them what would you be then that quiet voice held no anger no demand she turned to look at him the elders face was as still as his words giving her no impression of his thoughts she shifted away her eyes dropping again once i might have known now theres no point it doesnt matter she thought briefly of triskas cave of working with the richly colored fibers and fabrics creating beauty with functionality and sharp loneliness arced pain through her heart before she shuttered her face why go out there when it wont change anything perhaps it wont or perhaps it could the silence between them lengthened out there it may be that you could find an answer to my question she heard a faint shushing like a breeze lifting the wide leaves outside her ekele and she looked up once more only to find herself alone on the sanded path when morning came stardance found herself walking beyond the borders of the vale one of the first group of students assigned to a small section of the safer areas just as the confirmed mages were partnered with experienced scouts and patrols the students too were accompanied by younger fighters stardance was the youngest student in the group traveling to the east of the vale and the simmering resentment in the oldest scout trainee was palpable as he paced near her clearly he felt that he belonged in the unexplored places not in the safe areas with the students you dont need to babysit me she finally snapped knowing she sounded like a petulant child but not really caring if you want to go farther out my kir will let your bird know if i need assistance the scout barely five summers older than she gave her an odd look but he didnt reply instead he allowed a little more space to drift between them no longer matching his steps to hers but lengthening his stride until he moved first beyond her view then beyond her hearing she shrugged if he went too far and found something he couldnt handle he would deserve it he was good enough at least that it had taken only moments for her to not be able to hear him no longer distracted by his angry presence she frowned and returned her attention to her own task the area she was to inspect was a rough wedge shape curving outward from the vale between a stand of large pines and a meadowed area and along the cliff edge that dropped down to the stream that would eventually join the anduras pacing the approximate borders using her mage sight to look for magical signatures or unusual tracks of anything the scouts might have missed stardance felt her frustration mount its just useless makework she thought angrily theres nothing out herethey just want to keep us busy until they can figure out what to do next i dont know why were even bothering even so she continued with her task at first kir had flown overhead helping her keep track of where her wedge overlapped with segments being examined by the other students their bondbirds were in the air for the same purpose after she had finished the first circuit of her area and started a closer inspection of the inside of the wedge she gave kir permission to land for several candlemarks stardance combed the forest starting at the outer border of her space and spiraling inward until she reached the landmarks of the clearing that was the last central piece of the area she was assigned to she heard only the natural sounds of the forest although as she neared the edges of her wedge she sometimes heard mutterings from the other students or scouts at one point she looked up to see the scouts goshawk bondbird lazily coasting overhead but she neither saw nor heard any trace of the young man himself after another candlemark of pushing through brush and finding nothing of more concern than small rodents stardance stood in the small clearing that marked the point of her wedge releasing her mage sight with a sigh of relief she loosened her water skin from her belt and took a drink thirsty kirs mindvoice was her most plaintive the falcon had alternated between soaring on the thermals and perching in trees near stardance to watch her her head cocked to the side as though she were trying to make sense of her mistress actions come then stardance replied lifting her hand for the falcon who plummeted from the sky raising the bird from her arm brace to the leather pad on her shoulder stardance held up the water skin tilting it so a careful stream poured into kirs beak kir shook her head sending droplets spattering over stardances face and hair stardance winced and pulled the water skin away mockglaring at her bondbird the falcon was unchastened her eyes glinting as she tilted her head and kirs teasing amusement in the back of her mind drew out the first smile stardance had felt since the last storm since triska she stopped the thought abruptly i at least still have work to do she scolded the bird but her tone was affectionate rather than return to the skies kir folded her wings back and shifted her talons on the leather pad stabilizing her grip and rebalancing her weight so stardance could move without disturbing her stardance turned in place her irritation with the fruitless exercise of looking for magic now returning she studied the clearing again glancing to the sun for her bearings as she recalled this place had once had a strong leyline which had been tapped and drawn deeper toward the vale to power the heartstone most of the sections of forest the students were searching today contained at least one former line or node might traces of these have survived the storms was that what the elders had hoped they would find with their closer examination she closed her eyes the better to feel for any echo of the crackling energy of the magic once so familiar to her and expanded her mage sight outward she saw nothingno lines no web of energy to draw frombut she had a vague feeling a sense that the magic was still there somehow she frowned in frustration not even sure how to go about it she tried to change the focus of her mage sight broadening and refining it at the same time suddenly her mind seemed to twist and she could see a faint tracery limning everything around her with a subtle silver fainter than the tiniest of leylines to this odd mage sight her shielded self was now surrounded by a faint haze of what she was sure was power but she couldnt tap it or shape it how could anyone make use of this it looks like i seize the fibers but is not so look deeper triskas voice rang in stardances head so clearly that the girl opened her eyes and looked around the wild forest expecting to see the beloved snout hovering just behind an exceptionally large leaf laughing at stardance for believing her to be gone but even kir was silent and though the falcon liked to pretend to be aloof and regal she would have been twittering like a magpie if anyone familiar were near stardance took a deep unsteady breath fighting back the crushing disappointment the weight of loss heavy within her then she remembered when she had heard those words it had been a spinning lesson when she had been trying to use magic to help feed the fibers to the spindle fasterand had of course ended up with great clumps instead of smooth thread after those words she had watched triska spin this time with her mage sight sure that the hertasi was using some innate magic how else to explain how far superior triskas threads and weaving were but mage sight had shown her nothing just the glow of triskas door wards like and yet somehow unlike those used in the training rooms is in mind triska had finally said think to make self attractive to fibers no more it hadnt made sense to stardance at the time so she hadnt given it further thought but had continued to practice spinning without attempting to use magic could this faint magic be spun like the loose fiber into stronger thread stardance looked around the clearing trying to remember where the lines had lain before the storms unable to recall she shrugged see if it works first she muttered time enough to reshape later sent kir not you silly thing as if id reshape so much as a feather kir preened her plumage briefly then resettled on stardances shoulder tucking her beak behind the girls ear in a gesture of reassurance stardance closed her eyes then opened her mage sight with that same twist of her mind until she could once again see the faint fog of diffuse energy around her like attracts like she thought and fed a tiny bit of her personal power outside of her shields letting it drift and ripple a fine radiance over her skin inviting the nebulous energies around her to join it long minutes passed and she was about to throw up her hands and go back to the vale in disgust finished with this pointless task when she again heard triskas voice in her head the silk waits for no one but it will not be rushed stardance fed a little more of her energy out to her surface ignoring the first warnings of energy strain imagining waggling fingers of magic waving come dance with us into the energymist so caught up was she by the image and the feeling she was creating that she almost missed the response of the magichaze around her it was exhaustion that caught her attentionor rather that she no longer felt exhausted despite using her personal energy slowly she brought her mage sight back into sharper focus and was astonished to see faint tendrils coalescing out the mist drawn into her shields replenishing her stunned she thoughtlessly reached out almost grabbed for those precious strands of power until she practically felt triskas presence beside her and remembered what had happened when she had first spun thread how everything had tangled together when she had stopped letting the fibers flow through her fingers and had started to reach urgently for them slowly she stretched out to those tendrils with her coruscating magefingersbringing the strands together plying one to the next and to the next with utmost care until she had a tiny line started it was a mere runnel nothing like the leylines that had fed the heartstone and powered the vale nothing even like the line that had once flowed through this very clearing but it was still decidedly a line but what to do with it she couldnt stand here forever a living lodestone in the magichaze now she was unsurprised when triskas voice again echoed in her head every weaving starts with the warp thread with mage sight and normal vision layered one on the other stardance examined the clearing which stood on a slight incline like water magic tended to run downhill so she shifted trailing the tiny threads of magic down the slope careful not to move so quickly as to break even one as she paced the lowest edge of the clearing she found what she sought though not of the quality of a heartstone the large rock at the edge of the tree line seemed to have enough quartz in it to hold the power from this tiny line she had created it would serve well enough for her to tie off a warp thread here maybe once the power had gathered and grown weft threads could be brought in to shape it reweaving the network of lines that had once tracked through the pelagiris or it could be guided to run its path elsewhere perhaps even back to the vale with exquisite care she reached out to the stone with her shimmering magefingers sending some of her own power to dance over the stone to wave invitingly to the tendrils she had drawn with her ever so gently she nudged the line she carried toward the stone it wavered uncertainly but she waited dimming her own radiation bit by bit until the fine line quivered and with an almost audible snap fell into place finding the stone and settling sinking into the earth drawing the energyhaze with it now separated from the support of the tiny tendrils of power drawn from the fog stardance staggered as a drainheadache blossomed into full power drumming the insides of her skull kir launched to a nearby tree chittering her concern but stardance kept her from calling to any nearby bondbirds moving slowly keeping to paths that were as out of the way as possible she stumbled she hoped unseen back to the vale barely able to climb the stairs to collapse onto the bedroll in her ekele are you sure winternight leaned forward one hand twisting over the head of his staff none of the students were healing magetalented so far as we knew dayspring nodded it was a leyline and what resembled the beginnings of a node im not sure why i scanned the safe areas we were crossing as we returned to the vale but im glad i did it was tiny but must have been formed by an external influence not the natural gatherings of power in channels there hasnt been enough time for the magic to settle so cleanly and this was the only place where i saw such a thing we need to know who was in that area we need that student that gift kveyas has never had many healing mages and now that silverheart is the only one left well shes wearing herself out i never noticed signs of mage healing in any of the students i taught silverheart added her voice soft she was too young for the lines that had creased her face in the last few days strained not only by the mage storms themselves but by the demands of attempting to restore some balance to the power around the vale but neither did i work with all of the trainees my apologies for my lateness windwhisperer said brushing aside the curtains at the entrance to winternights ekele there was a changecreature in the area i was working in which delayed our return until we had dealt with it he shrugged off the questions not magical so the scouts will be better equipped to relate the details my younger son had an interesting tale too from his work in the safe area but we can discuss that later first why the summons winternight gestured to dayspring and the younger mage spoke you assigned the students this morning didnt you windwhisperer nodded we need to know who was in the area that went east toward the cliffs between the stand of tallpines and the slope just before the meadow theres a leyline and a node there and they werent there when we went out this morning only a close observer would have noticed the flicker in windwhisperers eyes before he leaned back his face as calm and still as ever there were three students in that approximate area but as it happens i know who created it for my son observed her stardance the other three mages inhaled sharply i never taught her silverheart murmured at last winternight was silent for a moment studying windwhisperers face is your son near windwhisperer nodded and bent his head toward his kestrel bondbird who hopped off her perch and darted out the open window i thought you would want to speak with him so i asked him to wait below and said i would send tria when we wanted him to come up a moment later the young scout tapped at the entrance then pushed aside the curtains and entered the room welcome nightblade winternight nodded at a seat next to windwhisperer and the new arrival sat your father tells us you were paired with stardance in the searching of the safe areas today nightblade lifted one shoulder in a slight shrug not so much paired he replied after a moments thought i thought it would be best for the oldest scout to stay nearest to the youngest mage student his voice left a subtle shade of emphasis on the fact that he was the oldest of those assigned to work in the safe areas with the students hinting that he felt he deserved to be out with the rest of the fully trained scouts winternight chose to ignore the implication what did she do as we left the vale stardance made it clear that she did not wish for me to be immediately near her so i went farther into the forest and watched her from the trees or through miels eyes she was diligent tracking back and forth so that she covered every bit of her assigned area of the forest she finished in a clearing and it was there that she seemed to be working magic although i dont have enough mage sight to know for sure at times she moved her fingers very slowly like she was working with something fragile that was held between them a couple of times she tilted her head as though she were listening to something or someone then she walked to the stone at the edge of the clearing and held her hands over it not quite touching it for a long time after that she nearly collapsed and barely managed to stagger back to her ekele i made sure a hertasi would take care of her and found my father to tell him windwhisperer nodded confirmation while silverheart leaned forward did she say anything anything at all she talked aloud to her bondbird a couple of times and i think she said something about seeing if it works other than that nothing that i heard when there were no other questions windwhisperer nodded a dismissal and his son slipped out the mages turned to silverheart waiting for her thoughts the only healing mage in kveyas this was her field her expertise silverheart leaned against the wall of the ekele her eyes halfclosed in thought stardance she was the one more or less adopted by the hertasi who was caught in the change circle correct yes so hurt angry lonely and from what windwhisperer said of her last night stubborn not the ideal time for any of us to ask her what she did and why and how she would not refuse the direct command of the elders windwhisperer said thoughtfully but i agree that she would not respond well i need to watch her do this to see how she is working but we cant send anyone extra out with her or she might not do anything i wish i could use mage sight through cedes eyes but you can through mine windwhisperer replied i realized today that im getting a little old and weary to keep up with the scouts he continued with a wry smile you can link to me and i can watch her with far sight he paused considering is it likely that she could harm herself or anyone else if she experiments on her own silverheart thought for a moment it is possible that she could become too absorbed too focused and forget to come back to herself but if we are watching her even from a distance i should be able to recognize the signs and we can use a bondbird to shock her out before she gets lost she shrugged the magic is so diffuse so faint that there is little risk for injury there just isnt enough power for her to do anything significant the mages all nodded in agreement even in these few days after the storms magical accidents had been fewer and smaller stardance woke blinking and rubbing her eyes to shake the last traces of exhaustionheadache from her mind it took a moment for her to remember how she had gotten so drained and then the images flooded back over her the magichaze the tendrils memories of triska she almost murmured the hertasis name waiting for the ache of loss to build to overwhelm her with emptiness as it had every time shed thought of triska in the days since the last mage stormand was stunned when it seemed a little muted as though she was a tiny bit less raw inside she would have considered it further but a hungry kir was already protesting how late she had slept as morning drew on once again she gathered with the other mage students for windwhisperers instructions each day they were to expand their search farther away from the vale as the scouts and full mages widened the range of the safe areas stardance was surprised to be glad when windwhisperer told them to take areas just beyond those where they had searched the day before she would have the chance to see what had happened overnight to her little runnel a tiny bubble of unexpected anticipation welled up within her not dimmed even when the young scout darkmoon nightdark no nightblade again paced his steps to hers as they left the vale today he seemed less angry less resentful of his assignment but she was still relieved when he drifted away from her farther into the forest when she was sure he was out of her hearing she slipped between the trees into the clearing where she had threaded the little line together it was easier today to make the shift in her mind to see the more diffuse energies around her her little line still glowed to her mage sight tracing down the slope to pool in the large rock was the line a little broader a little stronger than she had left it stardance couldnt be sure but she thought that maybe it was the stone itself had retained the magic that trickled through the runnel she paused considering would it accumulate enough power that it would need an outlet reaching out with a gentle touch beyond her shields she tested the energy in the stone then released it unless a great deal more magic suddenly flooded down the tiny line the quartz in the stone could hold the gathering power for days at least she turned and moved deeper into the forest heading for the outer limit of the new area she would be searching silverheart unlinked herself from windwhisperers mind rubbing her eyes to clear the afterimages of mage sight layered on far sight so what do you think the elder asked her his eyes closed as he continued to watch stardance move through the forest she is very young the healing mage answered slowly but her instinct seems good is she truly working with the earth magics on that level it seems so as dayspring suggested that is a tiny runnel and rudimentary nodewell more of a locus than a node since she knew exactly where they were and only touched them to verify their presence it appears that she did create them silverheart paused for a moment considering there had been a fairly strong leyline and node in that clearing if the girl remembered that and tried her experiment there because of it i dont think we need to monitor her closely until she gets to where there used to be stronger nodes from the old maps i think there are two in her area today one just beside the little waterfall and one closer in near a stand of pines there was a brief silence and windwhisperer stood shaking his shoulders to loosen himself as he released his far sight halftrance ive set tria to watch her and alert me when she nears either of those areas or if she does anything unusual no sense in using far sight for that long if i dont need to silverheart nodded it may not take much energy but there is little from which to replenish yourself now we wait stardance looked up checking her position yes she had completed the first arc of her wedge and was almost at the waterfall that dropped the stream down below the cliffs that had marked the edge of her area the previous day hadnt there been a node here too the leylines often followed the patterns of the streams for there was so much life in the water to supply them this time she sat comfortably beneath a tree before she twisted her mage sight to the broad and shallow focus that allowed her to see the nebulous fog of power the haze seemed stronger here near the water than it had been in the other clearing would it be easier to work with opening her shields she once again cascaded a subtle ripple of magic over her surface imagining the enticing fragments drawing the diffuse energy toward her back in his ekele windwhisperer sat up and hissed an alert to silverheart tria says shes sitting down near the head of the waterfall he linked to the kestrels eyes then shifted to his own far sight once he had stardances position fixed in his mind with a soft touch he felt silverheart connect to him and suddenly her healing mage sight layered over his so that he saw the faint life force limning the area the girl sat in the haze of fragmented power that was slowly floating toward her thats what you see and work with he murmured in amazement and silverheart chuckled very small as you see it takes patience a lot of patience but how is she working with it silverheart didnt answer for a long time as she studied the young girl watching the fog gradually coalesce into tendrils that reached out toward the girls glowing form shes making herself into something like a living lodestone using some of her own energy to draw the bits of power to herself once it connects to her her voice trailed off as stardance raised her hands her fingers gathering the first of those tentative strands and doing something to blend them windwhisperer put voice to silverhearts question what in the stareyeds name is she doing silverheart had no reply for she had never seen anyone work with magic this way instead of guiding the tiny bits of power with her mind nudging them together as silverheart had been taught to do stardance used her hands fingers twisting nimbly but carefully to blend the fragments together folding them over each other and weavingsilverheart was so shocked when the word came to her that she broke her link with windwhisperer the hertasi she said at last stardances caretaker she worked with cloth yees windwhisperer replied his brow furrowed with confusion silverheart slowly connected back with him this time not using her mage sight looking only at the deft movements of the girls fingers shes spinning the power like thread weaving it together she murmured at last a hint of awe tinging her voice thats how she could attempt it without any training in guiding the subtle magics shes using her own power to connect with it and then treating the tiny bits of energy like the bits of fiber to be spun into thread with a twist of her mind she shifted into her healing mage sight again sharing what she saw with windwhisperer and they watched as stardance blended the last of the tendrils that she had drawn to her with the ones that already wound together around her coruscating fingertips then the girl slowly shifted drawing her hands and the fragile strand of magic to the rock that had once anchored the waterfalls node how is she going to connectoh shes using her own power again silverheart answered her own question as stardance held her hands over the stone then rippled some of her personal energy down to it to guide the tiny runnel down from her hands this one is larger than the one she created yesterday silverheart murmured i hope she doesnt even as the words left her they both saw the little line snap into the earth and the girl pitched forward unconscious her bondbird was instantly beside her her beak wide with distress cries and windwhisperers tria soon joined the falcon her presence calming the larger but younger bird in another moment they saw nightblade drop from one of the nearby trees carefully turning the girl over and checking for injuries before scooping her up and heading back toward the vale windwhisperer released his far sight and silverheart broke her link with him the two of them staring at each other in disbelief should we question her when she is restored will she be more open to talking does she even realize how very important it is what she has done with no instruction nothing beyond that of the other trainees windwhisperer shook his head i think she is still too fragile too hurt for questions she has lost much this one and the storms especially have taken much from her it would be good for her if something could be gained from them as well if she is not a danger if she is not creating anything that she cannot handle can she be left to make that discovery on her own silverheart frowned thought a moment then determination set in her eyes kveyas needs her to be trained in her newfound gift before it becomes too strong to do something once is accident twice is coincidence but a third time if she goes out tomorrow i want to follow her if she attempts this again i will have to interrupt to confront her in some way it may not be dangerous now but if left too long it could become so the last traces of exhaustionheadache were stronger this time more difficult to shake free stardance frowned she had no memory of coming back to her ekele although she vaguely recalled being on her bedroll already when one of the hertasi had brought her the cool refreshing drink commonly used by those who overextended their gifts other than that brief exchange her last clear recollection was of creating the second little leyline the thought of it made her smilethey were things of beauty in their own way the tiny runnels of power that she had spun together hadnt there been another node too in the area she had been in near the stand of pines maybe she could go back out to that one today if she could not weave works of beauty with triska perhapsshe paused then probed the thought of triska for the first time the ache didnt threaten to swallow her and she didnt feel cut open on the sharp and jagged edges of grief before she could ponder further kir chirped from her perch sending a feeling of combined hunger and eagerness to stretch her wings stardance rose and freed her bondbird from her hood a faint thread of anticipation to match the falcons dawning within her chapter discordance jennifer brozek rax wept in what was left of his ale as the bard finished the ballad of love lost and betrayal it wasnt like him to lose his composure outside the house but things had been so difficult this season and he didnt see it getting any easier with the baby on the way as the bard struck up the next tune a war chant with a heavy drumbeat rax called out to the bar wench sarry get me another and another after that he felt the chant beat in time with his heart and felt his blood rise to combat the sorrow come come come to the beat of the drum drum drum and kill kill kill with your sharpened sword to take take take every last crumb crumb crumb and do as you will sarry distracted by a handsome man with coin ignored him fussing over her target for a tip and possibly a tumble later if the stars aligned sarry she glanced over her shoulder at him and smiled a tightlipped smirk that told him all he needed to know before turning back to the man before her is there anything else i can get you seder before seder could answer a clay mug sailed past sarrys ear and crashed against the wall in a shower of shards and dregs of ale sarry turned to see rax standing tall and shaking with rage the mood of the tavern turned ugly with the beat of the drum and song of violence rax took a step toward the bar wench only to be stopped by another growling manalready angry at the sound of raxs voice she didnt see the first punch or who threw it years of experience in rough places told her this was going to be trouble and wouldnt stop until blood was shed as she fled to the back of the tavern the room erupted in chaosmen yelling and swearing the pummeling of fists on flesh the crash of furniture thrown and the sharp sound of metal weapons being unsheathed mathias grabbed her and pulled her behind the bar she let him do it thinking that he was trying to protect her instead she found herself flattened face down on the dirt floor with him behind herone hand holding her down the other fumbling with her skirts she had a brief moment of confusion she trusted mathias hed always protected her now this sarry let the rage of being attacked flow over her and the pounding of her furious heart beat in her head like the sound of the bards drum sarry screamed her rage bucking her body up as she reached for a weapon her hand found one a large serving fork as mathias wrestled with her trying to hold her down she twisted her body around and stabbed the man who had been her friend protector and boss in the throat blood spurted from the wound as he reared up in pain and she yanked the fork back they both screamed now two more voices in the din of the total tavern melee she plunged the fork deep into his stomach on the other side of the bar rax already lay dead with his head caved in by a chair seder was dying a sword pierced his chest and his enemy was being beaten to death by two other men using clubs and their feet those who were not fighting were dead except for one no one noticed when the music stopped nor did they notice when the bard picked up his pack and drum and walked with careful steps through the violence and out the door the only survivor of the night sarry would not remember what the bards name was or what he looked like terek frowned at the letter in his hand usually letters from home were a thing of joy not today there had been a brawl at a tavern and people had died people he knew mathias had been a brother to him his death was a shock he closed his eyes and rubbed his brow there is more to this he thought people dont murder each other over ale maybe in the slums of haven but not in woodberry not in a tiny settlement like that something within his gift told him he was right terek he opened his eyes and smiled at the always fashionable mari she was a bard who knew those worth knowing in the court and she looked the part yes he frowned at the worry lines around her eyes whats wrong im not sure but i was listening to a couple of heralds talking and i think somethings happening he gestured for her to come in and sit down tell me im not sure whats happening she repeated i got a letter from home a friend of mine died while carousing with his friends she bit her lip marshaling her thoughts then i heard the heralds talking theyd just come off circuit and there was a bit of bad business in the north they had to judge a murderer the thing is at first i thought they were talking about the death of my friend because everything was the samethe victim had been killed in a huge tavern brawl but they werent they were talking about someone else so i asked them more about it two different villages next to each other had the same thing happen about a sennight apart bar fight unusual amount of death terek nodded his heart thumping hard in his chest it sounded far too much like his letter from home to be coincidence its been a hard season in northern valdemar he allowed she shook her head hair flying in its vehemence not that hard look she pulled a rolled up piece of paper from her bag when she spread it out on his desk he saw that it was a map with small marks over four villages in the north as soon as terek saw the map with the marks his stomach dropped in horrified recognition and his mouth dried he sucked air in through clenched teeth these villages mari said pointing to the places they both knew well have all had horrible events with people dying in taverns or she stopped and took a breath before continuing or have had a bunch of people kill themselves valdemar has had hard seasons before but this is different i looked into it this is one village after another in a line in a circuit terek corrected and tapped woodberry make that five villages maybe more he drew his finger over the map from village to village in an oval circle what arent you telling me mari paused to brush invisible lint from her ruffled crimson sleeve reluctant to speak theres a bard involved only no one can remember him after the carnage they just know he was there the night of the deaths but no one can find his body and he isnt in town the next day one of ours is doing this on my old circuit he looked up at his former protégé his eyes bleak one of ours and it has something to do with me he listened to his lords voice as it instructed him where to bury the shard eyes closed he stepped forward or to the side as it commanded he could feel the power flowing through him as he dropped to his knees and dug a small hole as he placed the shard chanting the words that had become his mantra his prayer his obsession he knew his revenge was nigh either the object of his hate would come to him or everyone who used to laud the old bard would suffer for ages to come poisoned stone planted on the edge of the village he stood and brushed the dirt from his hands he hefted his pack with its evil secret put on a real smile in anticipation of the carnage that would happen that night and sauntered down the road into the village where kindly folk smiled at him pointing him toward the nearest tavern it was a modest thing with only one story and small windows but it was one of the nicer buildings in the square with uncracked walls and a freshly painted sign of a mug frothing over with ale he nodded to himself and entered empty at this time of day the proprietor sat at one of the tables eating from a bowl of steaming porridge he didnt get up only nodded and gestured the stranger forward with his wooden spoon good day im sorrel im looking for a room and a place to show my skill sorrel tapped his drum for emphasis daven here the proprietor gave sorrel a critical onceover bard eh no good sir merely a wandering minstrel i wear not the red of an esteemed bard he watched daven calculate in his head for a moment then i cant pay you bard wages but i can make sure you have a warm bed and a full belly and maybe a coin or two to rub together as you leave sorrel smiled excellent for that i will give you an evening of entertainment you wont forget for a long time to come may i sit with you the old man looked up at sorrels smiling face glanced at the mostly full tables around him and nodded with a grunt im sorrel he said as he sat arranging his pack and drum next to him on the floor aaron he gave sorrel another look and then returned his gaze to his ale you local nah traveling through where to aaron looked up again why sorrel pulled back and raised a hand just curious im a traveler too thought id make conversation sorry the old man gave a long gusty sigh nah im sorry heading to woodberry got grandkids to look in on their da died woodberry bad bit of business there you know aaron paused in his mug in midair sorrel nodded whatve you heard big brawl lots of people died it was a mess you were there nah just picked up the word on the road avoided it aaron drank deep from the mug and clonked it on the table yeah thats what ive heard too its why i travel sorrel saw aarons questioning look to spread joy and leave a place a bit lighter than when i arrived he tapped the drum on the ground a bard just a minstrel aaron nodded playing tonight aye good i could use some music it lightens the soul sorrel gave him a smile with too many teeth this will be a night to remember speaking of which its time for me to earn my supper word of the minstrel had spread throughout the small village music was always welcome and the tavern was almost full the sounds of wooden mugs clopping to the table mixed with the smacking of satisfied lips and the laughter of good conversation however when sorrel took his place in the corner where the singers and dancers performed the place quieted with an anticipatory buzz of people whispering to each other what they knew of the stranger two beats of a drum later and the tavern was almost silent tonight a dream of mine is about to come true and all of you here will witness it unfolding sorrel reached down into his pack and pulled out something small and black terek this is for you with that he tossed the black thing toward aaron it is the most natural thing in the world to catch something tossed to you in a casual manner tereks hands were already wrapping themselves around the cursed item as sorrels drum sounded out a slow beat and terek realized that his real name had been used by then it was much too late he rocked back as the power of the thing a statue with large blank eyes and a larger mouth filled with sharp teeth caught him in a spell staring into the statues eyes terek knew that sorrel had captured the rest of the audience in a spell and they would be no help he felt his own power draining from him as he fell into the statues trance before me stand three promising youngsters but not every dream can come true terek recognized himself from years before while riding his last circuit he had been asked to judge the children in the village for potential and judge he did you young sorrel you have some skill but lack both the creativity and the gift of a true bard you will be welcome at campfires but not in the halls of the collegium with a shake of his head and a turn of his shoulder he dismissed the boy terek saw the boys anguish as he fled the square but that was no longer his concern these other two children were aric you have proven yourself to be both skilled and creative i have spoken to your parents and they have agreed to send you to the collegium you wont go alone you will take with you my personal recommendation you will be welcomed in courts and merchant houses around valdemar after your skills have been honed terek gave aric a scroll tied with a crimson ribbon while the villagers applauded he patted the boys shoulder and gave him a gentle push toward his beaming parents terek smiled and allowed the power of his trained voice to carry his pleasure as he made his final announcement mari my dear child you have proven that you have the skill the creativity and the gift to become a master bard i have spoken to your parents and you will travel with me finish out my circuit and then enter the collegium as the most esteemed of students you are what every bard strives to become and the kind of apprentice every master bard seeks you end my quest locked in a vision of the past terek could feel his power his gift being torn from him bit by bit he struggled to bring his considerable will to bear but this trap was too well laid and too long in coming he had fallen for it and this knowledge settled heavy on his heart all around him he was vaguely aware that even his hidden companions kolan and pala gifted bards both were locked in sorrels spell he wondered how the ungifted peasant boy could have become so powerful as if in answer to his query a new vision clouded his mind fleeing through the trees sorrel sobbed as his heart broke his one dream in life to become a bard to show the village he was good enough was gone there was nothing left for him now it was the end he tripped over a tree root and fell headlong into the dirt he stayed there trying to choke off the sobs that threatened to overwhelm him again he wished he would die no little master no dont die i can help you sorrel lifted his head looking through wet lashes into the forest around him tears smudging his dirty face but the sobs had halted in surprise at the voice in his head he shuddered as he took in a breath and wondered if he had gone mad not mad little master far from it you have found me and i can make all of your dreams come true would you like that as he looked around he felt something smooth and cold under his hand sticking up from under a tree root was a glossy black stone he dug until he could pull it out of dirt it was a statue a squat thing just longer than his hand and as thick as his fist carved on the front of it was a frowning creature with large eyes and a large mouth with thick lips on the back the same hideous creature was smiling openmouthed showing off rows of sharp teeth make my dreams come true sorrel marveled at the thing in his hand as it spoke in his head all i need is a sacrifice of blood feed me and i will be your slave sorrel it was aric most likely come to tell him of his failure too here he called as he stood up statue in hand he waited for aric to appear hed show him the statue and the two of them would figure out what to dojust as they always did aric burst into view he was smiling before sorrel could say anything aric grabbed him by the hand i did it im going to the collegium with master tereks recommendation i did it sorrel stared as his friend broke his heart all over again im sorry you didnt make it but i was thinking after my training you could travel with me anyway youre really good on the drum you could be part of my entourage im going to have one of those im sure after im done well still be together and making music hot roses bloomed on sorrels cheeks as aric added insult to injury come be part of arics entourage become one of arics lackeys an unfamiliar emotion rose out of the shards of sorrels dream hate hate for his friend and his good fortune heedless of sorrels clenching fists and flushed face aric had continued on dancing around his friend maybe theyll let you come to the collegium with me anyway maybe i can say i wont do it without you or maybe i should just take you with me and well just see what happens were going to get out of here isnt that great i need just one blood sacrifice and all your dreams come true will you sacrifice him to me yes sorrel said and stepped close to the boy lost in his own dreams aric grinned at sorrel not realizing that his friend had not answered him until the first blow came by then it was much too late terek groaned aloud as he watched sorrel beat aric to death with the statue as each blow landed he felt as if he were being beaten himself his vision clearing he saw blood on his hands where it was from he did not know all around him he saw people fighting with each other the heavy drumbeat dominated the sounds of chaos sorrels voice was strong and overwhelming terek could feel the power of it it was as if sorrel had a corrupted gift as if sensing his thoughts sorrel looked through the melee of bodies when terek raised his head and their eyes met that one look told terek everything this was his fault he was the reason so many people had died he had been callous careless and mean to a boy who had not deserved it as the thoughts slammed into his head terek realized that they werent true thoughts but the thoughts forced into him by foul magic be that as it may he also knew he was going to die still terek fought will against will praying that kolan or pala would be able to break the spell then the tinkling of finger chimes cut through the drowning drumbeat and a high soprano voice powered by the gift brought forth a light the sounds of love and laughter on the music gave terek the strength he needed to push back against the draining force of the cursed thing in his hands sorrels beat faltered and terek saw why mari stood in the doorway of the tavern and sorrel stared at her as she sang familiar words of their past you and i together far from all that ails young and loved forever and forever we will sail she strengthened her song singing of childhood days and the innocent love the two of them had once had long ago terek could breathe again and now he brought forth his own voice in harmony with maris sorrels face hardened once more and he turned his focus back on terek willing the statue to finish its task but terek met him voice to voice will to will while mari sang her own attack the village folk who had stilled at the first sounds of maris song now stirred as if waking from a bad dream those who could fled the tavern limping bruised beaten and bleeding mari stepped into the tavern and went over to kolan and pala who had regained their senses maris finger chimes urged the village folk on as the other two gifted bards raised their voices to maris allowing her to lead them in the fight against sorrel and the evil artifact terek stood statue clenched in one fist he stepped toward sorrel whose wide hatefilled eyes refused to give in the bard raised his shaking fist and forced it open to reveal the small statue a twin to the original one that sorrel had found in his grief he showed it to mari and the others who turned their voices on it and all at once the statue vibrated and then shattered as black stone shards flew in all directions cutting unprotected flesh sorrels head snapped back and all the music stopped his maris tereks sorrel staggered backward hit the wall behind him and slumped to the ground it was only then that the bards could see that the largest of the black stone shards had taken one last bloody sacrifice by embedding itself in one of sorrels eyes terek rushed forward and went to his knees but it was too late sorrel was dead leaving the old bard with questions and an apology unspoken on his lips terek sat in his office staring at the one shard of black stone he had kept we found the rest of the shards and buried statues at the affected villages theyve all been taken care ofexcept that one mari said from the doorway to his office as she gestured to the one in his hand i feel i should keep it to remind myself of what my hubris had wrought you cant blame yourself not all dreams come true sorrel chose his path but but nothing mari stepped forward and held out her hand terek hesitated before handing it over why did you follow us she shrugged i always wondered why aric didnt make it to the collegium and i always wondered what had happened to sorrel once you decided this was happening because of you and your past i realized that i was part of that past and that perhaps i could help you were right she smiled sometimes she turned paused and turned back the heraldmages are about to do a seeking to find the statue you described from your vision we know its still out there want to help terek did not say anything for a long moment before he nodded and stood yes i started this i should help end it one last circuit to complete chapter slow and steady brenda cooper shay leaned down and filled her fist with fresh earth it felt cold and damp and absolutely awful she almost opened her fist almost let the earth drop again it wasnt real that she needed it wasnt real that she stood in front of her whole village by her mothers grave with a fistful of dirt she was going to wake up any minute and hear her mom searching through the shelves in her apothecary for moonflower or homemade tinctures or bandages no now go on the voice belonged to the innkeeper who had gotten her in trouble for climbing in his barn rafters to watch the horses from haven just yesterday only now his voice was soft and sweet almost wheedling you can do it she shook her head she needed to think it was so hard to think shay throw the dirt the innkeeper repeated a little more firmly this time she took a close look at her surroundings the cold hole in the ground just big enough for the slender wooden coffin the winterbare trees and the shivering townspeople she raised her fist above her head gripping so hard the dirt became a wet hard ball bits of it falling through her fingers like everything she knew about life she threw the mud onto the coffin watching it smear across the top and stain the clean white pine of the lid she backed up slowly one foot at a time trying not to be noticed letting others come in and throw their own dirt on her mother a few adults hugged her as she went she stiffened their touches feeling more like fire than help the children and teenagers ignored her which was better than usual as she finally got behind everybody and could turn and walk away the first strains of a funeral song began to fill the air the song seemed to be for her as well as for her mom after all she had to leave no one would want her here at their house shay stopped outside and gazed at the dark windows shay wasnt smart enough to manage all the things her mom did she could have been her moms helper until her mom died years from now but there was nobody else in town who would be patient with her she didnt go in she pulled the kitchen knife shed hidden from the woodpile and tucked it in her belt the blade long enough she felt it with the top of her thigh the water jugs swung easily over her head but when she shouldered her pack she had to work to get the whole assemblage adjusted the water pouches hung on a leather strap sized for her mom and shay had to tie a knot in them at fourteen shay was nearly her moms height but she was all bones while her mom was soft had been soft she couldnt remember what shed thrown into the old pack but surely it had been the right things shed been filling packs for her mom since she was seven and for the last two years shed even been allowed to go along when the farm or homestead a call for healing came from was close enough for the trip to be safe surely even this new empty person she had become knew what to do shay turned away from littles town she didnt look back couldnt bear to look back no one would notice her missing until after the funeral or even with luck after the funeral feast by then it would be dark littles town sprawled across a meadow surrounded by more meadow and low hills in three directions cold harvested hayfields alternated with sheep pens full now since the sheep wintered near town they were quiet today huddled together for warmth heads down as they tried to find fodder in between feedings shay went in the fourth direction up the same way her mom had gone toward a homestead on the top of the cliff that looked down on the town from the north she wound up a forested path that wasnt straight up but rather a series of nasty switchbacks with a few good breaks of flat trail theyd found her mom on one of those trails cold wind drove at her back helping her up the sounds of the town faded replaced by birdsong and the rill of water running thinly down cold streambeds just fast enough that only the very edges froze her thighs started to hurt but she drove them up and up anyway if she could do this climb in summer she could do it now her mom would have liked to meet the women from haven especially the one in green the healer healers came through about once a year sometimes more often sometimes less her mom and the healers would usually take tea together and talk maybe sit by the fire if it was winter too bad there was no fire here shay was getting cold shay never talked to the healers or anyone from haven by definition they were the best valdemar had to offer and shay had nothing to offer them she was always scared she would say the wrong thing but there had been no tea this time her mom had been off getting killed by bandits and the women had been gone before anyone knew that no reason to call a healer for the dead she stopped at the first flat place looking for signs of struggle she spotted a few broken twigs by the side of the path and the footprints of the townsmen who had gone looking for her mother both going up and coming back here and there the mark of a horses hoof going toward town the fresh human tracks kept going so shay took a long drink of water and followed them she should eat she knew she should eat but she couldnt remember if shed brought food she didnt want to stop long enough to dip into her pack night had started lying cold along the trail when she stopped at the next flat place the signs shed been looking for were here even bigger than shed expected bushes lay flat footprints went every which way it seemed tainted by people and hurt she found a few spots of what looked like black liquid on sticks and rocks her mothers blood cold now gone back to the forest already shed overheard one of the men say her mom hadnt been given a chance to fight but had been killed from behind and quick there was nothing for bandits except a pack full of herbs and bandages they should have left her alive and asked her to help them heal their hurts it would have been better for them and her mother would be alive shays pack did yield food bread that had been fresh the day before lay squished in the bottom on the pack beside five apples shay ate the bread and one of the apples she should have taken more her mom would have patiently helped her lay out what she needed but no one would talk her through plans any more help her survive in a world that demanded more ideas than it had given to shay she felt sure it wasnt smart to stay here where she could see her mothers blood and the tracks and everything but it couldnt be smart to keep walking either shay looked around for a place to build a bed careful not to step on any healing plants and careful not to step into anything with thorns settling for a flat place made soft with old pine needles she pulled down bluepine branches thick with cold needles until she had enough to make an even softer spot to lie on and then twice as many more branches to put over her and hold in some of her body heat she did all of this slowly and steadily careful to focus on her task she climbed carefully in as the dark took the last of the light away and she lay still under the boughs her knife right in front of her in case any night animals came sniffing around she tucked her pack under her head so nothing could steal it tomorrow shed have to keep going as fast as she could manage and still be steady more snow could come before winter was over she was going to need something to do she had tried to help the innkeeper clear dishes but he had yelled at when she was too slow for him hed told her no when she asked to work in the stable mumbling something about not wanting the horses let out her mom had refused to let her try to herd sheep with the other children after they threw rocks at her one day she knew all of her moms herbs and how to count them and how to hold a crying child while a bandage went on a knee or a splint on an ankle maybe she could pick plants for people and trade them for food she wondered how far the next town was down the track too far for common visiting in winter she wasnt too dumb to know that much it took a long time to fall asleep and then she didnt stay that way very well branches poked her and the cold found its way through her blanket of needles and poked her in the ankle and her fingers grew so cold she finally fell asleep with them tucked up between thighs she woke up in time to see the last stars fade after an apple and some water she stood and looked at the place her mom had died for just a moment the idea of going back down to town seemed better than going up but there was nothing left in town that loved her except a few of the animals after two candlemarks spent trekking uphill shay came to the top of the ridge if she went right shed end up at the homestead but she didnt know very much about it just that mr crestwell who owned it didnt pay enough for the long trek up at least that was what her mom had said so she didnt turn that way the path kept going straight along a ridge for a long while thinner now since it wasnt used as much as the one between mr chrestwells homestead and littles town she surprised a few deer and a wild pig but they were all afraid of her and she was afraid of the pig she dug roots for lunch using a hard stick and a rock just as her mom had taught her she ate an apple but she was still hungry well there were two more apples and she could make it the rest of the day on those the trail wound back down the far side of the ridge for a while almost as steep as the path up had been shay was careful where she put her feet so it took a long time to get down slow and steady her mom always told her take care of yourself and dont worry about what other people think besides there was no one but the birds to care if she was slow and a little clumsy out here clouds bunched above her but they didnt rain or snow she stopped a few times to look at animal tracks the horses of course deer and something bigger with cloven hooves not many though and mostly not completely fresh but animals had passed over this path many times since the last time humans had walked it the only boot tracks she saw were old ones with hard edges that had been frozen by earlier snowfalls and not yet crumbled by other steps on the path she refilled her water jugs from a tiny waterfall at the bottom of the hill the water was colder than the water in the insulated jugs and when she took a few sips it made her cold inside the cold jolted her her right foot slipped on a wet rock as she stood up and she fell down hard knees and feet in the cold water she pushed herself too quickly out of the water and fell in again this time twisting her ankle now she stopped even though one foot was still in the water and the other hurt slow and steady she needed to be slow and steady she couldnt put weight on the foot and her shoes were wet and her teeth clattered against each other so she crawled on her sore knees and her cold hands the pack making it harder the water jugs trailing behind her shay sat on the path gasping and shivering and cold for so long that the sun fell behind the tall trees that lined both river and path she knew better than to stay on the path thats where the animals were and her mom had told her they came to blood this was also the path the bandits who killed her mother had come down on she hadnt really thought about that shed only thought about not being in the town by herself without her mother to stop the other children from taunting her if bandits came she didnt have anything worth stealing except for the kitchen knife but she was a girl and her mom had warned her about strange men when she stopped thinking so hard and decided to move her body felt stiff she crawled to the side of the trail until she found a grouping of young pines that would shelter her from the sky after she stopped shay reached her fingers down to feel her ankle it had grown bigger while it didnt hurt much to touch it if she touched it hard enough to move her foot pain shot up her calf she was a village healers daughter and she knew to stay still it would be light enough to see for a few candlemarks everything was wintercold and winterbare except for the evergreen trees maybe it was better to live on the apples she pulled down the few branches she could reach apologizing to the small trees that would probably need them she got enough to cover her legs and feet and then she couldnt reach any more shay dug her knife out of her backpack being as careful as she could she felt a little better with the shaft in her fist she watched the water letting it mesmerize her into a cold shivery nap where she dreamed of horses and dogs and of her mother tucking her in at night something in her dreaming must have caused her to move her foot pain woke her up to cold snow had started to fall the flakes a bit golden in the late afternoon air she felt stuck in place cold and hurt and alone and empty she was hungry but she didnt want to move enough to dig out an apple a horse whinnied shay stiffened and stilled voices womens voices one of them saying the snow will hide tracks the other responding we need to stop for the night soon the first woman said id rather keep going then silence fell except for the soft sounds of the horses hooves in the slight blanket of snow that had fallen while shay dozed shay shivered were they looking for her on horseback most bandits were men she held her breath and waited to see who rode up on her the figures of horses emerged from the snow on the path between her and the stream snow spangled their saddles and stuck to their manes and tails their riders were the two women who had gone through town the healer and the bard she recognized them even though they were closely bundled against the cold bits of red hair escaping from woven hats maybe she was still asleep and dreaming she clutched the knife hilt tighter or at least she tried her hand was stuck curled tightly around the wood hello she rasped her voice slight the first horse was past her the second right across they hadnt heard her she wasnt directly on the path and theyd have to look her way she took a deep breath and tried to let go of the knife croaking a disappointed sound when her bare cold fingers still refused to move the woman turned and the horse stopped and the next thing shay knew a cloak was thrown across her shoulders and a face was close to her saying her name shay shay is that you are you shay then she was lying on a blanket by a fire the warmth and light both slowly seeping into her night had finished falling so all that seemed to exist was the fire and the women and blanket around her the healer held a cup and poured a bit of something warm between shays cracked lips the bard sang to the fire something soft and meant to help babies sleep it was a song shay had known once because her mother used to sing it to her she fell back asleep when shay opened her eyes again the fire was just as high but the quality of darkness had turned toward the gray of dawn although it was still dark enough that the fire lit the falling snowflakes so they looked briefly like sparks she was lying on her back with her foot on a log a saddle blanket under her head that smelled like clean horse sweat and snow and a heavy cloak over her the healer was sitting and staring at the fire and no one was singing except the storm itself soft and thick and windless the snow falling in a whisper and sometimes sizzling a tiny bit when it hit a coal just right shay tried to say something but what came out was more like a squeak the healer turned toward her im dionne im glad we found you shay managed a mme ttoo are you still cold only a little dionne reached for a cup that sat on a little bank of coals away from the hottest part of the fire and held it up will you drink some more tea shay tried to sit up and then dionne was beside her lifting her up and whispering rhi mmhhmmmm not morning yet the protest emerged muffled from a pile of blankets shes awake dionne said as she lifted the cup so shay could drink mmmmmhhhhh its snowing leave me alone but the blankets moved and the woman sat up and smiled at shay hello i think we just found you in time tha thank you shay said and took another sip of the bitter tea which seemed to warm her blood so her whole body got a little warmer she took two more sips before she asked why did you come the bard answered you needed to be found she pulled on boots that had been left close enough to the fire to be warm master johaness sent us after you the innkeeper he doesnt like me dionne took the cup for her and set it back on the coals letting shay lie back down all the way he sure seemed worried when he caught up to us on that great big beast of his the idea of the innkeeper riding after her refused to sit in her head why didnt he come himself at least her words were coming out better maybe he thought you needed healing dionne said or a song the other woman answered she hadnt been close enough to see how much the women looked alike are you twins the twin with no manners is my sister rhiannon dionne said it gently almost teasing and now that you can talk your ankle is swollen is there anything else wrong shay shook her head dionne bent down over shays foot and took the swollen ankle in both of her hands at first nothing happened then it felt a little warmer and then it felt a lot warmer when dionne took her hands away she cocked her head and asked is that better shay could move her ankle much better thank you can you sit up dionne asked for answer shay sat up and held her hands out to the fire are you going to take me home the two women exchanged glances full of meaning shay couldnt read do you want to go there no they answered with silence for a bit then the bard rhiannon said i heard your mom died im sorry shay swallowed me too what did you plan to do dionne asked her voice gentle so they must have talked to people in town knew she didnt have any family it sounded as though no one had been willing to take care of her that stung she threw a stick into the fire marveling again that her ankle didnt hurt when she shifted her weight she watched the stick burn thinking slow and steady do you need someone to help you she asked i dont have a horse where were you going dionne asked shay kept her head down i dont know do you have family anywhere shay felt like dionnes questions punched her adults did this a lot avoided answering her questions by asking questions of their own the small hope that they had really been looking for her felt even smaller now theyd been doing their jobs saving people stupid enough to get into trouble the thought made shay laugh the unfamiliar taste of bitterness burning the back of her throat she was used to avoiding people used to being laughed at and yelled at but since so much of what people teased her about was true she deserved those things they seemed fair but she had wanted these smart women on the beautiful horses to want her at least they didnt ask her again when she didnt answer but just let her sit and watch the flames after a while she noticed that rhiannon had started singing again both women were moving around camp shay should help she stood up but dionne said sit down a bit longer ive got something for you to do there sure enough she showed up with two metal sticks each with a sausage on the end hold these over the fire theyre cooked so they just need to be warmed shay kept one stick in each hand turning them slowly her belly waking up at the rich fat dripping onto the coals they stopped feeding the fire while they ate and then the women were careful that it was all the way out shay approved they might not be slow and careful but it was the careful part that mattered she liked these women a lot even if they didnt need her to help them snow fell off and on all the next day although thankfully no winter wind came with it shay couldnt sleep in the saddle behind rhiannonthe horse was too tall and swayed too much but she had wanted to ride for all her life and she might not ever ride again so by the time they made camp she fell exhausted and cold and pleased onto the ground dionne took one look at her and covered her up with the damp cloak it was still dry inside even if was heavy and smelled of wet horse shay drifted listening to the murmur of the womens voices and the sounds of wood being gathered thwacked together to knock off snow and piled she should be up helping them since gathering wood was something she did well but her body didnt want to move so she lay still warm enough under the blanket to think and thought about how to be helpful if only she could prove that she could be a good helper maybe dionne and rhiannon would want her a candlemark later there was more warm tea to drink and some dried meat and slightly stale bread to share out dionne mentioned that theyd be out of the snow the next day and would be close to a town high meadow shay had never been so far from home but she said sometimes people come from there to buy our sheep do you know how to herd sheep rhiannon asked no she didnt want to tell them about the kids throwing rocks at her dionne frowned what did you do i helped my mom pick the plants she used and helped her dry them dionne stood up and rummaged in her packs which had been hung on a nearby tree she drew out three bags of dried plants and handed one to shay do you know what this is she opened the bag and smelled it then she touched the dried plants sweet rose what did your mom use sweet rose for she made tea when people had headaches and used it in one of the salves that makes cuts stop hurting dionne nodded and handed her the second bag dont touch this one with your bare hands nettle she made soup with it but she never let me touch it until it cooked she also mixed it with other plants to make things for swelling after shay identified the third bag as fleawort dionne sat back on her haunches and looked at rhiannon instead of at shay it might work rhiannon was still for a moment and then she looked at shay and smiled lets try it shay was so busy thinking about her mom and plants she didnt think about what they meant for a long time besides they hadnt been talking to her she would be patient they stopped in high meadow and stayed at an inn all three of them sharing one room rhiannon sang for the people in the inn while shay and dionne sat on a nearby bench and ate a thin stew that tasted like heaven even if it was only root vegetables and spices and water when she fell asleep that night shay told herself not to want anything that what dionne and rhiannon had done so far was enough surely they would leave her here and she could find something to do or someone to take her in she should find a way to thank them in the morning after breakfast and some bargaining with the innkeeper a woman here fat and round and a little grumpy shay helped them gather up the tack and their bags from the room and stood out of the way while they got the horses ready the stable boy brought around a sturdy little red pony with a saddle and bridle already on it and dionne and rhiannon grinned widely when he helped shay up onto it she had never been so surprised by anything good in her life his name is apple the boy said is that because hes red shay asked the boy laughed hes not that red but he loves apples and hell come all the way across the pasture for a little bit of one sometimes its the only way to catch him shay was afraid to ask if the pony was hers but they rode away from town with shay on its back and a long lead line between her and rhiannon to keep them together maybe the women were going to let her stay with them after all the roads were clear now and the going was still cold but dry apples hooves made a pleasant sound on the frozen trail and shay focused on that and talked to him trying to ignore the way her legs and butt hurt from riding by the time they had been riding three more days her legs didnt hurt anymore and shed fallen in love with the pony and wanted her life to stay like this forever she couldnt bring herself to ask so she did everything she could to help and was very careful not to do anything wrong they started going through bigger towns with places that made metal and fields of horses instead of sheep and guildhalls for people who built houses the roads became busier and then they came up to the biggest place shay had ever seen one with wide cobbled streets and walls haven it felt like seeing a story come alive she gaped when she saw two heralds ride out on companions and she understood for the first time what her mother had meant when she said companions were nothing like horses they were not they were so beautiful she thought she might die of happiness for just seeing them as they wound farther into the city shay felt the good feelings shrinking inside her a sadness filled her completely against her will she had nothing to offer here if she couldnt wash dishes in littles town what could she possibly do in haven she patted apple on the side of his neck focusing on the mixed brown and white and red of his coat that looked simply reddishbrown from a distance focusing didnt help because she couldnt possibly keep apple no one had ever said he was hers and it made sense that they procured the pony so she didnt tire out the other horses they pulled up outside a great big building that looked like the school from littles town only bigger and grander and grown up students in gray and pale green streamed in and out of the building everyone moving fast and looking smart and neat rhiannon still used a long lead attached to apples bridle and she came up and held apple by the head whispering sweet nothings to him dionne came around to help shay dismount she managed to get off without any more than the steady form of dionne nearby staying slow and careful in her movements so she wouldnt embarrass the women by falling here or herself by needing help with simple things shay noticed that she was wearing the same clothes shed started out in and while theyd been washed once that had been two days ago her pants had tears in the knees where shed fallen her shirt had been mended in three places and smelled like horse and cold and the road not right for haven at all this is the healers collegium dionne took shays chin in one hand and guided shays face so that she looked dionne in the eyes are you all right she asked you look scared theres nothing to be afraid of here shay nodded not willing to try to talk in case it made her lose control and loosed the tears she felt in the corners of her eye we want you to come with us to meet someone okay her own voice sounded small so she straightened her back and said it again i will dionne took shays hand and they followed rhiannon down a twisty cobbled path worn smooth by many feet they turned onto a thinner path and went through a wooden gate into a garden stone benches sat in each corner of a lovely little garden full of raised beds only a few were full now since it was winter even in haven the bare beds lay fallow and ready for the spring neatly raked and cleaned out shays mom had kept a few pots to grow herbs she couldnt gather but this was richness beyond imagining shay let go of dionnes hand and started walking through the beds that still had plants smelling each one half were familiar when she turned around dionne had gone rhiannon stood by one the benches looking like she was waiting for something or someone shay went and sat by her and rhiannon put a hand on her shoulder then she started singing one of the tunes shed sung for shay almost every night the lullaby her mother had known it calmed shay and reminded her to stop her racing thoughts and fears and take things slowly they waited a long time but the longer they waited the more rhiannons song calmed her and chased away her worries about what people here would think of her so she felt easy when dionne brought out an older woman with a thin sharp face and bright eyes this is the herb mistress for healers she likes to be called janelle shay held her hand out im shay the womans handshake was warm and neither soft nor too hard dionne told me quite a lot about you im sorry about your mother me too the easiest shortest response she could make can you tell me what the plants out here are shay licked her lips suddenly afraid shed forget all the names but she took is slow and easy and managed to remember the names and how her mother used and cared for all of the plants she had seen before janelle nodded at dionne then looked at shay would you like to stay and help me the rest of the winter she paused i could use a hand soon getting the spring plants started shay didnt react slow and steady janelle gestured toward dionne and rhiannon they need to go on dionne spoke up but well check on you next time were in haven then if you want to go back home ill take you shay shook her head i dont have a home the herb woman whispered maybe you do now shay looked at janelle and thought and then she said thank you they went to get her pack which had been tied behind apples saddle shay hugged the pony tight when she let go she was crying they were going to go without her she had a place but she didnt want to leave the twins can i ride somewhere else with you sometime rhiannon smiled maybe if janelle gives us good reports and you can ride yourself if you have someone to go with you shay blinked confused were going to put apple in the common herd and give you rights to draw him out if you want and to visit him and bring him apples she couldnt believe that her mom dying was luck but coming here was good she was in haven and someone wanted her help shed have janelle and apple and her new friends would visit the only thing better would be if i could go with you all the time she said leaning over and giving rhiannon a hug im sorry rhiannon said dont be sorry mom always told me to take things slow and steady dionne had come up behind them maybe rhiannon could learn that from you rhiannon swatted at her but it was playful and the mingled laughter of the women made haven look beautiful again chapter sight and sound stephanie d shaver wil chosen the herald snapped out of his reverie sitting up with a snort on the hard wooden chair sorry he said to kyril mustve been woolgathering you were saying i was asking kyril said about the circumstances that led to herald elenes death his pen tip gleamed with ink poised over the parchment right wil rubbed his eyes the burden of being awake put a strain on his ability to be tactful and thorough she died he wanted to say im sorry she went into a river and drowned and died but kyril would pick every bone of the story until he got his damn details no easy way out of this one she went into the river at callcreek to save a boy whod been caught in a flash flood wil said bad situation all around the boydid she yes wil said softly she fetched him to shore kyril nodded she is was terribly gifted continue they started to pull her back in and apparently a log blue flash of foresight in the water out of nowhere so dark and cold and ah gods mother so sorry elene so sorry alrek no alrek it wasnt a foresight visionjust the memory of one it hit like an aftershock not as bad as the original but with enough intensity to stall his narrative wil envied heralds who only knew who had died when the death bell rang he always knew who and where sometimes for people like elene his foresight showed him firsthand details leading up to the death people hed been close tointernees instructors yearmates not that there are many of those left dammit focus he grabbed hold of the disparate threads of his thoughts and forced himself to rattle off details devoid of the panicked terror that his foresight made him privy to according to the shore crew that had been on the other end of herald elenes lead rope a log had tangled in her lifeline and dragged her under some of the men swore the rope snapped others suspected someone panicked and cut it elenes companion alrek had berserked run in mad circles and then galloped off the frayed bit of filthy rope trailing behind him did you question the locals about who might have cut the rope kyril asked i did sir under truth spell wil said no guilty parties it sounds like the whole situation was a big confused mess and alrek wil shook his head hasnt been seen since the incident kyril nodded and picked up a clean page well find his body sometimes they just show up in companions field was elene recovered yes but shed been in the water awhile the villagers had done their best given what time and the muddy waters had done to elene shed been carefully wrapped in sackcloth and transported on a bed of sweet grasses and flowers her grave is by the temple of astera near callcreek wil finished kyril made a note anything else wil mulled the question the vision had been useful in caulking the gaps giving him questions to ask the denizens of callcreek wil felt that hed gleaned all he could from it for kyrils report and yet sir something is nagging at me he said at last oh but i cant tell you kyril raised a brow i mean i cant tell you wil clarified its my gift sir my gut says theres something but not what ah the famously unreliable foresight sorry sir quite all right i know better than to try to pry it from you just be sure to tell me when it surfaces wil nodded excellent one last thing then for the first time since theyd begun their dialogue kyril set his pen down then sat straight up and folded his hands onto the desk elene had a family he said wil felt his stomach twist we have an obligation to them kyril continued when possible we prefer to deliver the news in person i understand you knew her personally wil nodded what im about to ask of you isnt for everyone kyril said honestly its not for anyone its a hard task telling a mother her daughter is never coming home can you do this herald wil youre exhausted vehs saidif you dont want yes wil said i can or you could ignore me completely kyril gave a small sigh the queen and the circle thank you come back tomorrowwell talk about protocol for notifying the family he cocked his head meanwhile you look like you need sleep in buckets wil admitted laughing a little thank you sir thank you herald kyril replied wil departed the records room to the rhythmic scratching of kyrils pen nightmares are getting worse you need a healer are you even listening no wil replied honestly as usual unseen someones had prepared his apartment for his return to haven there was fresh water in the ewers and seasoned firewood by the hearth hed been focused on building the fire not vehs wils hands were callused and leathery from years on circuit he didnt bother with gloves or pokers anymore just shoved the lit wood around until the configuration pleased him ignoring the sparks and splinters healers vehs started the healers want me to drink sleep tinctures wil shot back and not the cute stuff made with hops and shamile the mean stuff you give to a bull when you need to geld him no one is gelding you chosen wil snorted but vehs wouldnt let it die if its what you need to sleep what vehs was nattering on about was that the vision didnt just intrude on his waking thoughts it had become a recurring nightmare one he couldnt seem to shake wil hadnt sleptreally sleptin a week his sleepdebt had been growing even before elenes death thanks to nights on the karse border now that debt was coming due with interest hallucinations jittery nerves the acute fleeting sense that he was being watched when he wasnt it was nothing he hadnt dealt with before the vision would fade eventually hed endure until then id rather deal with the nightmare wil rolled his right shoulder wincing spring had been damp and chilly and his joints protested the chill he shucked off his whites the cold air making his skin and scars prickle under the bedcovers it felt even colder not for long he thought his eyes drifting shut warm no time he slept and in his dreams elene died again in the water freezing all the way up to her neck a hard shock of cold as she allowed the current and rope tied to alrek carry her to the child clinging to an outcropping of rock she practically blanketed him with her body getting a good hold she turned to look back at the shore alreks white form blazing like a guiding star then she reached her gift struggling with the childs weight and mass struggling with the distance struggling as she struggled against the current the boy vanished beneath her she saw a dark figure appear near alrek heard the shore crew cheer for a moment her heart soared the log came out of nowhere and dragged her down her body pinned beneath the wooden anchor and the tangled lead rope everything became a confusion of sound and sensation so dark and cold and all she could think was ah godsmother im so sorry elene her companions voice pleading in her mind so sorry alrek she felt him and the villagers straining to drag her in the rope jerked and her chest blazed with pain as ribs cracked her companions mindless panic threatened to overwhelm her no alrek she fumbled with something at her belt wil shot up out of bed fighting his own blankets spilling out onto the floor with a scream in his throat he sat panting until his heartbeat settled am i missing something he thought when will i stop dreaming about you elene she had been a yearmate an infrequent lover a fellow circuit rider she could be in his head another day week month year vehs said adamantly and in the meantime you arent sleeping go do something about it already wil pushed a hand through his closecropped hair smearing sweat across his scalp id rather you sang me a lullaby chosen no tinctures vehs stubbornbullheaded but wils annoyance at his companions meddling had reached its breaking pointhe snapped down his shields cutting off vehss rant not that he could block him completely just enough to muffle the chatter he curled up on his side in his bed and sometime around midnight he finally eased into a halfwaking doze that lasted until dawn food and a bath briefly revitalized him but by the time he took the stairs back to his quarters he found his steps dragging he flopped onto his bed and settled his eyes shut in the water knock knock knock wil jolted up and for a moment sensed something nearby watching the feeling vanished someone was knocking on his door but he was alone in his bedroom wil lurched over to the door yanking it open a redhaired girl in the orangered of a bard trainee waited in the hall hi she said brightly im amelie hello he replied fighting the instinct to close the door again bard trainees were in his experience never a good omen milady lelia would like to see you amelie smiled brightly is now a good time wil raised a brow milady lelia amelie maintained her blazing smile and nodded wil glanced back at the bed then back to her he forced himself to smile nows a fine time he said they didnt have far to go wil hadnt seen lelia in years so he didnt know how the bard had managed to win a palace wing apartment from one of selenays distant relatives but shed done it what surprised wil was not that she had finagled it but that she had chosen to settle down lelia seemed the type of bard who would wander valdemar until her shoes wore away and her toes fell off amelie led him in and if the woman waiting for him was barefoot he couldnt tell because she was bundled up in a red velvet blanket wil lelia said with enough warmth to make his heart swell she remained unvarnished loveliness albeit with an air of fragility he did not remember seeing before aging just like me he thought only with a little more grace and flair milady he bowed she rolled her eyes at his airs pushing out of the chair to hug him the sudden friendly movement pushed away the melancholy hed felt a moment before he returned the gesture smiling id have given you a full day to rest and recuperate but the last two times i did that you were gone before i could gain an audience she sat back down you just love to go dont you i could say the same about you he thought he took a seat on a couch as amelie plied him with tea cream cakes and other snacks he waved them off politely my protégé lelia said nodding toward amelie as she swept out of the room shes all sorts of mischief you seem to be doing well she stretched her smile so wide he thought her face would crack youve no idea howve you been stopped any assassination plots lately he shrugged its been a slow year or two mostly citizens irate over taxation property lines and who owes whom for what assassination plots sound more fun same amount of paperwork too his lips twisted in a grim smile she sipped tea as they talked he gradually grew at ease with the sumptuous setting no one disturbed them though judging by the number of chairs settles and low tables lelia was accustomed to entertaining groups when do you head out next she asked topping off her cup from a nearby pot tomorrow wil said probably maybe the day after another circuit so soon no wil replied i have to go deliver bad news to herald elenes family lelia tilted her head to one side she died a fortnight ago near callcreek yes yes he gave her a curious look you knew her no but i make a practice of knowing for whom the death bell tolls ah he lifted his brows sympathetically right lyle lelia smiled her twin brother was a herald he had in fact been wils internee every time it rings she has to wonder he thought even if sometimes its a little more than i want at least i know i was near callcreek when she died he said on my way back from the border actually i did the footwork of finding out where when why and how no who she drowned on a rescue mission no ones fault his chest twinged as he said it though and he remembered the crushing pain from his vision her family needs to know so ill be heading to boarsden shortly her eyes lit up boarsden eh thats near winefold wil knew the map of valdemar the way parents knew the faces of their children correct would you like me to go with you he blinked what me go with you i admit in advance i have ulterior motives he swallowed around a suddenly dry throat such as my family travels to winefold around this time of year theres a festival to bless the fieldsits at least a week long good work for traveling entertainers id love to see them and once youre done at elenes you could view it as she cocked head again brace yourself wil im going to use a strange word on you she shaped it slowly holiday the bard is wise vehss interjection startled wil it was the first thing the companion had said since wil had awakened and eased his shields lelia took his silence for disapproval no let me think about it oh well do she drained her cup and set it next to the pot youd be doing me a favor im a frail little bard getting on in her years she draped her arm across her forehead and slumped and i surely would love the company she straightened and winked my destrier and i can be ready to go either day after leaving her he headed to the collegium common room for supper trainees chattered earnestly around him as he ate and contemplated the bitter work ahead you know vehs said somewhat unexpectedly shes unattached unbridled available wil furrowed his brow wiping up the last of his stew with a crust of bread who lelia what does that have to do with anything and how do you know that vehs ignored the second question you liked her once wil wiped his mouth and collected his empty plates its been a while vehs oh yes its been a while wil ha ha she wouldnt have invited you to her quarters or herself along on your journey if she didnt still like you on some level vehs hesitated i think theres a very real chance shed like to play stefen to your vanyel if wil had been drinking hed have choked thanks for waiting until i was done with dinner before planting that on me he thought just pointing out the blindingly obvious to the obviously blind wil looked around wheres your destrier lelia patted the neck of the slenderlegged chestnut palfrey waiting beside her right here wil and vehs meet my horse destrier wil and vehs exchanged a look forget what i said vehs said this ones crazy you named a palfrey destrier lelia grinned i always said i wanted one she cocked her head exit through the haymarket gate haymarket gate he agreed and helped her mount her destrier hed left the question of bringing her along to kyril the seneschals herald had spent the better part of the evening explaining the art of breaking bad news to good people and he had provided a small box of elenes personal items according to kyril elene had no living family except for her mother kaylene when wil had asked about letting lelia accompany him kyril gave him a thoughtful look and then said having a master bard along might not be a bad idea assuming shes discreet wil had said oh she is kyril said knowingly but ill want a full report on how it works out when you get back perhaps itll be an improvement on the process perhaps wil thought taking a sidelong glance at lelia as they rode she sat straight in the saddle eyes ahead reins loose in her hands finally he cleared his throat and said you pack light i used to do this on foot she replied smiling i learned to get by with very little no gittern he asked she shrugged from within her voluminous scarlet cloak takes up space wil frowned wont your family want to hear your music i dont need a gittern to sing herald youve plenty of room he thought but he let it slide lelia seemed focused elsewhere as if listening to something wil could not hear even when they finally got free of havens crowds and the open road spread before them she remained silent her gaze soft the silence gave wil time to mull over what he was going to say to kaylene kyril had given suggestions but they all sounded so formal but then what could one say that was right in this situation nothing but nothing wasnt an option either he would have to say something they stopped for the night at an inn where the owner greeted lelia personally people wil reflected remembered a good bard after making sure his things and elenes were secure in his room he joined lelia in the common area for a simple but tasty meal they capped the evening with hot drinkshe with wine she with her personal tea blend which she had packed much of for the journey they nursed their drinks in companionable silence stretched out on comfortable chairs and settles near a hearth despite the heat lelia remained wrapped in her cloak nothing emerging from it but her head and hands you must be sweltering wil said she smiled drowsily at him im quite comfortable thank you the wood in the hearth popped loudly showering sparks a moment later it resumed its gentle murmur of crackles and pops such a lovely ditty lelia murmured practically singing me to sleep wil started to nod but the phrasing caught his fancy can you do that alertness crept into her gaze do what sing someone to sleep with your gift i have on occasion why because i havent slept in over a week and im going mad drowning in a cold river every night he thought but as usual the actual words became stuck in his throat just curious he said she studied him then drained her mug and set it aside goodnight herald she patted him on the shoulder before disappearing up the stairs wil could feel vehs in his head his companion wanted to say something but ultimately did not in that they were similar he drank two more cups of wine before he finally went to his room wil clawed his way back to waking and again that sense of being watched he blinked it vanished it wasnt far past midnight and the thing that had woken him had not been the visionthough hed been up to his neck in cold waterbut his bladder he threw on clothes and trundled out into the night toward the outhouse he turned the stables corner something was out there wil had never feared the dark but the yawning space between the stable and the outhouse filled him with sudden unspeakable dread something was there his eyes scanned the uneven shadows of the forest hemming the inn did he see a shape there a blot of movement in the darkness cold dread filled him the presence felt truenot just a hallucination his mind flitted back to his time on the karse border was it possible hed raised a sunpriests ire was something following him waiting for a chance to strike the presence evaporated the darkness became just that the movement in the trees nothing more than wind and woodland beasts about on mundane business wil crept back to his room hunkered down in his bed and waited out the night when he emerged from the inn the next morning lelia stood next to vehs one hand on his withers good morning wil said faintly suspicious about them together something in their posture suggested conspiracy you look like hell lelia replied cheerfully as a groom emerged with destrier and helped her up into her saddle shes worried about you vehs murmured im worried about me well finally wil swung into the saddle ignoring the jab last nightsomething was out there something wil toyed with the reins alberich he mentioned nightdemons once vehs snorted this far into valdemar not possible more gently he added chosen youre exhausted your mind is playing tricks on you i felt something vehs vehs said nothing you dont believe me no vehs said sharply i believe that you think you saw something wil took a deep breath fine but lets stay in a waystation tonight just in case this close to traderest yes with the bard wil frowned now he wished he hadnt brought her along they were potentially in danger but he was sure if he told her to turn back shed only want to know why and no matter what he told her shed still want to come along but better one overcurious bard than a village full of innocents lelia he said were going to stay at a waystation tonight he braced for the inevitable questions all right she replied he gave her an odd look she smiled back congenially whatever you say herald she said the waystation outside traderest was typical of its kindsmall with a water pump and trough and secluded among the trees wil slid out of the saddle and lelia tethered destrier as he hauled their packs into the waystation they had a fire and a pot of porridge going within a candlemark she still hadnt asked why they were here he watched as she finished smoothing one of her cloaks over her boxbedthey hadnt brought bedrollsand then left again to tend to her horse he sat on the edge of his own boxbed all he wanted was sleep without dreams he wanted one minute he was alone the next lelia was leaning over him when hed fallen back on the bed he wasnt sure just that his eyelids felt so so heavy he could barely meet her gaze you know she said heralds dont just die in fights fires and floods keighvin the queens own before talamir worked himself into a brainstorm and an early grave knew that wil mumbled they throw themselves into their work she continued until theyre so exhausted they wind up doing something foolish she smiled a little lyle once told me i was his balance i keep him from flogging himself to death the smile softened with sadness i dont know how good a job ive done with that honestly even talking her voice had a melodic quality his eyes slid shut his thoughts growing muzzy he could feel the vision unfurling tugging at him like the waters of the river that had killed elene and then something stepped between him and it a soft susurration like the drowsy chirr of insects at twilight and instead of plunging into deadly waters he found himself at the edge of a clearing though not one he knew it could have been the heart of companions grove it could have been any number of places in valdemar a faintly blue light soft as moonlight lit the world but it was not of the world he knew some distance from him was a woman in luminous whites she stood at the center of the clearing and despite the unearthly light her face remained obscured even so he got the sense she was watching him tell him im waiting she said wil sat up in near darkness coals gleamed in the hearth and someone was breathing lightly in the boxbed to his right he crawled awkwardly out of bed and emerged into the chilly night air vehs walked over and nuzzled his hair sleep well he asked we had hoped it would last through the night wil frowned it we he asked and remembered the day before have you two been conspiring behind my back vehs lowered his lashes and gave him a coy look wil started to speak something moved in the dark wil snapped his head around scanning the forest he felt vehs stiffen that vehs said is not your imagination the waystation door creaked and the presence vanished from behind him lelia said somethings out there both he and vehs turned to look at her you feel it too wil asked she nodded something big familiar but not she shook her head whatever it was its gone now she hugged herself tightly its freezing ill be inside wil and vehs stared into the darkness together any idea what it is wil ventured something but not nightdemons vehs shook his mane chosen go back inside rest ill stand watch wil could tell vehs was being evasive but he knew better than to try and press a companion when he or she didnt want to give details lelia had added wood to the fire she waited by his bedside wrapped in her spare cloak you sang me to sleep wil said she nodded did it work wil stretched out in the bedbox i think so the fire popped and crackled can you do it again of course he closed his eyes will you tuck me in too she laughed and ruin our professional relationship then she started singing and the music stepped between him and the vision granting him peace several nights of solid sleep did much to restore wils spirits a fog had lifted from his thoughts he found himself picking out details in the vision that he hadnt noticed before things kyril would want to know so long as lelia sang him to rest wil no longer dreamed of elenes death the only dream he hadthat he remembered havingwas of the shadowherald and the clearing tell him im waiting tell who vehs reported no disturbances from the invisible it but that didnt mean it was gone and as soon as lelia was delivered safely in winefold wil would have to figure out what it was they reached the inn at boarsden before dusk and enjoyed a leisurely dinner lelia as usual found the biggest chair in the house curled up on it with her special blend of tea and regaled him with tales of the court the clothing is the best she said some of those women layer so much junk over the bodies the gods gave em they can hardly walk a straight line her eyes gleamed mischievously sometimes i want to go cowtipping if you know what i mean as wil wiped tears of laughter from his eyes she signaled a server to bring more hot water for steeping tea he took the opportunity to change subjects there was something hed been cogitating lelia tell mehave you ever heard of anyone having a gift like foresight but he grasped for words more like hindsight she frowned not sure what you mean visions of the past instead of the future uh hm she pondered well as you know i am the realms preeminent vanyel expert vehs snorted mentally i recall stories where he did that but it wasnt a gift it was just something a heraldmage of his caliber could do she cocked her head why wil shook his head just curious she raised a brow ive heard that before he smiled despite himself maybe later she grunted better they talked until well into the night when it came time to sing to him she looked so sweet at his bedside that he felt a momentary wild urge to sit up and drag her into his arms sleep always came before he could act on that urge the squat house was built into the hillside a bit apart from the grain fields flowers and aromatics flourished in boxes and neat plots around the tidy stone structure laundry hung from a line faded blue and green garments fluttering in the breeze wil stood on the rutted path leading up to the front door elenes carved box clenched in his hands such a miserable recompense for a daughter shes alone in there lelia said wil glanced at her she had a distant look on her face a slight crease to her brow how are you doing that he asked lelia smiled its a bard thing oh lelia hugged her cloak around her you should go herald before she notices us wil couldnt argue with that logic he started up the path vehs following too soon the door was before him and he knocked one moment a cheerful voice called he heard glass clink and then the thump of footfalls the door swung open and a rosycheeked darkhaired woman looked up at him yes she asked wil cleared his throat kaylene baernfield yes her expression turned to perplexity elenes mother her face froze and suddenly wil didnt know how or even what to say everything kyril had told him all the things hed thought up along the waythey all scattered with the cessation of the vision with all the rest hed thought he was prepared he knew now that he never would be elene her mother whispered she died he swallowed extending the box to her and thinking again so small so paltry im sorry kaylene took the box she looked up at him tears growing in her eyes he reached out and touched her shoulder and then she was not looking at him at all but at something past him a good day to be alive lelia sat at the base of the hill leaning against a spreading oak the ride had been long and draining and the nightly lullabies werent as easy on her as she let on it felt good to sit and rest and breathe the sorrow unfolded in miniature on the hill kaylene clutched the box wil touched her shoulder and vehs bent his head lelia dashed tears from her own eyes something stirred in the brush to her right something big her heart skipped a beat she extended her gift as shed done that first night shed sung wil to sleep and she felt itthat oddly familiar presence familiar because it was a companion that stepped silently from the trees odd because this companion should not be his tack was heavily worn and stained with mud a bit of frayed rope trailed behind him one end still secured to his saddle the saddle lelias eyes traced the name worked into the leather and her mouth formed a silent oh she used the tree to clamber to her feet and put a hand out to the companion up on the hill a voice called alrek kaylene pushed past wil shoving elenes box back into his hands wil turned to see the bard slowly making her way up the hill a companion beside her vehs its him alrek kaylene said again hoarsely she stumbled forward and wrapped her arms around the companions neck weeping i am sorry an unfamiliar mindvoice said and by the startled look on lelias face wil guessed that they all heard it i did not protect her i did not bring her home lelia looked down and away tears on her cheeks i am so sorry you brought her home plenty of times kaylene stepped back and you brought yourself home she stroked his cheek thats moren i had before the companion sank to his knees kaylene kneeling beside him its all right she whispered over and over oh dearie i know you did your best i did not protect her alrek wil mindspoke to him the companion looked up agony in his eyes why have you been following me wil asked she alrek bent his head i dont know why but she is near you somehow i feel my chosen watching over you she the companion keened a low soft sound that broke wils heart i killed her wil glanced at kaylene alrek had not projected their conversation to her for which wil was grateful as much as anyone could he understood the why of it all now but kaylene did not need that burden reaching out with his mind wil showed the griefcrazed companion what he himself had seen night after nightwhat only a strange twist of foresight could know threads of time not as they would be woven but as they had been elene in the waterfumbling for her belt knifethe weight of the logsawing at the lead line until it broke the water carrying her away the companion shuddered then sighed his head came to rest on the grass his eyes closing go on wil said softly shes waiting with vehs and wils permission kaylene took a lock of alreks white hair she tucked it into the carved box alongside elenes things all of boarsden came to bury the companion the sun was heading for the west by the time wil and lelia left the bard riding behind him thin arms circling his waist chosen vehs said hm you should really visit your father sometime wil stiffened maybe someday whats wrong lelia asked nothing wil replied making a conscious effort to relax his shoulders what are they feeding you in the palace water and moonbeams youre practically all bones moonbeams bright lady no too fattening but the jest sounded faltering at best and he wondered they spent the night at the inn lelia was departing early there was no talk of singing tonight wil had a feeling he wouldnt need it anymore how often does this sort of thing happen vehs wil asked a companion surviving his herald not often the shock alone i dont know how alrek endured it promise me you wouldnt do something like this please vehs went quiet then do you jest after putting up with a chosen like you ill be galloping for the bright havens when my time comes wil snorted set his empty cup aside and headed for the stairs thats truly morbid be glad i dont take a head start yes yes wil thought smirking as he opened the door to his room im such a burden on lelia was curled up on his bed she opened an eye as he entered and smiled wil stood very still finding it suddenly hard to breathe good night vanyel vehs murmured so i was thinking lelia said yes wil managed lelia pushed back the covers to the hells with our professional relationship he groped for words and finally said this wasnt what i meant by tucking me in she laughed and she was still laughing as he kicked the door shut behind him and went to her chapter the brides task michael z williamson and gail l sanders kethreson shena talesedrin was learning weapons work the sword this would have been useful to know for his journey to valdemar but his people were warriors from horseback and with the bownot with the sword and dagger and on foot he stepped aside from a sweep blocked and countered but his teacher parried that and beat back at him but no knowledge is ever wasted chosen you wont always have a horse to hand what if i were injured just because your people havent done something before it doesnt mean that its not a valid way to do things keth replied i know there is no one true way but its taking some getting used to traditions have always played a strong role in the life of a shinain they had to right now you need to pay attention to your role here or the weaponsmaster is going to give you the traditional bruises you know i would probably be doing something like this at home as well i wonder how nerea is doing with her lessons she was always better with the bow than me you miss her did you really expect that to change we are pledged shes why i work so hard at these lessons i only hope that shell wait until i can return im not sure she understood why i had to come up here when i wasnt sure myself yssanda was silent theres a herd of horses in the palace courtyard one guard said why is there a herd of horses in the courtyard asked the other i dont know but isnt that a shinain on the back of one of them sure looks like it heya its a girl and look shes getting down do you think we should tell somebody sergeant of the guard selwin spoke loudly behind them yes you halfwits i think you should tell somebody you rolin go get herald captain kerowyn at a run you vark suggest to the young lady that she should stay outside the palace door yes sir the two guards saluted in unison and moved with a sense of purpose shaking his head the young guard sergeant moved toward what seemed to be an escalating argument the burly guard was having an increasingly difficult time with the slim shinain who seemed determined to simply get through that door hed managed so far without actually laying a hand on her but it didnt appear that was going to last very much longer she wasnt so much aggressive as persistent moving past the string of exceptionally quiet and serene horses selwin came within range of a contrastingly loud and agitated shinain girl she doesnt speak valdemaran sir im gathering that impression lets see what i can do he strained to remember a bit of the language in very slow and careful shinain he said please hold coming someone who speaks language the young girl nodded briskly and moved back to reassure her riding horse selwin wasnt sure who needed the reassurance more the horse or her herald captain kerowyn didnt take long to arrive which was all to the better as far as sergeant selwin was concerned he wasnt a diplomat and very much preferred going back to his post near the main gates he simply briefed kerowyn on what had happened so far saluted and then gestured the guards to head back to the gate striding forward herald captain kerowyn gave the impression of impatience she didnt hide it it might help speed this encounter what happened to shinain staying on the plains where they belonged what happened the mage storms happened and erased the tasks the shinain had been given by their stareyed kerowyn really hadnt needed the rejoinder to what had been a rhetorical question but trust sayvil to make sure her opinion was heardneeded or not welcome to haven im herald captain kerowyn what brings you here so far from the plains my name is nerea shena talesedrin im here looking for my pledged kethreson shena talesedrin the clan elders said that he had come up here for training in his gifts her skepticism in the need for such training was obvious they gave me permission to bring his clan share up here to him when the talesedrin came up for the bolton fair where is he ah suddenly kerowyn understood both her animosity and her vulnerability by giving her permission to bring keths clan share up here to him the clan elders were both telling him that they werent expecting him to come back to the plains and giving him permission to stay where he was they were also putting the responsibility of telling his pledged this off their shoulders and onto his practical but not very kind of them this nerea must have been quite a nuisance yes kerowyn sighed to herself and now shes our nuisance sayvil please tell dean teren about the situation out here and ask him to bring the shinain envoy with him if possible have them meet us at the stables to the girl she replied he is here at the collegium but first we need to get these horses settled and out of the way if youll follow me ill lead you around to the stables there should be room for them there kerowyn knew better than to offer her any help with this after all shed gotten them here from bolton it would also keep the girl busy while kerowyn figured out what to do the girl followed agreeably enough since the horses were something she cared for she did not seem to care for local rules the companionrelayed message brought dean teren down from his office in a rush from another direction the shinain envoy shaman loisha shena pretarasedrin was only a minute behind the dean arrived at the stable entrance panting the shaman heaved one sigh and had his breath back under control the dean said a shinain invasion that wasnt quite the message but i gather this matter is important not quite kerowyn said hiding a smile however we do have a shinain girl far out of her area seeking her pledged who is one of your students she indicated the stables i see the dean said and he seemed to grasp the import he followed her gesture to where the girl was taking proper care of the horses including a quick brushing with an economy born of lifelong experience when nerea finished watering them at the trough and ensured they had a panful of oats and plenty of hay each she turned and walked back she seemed fully aware of the dean and shaman but she waited for kerowyn to make the introductions she greeted the dean with a bow and spoke formally to the shaman nerea there are things i must attend to but the dean and shaman will aid you thank you for the introduction cousin you are welcome with that kerowyn turned and left intending to find out just who in bolton let nerea off her leash with fifteen horses and who there might be missing her loisha shena pretarasedrin shaman and shinain envoy found himself left with the problem with kerowyn gone he was both translator for the dean speaker for his own and the only possible authority figure the girl might acknowledge neutrally he said nerea you are far from our lands as are you elder we both have our reasons she replied with not quite a smile yes you are here for your pledged im told i am if he is to be here i am to be with him he recognized her expression nowdetermination with a slight challenge loisha translated for teren teren raised his eyebrows well first i suppose i need you to help explain about the training loisha nodded and translated for teren dean teren twisted his mouth for a moment apparently in thought then spoke nerea he said mindmagic is much more than empathy for animals i know you can work with these creatures he gestured toward the stables better than most people and its a natural talent for you however keth is able to do the same to people and objects whether they want it or not whether he wants it or not he and his traveling companions were attacked not far from the city on their way here his reaction caused unconsciousness for the brigands and two never recovered properly being mindlame since then he waited while loisha caught up well good she said i approve of retribution to such grekkashen teren winced slightly at that perhaps but it wasnt an intentional response he panicked they collapsed this could happen to innocent people too nerea i understand pledging is something that has been planned for some time you must understand that his mindmagic changes things he needs to learn to control it for his own safety and yours and that of others loisha translated she stared right back at teren then spoke to loisha i understand that you must understand that our pledge doesnt change due to side matters he is alive he is very much himself and he is very much mine i remain with him and he with me explain that to him please she gave a single firm nod with a raised eyebrow at her firmness loisha turned and translated for teren teren said that is not possible the flat tone in his voice almost did not need translation for you perhaps not i assure you it is quite possible for me she sounded almost haughty certainly confident and stubborn and yet calm she was like a mountain in storm while the trees swayed in distress the dean looked at loisha in controlled exasperation it wasnt that she didnt understand she understood fully and was unswayed the shaman placed a calming hand on terens wrist and tried a different tack it is obvious this is true things have not changed for you and you are on your course however have they remained the same for him loisha spoke with the authority of a shaman and brought up exactly what nerea did not want to hear she flushed slightly i dont know she said i havent seen him since he left our lands that is why i am here now this must be resolved between us she almost stamped her foot in emphasis i dont disagree this training though is for safety consider a fire on the plains theres a reason children are taught to tend a fire carefully they must know how to judge fuel to avoid a flare of flames and disaster her expression was most put upon i dont seek to hinder that only to be near him inwardly loisha sighed the girl wasnt being unreasonable just stubborn and adamant and unswerving in her intent the shaman said well then please let me start by offering a place to stay and clean up from the journey in the embassy in the hawkbrother ekele she widened her eyes slightly thank you she said i will be comfortable with our cousins if you wait i will show you the way i and the dean need to discuss how we can arrange this meeting for you with a frown and flick of her eyes she said you have only to tell me where he is but clearly that is too simple for this city with its costumes and rules and gates and castes she paused briefly as if only then aware of her bad manners forgive me thank you for your hospitality i will leave you to your discussion and i will await your direction for now for now loisha thought this wasnt over by far he watched her move a discreet distance away enough to be in another tent were there any tents here she paid attention to some detail of the bricks and moss and while not relaxed she was not intruding he turned to the dean teren asked how do we get her out of here in a whisper he glanced over suspiciously at her i dont know that we can it would be up to her and her pledged the distance should have made this impossible especially for one so young for our people they are man and woman grown you mustnt mistake her for a child im not mistaking her for a problem the dean clutched his hands together no but you are mistaking her for your problem i will show her to the ekele then we can talk very well and thank you then we can have keth deal with the issue teren seemed quite exasperated and loisha surmised that by issue he meant sending her home he didnt think it would be that easy i will meet with you shortly he said then he turned and to nerea said come then and i will show you to the ekele teren was in his office when loisha returned he gratefully put aside his writing and said please have a seat loisha sat in the one available chair in the cluttered and paperfilled office always one chair not used for storage i see the shaman offered with a chuckle teren shrugged and nodded and chuckled back its my way if anyone were to straighten my clutter id never find anything again but as to the other thank you for your aid in this matter this is most awkward students are unaccompanied and if they are not single when they commence training they are by the time they graduate this is how it is done and most arrive knowing it if hes to be a herald you are assuming he will complete the training and follow your chosen path there are at least two people assuming his fate for him it seems to me that is a question for him to answer teren looked startled at that how could he refuse to be a herald quite easily are you asking will he be the first to refuse teren had no response he never considered that possibility there were traditions and cultural assumptions at the collegium those werent necessarily the traditions and assumptions of the boy and they most definitely werent those of the girl by choosing him yssanda had thrown things into a fine tempest perhaps it was an amusement for her or it might be a necessity what would have possessed a companion to go all the way to the dhorisha plains to choose a shinain child what would valdemar need him for or was it that the shinain would need him more regardless of the cause this situation needed resolution i suppose we should arrange for them to meet he said leaning back and stroking his chin after that well see are you going to warn the young man im not sure we should hell want to meet at once and it will distract him ill arrange some time and well let them meet he can explain to her better than we im not sure it will be that simple oh of course hell have second thoughts and some homesickness however hes a fine pupil hes learned a lot of fundamentals quickly and hes even accepted the separation it was long in his mind theyve both grown and changed and this will make it clear the next morning loisha met nerea at the ekele entrance she was staring wideeyed at the lush and fragrant growth it was very different from the plains and being surrounded by the local terrain only emphasized the differences hearing his footfalls on the graveled path nerea turned and greeted the shaman bright the day elder she said cheerfully did you sleep well i did thank you how are the youngersibs they are comfortable and getting refreshed how much is stabling i have little money but i can offer work nothing is required for now you are a guest at our invitation thats gracious of you quite a few youths would have assumed hospitality without even thinking they expected adults to manage things for them the locals had trouble grasping that by shinain tradition she was a woman grown of course she asked about debts actually its gracious of the dean and of the queen he smiled but its something they plan for so you need not mention it i will do so at least once but i understand she said he sighed slightly yes the ways here were strange but as a guest one should learn and abide by the local rules she was a headstrong and inexperienced youth wellintentioned but fiery if you are ready then please come with me they walked out into a damp spring morning it had rained during the night it might be warm and muggy later but was clear and fresh now he led her through companions field along palace garden paths and to the collegium main hall at a side entrance teren awaited and with him kethreson shena talesedrin nerea was not so formal with keth she charged forward and threw her arms around him in a tackling hug feet off the ground and looking melted in place loisha stood back and let them resolve that their embrace was one of innocent companionship not of longparted lovers but it still held that same intensity keths mind whirled how did nerea get here but she was so warm and her grip so tight he could smell her hair and the scent of her leathers he closed his eyes and hugged her closely when he finally bent to put her down and her feet touched the ground she stepped back and grinned hugely at him her dark eyes glowing she said it is so good to see you my pledged i have traveled far to keep our bond her voice that language was music to him after months of the strange tongue and stiffer rules it used shinain flowed from the lips as was proper valdemaran seemed to march backward instead he remembered there were others here and they were being watched he kept hold of one of her hands and said i am so thrilled to have you here but i must introduce you to someone he tugged and she followed him smiling into companions field and away from prying eyes who did you need me to meet nerea asked they had been walking away from the palace and the collegium for some minutes now while he enjoyed her company shed come so far he had so many questions and so much to say but first he had to introduce her to his companion there she came from a shady copse of trees toward them he pointed as she came close then laid a hand on her shoulder he said this is yssanda she is in part the reason why i came here shes beautiful good lines broader head how did they get the silver hooves and does she suffer any eyesight problems with those blue eyes do the hooves breed true i can see as well as you do dear and sometimes clearer and dont you even think about breeding mei can pick my own mates thank you very much yssandra let him hear her comment even though she spoke to nerea well that certainly moved things along nerea stood very still the sensation of having someone speaking inside ones mind was disconcerting to say the least he recalled having that sensation come from a horse made it even more so while the shinain consider horses to be their youngersibs they didnt expect them to talk back nerea shes not a horse keth said gently shes a companion a person in her own right shes been my friend teacher and ally while ive been in this foreign place even after im done here shes going to have to be a part of any of our plans what are those plans going to be youve already been gone so long am i still a part of any plan keths heart went out to her she seemed to shrink inside herself a little both wanting to hear the answer and not wanting to hear nerea deserved his honesty but he wasnt sure himself we need to talk about that i think thats why youre here dean teren sat in his office yet again considering the problem that nerea and keth presented him neither one of the youngsters was taking into account what the collegium might have to say in the matterthey just assumed that they could order the world according to what they wanted after all they were young and togetherwho could stand against them that was exactly the reason herald trainees were expected to be unaccompanied it occurred to the dean that while it was certainly possible to stand against them it might be very problematic to do sosufficiently so to give the bards song fodder for a long time keth wasnt precisely a disappointment he learned very well however he hadnt internalized the right attitude and didnt see a problem with nerea remaining here she stayed at the ekele and had worked out a labor exchange for lodging she was quite competent teren realized hed underestimated them a valdemaran youth of that age could be swayed through reason emotion or social suggestion not only were these two from another culture theyd grown up much faster they were a strange mix of adult minds in juvenile spirits and bodies he needed to talk to the envoy again keth walked with loisha near companions field with his own concerns there were few people he could even begin to discuss this with its aggravating keth said all this past year ive been told i must continue alone i had accepted thatwell somewhatbut now she shows up here here halfway across the continent the shaman paused to study a flower keth was not interested in flowers it should be flattering the elder said it is keth agreed quickly its also very inconvenient not just for you i understand but i want her to stay i want to go home with her so does she i also do want to continue my studies theres so much to learn and im improving he paused unsure what to add you are improving the shaman assured him you also cant control this situation unlike mindmagic this involves peoples intent even if you had that power it would be unwise and unfair to use it he nodded that such might be possible was disturbing as to the matter at hand he asked so who does control it and what should i do we each control our own part or we think we do eventually each of us will find a path that fits the events that makes sense he agreed and he did feel better i just wish it would hurry up he realized he was pacing back and forth as the shaman strolled the shaman said it is better that it take time as to other things i understand nerea is taking language lessons he smiled with a twinkle yes clan kleshya also have given her lodging and some small allowance in exchange for stable work i let her have a little of my own funds he admitted blushing i do care for her she was so stubborn or not stubborn but simply unswayable there is no reason you shouldnt the shaman said but they want me to become a herald and heralds you are not yet a herald and you remain kethreson shena talesedrin those are two more things that must be reconciled this doesnt sound possible he said hed wanted reassurance this was making him feel more depressed he didnt feel shinain nor valdemaran nor even himself now it is all possible and we need not know how at this point it will all resolve in time thank you elder i suppose he tried to smile can you give me something more immediate and practical you are free for the day why not take your pledged into haven im sure shed like to see more than stables loisha found himself quite busy while he couldnt fault kerowyn for handing the problem off and it did involve his people it was quite an interesting one with all that entailed so teren what are we to discuss today he took the empty chair and noticed it was a different one the piles of parchment had moved the same as weve discussed every day for the last two weeks nerea yes shes quite the item a pest sweet pretty too clever for her own good and a pest teren twiddled a quill in his fingers the language lessons he guessed that and still being here and loitering around i suggested she stay in bolton i offered to pay for quarters across town to make some distance she would refuse of course she did yes teren was most agitated and on such a fine day is she affecting his studies not that ive noticed and ive been watching it is disruptive to others though on top of his existing differences as a foreigner loisha kept calm and reassuring well i should think that would be good for the other trainees theyll have to deal with such matters in the field after all indeed i would just prefer their practice problems be more organized you cant send her away he pointed out i know teren stood and looked out the window id hoped shed get bored and leave or hed realize hed grown apart from her something if anything they are reconnecting and throwing sand in everyones shoes then perhaps now is a time to walk barefoot and enjoy the sensation teren said walking barefoot also involves thorns then walk carefully loisha offered his friend with a smile i have a feeling these thorns will be trodden down by many feet let me show you the city keth said while it wasnt home it was a fascinating place and he was eager to introduce her to some of the more interesting foods whatever you like she said with a smile it caught him off guard he offered an arm and led the way toward the horse and animal market figuring to stop at the compass rose just beyond it it wasnt the cheapest but it didnt attract lowlifes and the usual clientele wouldnt be surprised to see a pair of shinain they were almost to the market when he realized why her smile had concerned him there was a glint theyd both grown in a year and she felt like a part of him then he realized he felt the same way even if he did agree with the collegiums rules and hed only admitted to understanding them this was something he wanted more the ashkevrons do have some fine horses nerea said we have better but not by much and no others ive seen come close well they do buy ours and breed them certainly but it takes more than stock it takes care and raising her energy never faded hed always liked that there were a lot of horses here today it must be some market day there were wagons carts horses with pannier saddles mounts for nobles and the wealthy and draft horses for farmers some of the wagons contained oats nuts apples and other fare meant for the animals and several stores had displays of combs and brushes there were also saddles tack and clothes for riders and even a carpenters display of stable making the place smelled of fine horseflesh and he enjoyed it some very fine creatures she said smiling she was relaxed he realized and comfortable for now with food and fine weather there was nowhere hed rather be which was odd this place was not home he could speak the language well enough to get by but it still felt foreign rather than ponder it he decided to just enjoy the day her hand was warm as she clutched his her shoulder brushed him every couple of steps he was comfortably fed and had no pressing worries for the day it was at that moment that the stareyed saw fit to give him pressing worries a carthitched horse suddenly stepped sideways reared up and came down in a limping gallop his cart knocked a stall askew spilled some contentsbags of feedand rode over the collapsed legs of the vendors display the horse was clearly hurt right rear leg tipping the ground as the rest clattered on the cobbles people dove from its path shouting and screaming other animals shied and whinnied backed and sidled until carts crashed and tangled in a huge mess it would take hours to sort out it had happened in moments the chaos spread as other horses and even smaller animals caught the whiff of panic their instincts fought their restraints and the din of it all was astounding then nerea stepped into the street keth knew what she intended and took a half step to grab her then decided he would only make it worse he had no doubt she knew what she was doing but he wasnt sure the horse did three people buffeted him as they darted past urgently clearing the street and seeking somewhere out of reach of rearing hooves and twisting wagons then the horse a very handsome dapple reached nerea at a neargallop still dragging the remains of the cart she stood calmly stepped aside just enough to avoid it and stroked his flank with her fingers he slowed haltingly and stumbled two steps forward as the tilting carts momentum shoved at him nerea walked around him fingers tracing his muscles after the dapple was calmed she stepped over to a dun mare nerea held a hand to her muzzle and she quieted then a roan stallion dropped relaxed and stepped out of the wreckage of a pushcart yoke the waves of calm rippled out where waves of panic had flowed only breaths before nerea turned back to the dapple walked around and touched his injured leg he raised it at once and she studied his hoof taking out her belt knife she pried something long and sharp out of the frog releasing the foot she patted the dapples flank and keth smiled because he knew what could keep her here near him and near the horses he would stay here and finish his studies because mindmagic and animal speaking ran through his people it was inevitable others would show their talents and possibly more of them hed be needed to teach those children of the shinain who had mindmagic and who could not or would not leave the plains nerea would stay here until then and teach the valdemarans about horses for wisdom ran both ways he also understood why the day had been so sweet even though valdemar wasnt his home nor anymore were the plains home was where nerea was so how are our lovebirds doing more importantly has nerea started home yet teren asked loisha hopefully after serving the shaman some tea loisha smiled at him i think that is a vain hope my friend she does not look as if she is leaving anytime soon if she were easy to dissuade she would have never left the plains in the first place teren sighed and leaned against his desk what am i going to do with them why do anything they will solve their own problems and have indeed begun to do so loisha calmly sipped his tea what do you mean asked teren suspiciously he had the feeling that he wasnt going to like this after that incident at the horse market nerea has received more offers for work and horse training than she knows what to do with she isnt going anywhere he repeated what about keth has he spoken to you at all loisha sat back and steepled his fingers yes he has asked me about becoming a teacher on the plains he believes his talents lie not with valdemar but with hisourpeople hes not entirely wrong her talent of course is a latent power manifesting itself there will be others he can hardly be the only one needing to be trained in mindmagic since the storms there is now no reason not to my people would learn better from one who has the proper attitude magic is not to be meddled with but controlled and tempered but he is supposed to be a herald anyone a companion chooses has to be a herald teren was agitated hed thought loisha concurred with him why there is no one true way its time to change not every shinain with power can trek to valdemar and certainly they cant remain here at some point we must have our own schools in the meantime he will be an intermediary learning here then mentoring others perhaps one day he will return to the plains teren said thats not what he wants loisha replied nor is it what you want nor even what id want if i had a choice none of us do though the storms have blown the slate clean for us down on the plains he took a final sip of tea and placed the cup down on a clear spot amid the clutter i believe they have for valdemar as well chapter fog of war ben ohlander gonwyn pressed the bloody filthy rag down onto where his teeth had been broken by the arrow hit the helmets cheekpiece had saved his life but pain from the splintered molars flared as he tried to stanch the bleeding he spat more blood and fragments onto the leafy ground distant fighting flared up the rattle of combat carried across the torn ground his part of the field might have gone quiet but fighting still raged in the center and on the left he nudged rath with his heels and they moved together up the drawand through the trees the companion fastidious about her hooves stepped around the windrows of fallen bodies tedrel and valdemaran lay commingled embraced in death he crossed into the rally point well behind the lines at least until the lines had moved and brought heavy fighting the low mounded hill and its sparse trees stank of blood and loosened bowels thick with the stench of death nearby wounded had been gathered here at least until the tedrels had swept the valdemaran forces back now the injured felt no pain he thought adreal lay dead propped against a tree with a bloody blanket pressed to his middle the herald master opened his eyes and reached for his notched sword bringing it up in defense before he recognized gonwyn gonwyn slid out of the saddle and moved closer claris adreals companion came into sight lamed by a gashing wound in her left rear leg the skin lay open exposing the muscle beneath blood slicked the companions side running from haunch to hock where the hell was our support gonwyn asked it was raining anvils on us over there adreal halfsmiled at him you sound like you have a mouth full of marbles gonwyn made an apologetic gesture toward his bloodcrusted face got hit by a spent arrow lost most of the afternoon asleep in a warm pile of dead other people was missed by the tedrel looters theres your answer adreal shook his head tedrel happened their cavalry never showed the lord marshal took all the reserves and our horse to go deal with something clever the tedrels thought up they took all the heralds who were controlling movement on this side they went out of play just as they would have been useful adreal coughed as he shifted his weight against the tree you do know that king sendar was killed gonwyn winced as he brushed his tongue over the damage yes it came out as yeth i heard he was down but was back up rath told me he was killed when i came to what happened adreal shrugged and coughed again a thin spittle line of blood leaked from the corner of his mouth his tone remained dry and normal dont know the full of it he took what body of troops was near and charged into the center cracked it most of the tedrel forces fell on that wedge just about everyone in that charge was killed but it took the pressure off the flanks what about the heir gonwyn asked alive adreal wiped his hand across his face gonwyn could see the sweat even in the cool air selenay is alive i heard alberich got her out before that part of the line got swamped there was some kind of assault or raid he got her out gonwyn spat again and reached into raths saddlebags for sour field wine he rinsed his mouth winced at the astringent bite then offered the bladder to adreal the herald refused with a shake of his head he didnt turn on us gonwyn asked i always thought he was too good to be true nope mr hide in haven was all over the map today bad cess to the tedrels he got selenay out after sendar died kept the attack going in the face of the kings fall and led the regrouping in the absence of the lord marshal wheres talamir then wheres the kings own he was near sendar when he went down they got tavar both men shared a glance first at adreals claris then at gonwyns rath the ultimate horror for a herald the loss of bond and blood of a companions fall gonwyn knew both that he would take his own life if rath fell and that they talked about a dead man they both glanced as the fighting on the left side of the valdemaran line grew more intense distant horns followed by a giant crash as two forces came together that took gonwyn by surprise lord maybe got off his ass adreal laughed without mirth no once sendar fell the center went mad with fury and most of the inner parts of the line bent inward commanders farther out on the flanks held back either they had farther to go or there were local problems he didnt say what gonwyn had heard again and again through camp rumor that the less reliable commanders were to be put the farthest on the flanks adreal ignored his expression and continued sorcha went to lord maybe to press home on that side and avenge the king the rage was on them too sorcha was arguing with him and maybe was saying maybe when something the size of a crow came and took his head off he smiled grimly sorchas elissa was impressed and companions dont impress easy adreal coughed again that eastholder sergeant splitface took over and two candlemarks later rolled up their right side like a carpet this was midafternoon you can still hear that part of the fight gonwyn was surprised not one of maybes officers they brought enough adreal smiled have you seen that bastard looks like he got his mug cut in half with an ax would you tell him no gonwyn shook his head i saw him once when i was running messages for colonel perfect boots youd need stones the size of catapult shot to go up against him adreal shrugged then though it cost him i think the lord marshal put him there deliberately you should have heard maybe squawking about command interference threatened to take the matter to the king anyway adreal picked up a broken arrow and drew in the dirt splitface broke through their right side and is driving into their center and rear their entire right side collapsed with many routing into the center most of that was thrown over by sendars charge whats left of the tedrel right wing folded back like a gate but splitface ripped right through that hes now somewhere back in there cheerfully tearing their rear echelons to shreds gonwyn tried to whistle and settled for a wince hes that good adreal shrugged seems so theyre outnumbered but ive never met an eastholder yet with enough brains to do basic math it probably hasnt occurred to him yet that they should be getting swamped theyre all still in a blood fury so that helps he made more marks to show the original valdemaran lines then scratched them out if we could hold then we might be the anvil to their hammer but as it stands hes pushing them all into us a wounded guardsman approached with a water bottle and a loaf gonwyn took the bottle and gratefully swigged from it he sluiced out a mouthful of pinktinged water before he drank he considered the bread the state of his mouth and passed on the loaf it was not a hard choice can sorcha hold him up give us time to reknit he asked adreal stabbed the arrow into the dirt map no she went down a little after midafternoon with eiven dead she was our last link to the far flank on that side of the line gonwyn winced eiven and selim sorcha and elissa thats seven pairs today eight adreal corrected morevon got hit with one of those floating flaming bastards pinned him and elath to the ground gonwyn made no response for a long moment its been a rough day for the companions field adreal laughed again a dry humorless laugh its been a rough day for us all he stabbed the arrow into the ground there ive shown you mine you show me yours gonwyn wiped adreals marks with his boot he absently noted that blood had already stained the leather he flexed his stiffening hand not much to tell he said i was on the assend of the line supporting captain arlands guards regimentand a herd of orthallens militia this morning i was all the way past where the oak grove burned watching for tedrel cavalry trying to push our flanks we were still holding in our original deployments the militia gave a good account of themselves they broke the shock troops well enough there was no serious effort to turn our flank they were just keeping us in play at first gonwyn made more marks to show the evolving fight wed started to give ground after we got intelligence that the tedrel cavalry was missing and to watch our flanks arland had just refused his line to double spears on the right when every damned tedrel ever born washed over us i saw the terilee in flood once rising up a dike thats how it felt arland called me and his scouts in at that point he laughed ormona was mindspeaking for arland and called for reinforcements she got sorry theyre busy good luck he stabbed the dirt with the arrow the line bent but we were doing okay then we got word that sendar was down and orthallen he commanded the bulk of the militia ordered everyone back to the second rally line disengaging in the middle of a fight is damned hard and while the militia was doing well they werent up to this arlands regiment got sorted out but the militia shattered like a dropped pot he shrugged they would have had us except that a whole horde of tedrels took off and started running for the center there were enough left to make us pay but it thinned them enough to give us a chance gonwyn flexed his hand and stared at the trickle of blood that ran down between his middle and ring fingers the wound in his shoulder had broken open again most everyone got back into the trees he continued we were scattered from hell to breakfast in those woods once those blackhearted bastards sort out splitface and figure out were broken theyll turn the position then were done adreal paused assessing gonwyns report its not that easy looks like most of the tedrel leadership went down in sendars charge there are a whacking great lot of them still out there but their army is breaking up nonetheless i take your point this fight may be won but it isnt over gonwyn nodded feeling the need to explain his own presence away from the fighting wed just gotten word that the king wasnt down the message got garbled somehow rath thinks we picked up a piece of the local chatterthat the king had gone down into the valley but who knows he continued to draw with the arrow we heard from horvis who was up closer to the center that king sendar had charged down into main body and we were to press forward in support orthallen was nowhere to be found ormona was supposed to be mindspeaking for arland but orthallen took her with him so we got word from a very confused guardsman riding his captains horse he was looking for a captain elesarn who was supposed to have a cavalry troop when he found us he was about a quarter compass off the mark looking for a horse unit that were gods only knew where at that point we policed him up arland ordered us forward but it took a few minutes to mindspeak with horvis and ormona and get everyone singing the same hymn orthallen was supposed to join back up but arland didnt wait he did a halfleft with what he had and started sweeping in toward the center i think our linear distance would have been about two miles at that point most of the tedrel shock troops scattered when we came back out of the tree line i was with about a halfcompany a mixed bag of guardsmen and militia wed hit what was left of the tedrel shield wall and were doing okay until i got hit with this he made a gesture at his marred face and i went down when i came to anything that wasnt dead was scattered arland and the regiment were long gone i worked my way back to the rally point he dismissed an hours terror sharp fighting and the shoulder wound with a shrug he looked around at the piles of dead and dyingand the evidence of heavy battle such as it is a shared glance with adreal told him that the history lessons were over im staying here to redirect whoever tries to make the rally point back to the assembly areas below the village thats where her majesty is trying to spin dung into diamonds you want me to go there gonwyn asked no adreal replied what i want is for you to get to splitface and get him to back off but youd never make it he looked at the battered chainmail on the bloodstained herald you were a guards officer before you were chosen i need you to get into those woods and start rounding up the stragglers there are parts of units all over these hills and we have to get the strays moving back toward the village that way her majesty can knit something together that buys us time if i can break through the companion babble ill get word to someone on what youre about gonwyn reached down and gripped his friends arm be careful i saw something in the woods that made a karse demon look like a kitten adreal returned the grip probably was karse the tedrels raped and burned their way across the country even if they were in the sunlords pay this battle is the best thing that ever happened to them if tedrel wins they get a weakened and defeated valdemar with a tedrel client for a buffer if they lose then they get rid of an annoying and expensive problem if it calls a draw then they bleed us three throws and they win each one so karsell be watching this all very closely gonwyn looked at the bloodstained blanket and knew the answer beforehand can i help you adreal lifted the blanket gonwyn saw the poniard rammed to the hilt through the chainmail and between adreals ribs a bright bubble of blood leaked out as he exhaled healer janse took the pain when they first brought me here so it doesnt hurt i passed out he pointed with his chin to where the wounded had been slain as they lay when i awoke this was over he shifted the blanket to cover himself gonwyn bent to offer his hand in farewell adreal grabbed it with a fierce strength his expression direct and forceful gonwyn do you remember what the king said before he left haven you like handstrokes too much and if were going get out of this we need brains leave the sword in the scabbard promise me youll steer clear of fights gonwyn dipped his head acknowledging without promising he raised his hand in salute see you on the other side adreal raised his hand in reply then let it drop he turned his attention to obliterating every vestige of their quick maps that was adreal careful beyond careful get something to eat and wash your face he said as gonwyn turned away you look like youve been wading in an abattoir gonwyn returned to where rath stood the companion had all but demolished a pile of oats poured from a bag and onto the leafy ground he could feel the hunger in the big mare and the bonedeep fatigue no rest for the wicked with rath there were never questions just statements it used to annoy gonwyn but hed had twentyfive years to get over it is there ever he replied the wounded guardsman stood nearby he held a sootstained steaming pail of water the handle wrapped in rags blood seeped through the bandage on his head and ran down the side of his face gonwyn looked at him one pupil the size of an olive the other a pinpoint just put it down son he said gently the guardsman looked at him confused and still gonwyn took the bucket from him he watched as the young soldier drifted back to where a larger pot of water boiled over a fire the companion answered his unasked question his brains were dashed about severe but not fatal if he is well cared for there will be damage gonwyn poured most of the warm water into a pail mixed a double handful of oats into it and squatted on his heels to use the rest of the hot water to wash off some of the blood and filth he took a rag and gingerly swabbed the contusion on his temple from when hed been knocked off rath the mare had nearly done a backflip to avoid stepping on him but had still clipped his head and put him out you done making yourself pretty rath was still nose down in the pail lipping out the last of the steaming oats yeah gonwyn replied you ready yes we should go too many oats will make me fat gonwyn looked at her with rath you could never tell she might even be serious he tightened the bellyband and mounted settling in the worn saddle herald and companion moved back down the hill and across the narrow draw at a groundeating canter they avoided the lines of dead by unspoken agreement angling away from the road and down through the leafy drifts to the stream that had been the control feature for the valdemaran reserve line they followed it some quarter of a mile to where it bent sharply to the right the stream went straight ahead on their crude map that had been the beginning of a very bad day turned out the map theyd copied was wrong there were two streams about a quarter of a mile apart which meant some of the troops had withdrawn to the wrong stream when orthallen called retreat then when theyd tried to turn it around the units were hopelessly scattered and the reserves were gone everything else about this campaign had been a dogs dinner so why not the maps enough raths mental voice cut through his internal monologue the mare stopped suddenly and tensed adreal gonwyn asked he has passed claris has gone mad the very matteroffactness of the mares tone told him how deeply she felt the loss all companions shared a bond deeper than mortals could understand but rath and claris had been exceptionally close gonwyn forced himself still pushed down the grief at adreals death and claris loss he buried it alongside the crushing fatigue the pain from mouth and shoulder and the bellydeep fear all the things that were normal to feelbut which he just couldnt afford rath sensing his resolve pressed onward picking up the pace to move through where the tedrels had pressed forward been stopped and then driven back the combat here had been brutal with quarter neither asked nor given the dead lay thickest where the lines had struggled longest they rode around a few fragments of tedrel units none of which looked much like fighting gonwyn and rath moved together with an abundance of caution alert to adreals order to avoid trouble from such came the karse stories of ghost horses they slowed after a mile or so to pick their way carefully through a narrow draw where a small fight had taken place a dozen dead valdemarans and rather more tedrels lay in little heaps and piles he and rath had passed this way less than two candlemarks earlier so this fight had taken place recently tedrels were still bleeding through the original valdemaran lines and into the border hills this was bad news that needed reporting he slid out of the saddle to walk ahead of the mare scuffing his feet in the leaves as they went the tedrels liked caltrops and having rath take one through the hoof would be a deathsentence he searched the dead tedrels rifling through equipment and pockets and looking at shoes the journey bread was freshbaked so they had both ovens and wheat the shoes were mostly old but well tended and stuffed with fresh hay to pad the feet the equipment tended to be simple and poor but well maintained the standard tools of a sellsword there were a few small coins but no significant booty or loot that suggested a couple of things but none definitive no writing material orders or maps the mix told him that they were decently supplied and had resources close by bakers and cobblers did not strap their kit on a field pack this was no tedrel advance guard this was the tedrel nation in some ways the tedrels were better supplied than the valdemarans they faced king sendar had to cajole and command to force the council to put aside its spats and march as one country the delay gave the army a throwntogether feel and it was larger than the commissary could support for any length of time sendar no selenay now would have little choice but to begin disbanding the army very soon before it started eating itself to death they had to do for tedrel here and now he took some buttons small coins and other trinkets that might show where the tedrels had been he also gathered up a brace of fat rabbits they had snared along the way what are you going to do with those asked rath its not like you can chew right now im not going to leave two patriotic valdemaran rabbits in the clutches of the tedrels its only right i find a good valdemaran stomach for them even if its not mine whatever he took the journey bread as well he wasnt sure when he would eat and while food hadnt been an issue it was just a matter of time before it was he felt rath touch his mind sort his conclusions and make his report its still too hard to get through ive passed word to kantor directly but hes preoccupied with alberichs problems im trying to get to eigen but he and rimlee are almost out of range theyre mopping up some tedrel cavalry anlina is up in the center shes tied up with sorting out something about the king and adreal is dead otherwise theres still too much confusion gonwyn shook his head the mindspeaking is an advantage but we rely on it too much once the plan fell apart so did the way wed planned to mindspeak the queen might be able to get orders down my friend but no way are we going to get word back up these militia did well they held their own then withdrew in good order in about company strength should we follow and make our report in person gonwyn considered it and the attendant benefits of healer wench bottle and bed in exactly that order he judged the direction and likely time and frowned the sun was well past afternoon and into evening adreal knew what he was about damned duty no he said reluctantly theyre headed toward the roadstead theyll be halfway to the village by now someone will police them up well press along the main line of resistance thy will be done replied the mare he turned to mount and felt rath stiffen be still now theres a herald nearby back up that side wash up among the trees gonwyn turned to look there where the big oak is slanted and thicket is close in where the stream tumbles yes it is herald danilla she panicked in the fight her companion is very young and was overcome what the hell does that mean overcome it means that we are not perfect chosen the girl is frightened and both are ashamed be gentle herald gonwyn when am i not he replied rath flickered about a hundred quick mental images between them all right but that last one wasnt my fault she said the pig was tame he slid his sword out of its scabbard and laid it across the saddlebow better safe rath did not respond the companion started down the washedout creek bank and splashed across her steps were dainty and careful feeling for a caltrop even in the water before she put her hoof all the way down gonwyn in no mood for a fast arrow from a frightened girl stopped just inside calling distance to the stand of oaks herald danilla he called come down it is herald gonwyn he used a note of command broadened with inflections of concern and wary friendship he could feel the edges of raths mindppeaking to danillas companion many heralds could actually hear the great pool of minds that the companions shared the skill not shared by gonwyn had been alternately described it as a great joy and great annoyance some few moments passed before he saw movement then a quick flash as a young herald in new chainmail and white surcoat led her companion down from the copse of trees he waited letting her come to him while he scanned the surrounding trees they had been in this draw too long and were too exposed he assessed her condition as she approached her head down her surcoat was streaked with blood and the left shoulder was spattered with gray lumps that his experienced eye told him were someone elses brains her coat was still a damned sight cleaner than his though her hauberk was tightlaced in the school style rather than fieldlaced telling him she was fresh from the collegium first mission first fight and it was this butchery the companion was injured favoring the rear left hoof the girl looked up at him as she approached there was a shallow wound high on the haunch toward the back it had been welltended and dressed tear marks traced clean streaks across the heralds filthy face her hair was matted with blood probably a cut in her head he didnt see any fresh blood and in any event hed lost his healing kit it would have to keep equipment he asked sword bow she replied softly her voice muffled as she studied her feet can you ride a pause while she conferred with her companion yes can walk cant run almost a whisper this time i dont have time for this he thought to rath make time the companion replied theyre herald and companion leaving them is not an option mount up we need to move she mounted lightly moving with a grace that gonwyn lacked even when not wearing chainmail and two weeks worth of grime she settled in her saddle and looked at him her eyes haunted he knew what was coming and hated it hated her for it he didnt like being involved didnt want to be involved and she was going to involve him i ran she confessed bringing the monster in the room out in the open now he had to deal with it when they broke through i helped in the fight i did i killed two with my sword then everything fell apart there were so many they killed captain elagen and herald valean and smashed companion saneels head wide open the pikemen started to run thats when i panicked she began to weep tracking more clean across a landscape of caked mud dirt and blood im so sorry gonwyn hated weeping anger he could deal with drunken stupidity his and others a specialty and the myriad petty squabbles and cases of two decades of riding circuit proved a cinch give him a few tears and he was utterly at a loss you and half the population ever born commented rath drily say something encouraging and move out we need to go you broke its not part of the job description but it happens it also happens to be history we need to round up whatever troops we can find and send them back to the village and we have to do it sometime before i have a birthday he stopped feeling himself starting to run on nice said rathwhy dont you kick her puppy while youre at it he snarled a curse by way of reply the companion turned downstream the map showed this draw feeding into the creek that marked the border but that was wrong too dont take it out on me rath replied its not my fault you have the emotional range of a sling bullet the companions mental voice carried a tired good humor but there was an edge the last time hed heard that edge shed dumped him in a well of course the caterwauling when you were drunk may have helped i was singing oh is that what that was it sounded like a cat hung by its tail the maids father wasnt impressed either he chased you for nearly a mile and having him present the foundlings bill to haven for the babe was what got you busted back to circuit that was what second promotion second bust you know what they say about you in haven thats our gonwyn stand up guy in a fight or for a girl stands up for every fight and every girl gonwyn felt stung anything else youve got your own issues chosen so lighten up on the kid he looked back to where danilla followed she had mounted her companion moved slowly on the injured leg the young mare wasnt likely to pull up lame but she wasnt going to run any races either he furrowed his brow same leg same injury as adreals claris he lodged that one away look he tried again were in a fix and i need you in the here and now he softened his voice adding firm but fair compassion anything she interpreted as pity would only make the situation worse what is done is done we cant change what happened but we can learn from it and move on try to do better we won today but it may not be over weve got units all over these hills along with many tedrels our job is to find as many of the good guys and as few of the bad guys as possible so that we can reknit the army in case we have to fight tomorrow understand she nodded yes a little firmer now time to ride they pressed farther into the hills calling several valdemaran units a halfcompany here a few scattered squads a platoon of mismatched parts and a string of individual men lost from their units they skipped around tedrels some of whom remained bent on violence but most were as lost and confused as the valdemarans gonwyn got the further sense that while the great center of the battle may have retained some organization out here in the boonieflanks command had all but collapsed on both sides he noted as they rode that the girl had firmed up shed stopped looking at the dirt in front of her once it became plain that there were others there whod broken in that first confusion she felt less alone they werent heralds of course but they were all human by the time they stopped for the evening she was watching for traps and ambushes and had some of her confidence back it wasnt in him to go taletelling so the girl would not have to face the heralds version of censure where everyone understood of course we understand when what they meant was we understand you failed and then the duties got easier after that you were still a herald but not quite in the same league as those hadnt let down the side hed sipped from that bitter cup himself and saw no reason to pass it to another it was better in the guards where the senior sergeant took you behind the woodshed and just beat the dung out of you when you screwed up the thrashing fixed all and let you back in the platoons good graces he pulled up as the sun was eaten by the hills to the west full dark would be here soon with some hours before moonrise rath found a good campsite well back in a valley with close overhead trees a steep rill that would provide a way out in an emergency and good water gonwyns camppicking ability remained a running joke between them at least since the flashflood and the beehive he turned in the saddle back to where she followed its getting too dark to continue he said with all of these tedrels in the hills well rest here until the moon comes up until then itll be too dark to be blundering about we should have a couple of candlemarks to eat and sleep then well press on he dismounted with a grunt and loosened raths bellyband he could see her in the failing sunlight copying him her brow puzzled why do you do that she asked do what ever tried to put a saddle on in the dark when arrows are flying no i got that i dont understand why you usually talk to your companion to your rath why dont you just mindspeak as i do with my enara he looked at her as he leaned into rath crossing his elbows on the saddlebow im almost totally headblind i can hear rath and she can read me but i cant send worth a damn if i buckle down and really focus i can just about get a whisper out its just easier to do it this way her expression appeared no more than halfbelieving whats your talent drinking interjected rathwenching gonwyn ignored the companion i dont really have one i was already a guards officer nearly twentyone when i was chosen the masters said i was too old to learn mindspeech which is why almost everyone who is chosen is a child alberich hadnt been the first adult chosen though clearly the oldest he wasnt comfortable with this topic or its memories and wanted to change the subject whats your talent then oh me she replied she looked around and found a stick as long as her forearm and as thick as her finger she snapped it green wood splintering along the ends of the break she held the stick between her hands and stared at it in intense concentration gonwyn was just convinced she was having him on when a thin wisp of smoke emerged and the splintered ends burst into flame gonwyn thought she looked a little relieved youre a firestarter he said im not very good i can just about manage this stick and it doesnt always work well id bet it beats my flint steel and profanity when i cant get my tinder to light she smiled then showing dimples uh oh the girl had turned back to her saddlebags and had pulled out a bedroll when she abruptly laughed she looked back over her shoulder at him enara tells me i am in the presence of a notorious womanizer and flirt she is worried youre going to seduce me gonwyn turned his head and gave rath a long stare rath contrived to look innocent a dead giveaway are you am i what seducing me gonwyn gave her a disgusted look all right all right she said taking her bedroll and heading toward their campsite how about now are you seducing me now she smiled again if you were i wouldnt want to miss it gonwyn managed to convey his response in a single snort that encompassed rath enara and danilla i mean at your age you probably would want to give it a good running start gonwyn took his blanket out of his rather thin field pack and followed did you have to he asked rath as he passed you do have a certain reputation he gathered such small wood as he could find as he crossed to where the stream burbled down underneath a widespread oak she had already dug a narrow deep hole in the dirt and had started the side vent to let in air the fire would burn hot and small within its deep pit cook well and throw out little light her campcraft seemed good enough even if it looked more like a final exam than a field rig she still smiled in good humor but kept her attention on her work he moved to one side and gutted the rabbits using the skins to lay the carcasses on while he jointed them he dug a second pit for the offal and trash deep enough for scavengers to be put off the scent at least until what they left began to rot their camp preparations went quickly both moving with an efficiency driven by the quickly fading light he took a small leather bucket from his bags and soaked it in the creek water to thoroughly wet it then set it on a small tripod to boil he began cutting small pieces of meat from the rabbit and dropping them in the water she made a face at his filthy hands then frowned as a drop of blood fell from between his fingers and onto the rabbit pelt damn he said seeing the blood he reached up under his surcoat and adjusted the rag he had stuffed under the hauberk to try to contain the bleeding youre hurt she said not a question took an ax in the fight this morning it split the mail she crossed to where he knelt to work and knelt in front of him she pulled back the surcoat and pulled the dirty rag out of the cut in the chain where gonwyn had pressed it back in blood streaked the chainmail links and stained the linen undertunic her expression told him what she thought of his efforts no no no she said this just wont do that wound may need to be stitched gonwyn felt his stomach drop stitched dont i need a healer for that she glanced around do you see any healers my dad raised cattle and ive stitched lots of bulls after theyd gored each other gonwyn did not find this reassuring nonetheless he slid out of the dirty remains of his white surcoat then winced as he moved his arm back to unlace the hauberk she moved to help him oh thats interesting the footloops here allow the laces to be drawn with one hand and tied off one person can do it one handed and while the metal doesnt overlap it does let you loosen it to let in some air if you have to she took the weight of the hauberk as he slid out of it then felt the heavy weight drop onto his blanket the armor was already dirty and would need a good scouring in the sand barrel but more grime wouldnt do it any favors gonwyn was surprised and more than a little concerned at the amount of blood that soaked his undertunic the wound had not seemed that bad she looked at the blood on his side then at his face which he kept carefully expressionless i need to see it he started to unlace the tunic then gave it up as his arm wouldnt reach ill need your help she smiled at him dont get any ideas they both laughed at the joke however thin she helped him out the tunic when he couldnt raise his arm above his shoulder now that theyd stopped moving the shoulder was stiffening quickly and the movements threatened to cause the pain hed banked away to break through gods gonwyn she said as the undertunic came away his entire right shoulder was a single massive black bruise where the chain had taken the force and spread it across the links broken links had scored the skin when they had been driven through the undertunic the ax wound itself was about two inches long and looked deep enough to have cut into muscle a large black crusted scab covered the entire wound and oozed blood he moved his left hand to press on the skin and she smacked it away he did not tell her that while hed been hurt before hed badly underestimated this one bastard knew what he was about got me longwise instead of chopping down just where the mail splices together he cut right through those hands are filthy keep them away from the wound she moved to the stream and with that innate facility that women have produced a cake of soap she washed her hands thoroughly and returned to him with her healing kit she carefully cleaned the wound while gonwyn pretended this was all routine he did swear when she doused it with the astringent wine but just the once the sun was nearly down before she finished probing the wound extracting a small sliver of metal that had entered stitched it bigger stitches than the healers used as cattle call for different threads and dressed it in linen she set his undertunic to soak in the stream for a time and hung it to dry as he had no other for his part he tested the arm and made several practice swings with his sword it hurt like blazes but he thought he could still fight if it came to it dont do that youll pick them free she came over to him as he moved the chainmail and settled the blanket around his shoulders lets see that mouth he leaned away and spat out a gob of bloody phlegm nice she said now turn into the light so i can see they were nearly of a height he angled his head this way and that and opened his mouth i cant see much but it looks like you youre going to have to get those back two extracted before they get infected and abscess gonwyn nodded that was about what he thought she looked at him perplexed why didnt you go to the healers he shrugged embarrassed my friend was dying from a stab wound and was still doing his duty right up to the last seconds of his life i couldnt go the healers for a toothache not after that he did not admit that hed thought about doing exactly that i didnt know the shoulder was that bad she gave him a very long look then swallowed whatever she was about to say well i dont want your dirty fingers in my dinner so you sit over there she looked down at where he had been cutting the rabbit how were you figuring on eating boiling the meat into a broth see if i could boil the meat soft enough to chew and sip down the broth she nodded one time an economical gesture well do that she set to finishing the task he had started cutting the rabbit into bits to boil and then spitting hers to roast the cook fire brought the heat directly under the pot and spit so the food cooked quickly and evenly there was little enough left for them but this fire was about eating not comfort the sun faded before the rabbits cooked leaving them sitting ravenous underneath a purpleblack darkness decorated with a skyful of brightblazing stars the evening brought a chill enough that he sought his one notasdirty shirt from his field pack he managed some cupfuls of soup along with a few bits of rabbit he shared the jouney bread hed taken from the tedrels his wellsoaked with broth to soften by unspoken agreement the mission had ended tomorrow they would abandon the search and return to the assembly area gonwyn felt a voice in his head from a mindspeaker powerful enough to punch through his headblindness danilla and enaras heads came up any units still fighting are to cease operations and return to start lines all regiments and militia are to do a muster count and report by the numbers all heralds not assigned to military mindspeaking duties are to report to command tent in fighting kit for briefing who the hell was that asked gonwyn i think thats myste danilla replied whats a myste asked gonwyn still impressed by the strength his headblindness had been described as a wall fifty feet high and a hundred wide herald chronicler she replied herald chronicler gonwyn realized he was starting to sound rather dumb dont you ever get to haven she asked him in turn no he replied relieved to be on the granting end of the conversation it gives me hives i try to avoid any kind of headquarters myste was in my year at the collegium and an utter despair no real friends no one would partner with her for trials and we dreaded having to train with her couldnt see needs um spectacles cant fight to save her life nearly cut off her companions ear the first time she tried it mounted cant run circuit she can mindspeak though replied gonwyn so it would seem answered danilla just a little primly he was ready to ask her what that meant when mystes voice broke through again pending instruction from the queen all actions against the tedrels except in strictest selfdefense are to cease by order of the lord marshal what why asked danilla gonwyn turned toward her im guessing its because the commissary is running out we dont have the time or rations to scour these hills and the queen has to think about the harvest we took a lot of farmers out of fields to fill out this army and she needs them there or we dont eat next year id wager shell leave just enough down here to keep the tedrels in check and only in numbers that she can easily feed rath broke in something is up im hearing that theres going to be a raid into karse to get some prisoners so everyone is tied up with that she paused daners made contact our report has been noted were to pull back and bring out lady danilla and stop hunting tedrels ive explained what adreal sent us on but he died before his message could get passed through so theyre going off of your reputation lady danilla he asked the herald you said your father herded cattle even in the dark he could feel her embarrassment it was a lot of cattle she replied he exhaled loudly all right well stay on plan once the moon comes up and gives us some light well backtrack to where that big valley runs north and south we should pick up the roadstead there and be back in the camp before moonset the creeks are more direct but theyll all look the same at night and the map is worthless he slipped his damp hauberk back on then the chainmail the pain flared when it settled over the wound as did the spots where the secondhand mail had galled his shoulders he made no effort to put the surcoat back on it was too torn and dirty for even his low standards he and danilla then packed the camp in the dark loading the saddlebags and field packs both pits were carefully covered they could not conceal that they had been there but they didnt have to make it easy once they were done and ready to ride there was nothing for it but to wait for moonrise the companions stood watch trading guard while he and danilla dozed sleeping in armor proved nearly impossible as it just wasnt possible to get comfortable gonwyn had done it enough to have a leg up but his multiple hurts kept him from doing more than dozing fitfully the time passed in short naps measured by stiffness and metal digging into tender places the moon had just risen when gonwyn snapped awake how many rath he sent struggling to make the sending some thirty chosen they are close and coming this way danilla he whispered ive heard from enara she replied can we get out theyre astride our path out rath answered to him there is another body moving east of us where i think the draw comes up damn said gonwyn good water good campsite escape route we might be camping on one of their rally points what do we do danilla asked he ran the options all bad we hide wait them out rath show us the draw they quickly mounted and made for the narrow watercourse it looked intermittent and fell in a sharp vee barely wide enough for the two companions the vee fell out of the moonlight and while there was no concealment they might just be safe in the shadow they had just settled in and froze as the first group of tedrels poured in gonwyn quickly assessed them they looked whipped many bore light wounds but they were still armed in the moonlight he saw tedrels with crossbows spears and some better equipped with swords shields and some armor a second group followed in better order their leader haranguing them in the pidgin tongue that passed for the tedrel language few carried more than their war gear they took out what food they had some better provisioned than others the stronger took from the weaker where they could and the main body split into fragments as they moved to camp in mutual distrust one largish group made directly for the draw where gonwyn and the others hid he heard the soft creak as danilla drew her light bow from its case and strung it there was a soft tap as she nocked an arrow he drew his sword from its saddle scabbard the weapon slid free in his hand a shorter blade than most thicker and double edged the sword was an infantry weapon honed for killing with none of the daintiness of the cavalry saber he held it back against his leg where it was least likely to reflect some stray bit of moonlight if it comes to it he whispered stay in the draw i will draw them away and we will link up later i will not she whispered back i am a herald and i will fight there was no point to an argument and the tedrels were too close the group stopped to camp barely thirty feet from the draw there was some argument then one began to desultorily make a pile for a fire the others spread out to gnaw on what food they had one made directly for the draw gonwyn heard the soft collective inhalation from the group in the draw as the tedrel came to the mouth of the vee adjusted his crude cloth armor and began to relieve himself gonwyn held himself ready a bare dozen feet from the tedrel he could visualize the tedrel standing there staring into the darkness seeing white shapes begin to resolve against the deeper black until the mans mouth opened in a soundless o now rath launched herself powerful withers throwing them a bodys length forward gonwyn whipped the sword across the mans face slashing brutally as he passed the tedrel screamed as rath exploded into the moonlight rath broke left staying in the wellspread trees in order to make a harder crossbow shot the companion took the distance to the sprawled tedrels in a couple of strides riding a second down and whirling between two thick oaks gonwyn pressed low against her flank more for protection from low branches than from the tedrel he held the blade flat back against his boot his left hand wrapped around the saddlebow rath whipped around the larger oak changing direction to throw off the crossbowman who stumbled toward them gonwyn needed no force only aim to slash the blade outward taking the crossbowman in the throat rath took another shattering his spine with a single kick as the man tried to flee back four dead in as many seconds as rath dodged back between the pair of trees gonwyn killed another with a stab backed by half a ton of charging equine five quickly now time slowed for gonwyn he felt the simple fierce joy the power that coursed through him as his enemies seemed to slow and his senses sped he felt the man to his right grasp the claw from his belt to load his crossbow gonwyn killed him with a leaning slash that took his throat another tedrel bent to grab his spear and rath in the same parlous state smashed his chest with a kick that stove in his ribs other tedrels armed with spears and crossbows emerged from behind trees as the companion stormed among them gonwyn slipped from raths back and in perfect dance passed under her legs to stab a spearman as she lashed out with her rear hooves to dash out anothers brains he rushed two on foot the rightmost raised a battered sword gonwyn lopped his sword hand at the wrist whirled to stab the leftside tedrel who was still raising his short spear and disabled the first with single backhanded slash to the face he sprang back up and remounted in perfect choreography as rath turned again to strike out with forehooves a single odd image stood out afterward to gonwyn the droppedpot sound as the companions ironhard hooves shattered a skull and destroyed a life the moment frozen flashed into action again another crossbowman emerged ahead fumbling to bring the weapon to bear gonwyn hurled his sword it struck hilt first smashing the mans nose and knocking him backward gonwyn drew his saddleax a wicked single blade with a reverse spike he chopped down on another tedrel killing the last standing in this group with the spike driven deep into his shoulder along the neck rath charged forward to where the man lay screaming as he clutched his face rath trampled him gonwyn leaned down both palms brushing the dirt as he recovered his sword and rolled back into his saddle he turned the blowing mare toward the next group dropping the bloody ax back into its sheath a second quick grab this time at a small shield leaning against a tree he pulled it free and armed himself with it as rath danced back using the trees as cover against crossbows rath gathered herself to charge again as gonwyn finished his arming he glanced quickly to the right and saw danilla just emerging from the draw with bow in hand a string of dead or dying tedrals lay behind him one he had missed scrambled from between two trees and fled across the open area of the valley floor danilla whipped her bow up tracked him and coolly released the arrow glowed red and burst into flame as it crossed halfway to the tedrel it caught the man in the back as he fled he fell to his knees the fire spreading across him as he burned and screamed danillas second arrow took him as he writhed on the ground ending his life there was a moments perfect silence then danillas shout of exultation and rath charged together they slew as danilla rode about the fringes burning down those who escaped iron hoof and wicked blade it was done when the last tedrel lay dead gonwyn spattered with blood and exhausted slumped as he waited for danilla to join him rath stood her legs splayed out blowing heavily somewhere in the fight the stitches had broken open but that was of little concern dannila and enara rode slowly to them she looked around the carnage over thirty tedrals had entered the campsite none survived i think you do have a talent gonwyn she said in voice that shook only a little and may the gods have mercy on you chapter hearts peril kate paulk ree stretched and sighed feeling comfortable and lazy on the roof of the barn belonging to the farm where hed lived for the last ten years his family farm in a way certainly the place where his family lived with the summer sun warm against his back the warm roof shingles beneath him and the air full of the scent of growing things and farm animals it was difficult to concentrate on something as painstaking as checking the barn roof for rotting shingles much less the careful effort needed for replacing them his rattail twitched in his breeches and his claws wanted to relax all the way out but he must work it had to be done before winter came and ree was the best person to do ita hobgoblin who was part rat and part cat as well as part human he had better balance than humans and keener eyesight that the wild part of him longed to take a nap right here or to head out exploring the cool shade of the forest was something hed grown used to over the years the forest was dangerous a place where the animal hobgoblins had taken over from more normal predators it was also as familiar to ree as the farm he called home in the years since hed come here hed watched the forest slowly return to a kind of balance after the hellish changewinter and the magic circles the same magic circles that had changed him from a human street rat to the hobgoblin he was his mind wandered into times long past from the desperate days when hed saved jems life on the streets of jacona and jem in turn had saved rees humanity and perhaps his life if ree had gone on the way hed been hed soon have stopped knowing how to talk and from there to forgetting he was human at all was but a step when all you can do is run and hide you start forgetting youre not a small hunted animal and then and then you start attacking humans as animals do his meeting with jem had led them to leave jacona and head out to the countryside in which they imagined theyd be safer which just went to show how young theyd been as it turned out it had been safer but never in the way he expected jem had almost died of the coughing illness that winter as they stayed out of towns where people would kill them it was jems illness that had forced ree to come to the farm to look for help by blind luck or perhaps blind destiny theyd blundered into a farm that belonged to jems grandfather and here theyd been since ree and jem and jems grandfather and later amelie and meren jems and rees adopted children no one asked embarrassing questions about jems and rees relationship or rather the only one who asked was garrad jems grandfather and only to tease them and got a great deal of laughter out of their embarrassment and if the children called jem da and ree papa no one thought there was anything wrong with that either anywhere else their odd little family might be remarked but the people of three rivers valley had gotten to know the people at the farm for who they werefor their bravery and kindness and courage ree and jem had helped the village too many times for anyone to remark two young men much less a man and a hobgoblin shouldnt be raising children together even if one of those children was also a hobgoblin the village saw that they clearly could and were raising happy sweet children out of waifs no one else wanted ree sighed again sometimes he thought the only reason theyd taken the children on was that they had no idea how hard it could be they were good children and ree would miss them when they left for houses of their own but it was like living with your heart in someone elses body he worried every time amelie went to the village and was late returning and his heart about stopped when meren took a fall from a tree with an effort he focused on the work in front of him that one looks like its starting to go ree bent closer to the shingle close enough to sniff the wood the scent of decay was faint but there it might not be obvious now but in a month that shingle would be starting to crumble and by the time winter set in it would no longer be weatherproof he sat beside the shingle and started prying the nails loose taking care not to bend them too much good nails were expensive it was better to reuse them if you could getting them straightened by the smith down in three rivers village cost less than new nails but it was still a cost ree preferred not to pay he chuckled to himself like jem hed learned farmer thrift from old garrad the owner of this farm and jems grandfather if he was going to be honest with himself ree had learned a lot more than thrift from the old man garrad had taught him the value of work and to see himself as a man not a street child and not a change circle freak everywhere he looked ree could see the result of his work and jems the evergrowing herd of cattle goats and donkeys the fields they hired men to plough and harvest the walls of the home fields and even the prolific damncats oh they were ordinary cats but somehow the name had stuck for cats raised on this farm mostly ree suspected because the three rivers folk were convinced he could talk to them and trained them the things people would believe grown men and women talking of training cats it was the other way around he observed them recognized their calls and body language and they knew hed respond to something urgent well except for damncat the grayandwhite troublemaker with a fondness for rees shoulder that cat was smarter than most and knew it too can i help papa ree about jumped out of his fur meren might be all of four years old and part cat but he could creep up on a body like nothing else on earth not that he meant to it was just meren walked softly especially when he discarded his shoeswhich was most of the timeand he seemed to instinctively know to stay downwind the boy giggled his greenyhazel eyes lit with mischief he was an odd sight with his whiteblond curls and sparse tabby fur without the fur and the pointed ears meren could have been taken for human but as it was he was as much a hobgoblin as ree although meren had been born that way the child of two hobgoblins whod been killed by the villagers hed been taken in by ree and jem as a baby and raised to be more human than animalunlike his parents whod gone to the animal bored are you ree asked like ree meren didnt like being confined to the house at least since the dire wolf had got through the fences two years back hed stopped trying to explore the forest on his own or and ree wasnt entirely sure this wasnt the casestopped getting caught at it meren nodded da and melie are cooking an granddad said to get out from underfoot his thumb hovered near his mouth ready to go in ree eased a nail out and set it beside the others if meren was upset he sucked his thumb it happened less as the little boy got older but if something really bothered him granddad got mad didnt he ree collected the nails and handed them to his sonmaybe not the son of his body but meren was his son just as amelie an allhuman orphan he and jem had taken in was his daughter hold these for me please theyre valuable and i dont want to lose them that diverted the threatened thumb and gave meren something to feel important about while ree eased the shingle free granddad gets mad lots meren didnt sound entirely sure of himself ree nodded with his claws digging into the shingle it was a lot easier to pull it loose without disturbing any of the others can you keep a secret a proper secret he had his suspicions about what garrad had said to upset the little boy but more to the point he knew why this last winter had been hard on the old man he didnt walk much now and when he did he truly needed the walking stick jem had made him years ago meren sat straighter trying to look taller and older than he was yes papa it hurts granddad to move ree said quietly the shingle came free he set it aside and reached into the pack on his back for a fresh one started to ease it into place when granddad is hurting he gets grouchy meren tilted his head to one side chewing his bottom lip then he wasnt really mad at me nope granddad yells at everyone as ree well knew having been the recipient of garrads temper more than a few times you know that the thumbcomplete with nails clutched in that handthreatened to enter merens mouth again but granddad said i was ree chuckled he told you to go play with the damncats because youre just like them he tells me that too when hes grouchy he tells jem just about the same too it was an exaggeration but not much of one not melie though no but melie is never wild is she no meren said then paused and wrinkled his forehead on count of being a girl probably ree conceded amiably though it was more likely on account of amelie having seen her whole family massacred when she was very young could you pass me a nail please meren stared for a moment then carefully took a nail and handed it to ree oh ree wasnt sure when it had become a weekly event to have lenar and his family to dinner at the farm but sometime between the time theyd adopted meren and the time hed saved amelie from a dire wolf it had started and then by the time meren was on his feet again after the dire wolf attack it was simply accepted as something that happened like clockwork lenar might be the lord here but he was also garrads son and jems father true hed lost track of jem when jem was just a baby leaving poor jem to grow up as a street urchin but hed not done it with intent and he loved jem in his own gruff way besides the two were so alike in temper and look that they might rub wrong but couldnt avoid loving each other the three of them treasured their time together even if it almost alwaysat least until this last year and garrads illnesshad ended in all of them shouting at each other at the top of their voices on the first few visits lenars wife loylla had been uncomfortable but now she either hid it or mostly forgot that this was a plain farm and not the kind of manor shed spent her whole life in she was a cheerful daughterinlaw to garrad and though she wasnt so crass as to try to mother jem who was little younger than her she behaved to jem and ree as an older sister might their little boy a sturdy twoyearold played happily with meren whenever the family visited and lenar sometimes grumbled that the boy asked every day if he could go play wif mewen ree thought that lenar didnt really understand why little garrad couldnt come over every day either because it wasnt lenar who had to haul the little imps out ofamong other thingsthe chicken coop the water trough the barn feeding trough and every mud puddle they could find that enviable task fell to ree there wasnt a fence tree or building on the farm that meren couldnt climb and if he could help or carry little garrad with him he would which was why this warm summer night while amelie and jem laid out the table and garrad talked with lenar and loylla ree watched meren playwrestle with little garrad and made sure he was between the two little boys and the fence at least today the worst theyd suffer was grass stains on their oldest clothesworn patched clothing that was kept just so the two of them could get themselves dirty without ruining good clothing a blur of movement at the edge of his vision caught his eye and he reached out catching damncat before the grayandwhite menace could join the fun oh no you dont he held the cat close and made eye contact you want to play with them i get to trim your claws the cat might not understand the words but he understood tone and scrambled for rees shoulder instead one of the other damncatsanother gray and white with the lanky build of an animal partway between kitten and adulttook great care to groom itself as if ree thought with a wry smile it hadnt been considering joining in the play fight a little before one of damncats siring of coursedamncat sired most of the kittens at the farm these days he sired smart troublesome kittens the best hunters and mousers in the region ree suspected some of them had thumbs although hed never quite figured out which ones there were just too many damncats the warm weight of damncat leaned against his head and the cat started to purr ree reached up to scratch the animal without looking away from the rolling squealing little boys i make a terrible wild beast standing here petting a cat while minding two little boys not that anyone from outside the valley would realize that was what he was doing theyd think i was watching my dinner and playing with my snack ree jem called from the back door dinners about ready ill get the boys in he shouted back he and jem shared all the farm chores between them these days what with amelie spending each morning at the manor learning how to be a lady and meren too young to help much but when it came to herding small boys ree had the advantage over jem lacking the familys quick temper moving carefully so he didnt throw damncats balance off ree bent and grabbed the straps of a small pair of overalls and hauled the wearer out little garrad halfway through a pretend wild animal growl meren started to protest but stopped when he saw where his playmate was safely held in merens papas arms time to wash up and get into your good clothes boys come along now shepherding two little boys was a lot more difficult than dealing with the goats or the cows ree had learned it got worse the older the boys got he hoped theyd start getting more sense before he couldnt keep up with them having to climb to the farm roof once or twice a day was one thing having to do that and save the goats from boys who wanted to ride them and race them was something else again still he got them washed and into their good clothespants and shirts although they both went barefoot it wasnt worth trying to keep meren in his shoes in summer and trying to get little garrad to do something meren wouldnt well that one had the full measure of his fathers stubborn streak he even managed to get the two sets of blond curls tamed and turn the pair of them over to jem with time to get himself changed everyone else was at the table when ree entered theyd set it up with the best tablecloth and the best plates and all and melie had arranged some flowers from the garden in a bright blue vase shed bought at the three rivers fair it might not be a proper feast but it looked right homey to ree he smiled and took his seat nodding to lenar and loylla did anything come of that last message you sent back east about being confirmed as a lord lenar chuckled either im not that important or some clerk is having fits he shrugged it doesnt matter that much so long as the taxes go in ive got the records and the receipts from karelshill so any investigation is going to look someplace else he covered his wifes hand with his much larger one the empires pretty flexible ree if it works and the taxes keep coming no ones going to argue with my position ree nodded and didnt argue lenar had been a soldier before coming back to his old home with enough gold to build himself a manor and he knew how the nobles and all did things it would be nice to know lenar was properly the local lord but if he didnt think it mattered it wasnt rees part to argue conversation ebbed and flowed while they ate loylla mentioning how fast amelie learned and how eager she was to know everything she needed to know and ree giving jem a look that said he knew amelie was learning as fast as she could so she didnt have to be at the manor house not that she disliked lenar or loylla but she loved being at the farm looking after her flower garden feeding the animals and milking the goats lenar lamented how fast little garrad was growinghed learned to feed himself well enough that he didnt need someone to help him and he didnt even get too much on his face although the food on his plate was mostly cut small enough for little fingers and didnt have any gravy or sauces a child could smear himself withand jem agreed complaining that theyd had to let down the legs of merens overalls again so they were long enough to be decent and he didnt think theyd last until the tailor came through to take orders for the next years clothes oh theres been some bad hobgoblin problems in karelshill lenar said after ree had taken both boys upstairs to sleep it might still be full light outside but small boys needed a lot of sleep jem raised an eyebrow he was looking more and more like his father a bit less weathered and without the beard but still attacks or just sightings there werent as many hobgoblins these days but the ones that could breed did and some of them were vicious ree still needed to patrol the forest although since hed had to start patrolling on his own he never went out without a weapon the snow bears and dire wolves were the worst lenar sighed attacks son bad ones he nodded in rees direction and got the frown that said that he was worried about ree his voice boomed too which is how you knew that lenar cared he cared enough to yell at you you be careful out there you hear dont want anyone getting the wrong idea about you being like them what i hear is that somethings organizing them using them to attack maybe softening them up for something else ree winced that would take magic wouldnt it his tail twitched and whipped against his leg most of the time his tail was just fine down one pants leg but when he was worried it tried to lash and made it look as though he had a snake trapped in there lenar scratched his beard thats what i hear im not so sure i mean no offense ree but say someone like you only with bad intentions got hold of some cubs you could raise yourself a hobgoblin army that way jem made a sound of protest but stopped at garrads soft hes right jem aint nothing that says being mostly human means being good ree nodded yeah i know there had been too many nights when hed lain awake wondering whether he was human and what part of him made him fit to be with full humans and some nights he was sure he wasnt sure he wasnt good enough to deserve someone like jem who could have had anyone he wanted it wouldnt even have to be a hobgoblin garrad said it could be someone who didnt have any reason to care about other people you wouldnt even need to be a hobgoblin to do that although it would be harder humans can stop being human too you know i think i might have a bit before you and jem came he added quietly rees claws unsheathed and he tapped the tablecloth with them how much damage was done no one dead yet lenar said theres been some stock taken and a few injuries he didnt look happy the problem is there are plenty of people who remember a hobgoblin king who came from up this way damn that ruse a trick ree had used to frighten soldiers away had come back to bite more than once it didnt matter that he hadnt been able to think of any other way to get the soldiers to leave and not come backand they hadnt come back so ree supposed hed scared them good it had worked but hed still left himself with a nasty mess that didnt ever go away the warmth of jems hand on his didnt help sometimes he had to remember there were other people and other places outside their special protected relationship i dont suppose you could tell them the hobgoblin king isnt happy about this but these creatures arent his or in his territory it wasnt a questionree knew very well lenar wouldnt be able to convince anyone of that ive tried lenar said making ree blink with surprise lenar had tried lenar laughed a little at rees expression of course i tried son i want to keep you from trouble if i can and jem too of course only im not a diplomat im just an old soldier who got into more than he planned for ree nodded well life like raising children was trouble wasnt it but it had his compensations he squeezed jems hand gently making sure his claws werent unsheathed the sun was setting when jem climbed up to the attic bedroom to fetch little garrad he returned soon after grimfaced theyre not there how they never came through here no jem said his mouth set they opened the roof hatch and got out through it you know meren did that last week down the rain pipe to the shed roof and down the shed roof to the chicken house where hed tried to collect the eggs only got the wrong ones the poor broody hen would never recover from the shock ree swallowed he half stood before he even thought of the words his mouth was dry the trouble those two could get into it didnt bear thinking if he was lucky hed just find them trying to ride one of the goats or driving the cow to distraction if he wasnt lucky ill check the outhouse maybe one of them had to go and at this time of year neither of them would use the chamberpot not that ree blamed them he preferred the outhouse even in the cold of winter he wouldnt blame them for not coming through here either because garrad was as likely to yell at them as not in the mood hed been he doubted hed find either child in the outhouse truth be told there were much more interesting things to do and places to go than the outhouse but they might have gone there first and there was a good chance of catching a scent besides he didnt want to see lenars expression or hear anything lenar said his face had clouded when jem said that meren had got out that way before ree didnt want to know if he was mad at them for not telling him or mad at meren and he didnt want anyone to be mad at meren meren was no more mischievous than any other fouryearold but taking little garrad with him that was new normally when they were in bed they stayed in bed talking and giggling in halfintelligible babylanguage until they fell asleep ree snatched the belt with his hunting knife and the slingshot on his way out the leanto then paused to scan the ground there wasnt anything obvious but he hadnt expected anything neither child was heavy enough to leave much of an impression on thick grass the outhouse was empty with no trace of either childs scentor at least none that ree could determine under the overpowering outhouse smell from there he circled the house to where the air hatch on the roof was propped open theyd open that in summer to let breezes through and keep the house from getting too hot during the day but it was closed at night to keep insects out ree had closed both the hatches when hed put the boys to bed his throat tightened threatening to choke him and realized lenar was keeping pace with him ill tan that boys hide so hard he wont sit down for a week lenar growled he knows hes to stay in bed once hes put there and following that damn hobg he stopped but his glare said everything his voice didnt ree didnt say anything how could he lenar had to be as worried as ree maybe more sometimes ree caught lenar looking at jem as though hed never really forgiven himself for losing jem rather than worry at lenars anger ree traced the line of the roof with his eyes to the leanto and the stone wall butting against it oh yes an agile little boy could get to that wall without any difficulty and walk along it too until he got to one of the trees with branches hanging over the walls where he could climb to the ground the question was which one ree hurried over to the walland jumped up he bent to the stone to sniff they came this way neither boy had been wearing shoesfor once ree blessed their dislike of footwear once ree wouldnt have hesitated to drop to all fours to scurry along that wall but he wasnt agile enough for that any more and besides he tried to set the right example for meren he tried not to think about proving to lenar that he was more human than animal if he said anything now he wouldnt like the answer lenar walked beside the wall cursing in language fit to raise the dead it certainly made rees fur want to stand on end jem joined his father quiet but just as grimfaced ree walked so he wouldnt miss seeing anything even though he wanted to run if he ran like he wanted to he could take the wrong fence because he didnt know which way the children had gone a cat screamed in the forest ree didnt make any conscious decisions in the time it took for the sound to fade he was running along the wall aware of jem and lenar sprinting alongside him on the ground and damncats converging from every direction the cats moved ahead of them in a multicolored furry tide responding to the distress of one of their own where the wall ended ree jumped off and followed the cats into the forest jem and lenar didnt take long to catch up with him they didnt say anything not that theyd be heard over the caterwauling that echoed up ahead and under it growls not merens growl and no human screams did that mean the boys were already rees stomach lurched and he wrenched his mind away from the thought the damn boy knew the forest was dangerous why had he come out here a cats death scream then merens growl shrill and childish but dangerous too hed growled like that when hed saved amelie from a dire wolf ree raced around a massive oak and all but ran into two snow bears one batting ineffectually at the snarling cats attacking it the other it was covered with cats as well as though every damncat on the farm had come after the bears meren clung to the tree his weight held by the claws of one hand and both feet little garrad was wedged into the space between meren and tree while meren clawed and snarled at the attacking bear the bear that seemed to be fighting its own body as it reached for the child ree caught the first bears fur and used that to swing himself between the other bear and the children if the bear hadnt been injuredor if the other one hadnt been trying to fight off the damncats the way this one should have beenboth boys would be dead lenar pushed him out of the way practically crushing him against the tree get the boys out of here ree didnt argue he scrambled up the tree trunk to the first branching far enough above the bears reach to be safe then leaned down extended one hand garrad come to uncle ree it took an effort of will to keep his claws in with the bears and the cats and the smell of blood come on neither child seemed to notice a bear screamed dying ree dug his toe claws and the claws of his other hand in and leaned lower and lower until he could get hold of garrads shirt come on little man hold onto me he pulled praying that the shirt wouldnt tear that he wouldnt lose his grip another bear roar and hot breath against his arm ree didnt dare try to look he wasnt entirely sure how he managed it but a flurry of small limbs and some needlesharp little claws later ree sat on the branch with his back against the bole of the old oak and meren and little garrad trembling in his arms he didnt try to move or look just held the boys close there was a meaty sound then something hit the ground hard and ree heard scurrying and distressed meowing the lament in the cats cries made rees eyes burn well lenar sounded grim now we know something is using magic meren whimpered and tried to bury himself in rees shirt it took a while to get the boys calm enough that ree could hand them down to lenar and jem by then lenar had dragged the dead bears far enough away that they wouldnt attract any unwanted attention and jem had lined up the sad little bodies of three of the damncats more than a few of the other cats were hurt but they werent letting jem get close getting back to the farm just gave ree more reasons to worry little garrad was acting like any small boy whod just had the fright of his life but meren didnt seem to be well there he wasnt crying wasnt screaming he just lay limply in jems arms and stared at something no one else could see it was full dark by the time they got in and loylla was pacing the kitchen looking pale and frightened but shed boiled up water and had bandages out in case they were needed and she didnt hesitate when she saw lenar and little garrad just ran to them and embraced them both without a care for the blood spattered over lenars shirt no ones hurt jem hastened to reassure her is granddad all right im perfectly well and you neednt treat me like an invalid garrads voice was strong enough coming from the main room it was the damndest thing father lenar shook his head he strode into the main room and let everyone else trail after him all of them headed for the forest straight for the boys and they all attacked two bears the old man paled two they never come this close in summer something was controlling them jem said ree didnt want to hear this discussion and he was worried about meren he pulled the boy from jems arms and said ill be outside with meren no one argued ree spoke softly as he carried meren outside were just glad youre safe meren thats all you two scared us running off like that merens hands clenched tight into rees shirt and he shuddered the damncatsit looked like all of themwaited outside ree found himself needing to sit and was crosslegged on the grass before he realized that he hadnt decided to sit down cats were nuzzling meren making the little chirpcomfort sounds mother cats made with their kittens merens sounds were sadder remorseful ree would have sworn the cats were reassuring the boy telling him somehow that dying happens and the cats whod died had died well whatever it was it seemed to help because meren shuddered again then started to cry with words ree the sound came from behind ree and for once lenar sounded uncertain i guess i owe meren an apology it was little garrad who opened the air hatch and climbed out meren followed him but didnt catch up until hed gotten to the oak and then the bears came he made a sound ree couldnt interpret hes too scared to say more but im sorry i said harsh things i didnt mean its just you know i lost jem for all of his childhood and so many bad things happened to him losing little garrad might kill me i cant watch him all the time merens body relaxed a little but not all the way he couldnt understand all the words ree was sure but hed understand lenars tone and he almost for sure would understand the hand on his head and lenars voice saying softly thank you for saving my boy ree waited till lenar left he was thinking of the cats running like a furry tide attacking deadly foes to save the boys he didnt know much but he knew that meren didnt have the woodcraft to follow anyone yeah he could follow a scent but he didnt have enough experience to do it like that in the woods if hed been that far behind little garrad the cats told you garrad was going to the forest didnt they he asked no meren whispered but it was a wavering no lacking conviction they cant talk to me im not an animal ree held him tighter youre not an animal he said some humans can talk to creatures ree had read something about it once the cats told you there was a long shuddering sigh and then yes i was asleep damncat told me in my mind a long silence i didnt want to but youre scared we wont want you because of it ree knew that feeling too welland if meren could understand the damncats that way without words then he could understand ree and that that wasnt something ree wanted to really think about if he knew how scared ree was all the time it would be hard for ree to appear calmly confident another nod a bit shakier this time ree pulled meren closer hugged him tightly its just something you do not something you are being human is here he touched merens chest over the heart and tried to believe that as hard as he could to believe that meren having this strange gift was just well it was like mages had their gift that was all maybe it was an odd kind of magic but it didnt make meren less human for having it having gifts is all on how you use it this one saved you and garrad tonight that makes it good finally meren relaxed fank you papa the words were mumbled around a fiercely sucked thumb damncat strutted over he gave meren a headbutt then rubbed against rees leg yes you and yours did well too ree scratched the cat behind the ears and smiled everything would be all right these vessels hed put his heart into would break it again and again and again but somehow it would emerge stronger from each break human hearts did chapter hearts place sarah a hoyt ree watched and tried to keep his stomach from knotting up while lenars mage examined meren the mage was a decent enough fellow and he wasnt going to do anything like denounce the boy not here it was just after the magic circles ree had never really trusted magic magic had made him a hobgoblin after all complete with a coat of sleek brown fur and claws that retracted like a cats and a ratlike tail which was wrapped around one leg inside his pants that same magic had given meren a coat of sparse tabby fur in addition to his whiteblond curls and who knew what else and that ree reminded himself forcefully was why the mage was here you couldnt pretend that something like being able to broadcast what you were feeling to all the damncats was just a coincidence and with the controlled hobgoblins attacking more often it was better to have lenars mage make sure that his lords adopted grandson couldnt possibly be controlling the hobgoblins and never mind that those same controlled hobgoblins had attacked the child last summer scared people didnt think about things like that they got themselves worked up and went after anything that was different that was one of the reasons ree didnt go down to three rivers village muchwhile people respected him and knew hed help them whenever they needed and get hurt for them too it was better not to remind them just how different he was the mage leaned back with a sigh and his eyes focused again meren drooped whatever the mage had been doing had tired him out ill just get meren to bed then ill be with you ree said with jem walking amelie to the manor to spend the night thereostensibly to keep little garrad company but more because lenars wife was near to term and not really able to keep up with her sonand old garrad barely able to move ree was the only ablebodied person on the farm right now the mage nodded thank you a little later with meren not even protesting about being put to bed for a daytime nap and asleep before ree had pulled the covers over ree returned to the kitchen and filled a bowl with the stew that was always warming on the stove here he handed the bowl to the mage i heard tell you get hungry after magic thank you again the mageree could never remember his namewas one of those people who looked so ordinary you forgot them as soon as you met them not that ree would have been surprised to find that the mage helped that impression a bit with magic it had to be a powerful advantage to a mage to be overlooked and even forgotten well the mage said after hed eaten some your son isnt a mage nor will he be he does have an unusual gift something ive seen only once before if the man had seen it before that was better than completely weird ree told his stomach to untie itself and he made himself ask when was that the mage smiled faintly oh that was long ago in the army i was posted down south a way and the tribes there had these people they called beastmasters who they claimed could speak with any animal without words he shrugged the way our horses behaved around them i got to thinking it wasnt just one of those myths that grow up when someone knows animals really well ree nodded he knew about those since he was at the center of a fair few of them him and the damncatswho maybe werent quite as ordinary as hed thought after id got friendly with one of their beastmasters we each looked at the other with our giftsits a sort of compliment to actually open yourself to someone elses probing that wayand well what he had was just like what your son has so its a human gift just very rare now ree had to throttle hope something human something a mage had seen before that meant that meren was human enough to maybe be accepted that way even if he didnt look it the mage finished eating before he nodded exactly its probably not fully developed yet these things usually dont start showing up until puberty although they can manifest early under enough stress meren had seen enough stress in his short life for something like that to happen what with being born to parents who couldnt keep themselves fed much less their babyand had gotten desperate and raided the village fields getting themselves killed in the processnot to mention two neardeath encounters with hobgoblins is there any way to teach him how to well not get caught in it teaching a little boy to use something he couldnt feel wasnt exactly rees idea of fun but it had to be done meren needed to be able to tell what was inside his head and what wasnt even if meren didnt want to learn the mage smiled oh thats part of why hes so tired i took the liberty of giving him some basic shielding and showing him how to use it its close enough to the way magic works that it should keep him out of troublewell out of too much troublefor a while ree couldnt help smiling you couldnt keep a child merens age completely out of trouble at that age they attracted it like flies to honey thank you i appreciate that what the mage had left unsaidthat meren would need to learn more about his strange gift when he got olderwas something ree figured could wait for a while there was no point borrowing trouble when trouble came to visit regularly anyhow oh its my pleasure the mage stood and extended his right hand ill be happy to testify for you or your son if theres ever a need that offer was enough to make ree blink so his eyes wouldnt blur hobgoblins were killed on sight unless they had a license and were properly controlledwhich usually meant a cage or a leash here he and meren were exceptions but that was mostly because of lenar lenar being old garrads son the local lord and jems father meant that ree was family and hed made it clear he considered ree and meren equal members of that family what would happen without that in the future ree didnt want to think about it i really appreciate that he said softly thank you if it came to a court him not being human meant he couldnt say anything to defend himself meren too it was something ree mostly pushed to a dark corner of his mind even forgot about for a while but sometimes especially with garrad the way he was his and merens situation was so precarious so different from anything else anywhere in the world that any major change in the arrangement of their life could be a disaster no one dared defy garrad and garrad had lenars ear but if that were to change this farm and the valley were home now ree didnt think he could bear it if he had to leave with the shorter days of winter lenar had taken to making his weekly visit around the middle of the day so he need not ride home in the dark that suited ree just fine the chores were mostly morning and evening work this time of year with the days he wasnt patrolling the forest spent either repairing things that had been set aside to be fixed when there was time or helping garrad move from bed to chair or chair to pot the outhouse wasnt an option for the old man anymore not when it hurt him so much to take the few steps between his bed and the chair in the main room he only came into the kitchen for meals but if anyone but ree tried to help him theyd get their head bitten off for being damn busybodies ree suspected it was because he didnt offer sympathy and he didnt make a fuss of the old man he just did what had to be done garrad might be sick and his body failing him but that didnt mean he didnt still have his pride that pride was very much evident when he received his son this morning garrad was sitting in his chair in the main room combed and shaved and wearing clean clothes and keeping the pain out of his face as much as he could and doing his best to pretend jem wasnt hovering anxiously around the room pretending to straighten things that didnt need straightening and looking anxiously at garrad out the corner of his eye garrad would not acknowledge his grandsons anxiety he would keep his dignity till the end good to see you boy he told lenar then he turned to ree and said ree theres a rolled paper in the drawer beside my bed ill be wanting that now ree just nodded ill be right back the paper was where garrad had said new paper carefully rolled and tied with a scrap of bright yellow fabric ree recognized as the stuff theyd used for amelies best apron this year he closed the drawer and returned to the main room at the door ree paused struck by the resemblance between garrad lenar and jem they were grandfather father and son but they could have been the same man at different ages looking at them like this you had to look closely at jem to notice his eyes were rounder in shape and his mouth slightly softerat least when he wasnt in full family stubborn lenars hair was darker than jems but not much and garrads was all white and thinner now rees heart tightened when he looked at garrad like this and saw something else shadowed on the old man something you couldnt fight and couldnt beat one day jem too would be like this and the only longing in rees heart unbearable and demanding was to still be allowed to be near then to spend his life with jem he didnt think he could stand to leave to lose jem garrad nodded when ree gave him the paper lenar youll be wanting to keep this safe i reckon youll be needing it afore spring lenar blinked looking blank as though he had no notion what had gotten into his father this time he untied the fabric and unrolled the paper his face went slack for a moment thenwhen he looked uphe looked much younger younger than jem even oh no dad youre too damn stubborn to die ree didnt want to look at him to see the hurt the realization that his father was human and fading that garrad and lenar and jem too werent going to go on forever garrad chuckled dont you pull that with me boy i aint some fool woman to be soothed by pretty words granddad jem didnt get any further his voice broke in a way that said he was fighting tears there are healers that father i is there anything that can help is there any now lenar sounded lost that big booming voice faint and almost childlike none of that now garrad wagged a bony finger im old aint no healer can fix that nor no mage neither his expression softened the fierce light in his eyes fading a little he looked back at lenar id have been ten years gone if not for jem and ree theyve been good years i aint denying that but i can feel them as went before calling for me telling me its my time ree nodded slowly hed tried to pretend otherwise but hed known for a while now somewhere deep down that garrad didnt have long he hadnt wanted to believe it either lenars stricken look cut ree deep he might have been a soldier for the empire led his men in more than one battle and seen enough death to make ree cringe but it was obvious that lenar had never once thought his own father might be dying just read it son read it then keep it safe until its needed garrad got that odd light in his face and chuckled i figure you can argue better once you know what ive got there beside ree jems hand clenched tight into a fist and his face went stony its a will isnt it why didnt you say anything to us to me why didnt you tell us you were doing this why it wasntquitean accusation but ree could hear the hurt under it he set his hand on jems but he didnt say anything this wasnt his argument what garrad wanted to do with his property was garrads business he supposed it would go to lenar and in the fullness of time to jem meanwhile ree didnt want to consider that he wondered if he and meren could claim a corner of the forest and build a willow shelter garrad all but crowed thats one for me lad i aint said anything cause its got to be done proper and i wasnt going to get anyones hopes up so no hopes up which meant ree and jem he wouldnt couldnt finish the thought he wouldnt resent garrad either after all the man had given him shelter and home and family more than anyone had ever done for ree garrad nodded in lenars direction thats why its got to go through your father first lenar set the paper down again he looked troubled there were vertical lines between his eyes it cant he said in a strained voice imperial law you cant leave anything to ree or meren what jem about exploded across the room glaring at his father imperial law can go hang itself if granddad wants to leave this whole place to ree he can ree was too shocked to think he stared unmoving waiting for lenars roar it didnt come lenar made an odd distressed sound and hunched into himself like a child caught with his hand in the honey im sorry jem i dont like it either but ive been confirmed herethe message came yesterdayand i have to follow imperial laws even when theyre wrong jem demanded lenar only nodded looking miserable and lost even ree cleared his throat look you no one needs to why why cant you leave the place to jem and jem jem is my heir lenar said booming the last word his gaze told his son that he wasnt going to hear any argument on that and jem though his lip curled as if to make a scathing remark kept quiet the farm he can inherit the farm but hell have a lot more to look after hell have to do his army duty or go to court or he stopped but jem didnt say anything nor did ree theyd both assumed for a while it would be that way if jem was the son of a lord hed need to get known as such in the outer world ree understood what wasnt being said ree could not go with jem when he wentnot unless he was willing to go on a leash or in a cageand lots of things could happen when people were separated even asgoodasmarried people hell even married people like what had happened with lenar and jems mother as though to underscore it lenar said softly youre both so young which ree took to mean that they couldnt possibly know what they wanted for the rest of their lives garrad made a clucking sound that usually meant hed just heard something nonsensical which ree took a little comfort in but not too much because garrad said life is unpredictable and things happen look at me with two boys and a wife and then left all alone all those years if anything happens i want ree to be safe and meren they cant go to the army or to court they cant find their own ways they have to know there will always be this but father no buts garrad said with more than a hint of his old strengthand all of his stubbornness this way no one can argue about jem and ree living in the same house his eyes gleamed warning ree he was going to tease someone aint anyone elses business whether theyre sleeping in separate beds or not jem groaned and blushed fiery red and ree tried not to wince lenar didnt react at allwhich was so unlike him he had to be really worried father the law says i cant i could be wrong here but arent you allowed to make extra laws for things that affect just your lands ree tried not to look appalled at himself hed just blurted out something hed half thought about and now it wasnt just lenar who stared at him garrad and jem were both looking as if ree had had a litter of kittens or grown an extra head his face heated and he fought the urge to curl up and hide it was just as well his face fur hid his blushes he fell silent go on ree lenar said in the kind of grave voice that could give way to an explosion at the drop of a hat ree tried to collect his thoughts what was the saying but hed heard something about what was called particular laws the empire was so big no one person could know what was needed in every little pocket of it at any given time and lenar might think ree was daring too much and taking his inheritance and jems too but lenar didnt look upset and might as well hang for a cow as a chicken ree figured he was headed for the whole herd i thought the lord gets to make extra laws so long as they dont break the empires laws so you cant make a law that says meren and me dont have to be listed as safe hobgoblins but you can make one that says if weor any other hobgoblinpass some kind of test were human in your lands and get to be treated that way ree couldnt remember where hed learned all of that but he thought it was maybe bits and pieces hed heard over the years lenar and jem talked sometimesand garrad toowhen ree was clearing the kitchen or putting the children to bed and given the familys tendency to shout hed heard just about everything he was pretty sure lenar was the one whod mentioned the particular laws though although he hadnt been talking about anything to do with hobgoblins then lenar looked as though hed been hit and hadnt got to falling over yet you know he said slowly that just might be possible id have to speak to a few people about it but it could work you do that garrad wasnt making suggestions they were orders i aint changing a thing lenar sighed and shook his head wait and see father i dont know if this will work yet he turned to jem and ree this damn fool old man wants to leave you two the farmboth of you but jem frowned shouldnt it be going to you i mean youre granddads heir and all that ree squeezed jems hand it was so like him to argue for lenar and against himself ree felt tears prickle in his eyes your fathers got more than he needs garrad said with a chuckle besides he can take his pick of anything he wants that was here before you two arrived so long as he can carry it out in other words the things that might mean something to lenar like the portrait of the family painted back when lenar had been young that made sense to ree jem stopped bristling quite so much although the set of his jaw said thered better not be anything else upsetting in garrads will im glad the farm is going to you two actually lenar said it might have been home once but its your work thats made it what it is now and dads right i do have more than i need he chuckled softly besides i think its a good idea what he wants which meant there was more in the paper than lenar had revealed so far it seems to me that a place where the folks as havent got anyplace else can be welcome is a good thing garrad said into the silence he gestured to jem with a bony hand you and ree took a hell of a risk coming into the farm when you did aint no doubt if id been well id have met you with a pitchfork his expression softened and he smiled you two showed me theres more to good than being human seems to me theres others out there as could use the same chance ree swallowed and ducked his head to hide the way his eyes burned hed wondered more times than he wanted to count if merens parents could have been saved could have learned to be human again after all meren was as human as ree or more maybe all theyd needed was somewhere that gave them a chance to be human and maybe not too that was the hardest thing ree didnt know after you two it goes to meren lenar said softly if he doesnt have any childrenadopted or otherwisethe farm comes back to my family but its got to stay a sanctuary he smiled and ree realized that lenars eyes were too bright too shiny if i can get the two of you able to own property im all for it ree didnt go to the manor oftenhe kept himself to the farm and the forest mostly so he didnt unnerve people today was different today was the ceremony lenar had concocted to make him human not that ree had any illusions about it hed still be killed on sight anyplace outside this valley but here hed be officially human and able to do all the things any other man could do at least unless lenars lord or his or further up all the way to emperor melles himself said otherwise to hear lenar tell it that didnt happen unless a lord started abusing his people the important thing was once something like this started it was hard to take it away people would get used to the idea that hobgoblins could take a test and become officially humanalthough ree didnt have any idea what was in the test lenar had said it was better that way and for official things it was better to trust that lenar was right which was why ree walked up to the manor in his best clothes with his tail wrapped tight around his left leg and his stomach wrapped even tighter into knots that made him wish he hadnt eaten before he left the farm the thick wooden gates stood open with two men watching the stream of people coming in it looked to ree as if everyone in the valley had taken advantage of a fine winters day to come see what would happen that was a good thing it was just that rees stomach didnt agree he recognized both the guards theyd been village boys once among the ones hed helped free from rogue soldiers years ago now they looked every inch the real soldier but they both waved to ree and smiled inside the manors great halla big lowceilinged room that could fit everyone in three rivers with space to sparewas filling up fast ree couldnt help wondering how many had come to see garrads hobgoblin perform and how many actually cared about him he didnt let any of that show he just walked through the crowd to the front of the room where lenar had a solid chair a chest to hold important documents and a guard watching the people the guard nodded to reehe was another of the young men ree had helped saveand gestured to a spot to the right of lenars official chair it was far too plain to be called a throne ree took his place there and tried not to let his nervousness show this was all hed been told to come to the hall and stand where he was told he should have worn a hat at least then hed have something to do with his hands he couldnt have said whether it was better that he couldnt hear the words in the buzz of whispered conversation but at least this way he didnt hear anything he didnt like ree hadnt tried to find out what lenar was telling people about todays ceremony he figured it would be enough to get people to come to see without letting them know too much the more people who saw this the better according to lenar that way theyd be talking about it as a good thing before the official documents started their long trail through imperial bureaucracy fortunately he didnt have to wait long lenar must have been watching for his arrival because he walked out from a side door hed obviously chosen to make a point he was wearing a red silk shirt and a cloak of snowbear fur his cloak pin was the imperial crest and it glittered as though it was worked in gemstones and precious metal people fell silent the hush cascading through the hall as people whod noticed him elbowed their neighbors and pointed the ceremony itself went by in a kind of blur for ree he read a passage from a book hed never seen before then swore an oath of loyalty to the empire and its local representativenamely lenar the rest of the test was to explain what the oath meant ree thought he managed that well enough after that lenars mage came forward and lenar announced that the mage would examine the applicant that made sure no ones attention went wandering three rivers had never been big enough for a mage even before the magic storms and most people had never seen a mage actually do magic the thought didnt make his stomach rest any easier the mage smiled and whispered relax this is going to make you feel strange but it wont hurt that wasnt what ree was worried about what if he didnt if he wasnt no hed deal with whatever the mage found when he found it he took a deep breath and nodded im ready he spoke loudly enough for his voice to carry and if it shook a bit well that was to be expected for something as important as this the mage must have been waiting for him to speak because he made a complicated gesture and everything went odd the hall and everyone in it seemed to be a long way away or maybe it was ree who was a long way away and there was a pressure on his mind not really doing anything there just looking he fought down the instinctive desire to push that pressure away and make it leave him alone it had to be the mage doing whatever it was he was supposed to be doing the pressure moved and ree found himself remembering things hed thought long forgotten the smell of jacona in the summer clutching his mothers skirt at a fair and watching a mage make lights spark from peoples fingers the cold and hunger and fear that never went away when hed lived on the streets of jacona running from larger boys hiding and hoping they wouldnt find him hating that they were bigger and stronger than him the magic circle with its blur of pain and the screams that had started as two animals and him and became just him and the fur that kept him warm after that the claws that made it so much easier to catch food and escape gangs at least until the searches started and the street rats got rounded up and taken away losing what it was to be human bit by bit until he found jem and jem brought him back to life made him human again then the weird distance went away and the pressure was gone and he was back in the hall with the mage saying something to lenar that rees ears rang too much to hear his face fur was damp whatever the mage said it must have been good because lenar smiled and came over to shake rees hand welcome to the empire he gave ree a parchment certificate that had to have been done up before the ceremony the certificate didnt say anything about whether ree was human or not instead it said that lenar had examined him and made him a citizen of the empire there was other legaltype wording there that as ree understood it gave him the same rightsand responsibilitiesas someone born and still human thank you my lord that wasnt a title ree usually used but here now it felt right he heard a soft harumph of approval from behind him and turning around saw that garrad was there hed had two sturdy lads carry him up on a litter and he was sitting straight on the chair in the litter holding his stick his eyes glittered when ree went to him he found himself pulled into an embrace by the elderly mans frail arm welcome to the family heir the old man said softly they buried garrad on a bright day when the snow crunched underfoot and the wind was quiet ree jem and lenar had spent the day before digging beside garrads longdead wifes grave sharing memories and being grateful that in the end hed gone peacefully in his sleep ree didnt say but he figured the old man had held on until he knew his home would pass on the way he wanted it to then stopped fighting the call of all those whod passed before when youd outlived most of the folk youd known it must get lonely he wanted to find a quiet corner to grieve but with jem and lenar both barely holding togetheroh they were being strong and familystubborn about it but ree could see how brittle their control wasit fell to ree to arrange everything and make sure jem was too busy to let go until after the burial when theyd have a bit of time to themselves to sort out life without the old man he suspected loylla would have helped only she wasnt able to get about and wouldnt be for a while yet it was the people that surprised him people hed once told off for ignoring that an irritable old mans chimney had been smokeless for days people garrad had once had no use for men stopped by the farm with wrapped pots of stew or haunches of beef and helped with the chores without anyone saying anything then wouldnt let ree or jem thank them and now they trudged up the path to the farm men women and children all of them in their best clothes even the mayor and they seemed to ree to be well to mean it lenars priest gave a short speech mostly asking any gods that might be listening to help garrads soul get where it was supposed to be ree supposed that was the way the army priests did it because there were so many different religions and gods in the army that you couldnt pick any one set of them without offending most of the men you were ministering to after they lowered garrads bodywrapped in an old sheet ree and jem had sewn into a shroudinto the ground then all the men helped fill the grave ree tried not to look at the soil falling tried not to think about garrad down there it felt as though they must be hurting garrad as though they were suffocating him in the black loamy dirt but it wasnt true wherever the old man was he wasnt there that was just a shell like summer scritchbugs left when they grew garrad had grown and gone elsewhere with his wife and his brother and there hopefully all the hard binding of the old shell was gone and he was free and young again the men packed the soil tight tamping it down with the backs of their shovels then everyone helped to clean up before they left and that was that it was quiet and simple and there wasnt any fuss but somehow ree was comforted by all those people coming to help the house seemed terribly empty after everyone had left with just him and jem and ameliesniffling a bit but not actually cryingand meren no one said anything just they all wanted comfort and they all held each other standing in front of the fireplace dont think i dont know what this is doing to you jem said roughly dont you ever think i dont appreciate you ree hadnt even considered that hed just been doing what had to be done that jem wanted him preferred him over any of the village girls that was a daily miracle meren tugged at his pants ree bent to lift the boy and set him against his hip merens face fur was so wet it lay flat against his skin amelie tried to wipe her eyes with a soaked handkerchief then gave up and rubbed her arm against her face ree held them all as tight as he could feeling the weight of his family even more now not that jem didnt do as much as he but right now well that was how it was if he wasnt fit for something jem carried the weight shared between them it wasnt that muchcome on he said in a voice that only shook a little bit we should get dinner theres enough left from what folks brought that we neednt cook theyd get better after a while it wouldnt hurt so much to look at the spot where garrad wasnt and maybe theyd even be able to laugh again and smile when they remembered him later in a month or two he and jem would move into garrads room and give amelie their old room she was getting too old and too much of a lady to sleep in the attic separated by only a thin partition from merens room later there would be other challenges the children would grow and perhaps there would be other children who didnt have any place to go later jem would go away to do his duty by his emperor in one way or another and he would come back ree looked between his lashes at jem yes he would come back one way or another because this was his hearts place maybe his affections would change who could tell that but he would never deny ree this place theyd built together and if he did ree would make him see he was wrong and if someone enemy soldier or courtier tried to keep jem away from home ree would go and get him no matter what the peril or the suffering garrad would want that hed want them to be his family stubborn beyond reason and too damn pigheaded to give up when they were beat and loving and caring for those who needed it too it was a good legacy to leave chapter family matters tanya huff as theres no need to wait for a reply from verain youll have time to stop by and visit your grandmother before you head back to haven ryal verains holding wasnt far from the forest settlement where jors had been raised and where most of his extended family still lived but the dean of the heralds collegium did not assign heralds the task of visiting their grandmothers sir shes not likely to live forever you know the deans lips twitched the movement nearly but not quite hidden by his beard and at her age shed rather not go another two years without seeing you sir she was quite insistent i do something about that in the letter also your cousin he pulled a much folded and raggededged piece of vellum off a pile on his desk held it at arms length and frowned your cousins daughter at any rate annamarin could benefit from your experience what particular experience she doesnt say my grandmother jors shook his head trying to get the words to settle into an order that made actual sense my grandmother wrote you a letter herald jennet picked it up when she stopped by on her last circuit the vellum flopped limply as the dean waved it and jors thought he saw the faded lines of old accounts on the back from the sound of it quite insistent is a fairly good general description of your grandmother sitting back in his chair the dean looked measuringly up at jors his dark eyes narrowed is there a reason you havent been to see your family in almost two years herald jors it isnt i mean i dont ive just jors ran a hand back through his hair ive been busy are you asking me no good because im aware of how busy youve been and while the country certainly couldnt survive without you jors could feel his cheeks flush he hadnt meant to imply hed been busier than any other herald but in all fairness he hadnt just been hanging around the collegium since hed last been on circuit hed taken every courier run he could get and on those days hed been stuck in haven hed helped the weaponsmaster teach the archery classes run the grays through a few basic tracking exercises and had his butt handed to him consistently in the practice ring but you have a responsibility to your family as well things are quiet right now and we can find you if we need you i think seven days should be long enough to sooth your grandmothers justifiable irritation a raised hand cut off jors barely formed protest and im sure shell inform me if you cut the visit short but you dont like haven gervais reminded him as they made their way through the city toward the gate head up neck arched he pranced a little as a group of children called enthusiastic greetings i thought youd be happy to stay away for a while thats not the point jors forced a smile and waved at the children the point is my grandmother wrote dean carlech complaining about how long it had been since id been home perhaps she misses you also not the point my grandmother wrote the dean and because she did we dont have to return immediately to haven gervais turned his head just far enough that he could fix jors with one sapphire eye if you had been to see your family she wouldnt have had to write we were busy it was a weak defense and jors knew it you have no idea how embarrassing this is do you nerial didnt believe her herald was angry with you she said he seemed amused jors gave serious thought to standing in the stirrups and beating his head against the sign they were passing under the deans companion thought the dean was amused the legendary mystical protectors of valdemar gossiped like a flock of crows and given the isolating nature of the job there was nothing heralds like to talk about as much as other heralds he was never going to hear the end of this ryal verains expression matched that of the small black sheep jostling about in the pen behind himnot distrustful but definitely wary the scent was similar as well but jors was careful not to let that thought show as he handed over the oilskin packet pale eyes narrowed verain cracked the seal well thats that then he grunted as he finished reading the wariness had vanished replaced with satisfaction so jors assumed the news was good i cant deny the news takes a load off but i admit im surprised they sent it out with a herald my grandmother wrote the collegium when it became clear jors was not going to explain verain nodded ive no reply needs sending herald but if you can give us time to finish this pen wed be pleased to have you share a midday meal with us before you go where are you going forest settlement out from greenhaven verains eyes narrowed again youre trey hadens nephew jors fought the urge to remind verain he was a heraldhis instinctive response to being his uncles nephew his fathers son his grandmothers grandchildand said only yes verain had after all only made a statement not the first move on an emotional battlefield lagenfield the village closest to verains land was close enough to greenhaven that his family might have supplied wood had a closer forester not had what was needed well then youll have time to reach the greenhaven waystation after you eat and no time to get much farther if you dont he was still speaking to a herald not to trey hadens nephew no one with sense rode into the forest after dark id be happy to stay and share your meal jors shrugged out of his jacket if youll let me share in your labor the half dozen men mixed in with the sheep every one of whom had stopped working when gervais trotted into the compound shared a reaction jors couldnt hear above the bleating but given the laughter he assumed it was at his expense speculative laughter though not dismissive heavy brows rose until they disappeared under the thick gray curls thank you for the offer herald but were nearly done just this lot to send out to join the rest the rest were dotted over the hillside behind the compound like a spatter of ink against the new green surprisingly sleek without their fleece he had had no idea that lambs actually gamboled you settle your companion herald jors the oilskin crinkled as verains grip tightened around it youve done what you do you knew he was almost finished didnt you gervais asked as they headed over toward the stables hillside covered in shorn sheep only a few left in the penit wasnt hard to work out so it was an offer without meaning gervais snorted nothing of the kind i made it to acknowledge the value of his work in turn he acknowledged the value of mine your family values you hand up under gervais mane jors paused midscratch we werent talking about my family gervais snorted again i think that could be arranged no theyre tougher than those sheep of the holderkin theyre hardy ours can forage on their own all over these hills even though the lands rougher than a cheeks flushing suddenly becoming aware of who he was talking to raymond verains eldest son cleared his throat and continued without the profanity hed been about to add they dont need supplemental feeding and they may be small but i saw a ram take down a wolf once well a young wolf theyre not much for goring not with their horns turned back so grinning he sketched the rams horns curl over his own ears but theyve heads like rock and if they charge you youll know it we dont have a lot of trouble with wolves they tend to stay clear where theres people about and these sheep theyre smart enough to stay out from under the trees for the most part though they head for the highest ground about if they can expect to be chasing them down from the high hills some season you saw how they didnt have wool on their faces or legs herald thats to help them move through brush he continued before jors could answer they dont get caught up so easily and their fleece ah the fibers are fine and soft not so long and coarse as those of the holderkin we shear them twice a year spring and fall give us a few years to get this flock well established and the finest woolens at court will be from our sheep are they all black jors wondered youre thinking its wool that wont take dye much rodney nodded true enough but they throw gray on occasion and ive a mind to breed to white still nothing wrong with black woolens is there herald he waved a hand at jors whites then back at his own dark clothing blacks slimming they say husband did you just say herald jors looks fat rodney turned to look up at his wife opened his mouth closed it and opened it again although no words came out just as jors was about to protest for him her lips twitched rodney roared with laughter caught her around the waist and dragged her down onto his lap where he kissed her soundly i said nothing of the kind and well you know it he declared when they parted long enough for speech now did you actually have something to say or are you just interrupting our talk to cause trouble twitching her tunic back into place as she slid off his lap she nodded across the great room to where verain stood talking to a younger version of himself ryan came in to say that ewe youre so fond of has led another revolt if you want to keep her out of the stew pot youd best get over there and mount a spirited defense when rodneywhod surged up onto his feet at the newsglanced down at jors she tugged him back to her lips by his beard and murmured go ill entertain the herald for a big man rodney could move quickly when he had too he was almost across the room already gesturing at his father and brother by the time his wife dropped into his chair she shook her head at the crusts left behind by his empty bowl then turned to jors and said elane i imagine you were introduced to a dozen people all at once shoved into a chair and told to eat up so i dont expect you to remember he didnt actually your husband is the younger son middle ryan is older and ricard elane pointed to where a young man walked up and down by the windows a squalling infant on one shoulder ricard is two years younger the family runs to boys but ive five sisters so im hoping her hand dropped to her belly to even the odds there was only one thing that could mean congratulations what her gaze dropped to her hand oh thank you i havent known long its still so new we havent been married a year yet she halfturned in the chair to smile at her husband and when she turned back she frowned are you all right herald jors he schooled his expression before she could define it hurriedly raising his mug no one would ever smile across a room that way at him my lips do not move in such a way heartbrother a moment later ignoring the smug selfsatisfied reaction from his companion jors accepted the cloth elane offered and coughed out an apology she waved it off please you got very little on me and besides we were almost relatives you and i my father is dominic heerin jors nodded in the pause heerin owned the mill his uncle brought their logs to and your cousin hamin was courting my sister tara came to nothing though i remember when we heard youd been chosen it was all anyone could talk about id just turned twelve and i spent all that summer out by the track with flowers braided into my hair hoping another companion would come by and choose me eventually my eldest sister dragged me home by the ear and told me companions preferred useful people over those who shirked their chores elane shared her husbands fondness for monologing jors noted and he wondered what their conversations with each other must be like this must have been different for you he said from a house full of sisters and lumber to so many men and sheep a little different yes but not so hard to get used to rodney loves this land for all its rock and hills and the dangers of the forest so close at first i loved it for his sake but im growing to love it for its own and the sheep well youve already noticed their main failing but hes determined to breed to whitethat ewe hes defending threw gray twins this seasonand he admires them for their toughness as much as the fine wool of their fleece my sisters say when they see me now ive nothing to talk of but sheep and rodney well rodney and sheep her laugh drew her husbands head around and he paused in his argument long enough to toss a smile in her direction its always the way though isnt it as you move between birth family and found family this is what made me she held out one hand palm up and then the other and this is what i am and ill tell you this much herald jors she winked and stood as her fatherinlaw approached shepherds have much softer hands than men who toss lumber about all day the waystation was empty and quietalthough jors supposed that given the former the later went without saying hands cupped around a mug he sat in the doorway and watched gervais grazing his coat gleaming silver in the twilight beyond the companion in under the trees it was already night at the settlement the gates would be closed animals and people penned in safely the youngest and the eldest would be preparing for bed and everyone else would soon follow lamplight might extend the day in haven but out here sunrise and sunset still defined peoples lives not so different from where hed just come barring the differences between trees and sheep and the difference between herald jors and jors with a companion there is no difference between herald jors and jors with a companion they are both you my grandmother would agree although shed think they both mean jors with a companion gervais lifted his head and turned to stare jors wished not for the first time he could pick up his companions thoughts as easily as gervais picked up his finally the young stallion snorted and bent back to the grass if you are still annoyed with her about the letter tomorrow you many tell her it was inappropriate yeah jors drained the mug and set it to one side like thatll happen he didnt recognize the girl running down the track toward him until she skidded to a stop bowed elaboratelyone plait surrendering spilling her dark blonde hair down over her facelooked up and grinned herald jors wonderous one i like her jors returned the grin and swung out of the saddle annamarin in the time hed been gone shed crossed from child to girl shed be eleven now almost twelve the same age elane had been when shed spent the summer with flowers in her hair waiting for a companion instead of flowers annamarins hair held a trio of feathers stuffed into the top of the remaining braid you werent waiting out here hoping to be chosen were you grandmothers letter had said annamarin could benefit from his experience no no offense she added quickly to gervais dipping into another elaborate bow companions choose as companions will and companions will as companions please i really like her gervais said as jors worked that through may i give you greetings cousin may you what she sighed a simple exhalation defining her as the most putupon creature in these woods can i hug you why couldnt you youre a herald in whites and im tragically soiled though tis naught but good clean dirt tis naught annamarin rolled her eyes it means it isnt sort of wait my pipes she pulled a set of reed pipes out from behind her waistband i dont want them to be tragically crushed i made them myself she continued after an emphatic hug that rocked jors back onto his heels well lyralshe got stuck here for almost a week during fall storms when the mud was up over her bootsshe showed me how but i made them mostly lyral as they walked toward the settlement jors ran through the names of the bards he knew and came up short shes a minstrel she travels she sings shes the best i wanted to go with her when she left but mama said no papa said good riddance annamarin blew across the top of the pipes and back the rise and fall of the twelve notes sounded like a giggle he was kidding what did lyral say when you said you wanted to go with her it wouldnt be the first time a minstrel had discovered a talent in a child and made promises in order to lure that child away if lyral was one of those predatorshowever unsuccessful this timejors needed to find her hed be in and out of the settlement so quickly his grandmother would no doubt feel herself justified writing another letter to the dean beside him gervais had both ears flicked forward oh then this time the twelve notes sounded resigned and a bit annoyed she said she didnt travel with children but shed be back this way in a year or two and if i still wanted to go wed talk about what about me going with her i guess i dunno she shrugged a skinny shoulder then bent back to the pipes and blew out a string of birdsong that drew answers from the surrounding trees did lyra teach you to do that the look annamarin shot him reminded him chillingly of their grandmother its a calling bird song jors you spend way too much time in the city its tragic cant argue with that so since she couldnt have known theyd be arriving today shirking chores no when he glanced down at her she grinned maybe a little sometimes she turned in place and walked backward staring down the track i just want to know whats out there you know what i mean hed never given the world beyond the forest and the settlement any thought before hed been chosen on his first trip to greenhaven and the mill hed found himself falling into sapphire eyes and hearing an emphatic finally in his head now he thought about it gervais had sounded a lot like annamarin i was tired of waiting for you most of those who are to be chosen find their way to haven if id known you were out there id have met you halfway jors he smiled down at her yeah i know what you mean as they came out of the trees and into the clearing in front of the palisade jors found himself studying the area with a professional eye the settlements grant allowed a certain area cleared for living space and it looked as though his uncle had recently expanded out as far as he was legally allowed the edges still looked rough and there were two new buildings inside the palisade his mothers geese saw them first heads low necks extended the current flock charged out through the open gate hissing wings beating at the air when gervais lowered his own head and struck the ground with his right hoof they wheeled neatly to the left circling the willow fencing around the vegetable garden as though that had been their destination all along a familiar voice shouted from the garden as jors and annamarin drew even with the opening their grandmother emerged threw her cane at the geese spotted gervais and rocked to a stop as i live and breathe the boy is back less considerate of his whites than annamarin she stumped forward and dragged him up against her generous bosom leaving a smear of rich black earth across his tunic and down one leg given the amount of dirt on her hands he didnt want think about the places shed gripped him it was the same possessively affectionate hug hed always had from her and it made him feel seven ten fourteen youve filled out she clucked as she pushed him back out to arms length and looked him up and down well you couldnt have stayed all arms and legs forever i suppose could you never mind she cut him off as he opened his mouth how long can you stay seven days unless im needed needed gran rolled her eyes i think they can manage without out you for so short a time annamarin get my cane would you sweetheart had her head turned by a minstrel she added as the girl cautiously approached the geese either his grandmother had gotten a little deaf or she didnt care if she was overheard jors leaned toward the later fool woman put foolish ideas into the girls head i want you to tell her that its one thing to have a companion suddenly appear and declare you special she nodded to gervais who nodded back and another thing entirely to declare it yourself now come on hand tucked in the crook of his elbow she tugged him toward the gate its bread day your mother cant leave the kneading his mother dusted him with flour and clucked at the length of his hair then spun him around in time to have his brothers wife tora catch him up in a hug redolent with the scent of the first wild strawberries oh stop making such a fuss over him gran snorted hes just come home he hasnt saved the country singlehanded seven ten fourteen when he tried to step away he discovered he had a toddler wrapped around each leg they held him in place long enough for annamarins mother to appear and while she was exclaiming over his appearance jors cousin tomlin uncle treys youngest took an ax to the thigh last fall poor thing limped into the summer kitchen followed by the rest of the settlements children four dogs and a goat he only managed to free himself from their welcome by reminding them he had a companion to tend to jors set the saddle aside and let his forehead fall to thump against gervais withers theyre glad to see you i know and im glad to see them but but im jors with a companion you are my chosen gervais mental voice was matteroffact why do you need to be anyone else i dont that isnt he turned to rest his cheek against the warmth and ran a hand up under gervais mane am i a terrible person no you are a herald you cannot be a herald and a terrible person therefore you are not a terrible person responding to a nonverbal prompt jors scratched along the arc of his neck it is not terrible for you to want your family to see you as you are not as you were see lo where yonder herald stands jors turned to see ammamarin just inside the leanto barely visible over an armload of hay i know its tragic she said but this is the best of whats left theres not a lot of grazing yet but mikas been taking the goats to the south clearing if the wonderous one doesnt mind sharing his name is gervais have you forgotten hes too beautiful for a name she spread her arms the hay dropping into the manger he is a song walking above the mud we less lovely creatures tread upon have i mentioned that i like her you have jors pulled his brushes from the saddlebag trust me he walks in plenty of mud can i help you could play something for me i only know three real songs but she perched on the edge of the manger and pulled out her pipes mostly i just twiddle you know make stuff up jors draped his jacket beside her then bent to brush the dirt from gervais rear leg so make stuff up he didnt know what hed expected but her twiddles were just that random notes strung together not unpleasant but not exactly music either you know what you expected one hoof up on jors knee gervais rested his weight against jors shoulder jors grunted and pushed back annamarin the twiddling stopped jors dropped the hoof and straightened their grandmother looked between the two of them and snorted that woodbox wont fill itself child and no one will be pleased if the bread is baked only half through dont look to him hes a herald annamarin declared as she jumped down am i blind now woodbox if this labor ruins my hands and i can tragically no longer play youll weep with sorrow at the loss if that woodbox doesnt get filled youll be sorrier and you gran added as annamarin ran off did you think i wanted you to encourage such nonsense i will smack that minstrel if she returns filling the childs head with clouds you need to tell her what comes of running off away from ones family in search of adventure gran i you didnt run off did you you rode itd be different for that one wouldnt it thered be no pretty white clothes and a sense of selfimportance for her she needs to know whats out there doesnt she and she needs to know whats here safety security no one goes to bed hungryyour grandfather and i created this from nothing ill thank you to remember you missed a spot there on the left leg above the hock shaking her head she met gervais eyes im sure he does his best he never was much for chores either always off in the woods with a bow still im pleased to see you dont look like hes been neglecting you he missed another spot there his uncle trey his father and his older cousins came home at twilight theyd spent the day marking trees to be cut when the ground dried those that had been winterkilled and those topped off in spring storms jors was astounded to see that uncle trey a mountain of a man with more energy than any other three combined was now almost entirely gray and his broad shoulders had begun to stoop well put you to work tomorrow lad cheeks flushed his uncle clapped him on one shoulder he looked a little surprised when jors didnt so much as sway and added im sure youve forgotten what hard works like breakfast the next morning was porridge and berriesthe berries offered slightly squashed from his nephews fingers the boy shrieked with laughter as jors pretended to eat the fingers too when his mother ruffled his hair as she bustled past the long table he realized too late he was becoming the jors that was the jors they all still believed him to be youll work with your father and me uncle trey declared on the way out of the common dining hall jors paused half into a borrowed jacket with both of you is that a problem gran demanded i imagine youve forgotten most of your forest craft his uncle said the day would be a test jors didnt tell them hed tracked harder quarry than pheasant and deer over the last few yearsmostly because he couldnt figure out a way to do it that wouldnt sound like bragging and while hed done plenty of hard work as a herald hed forgotten how hard this work was so as the day went on he kept his mouth shut let it go trey his father laughed at last my boys still the best tracker in the family for all he spends most of his time with his ass in a saddle wasted skills uncle trey sighed when they stopped at midday theyd nearly reached the western edge of the grant sitting together on a rock shelf they divided up the food theyd been carrying and when they were settled jors uncle smacked his arm with the side of his fist and nodded toward a stand of beech four goodsized trees that had all been topped off what do you think lad no point saving them jors noted accepting a biscuit best to take them down and open a hole for new growth its beech the mill will take them for short boards if you stack them now and come back when the ground is dry enough for the sled and the oxen and theres enough limb wood there to keep the ovens going well done his father crowed couldnt expect a better answer than that trey the other man snorted straightened and stared into the distance pity we cant see if youve remembered how to shoot he said look at the size of that stag jors stood up on the rock to give himself a better angle frowned the distant silhouette was off slightly i dont think thats a stag i think its a dyheli dont be daft were too far north puts on a pair of white trousers and suddenly everythings got to be all mystical you need to keep your head in the real world off you go and track it then jors raised a hand as the dyheli disappeared into the trees and turned to see both men watching him expectantly no he said uncle trey began a protest but stopped when jors met his gaze his father suddenly directed all his attention to the packs well his uncle sounded as uncertain as jors had ever heard him wed best be starting back then hands wrapped around his empty mug jors watched his brother and his sisterinlaw carry the sleeping twins out of the large family room in the settlements first building his brother more than willing to leave their conversation when tara beckoned him home why are you sad he made room for annamarin on the bench im not sad you dont look sad she said frowning up at him but under how you look youre sad head cocked she studied his face is it a tragic love story a dying bandit girl and the knowledge that he was hers and always would be he started to say it was more complicated than that started to say their time had been too short for a story watched the door close behind his brother and his brothers family and said only yes annamarin nodded with all the wisdom of nearly twelve i thought so reaching into her pocket she pulled out a honey candy picked off a bit of lint and held it out to him my mama makes these when i had my heart tragically broken by ternin at the mill they helped thank you she dropped it in his hand although it stuck for a moment to her fingers and ran to join the children being herded off to bed the candy melted on his tongue so sweet it nearly made his eyes water if it didnt help it didnt hurt although he realized other parts of him did jors grunted as he stood stretched out his back and tried to work the knots from his right arm hard to believe hed only been walking and using a hatchet he hadnt hurt like this since hed first learned to ride used muscles you havent for a while lad uncle trey laughed not so easy keeping up with an old man is it leave him be trey theres a trick to walking on uneven ground jors father called out i expect hes lost the knack of it he needs to come home more often one of his cousins called a few more days of honest labor and hell be his old self again laughed another theres someone coming a moment later the geese sounded the alarm he went out yesterday looking for that damned ewe hes so fond of shed slipped the dogs late afternoon and headed for the hills with her lambs one of verains men sagged against the hands that held him as his horse sides wet with sweat stumbled and nearly went to her knees just inside the gate when the sun went down he didnt come in nearly had to tie elane to the chair to keep her from heading out to find him but hes smart rodney is and hed have found a safe place for the night yeah and then hed be back by day we told her back with that damned ewe but he wasnt jors stepped aside as annamarins father pushed past heading for the horse no we looked herald but we couldnt find him not even a body or sign of a struggle or the damned sheep and elane sent me to find you and i damned near killed the mare but elane he closed his eyes for a heartbeat and when he opened them again they shone with reflected pain obvious even in the light of half a dozen flickering lamps shes taking it terrible hard jors closed his hand around the mans shoulder felt the fine tremble of exhaustion through shirt and jacket felt the tension relax as he squeezed pivotting on one heel he headed for the heralds corner not needing a lamp to find the way to where gervais waited jors habit stopped his feet at the sound of his grandmothers voice where are you going then she stood in the door theyd left open when theyd rushed outside her hair unplaited for the night spilling around her shoulders im going where im needed to find rodney heads pivoted as the men and women in the courtyard turned their attention back to the old woman i understand you want to help jors but its forest trail all the way wait till day and go then if you must therere men already searching for young rodney who know the ground what can you bring to the search that they cant hope bare feet sticking out from under her nightshirt annamarin moved to jors side and swept a steady gaze over her family when a herald of valdemar rides hope rides with him yes they have men who know the ground but with one of theirs lost in the forest for going on two nights now what they need is hope she paused then just before the silence stretched to the breaking point she spread her hands and added and they need the best tracker this family has ever had a further heartbeats silence then a cheer jors bent and kissed the top of her head heartbrother i am well rested we can be there before dawn oh its so horribly tragic that one of the lambs died jors sighed i tell you a story of a gallant ride through the night beset on all sides by terrible dangers finishing with the sun barely up in the kind of tracking that one person in thousands could do in order to save a mans life and youre upset about a lamb it died annamarin released her grip on his sleeve to fold her arms and it was tragic rodney had been returned to elane from the bottom of a crevasse with a broken leg the ewe and her remaining lamb had been returned to the flock and jors had returned to trey haddens settlement annamarin had met him on the track it seems that you want your family to behave in ways you do not wish to behave yourself i dont know what you gervais gave a little buck the girl has talent speak to your grandmother on her behalf a bard their grandmother swept a narroweyed gaze from jors to annamarin and back are you certain a certain as i can be not being a bard myself jors watched her expression change her hand begin to rise and knew she had just asked herself what would jors know about bards gervais he added quickly is certain well she nodded slowly thats different then isnt it reaching out she took annamarins hand and tugged her close are you sure you want to be a bard child annamarin rolled her eyes its not something you do gran its something you are the old woman snorted its not something i am well no annamarin admitted but its like what jors is please child he was chosen that has nothing to do with what he is and everything to do with his companion with his companion finding him worthy what sighing annamarin tugged her hand free so she could gesture expansively there isnt a jors before and a jors after gran theres just jors and jors is a herald from the mouths of babes my point exactly gran grinned triumphantly and whacked jors on the shins with her cane when annamarin frowned jors shook his head try again when youre older he told her later when they were walking away from the settlement down the track toward greenhaven its tragic she doesnt understand its a little annoying he admitted but in the end i know who i am outside the palisades jors jumped as gervais tail slapped against the back of his legs and staying away solves nothing the companion added not every problem can be solved or needs to be out loud he said therell be bards visiting this summer how do you know im a herald he grinned i know things and in a couple of years ill see you in haven you hate staying in haven i didnt say i was going to stay i just said id see her there and then tragically abandon her stop it you dont look so sad when you talk to him in your head she planted her feet and struck a dramatic pose this is as far as im allowed to go can i hug you im clean you could hug me if you were dirty he told her she shook her head one plait falling loose that would be so tragically wrong hugging annamarin had nothing to do with being seven or ten or fourteen when he hugged her as her cousin and a herald he hugged the future not the past you didnt tell your grandmother she shouldnt write to the dean gervais pointed out when jors was in the saddle and there was nothing but open road before them i know i was afraid it would only encourage her gervais snorted you were afraid that too but the last thing i need is gran and the dean starting up a correspondence jors twisted and looked back toward the settlement annamarin must have reached the end of the track because he could just hear the geese protesting her return this is what made me he settled back in the saddle this is what i am birth family found family come on lets go home chapter the watchmans ball fiona patton although the winter solstice wasnt for another fortnight the nights had already turned cold laying a tracery of frost over the streets of the capital like a veil of croqueted lace leaning against the counter of ismy brownes saddlery shop sergeant hektor dann of the haven city watch sipped a mug of hot tea noting the extra touch of honey with a smile sgood he said sweet ismy cast him a shrewd glance you looked as if you could use it she noted late night he nodded stood the first watch wouldve stood the second but aiden made me go home your brothers a wise man she replied in a stern tone you cant do a proper days work if youre also tryin to do a proper nights work they needed extra hands it was the first night of the watchmans ball when ismy looked confused he smiled apologetically sorry i forgot only the watch calls it that its the first new moons eve before winter an every year round this time things well things happen what kind of things people runnin naked through the streets kind of things you mean like the lightning she asked in an exaggerated tone like him yeah oh please hektor dont tell me hes actually real hes real all right hes been doin it for decades but no ones ever caught him no ones even got a good enough look at him to identify him but every year we get dozens of reports of him all across haven the bettins four to one well never catch him an the watchhouses bet each other on how many sightings we get every year even every night we had moren seven on our patch this night last year alone hes a wily one thats for sure my granther used to say that he was as fast as a streak of lightning thats how he got his name ismy noted he said he even saw him once at the bottom of anvils close i used to peer through my bedroom shutters when i was a little trying to catch a glimpse of him but of course i never did i did her eyes widened you did not really he nodded enjoying her reaction once when i was first promoted up from runner to night watch constable uncle daz an me saw him turnin the corner south of the watchhouse but by the time we got there hed vanished anyway he continued setting the mug down on the counter da named these three nights the watchmans ball on account of the lightning leading us a merry chase all night long you see she nodded problem is he continued just the thought of seein him sends folk out into the streets an some of em carry on and pull all kinds of antics an pranks in his name its never been too much but its getting a bit more every year and the new captain wants him caught well i should hope so ismy agreed primly on a cold night like last night hed catch his death and dont you laugh at me hektor dann she admonished as he gave her an amused look if hes been doin it for decades like you say he must be an old man by now she took up the mug wiping the ring away with a flick of her cloth before pushing him toward the door now off you go to work and no standing any night watch tonight either you just leave that up to your younger brothers thats their job not yours sergeant dann yeah yeah all right im goin he paused on the threshold can i come by an see you after all this new moons nonsense is over he asked suddenly hesitant she nodded equally shyly do you want to come for supper id like that its just stew i like stew and biscuits you know i like biscuits too good well they stood in awkward silence until the city bells began to toll the hour then hektor shook himself good well supper after yeah he turned and headed quickly up the street ignoring the older merchants leaning from their doors and windows a few called out greetings a few asked if hed caught the lightning yet but most just smiled knowingly as ismy watched until hed turned the corner and disappeared from view there was a crowd of watchmen both on duty and off gathered about the night sergeants desk when he arrived at the iron street watchhouse a few moments later it parted for him eagerly but sergeant jons took his time collecting his reports and putting them into two neat piles before glancing over at the much younger day sergeant sergeant dann he said formally sergeant jons the nights incident reports are as follows four counts of fighting one outside the kings arms youll know all about that one yourself i expect what with you and aiden bringing em in yourselves theyre still here and the reports are still to be filed i figured since the day watch sergeant made the arrest the day watch sergeant could do up the paperwork he glanced over the report at hektor much as a schoolmaster might but when hektor gave him an even look in response he retidied his papers a ripple of annoyance passed through the crowd of watchmen which he pointedly ignored where was i oh yes fighting he continued two domestic disturbances no charges laid and no one taken into custody although holly poll did throw a chamber pot at constables jakon and raik dann he waited until the general laughter and ribbing at hektors younger brothers died down before continuing but since it turned out that she was actually aiming at her husband they let her off with a warning decent of em someone at the back shouted only cause it was empty jakon groused only cause youre scared of holly poll the laughter erupted again one count of burglary at the hillman mill sergeant jons continued in a louder voice caught in the act silly fool was trying to lead out two donkeys at once with predictable results apparently hell be in hospital for another day or two he gave an unsympathetic sniff before continuing five counts of public drunkenness two of the combatants became he lifted his head lips pursed as if to find just the right word belligerent so the charges were raised to resisting arrest three counts of public urination one of which led to an altercation with corporal wright when the suspect made his opinion of the arrest clear by attempting to urinate on him again he paused to allow the laughter to die down one count of sleeping on public property that would be old ivar he said in a quiet aside to hektor hes in the back having a good breakfast turn him loose whenever you like after lunch maybe hektor nodded and sergeant jons set the first pile of reports down with great ceremony all eyes followed his movements as he lifted the second so he began settling comfortably against his chair back lets us see now the watchmans ball reports what to get to first eh ah yes he glanced up as the gathered leaned forward waiting with a stern expression until they fell back into a sort of loose parade rest clay marchers gran and granther were at it again this year runnin amok were they the same person from the back shouted as constable marchers face flushed red running amok no not at all sergeant jons answered dancing amok yes without benefit of clothing again yes but they came quietly after the dance was done and were escorted home without incident clay you might want to head over there on your break and retrieve constable faranes cloak yes sarge right where was i the sergeant continued before he could be interrupted by more laughter fourteen sets of undergarments retrieved from various trees and fences some of which were quite again he lifted his head and pursed his lips as if to find just the right word finely made thats up from ten sets last year in case anyones keepin score he pointedly ignored a number of watchmen exchanging money as no one ever comes forward to claim their property they will be donated as has become tradition im not sure to which temple this year he glanced up with a rare smile i think wed best leave that up to the captain his words were greeted with a ripple of snickering and a number of surreptitious glances toward the captains closed office door seven people apprehended runnin through the streets without benefit of clothing he continued the gathered leaned forward again students the lot of them he finished to general disappointment two of em bardic trainees from the collegium again more money changed hands all reclothed lectured and escorted home again these incidents are also up this year by two sarge watchhouse runner padreic hektors youngest brother supplied two an it took some doin to get the last one raik noted sourly he climbed right up atop the statue of king valdemar and got his stupid self stuck had to go up and fetch him down took the better part of an hour just about froze his manhood right off him the silly bugger jakon muttered just about froze mine raik added had half a mind to leave him up there if i might continue before the captain returns from his morning meeting with the breakneedle street watch captain sergeant jons said loudly enough to quiet them sightings of the lightning all eyes turned expectantly none there was stunned silence what none at all corporal wright asked none at all the gathered slumped as if the air had been let out of them the entire capital passed the day in an air of dejection and speculation even those who had declared their disdain for the lightning in the past were seen standing about with glum expressions much of the talk was of his past antics and most agreed that nothingnot storms not fog and certainly not the watchcould have stopped him he must have been topped as hektor and aiden headed for a local pie shop at noon the older of the two danns shook his head i spose thats it then he noted two rabbit thanks jess whats it then hektor asked handing a pie over aiden accepted it with a grimace the lightning he declared shaking his fingers to cool them hes been showin up on the first night every year for years and suddenly nothing hes topped like they say makes sense hektor blew on his own pie with a reflective expression ismy says if hes been doin it for that long he must be really old he probably is topped aiden grinned at him ismy huh so thats where you snuck off to so early this mornin ma was wonderin hektor shot him a dark look liar i told ma where i was goin all right i was wonderin aiden admitted still grinning i just wanted to see her before my shift is all and and what aiden shook his head in disgust if you have to ask me you didnt ask her i told suli you didnt have the bollocks she owes me a pennybit do you two even have a proper understandin yet hektor frowned at him i dont know he answered slowly i think so she asked me to supper after all this was all done well thats a start maybe shell ask for you jerk coward eat your pie you gonna stand night watch hektor shrugged probably some of it anyway waste of time hes topped the captain still has the extra hands on just in case waste of money maybe but its not like we couldnt use it beside theres all the other idiots runnin amok out there to deal with aiden finished his pie with a grimace well they better get it outta their systems early then he growled a martial light growing in his eyes cause come midnight tomorrow most of us are gonna be damned ugly the rest of the day passed quietly as if the entire capital were holding its breath waiting for nightfall waiting to see if the lightning would make an appearance or if he really was topped as most people believed hektor arrived at the tenement house where he shared an upstairs flat with four generations of his family as the city bells tolled six he figured he had just enough time to eat and catch a couple hours sleep before he was due back at the watchhouse jakon and raik on regular night duty should be up and out of the small bedroom they shared with him and padreic by now he took the three flights of stairs two at a time already anticipating the bowl of his mothers soup and his own warm blankets he met the local herbalist coming down sergeant sir ive just been to see thomar hektor felt himself grow still oh he managed your granther needs to see a healer the man said bluntly an actual healer why whats happened the herbalist ran a hand through his hair in an impatient gesture he had a dizzy spell and a bit of a fall nothing too serious a bump on the head he added as hektors expression went from worried to alarmed years of breathing in the droppings from those messenger birds of his has compromised his lungs and a packet of herbs once a week isnt going to be enough to set things right at his age he needs to see a healer but hes resisting hell say its too dear hektor ventured rubbish hes just being a stubborn old fool i say this in all respect hektor ive known thomar for forty years he was friends with my own father as i was with yours and ill tell you what i told him he needs to see a healer soon or hell die his voice dropped it may even be too late he straightened i was sorry about egan he added as he headed down the stairs i miss your da as im sure you all do thanks the flat was in an uproar when he arrived padreic was pacing the front room squeezing the pigs bladder ball he was forever mending in his hands while their only sister kasiath was sitting by the coal stove her eyes red from trying not to cry jakon and raik were standing beside her clearly unsure of how to comfort her beyond their physical presence everyone looked up with relief when hektor entered wherere the others he asked casting a swift glance across the kitchen to the small pantry theyd converted for their grandfathers use suli took the littles off to visit her mother padreic answered aidens not home yet an mas gone to the healers to get someone to come by and see to granther granther dont need no one seein to him thomars weak but determined voice carried easily across the flat he just needs some blasted quiet padreic chewed at his bottom lip i thought i might go down to rosies hek he said in a hushed voice if thats all right i can stay though he added quickly if you need things fetched or somethin hektor shook his head no you go just stay indoors so i know where to find you both of them tried hard not to glance over at the pantry again well head out too now that youre home raik said where will you be the two younger brothers shared a look watchmans arms if you need us hektor nodded kas she looked up ill stay all right then hektor made a show of screwing up his courage so lets go see if we can talk some sense into a cantankerous old man the pantry was just big enough to house a narrow pallet down the center thomar lay propped up on a pile of pillows wrapped in shawls and blankets and looking as birdlike as one of his own messenger pigeons he gave hektor a narroweyed look as his grandson pushed the curtain aside dont start he wheezed its too dear and its not necessary the herbalist says otherwise granther the herbalist is a thomar paused as kasiath pushed past her brother and tucked herself on the bottom corner of the pallet nagging little fart he finished i know whats what he dont so he turned to kasiath dyou tell him your news girl she shook her head there hasnt been time granther so tell him now its good news news to celebrate hektor glanced down at his little sister i could use some good news he prompted with a smile she nodded gravely the watchhouse messenger bird master came by today she said an he offered me an apprenticeship thats great kassie another dann in the watch sort of um how much is it gonna cost thats all taken care of thomar snapped me an logan have an understandin about that an about other things too so go on tell him the rest thats not for certain granther nonsense an its too dear you let us decide on whats too dear you just tell your brother what logan said he thinks he might be able to get me into some classes at the collegium kasiath relented he says he thinks i might have animal mindspeech well birdspeech anyway maybe of course you do thomar interjected again anyone with half a brain coulda seen that years ago he began to cough waving off his two grandchildren as they leaned forward now you get downstairs and tell paddy to go chase your ma down afore she wastes time and money on some high and mighty healer whatll charge

front room interrupted them get your brother in here thomar ordered i got somethin to tell you both the night shift passed with the usual number of students running amok and sets of undergarments being laid out for the lightnings approval clay marchers grandparents made another brief appearance this time in their nightclothes as a concession to the cold but once again there was no sign of the famous nude runner himself after the night sergeant had made his reports the four oldest danns met in hektors small office with the door firmly shut behind them both jakon and raik stared at their older brothers with their mouths open granther was the lightning raik stammered youre not serious hektor raised his hands him an great uncle daz thats what he says hes pullin your leg jakon declared flatly theres no possible way they were watchmen he says they got a bet on one new moons eve walking the night beat when they were about your age aiden said uncle daz dared granther to run past the

up this year raik continued an why he wont never show up again hektor finished for them granthers too old an too sick to carry on like that any more the two younger brothers cast each other an equally speculative glance and aiden shot them both a sharp look dont even think about it he ordered think about what the looks turned to expressions of aggrieved innocence and aiden just scowled at them you know what dont i mean it both of you course not raik protested after all granther an uncle daz were the two oldest danns in their generation its hardly our place to take their place now is it its just a pity its over is all a real shame jakon agreed folks looked forward to the lightning all year he was like a market fair all rolled into one man eight men yeah eight men it would take a lot to fill

aiden the oldest dann brother looked from them to hektor with a deepening scowl i know what youre tryin to do he growled but yeah were sworn to secrecy satisfied the two younger danns sauntered through the door leaving the two older danns to stare silently at each other so thats it then aiden repeated hektor nodded thats it right thats it two nights later hektor sat in ismy brownes small kitchen wiping up the last of the stew in his bowl with a generous piece of biscuit ismy set a pie down in the center of the table before joining him i was sorry to hear about thomar she said solemnly it was just last night wasnt it early this morning how are the family doin he sat back kassies takin it the hardest and paddy too i guess its only been a couple of months since da died but he had a chance to talk to us all to pass things on afore he went you know it was a comfort yes i was pleased to hear about kassies apprenticeship your ma must be very proud she smiled at his confused expression therere no secrets in haven hektor she said especially in the watch you lot gossip moren a gaggle of laundrywomen i suppose thats so sometimes anyway he stared into space for a moment then shook himself the funerals tomorrow morning with a gettogether afterwards at the watchhouse do you think you might be able to come yes i think so jen can watch the shop its time she took on more responsibility ismy busied herself cutting the pie into wedges she an sheave come to an understandin she said in a conversational tone you remember shea my late husbands brother he took over the saddlery workshop after quinn died when he nodded she continued theyre gettin married this spring im thinkin they should move into the main room its more appropriate for two an of course theyll want the whole flat when they start havin littles its not really big enough for them an me oh do you um think that might be soon hektor asked suddenly feeling too enclosed in the warm kitchen oh yes like i said theyve come to an understandin of course she knew it long afore he did but thats often the way she collected the bowls and took them over to the sink suli tells me she an aiden have taken the flat below yours she mentioned yeah they move down in a couple of weeks he took a deep breath thatll leave our main room free as well you know if there were maybe another understandin to come to you know maybe do you think there might be she asked without turning around i think maybe yeah that is if you do do you she finally turned with an exasperated smile like i said its often the way when he continued to look uncertain she shook her head that means yes i do think there might be an understandin to come to honestly did you want a bit of cheese what cheese with your pie oh yeah sure thanks she cut a large piece off a round in the pantry thats a bit he asked bemused when she set it down in front of him with an equally large piece of pie you look as if you could use it you look tired again yeah well its been a rough few days so i hear they say the lightning finally made an appearance last night he started you heard i did you didnt see him she asked pointedly uh why would i she turned hands on hips i know you stood night watch last night hektor dann so dont try to deny it i told you there are no secrets in haven especially in the watch so she folded her arms in a businesslike gesture are you all through with this watchmans ball foolishness for another year lifting a piece of pie to his mouth he stared at it for a long time before looking up yeah he said for another year chapter judgment day nancy asire so levron are you looking forward to returning home levron glanced at the man who rode at his side perran was a traveling judge representative of the justiciary of karse its eyes ears and judgment passed by one who rightfully upheld the laws of the son of the sun and more importantly the laws of vkandis sun lord perran was all that levron was not tall with dark hawkish features molded from the classic karsite version of male beauty that would stand out in any crowd even if he did not wear the dark robes of a judge levron could only contrast his own looks with that of his companion at best he would become lost in the same crowd he had no memorable features though he was hardly ill to look upon and this was his strength he could move among people and leave no lasting impression he was he freely admitted a friend of sorts to perran and he had served the judge many times by riding ahead to the scene of a trial and losing himself in the town or village from this vantage point he had been able to gather information about the accusers and accused that might have become lost in a formal trial the insights he gathered he passed to perran and in many cases that knowledge had swayed a decision that otherwise might have been erroneous its been a while he admitted flicking his reins at a fly determined to light on his horses neck but this time ill be of no use to you at the trial theres a good chance some people in streamwood will remember me ah well perran said this case doesnt seem on its face to need your talents you might however know the litigants involved levron snorted i used to know them everyones aware how time can change people time deals differently with us all ill still need your observations levron you know or knew these people at one time maybe they havent changed as much as you think possibly the two men involved were acquaintances years back the woman she and i also knew each other her reputation was wellacknowledged around town a bit of a flirt if i have my facts straight oh yes levron nodded his head from her earliest days so the two of you werent close then at one time i fancied i could become more than merely a passing friend he laughed though the laughter sounded a bit hollow to his own ears she came from a family far more important than mine and she never let me or anyone else forget her status well perran said well find out exactly how she fits into this case i still think you might be of more use to me than you imagine you say people in town will remember you though by your own admission its been quite some time since youve returned home levron briefly bowed his head as you know both my parents have been dead for years and i had no brothers or sisters no extended family in streamwood thats one of the reasons i left for sunhame thinking i could make something of myself in the capital and so you have assistant to a circuit judge is a respected position the two guards following behind fully armed and appearing quite able to handle any situation that grew out of control laughed at some joke passed between them levron closed his eyes briefly the road hadnt changed since the last time he passed over it only then riding in the opposite direction the scents of the fields on either side were the same the fall of the sunlight on those fields a fleeting memory surfaced taking him back to the days he lived in this region of karse of a childhood and young adulthood spent coming and going in the area despite his effort to remain unaffected he admitted this would be no easy homecoming his parents lay buried on the hill behind the chapel the friends he left behind would not be the same and he had changed as well someone long ago said you could never go home again less than a candlemarks ride ahead lay possible confirmation of that saying he wasnt certain what he would find or even what he expected if nothing else his return to streamwood would prove interesting to say the least perran stood in the center of the room he and levron had been granted at the inn it was obviously one of the best reserved for those who could afford the price naturally he would not be charged during his stay which he hoped would not be lengthy his two guards occupied the room next door smaller but still more than accommodating the citizens of streamwood had gone out of the way to make his visit a pleasant one he settled in one of the chairs by the open windows watching levron unpack their belongings levron was trying his best to appear unconcerned but perran knew better this journey wore on him more than he would admit not that perran could ignore the significance of levrons return though he thought he would be of no help since he was known in town perran considered the benefits of having him as a companion so he said leaning back in his chair did you see anyone you know levron paused shaking the folds from perrans formal robes a few he admitted i thought so i noticed several people look twice in your direction as we rode by when is the trial to begin tomorrow midmorning here is what i want you to do levrons face went blank but i wont be able to disappear into the woodwork too many people know me thats my hope we have the rest of the afternoon and evening since it would only seem natural id like you to go out and wander around a while see what you can find surely there are a few people you might want to contact since some time has passed since you left streamwood i dont think anyone would find that out of place an uncomfortable expression tightened levrons eyes i suppose but theyll all be aware i ride with you that fact alone wont loosen their tongues perran laughed quietly on the contrary i think theyll be interested in asking what youve been doing since you left and how you ended up in my company once you start talking ill wager theyll lower whatever guard theyve erected out of sheer curiosity and so it was that levron entered a tavern hed frequented before he left streamwood true to perrans supposition several people nodded to him as he took his place at a table situated toward the rear of the room he requested a cup of ale and sat quietly nursing his drink a few former associates stopped by exchanged brief greetings and questioned him as to his new station in life but for the most part he was left alone it was apparent no one was overly interested in a former resident of the town though he was certain word of his arrival with perran had begun to spread levron the familiar but strangely unfamiliar voice interrupted his thoughts he looked up from his cup into the face of a tall man who stood by the table a smile on his narrow face for a moment the features of the newcomer wavered between that of years past and that of the present the mans name however was all too familiar barro levron indicated an empty chair memories flashed through his mind not all of which were particularly pleasant i couldnt believe it when i saw you barro said waving to the barmaid for a cup of ale youve come up in the world levron made a dismissing gesture perhaps assistant to a traveling judge is hardly an exalted position so you say barro took a long sip of his drink you know im to go to trial tomorrow yes and do you know why not really only in the broadest sense well let me give you the details perhaps you can offer some advice that levron said keeping his voice expressionless is the last thing i can do im only a judges assistant i dont know the law barros eyes narrowed not even for an old friend not even for an old friend as i said i dont know the law id hate to give you advice that wouldnt help and might harm then hear me out and maybe youll change your mind you know trika know trika levron managed a shrug of course heres what happened ive been half in love with her for years you and the rest of streamwood levron observed uncomfortably aware he could count himself in that crowd hunh i own a fabric shop and havent done badly for myself i thought i might be of standing enough to court trika his face darkened but she was already being courted let me guess levron interrupted unable to stay disinterested haivel haivel that coddled papas boy barro swallowed the rest of his ale his eyes gone hard he was always around her pestering her father for more and more access to her company and you i kept my distance making it obvious i was interested as well in fact i went out of my way to give her father discounts on any fabric his wife wanted to purchase i was never overt in my actions and as they say patience pays off after spending most of her time with haivel trika decided she preferred to see me levron could tell where this was going he knew all three individuals involved barro the man who worked tirelessly to better himself haivel whose parents had given him a small shop where he had set himself up as a scribe and of course trika the beauty of streamwood trika the tease trika the woman who adhering to the customs of karse had been allowed to be courted by men her father deemed worthy you know haivel barro continued lifting his empty cup in the barmaids direction he didnt take this well at all the more time trika spent with me the more upset haivel grew i think he was eaten up with jealousy and finally he couldnt accept the way things were and damaged my latest shipment of cloth oh and you saw this i did he came around just before dark i was finishing the last of my orders id gone to the rear of the shop when i heard the door open i came back to the front in time to see haivel throw a bucket of paint over the latest bolt of fine cloth id ordered from sunhame you have no idea how much that cloth cost it was ruined haivel laughed at melaughed at meand ran out of the shop levron leaned back in his chair im surprised i didnt think haivel was that sort well he is you havent been in town for years and havent seen the change in him i immediately went to the authorities and made my report did they arrest haivel barros face darkened they talked to him he denied everything he said he had a witness who would swear he was nowhere near my shop that night and his father took his side of course dear haivel beloved only son who couldnt have done anything so dishonest so youre taking the case to court barro squared his shoulders i am now old friend any advice old friend levron all but laughed barro had never been a friend an offandon comrade but never a friend in fact when he and barro had been young boys barro had been somewhat of a bully with levron taking most of the abuse when the two of them were together no advice other than to tell the truth judge perran is quite adept at knowing whos lying and whos not as ive told you im not a legalist i do know a person who lies before him is in worse trouble than if he had not some help you are barro muttered i guess thats all i can expect after all you arent the judge your master is levron smiled despite the veiled insult i wish you the best barro destruction of property is a crime and should be punished youre damned right barro shoved his chair away from the table tossed down a copper coin and stood i suppose ill see you again and with that he turned and made his way toward the taverns door levrons shoulders slumped and he relaxed somewhat amazed that this meeting had made him so tense once again he felt the pressure of memories from the past barro haivel and trika he knew or thought he knew them all and he admitted he was growing more than relieved he no longer lived in streamwood perran looked up when levron entered the room they shared from the expression on his assistants face he had not spent a pleasant time out in the town well did you see anyone you know levron frowned a few no one i considered close i did see one of the people youre to judge tomorrow oh barro ah the fellow whose cloth was ruined who reported it was done by haivel yes thats interesting a man by the name of haivel came here looking for you i cant believe you didnt pass him on your way in perran watched levron closely you might want to go out and see if hes still around what did barro have to say what didnt he have to say he told me the whole story how haivel ruined a bolt of expensive cloth by dumping a bucket of paint on it all out of jealousy over of course trika the two of them are trying to court her shed spent all her time with haivel and then started seeing barro he wanted advice which i refused to give him we didnt part on the best of terms perran nodded what levron told him matched information hed received before he had agreed to judge this case however a new twist had arisen when levron had gone out earlier and haivel had come looking for him information perran wasnt yet ready to share let levron find out himself unprepared for what he would hear not being forewarned his reaction would be unlikely to arouse suspicion of prior knowledge this in itself could aid his observations later if he could find haivel and the way events had transpired so far perran was certain levron would do just that it didnt take long for levron to locate haivel the inn sported a few tables and chairs to the side of the building where when weather permitted people could sit and drink or share a dinner agreeing with perran levron was surprised haivel had missed his recent arrival he drew a calming breath as he approached another person from his past levron haivel smiled and nodded his greeting sit sit its been a long time that it has levron acknowledged so how has life been treating you ive done well you know im a scribe theres a good life to be made writing for folk who dont have the skill i can only imagine so youre assistant to judge perran are you you obviously made something of yourself when you left streamwood for sunhame i did and ive never regretted it you know im going to trial tomorrow once the polite pleasantries had passed haivel jumped straight to the point levron briefly closed his eyes and i wont give you any advice if you ask for it i cant haivel drew back slightly in his chair his handsome face darkened and why is that fresh memories of his conversation with barro surfaced but he refused to let haivel know the two of them had spoken a short time before im slightly aware of the case but levron repeated i dont know the law and i cant offer any advice save to tell the truth haivel snorted well let me tell you if barro thinks hes going to have a judgment entered against me im countering him with my own accusation oh levron blinked in surprise and what did barro do that youre going after him in court he came into my shop one afternoon in broad daylight mind you and took a knife to an entire shipment of paper sitting on the counter before i could stop him cut it into pieces do you have any idea how much paper costs or what the going price is for a bolt of fine cloth levron shook his head in disbelief i couldnt guess but it probably wouldnt be cheap its not i dont have any idea what possessed him hes been acting strange ever since levron waited refusing to lead haivel to further explanation heres the problem haivel said spreading his hands you know trika i knew her levron admitted years ago i was courting her seriously courting her her father evidently thought well of me and then for some reason she dropped me like a hot rock and started seeing barro and someone vandalized cloth in barros shop he swears it was me and reported the crime to the authorities but i have a witness i wasnt near his shop and days later he came into my shop and destroyed my paper thats odd in broad daylight too do you have a witness only my own two eyes i cant let him get away with this haivel drew a deep breath are you certain you cant i cant offer any advice except what ive already told you levron said speak the truth judge perran will be able to tell whos lying and whos not haivel shrugged i understand though i hoped you might be able to help a friend for old times sake old friend again do the two of them truly believe we were friends ive explained why i cant all i can do is wish you the best of luck one word of caution however dont dismiss judge perran as just another traveling judge what i can tell you is this hes one of the best and anyone who thinks otherwise makes a huge mistake the transformation that turned perran from traveling companion to circuit judge never ceased to amaze levron though hed witnessed it many times seated a few paces away from the table perran sat behind levron could see why people could become awed clad in his dark robes the heavy gold chain of his office glittering on his chest perran exemplified the authority of the justiciary and as every citizen of karse knew stood as the legal hand of the son of the sun after speaking with haivel levron had related their conversation to perran in exacting detail his expected duty as perrans assistant he had watched perrans face go still as all the legal ramifications of the two stories swirled about in his mind and now today those thoughts would be turned into action barro and haivel had taken chairs before the judges table neither meeting the other mans eyes from his vantage point at the front of the room levron had a good view of the people who had come to watch the trial a few latecomers had arrived and much to levrons dismay trika had entered the room accompanied by her father the years had been kind to her she still possessed a breathtaking beauty but levron sensed something else immediately the hint of coldness lurked in her eyes a calculating expression she tried to hide by keeping her gaze modestly lowered ah yes trika the tease levron could imagine what had driven barro and haivel to their crimes trika was the source of those misdeeds he was certain of it perran rapped the table three times and the room grew silent this court is now in session perran said his face solemn what is said before me is seen and heard by myself as representative of the son of the sun and vkandis sun lord every word spoken to me is given under oath state falsehood at your peril unwillingly levron turned his attention to trika again though she maintained her modest demeanor she looked first to haivel and then to barro in a flash he knew what motivated her and felt a little sickened by the knowledge his faith in perrans abilities as a judge was absolute the truth behind barro and haivels quarrel would be brought to light and not a moment too soon for the sake of everyone involved perran studied the two men seated before him neither looked away both seemingly assured their testimony would win the day that in itself spoke volumes he cleared his throat ill question you first barro since you brought the original accusation against haivel from what youve told the authorities of streamwood haivel ruined a bolt of expensive cloth by dumping a bucket of paint on it now tell me what you think could have caused a productive and respected citizen of streamwood to do such a thing barro stood bowed his head briefly in perrans direction jealousy your lordship he said perran leaned back in his chair steepled his hands and listened to barros account of the vandalism of his fabric and the perceived reason for haivels jealousy he glanced once at levron lifted an eyebrow to be rewarded by levrons nod toward a beautiful woman seated next to an older man most likely her father so that was trika the source of the trouble that had escalated to vandalism he continued to listen to barros tale but he kept watching trika as the man spoke he could see how her eyes sparkled how her face grew animated as barro set forth his case against haivel and you saw haivel throw the paint on your bolt of cloth perran asked yes your lordship was there anyone else in the shop that night no your lordship did he say anything after ruining your fabric no your lordship he merely laughed and ran out of the shop i see perran looked down at a piece of paper on the table youve tendered the court a receipt setting out the value of the cloth it bears the stamp of tabot house of sunhame is this the merchant you deal with yes your lordship and the value of the bolt of cloth is set out here at ten silver soleri and you say its ruined it is the paint soaked through it since its an intricate weave perran motioned barro to sit then turned his attention to haivel and you haivel perran motioned for the man to stand youve brought a claim against barro for destruction of a shipment of paper to be used in your profession as scribe is that correct it is your lordship now explain to me why you think barro would do such a thing haivel shrugged i dont know i can only guess its revenge for what he thinks i did to his cloth but i have a witness who will testify i couldnt have been to his shop that night but he claims he saw you and you laughed in his face impossible your lordship and where is this witness who can give proof you werent at barros shop that night for the first time haivels eyes wandered im not sure perran leaned back in his chair and lifted an eyebrow what do you mean youre not sure he left town shortly after the incident your lordship then why do you claim you have a witness who can assure me you werent at barros shop because its true i wasnt and my witness would testify to that perran allowed a smile to touch his lips a witness who isnt here cant help you do you know where this person is no hes another scribe who travels in the area serving those who cant read or write haivels face reddened if i knew where he was hed be in court today you didnt think to find him when you knew you were coming to court i tried but he doesnt always take the same route perran lifted another sheet of paper youve given this court a receipt for the paper you claim barro ruined by slashing it with a knife haivel nodded its from a traveling paper merchant i get a shipment from him whenever he passes through town perran studied the receipt it says here the amount you paid the merchant for the paper was ten silver soleri is that correct yes your lordship it was a large order i have to stock paper because im never sure when the merchant will be passing through town again you may be seated perran studied the two men they returned his stare faces set in expressions of total belief in what they recounted but somewhere in haivels recounting he sensed a lie he straightened this court will adjourn for two candlemarks while i review the cases i want you both back here then he looked across the room briefly focusing his attention on trika please bear in mind that everything youve said i have taken into consideration and i am as you well know an enforcer of the laws of karse my judgment here today is final and your cases cannot be tried again levron stood outside the inn well aware his next duty to perran might be one of the hardest he had ever performed nonetheless any information he could find would aid perrans decision in this case glancing up at the passing clouds he made an effort to appear relaxed and calm one more man enjoying the springtime sun he heard his name called turned and saw trika coming his way accompanied by her father levron she said her smile such that any man would immediately feel flattered to be addressed by her you remember my father i do good day to you sir trikas father wore a somewhat preoccupied expression and merely nodded so youve become assistant to the judge she smiled again this time the smile was more than inviting yes levron squared his shoulders a position im rather proud of and you should be she said stepping close enough so he could smell the slight hint of her perfume im confused as to why barro and haivel are in court perhaps you can tell me what will happen if theyre found guilty that i cant i dont make those decisions oh she pouted prettily i thought you might have witnessed cases like this before and why should you care levron asked keeping his voice even trika lifted her chain and glanced off for a brief moment i dont actually im merely interested they were both beginning to bore me trika this from her father who now stared at his daughter thats not a kind thing to say but its true papa first haivel then barro she tossed a strand of nightblack hair over her shoulder youd think i was the only woman in town levron cleared his throat much as he wanted to keep his opinions hidden the time had come to reveal them you havent changed have you trika she appeared startled for a few heartbeats what do you mean by that i remember all too well how things stood when i left streamwood levron met trikas fathers eyes your pardon sir i dont mean any disrespect he returned his attention to trika you always seemed to enjoy setting boys and then men at each other simply to see how they would react isnt that what youve done to barro and haivel trikas eyes turned to black ice thats unfair i thought you and i were friends friends again why do they think we were ever friends not so i noticed you never paid me any attention at all i can see why i didnt trika said her eyes narrowed now youre nothing more than a trika this time her father put a hand on her shoulder be still i will not she fumed why should i let levron accuse me of because its true and you know it her father interrupted ive ignored your behavior far too long youre aware of what they call you in town arent you for a brief moment trikas haughty expression cracked trika the tease she said at last her voice gone very quiet levron bowed his head in trikas fathers direction i think it best i take my leave he said im fairly certain i wont be back in streamwood for a long time if ever so i wish the best of everything for you both he turned and entered the inn a headache beginning to pound behind his eyes but the unfortunate meeting had been worth it he now had the answer perran wanted perran couldnt deny the emotional cost of levrons meeting with trika levron had hardly spoken a word other than to recount the conversation he had shared with trika and her father knowing how difficult that meeting must have been perran vowed somehow to set things right perran earnestly hoped a situation similar to this one would not occur in the future court in session he stared at the two men seated before his table and made a show of inspecting the receipts they had given him to prove their loss let them squirm a little it certainly wouldnt do them further harm finally he motioned for barro and haivel to stand what i have here are receipts for the goods you have lost once again i ask can either of you prove the damages created by the other barro darted a quick glance at haivel i saw him ruin my cloth with my own eyes and i haivel said saw barro destroy my paper but neither of you has a witness its only your individual accusations that this is what happened my cloth is ruined barro exclaimed i saw haivel dump the paint on it and i saw barro destroy my paper haivel growled whose word weighs more here his or mine are you asking me a question perran leaned forward in his chair i dont answer questions i ask them both men seemed to shrink slightly my apologies your lordship haivel said quietly so perran studied the papers again you barro suffered a loss of ten silver soleri for the destruction of your fine bolt of cloth caused you say by haivel upending a bucket of paint on it and you haivel suffered a loss of ten silver soleri because you claim barro took a knife to your delivery of paper all because youre both acting out of a misguided sense of jealousy and revenge you haivel courted trika for a considerable time and when she started seeing barro you reacted haivels face turned red and he stared at his feet and you barro perran continued letting his eyes stray to where trika and her father sat reacted in anger because you claim haivel destroyed your cloth as you said haivel its his word against yours and your word against his now how can i tell whos guilty and whos not since neither of you has a witness and haivel im not certain i believe your witness exists im left in the unenviable position of having to decide a case that has no easy resolution silence gripped the room perran noticed several people glancing sidelong at trika if those gathered to watch the trial were any example what levron had recounted regarding trikas manipulations in the past seemed to be all too familiar to the citizens of streamwood and now he had to make a judgment both had suffered losses but the reasons behind the vandalism of each mans property could be left squarely at trikas threshold not that they were innocent perran believed each had told the truth despite haivels story about his witness barro had seen haivel destroy his cloth haivel had witnessed barro shred his delivery of paper perran gathered the two receipts and set them aside now hear my judgment he said by the authority granted to me by the son of the sun whose rule of law emanates from vkandis sun lord i speak barro i believe your recounting even with no witness you have proved it more likely than not haivel destroyed your fabric for which you paid ten silver soleri therefore he will pay you that amount to recoup your loss barros face lit up and a smile touched his lips perran turned to haivel whose expression bordered on the shocked and haivel you also have no witness but you have proved it more likely than not barro destroyed your paper for which you paid ten silver soleri barro is ordered to pay you that amount to make you whole barros eyes widened and haivel lifted his chin and now perran said i come to the portion of this trial that strays from the normal path i usually take the two of you he continued have behaved poorly for men of your standing in streamwood now i understand or i can try to understand feelings of betrayal on your part haivel and the jealousy that followed and you barro you reacted in vengeful anger at the ruination of your property vengeance i can also understand however and here perran stared directly at trika who sat next to her father there is someone in this court who is ultimately responsible for setting these actions into motion trika will you and your father stand trikas face froze into a pale mask and her eyes darted left and right as she and her father rose i find you guilty of playing petty emotional games with these two men therefore in my authority as judge as penalty i fine you twentyfive copper soleri to be paid to haivel and twentyfive copper soleri to be paid to barro a muted gasp rippled through the room barro and haivel exchanged a glance then looked away trikas father glared at his daughter who had lowered her eyes to the floor no longer flaunting her beauty as a seductive weapon and perran continued i caution you trika to think how your actions can influence others emotions are easily manipulated in certain circumstances perhaps this will teach you to be more considerate of those around you and so by the authority vested in me i conclude my judgment in the name of the son of the sun and vkandis sun lord so shall it be levron had never felt more relieved to depart a town after a judgment he rode next to perran for the first time in two days feeling unburdened by what lay in the future i want to thank you again perran said i asked a great deal of you and i hope you understand the need what you told me illustrated in detail how people can behave so badly its always a shame to see these things happen but im willing to wager this wont be the last such case im called to judge only next time you wont be so intimately involved it was my duty levron replied warmth flooding his heart at perrans apology yes it was draining yes i wish i didnt know the three of them i will say this your judgment was superb i found it amazing to see how you dealt with barro and haivel fining trika the fifty copper soleri to be paid half to barro and half to haivel meant each of them left court owing nothing to the other and a bit better off besides perran chucked do you think she will have learned anything levron thought for a moment then shook his head probably not it will take more than a fine to change her unless her father reins her in at last perhaps it might happen one day when someone she truly loves spurns her he lifted his head took a deep breath of the fresh scents of the fields that stretched off from the roadway i will tell you this i never want to return to streamwood if theres another case to be tried there i beg you please find a substitute perran laughed and lifted the reins urging his mount to an easy canter levron touched his heels to his horse and caught up a smile touching his face warmed by the late afternoon sun chapter under the vale larry dixon misty and i are asked some very clever and insightful questions when were doing qa sessions at conventions one thing i invariably say is a star trek writer once told me i have one brain to get it right and the fans have a hundred thousand brains to find what i got wrong there are fans and there are fans and the true believers memorize every detail and how it all comes together and they make webpages trivia games and databases and keep track of all details we love that its awesome we put amazing levels of worldbuilding and research go into even the most casual mentions and tertiary characters well its amazing to us anyway we could be easy to impress we might be weak compared to a lot of writers especially roleplayinggame writers but it sure feels like a ton of development even when something gets just a passing mention or is glimpsed in the background theres been thought put into it plus there are injokes and metareferences and braided or circular storytelling that have as much to do with standup joke framework warmup first callout setup gag punchline callback as with screenplay or prose structure some person or building in the background might be important six books down the line in one interview we laughed and said we always have four pages of notes for a twoline reference this essay shows a little bit of what that forethought is like and you know what this is our job seven days a week writing and drawing and researching every single day and we still get things wrong all the time but i promise you we sure do our very best for you my specialty is the how and why things happen department here are some insights into the hawkbrothers the hertasi and just what a vale isand what its for about years ago from the current point in the valdemarvelgarth timeline circa perfect day and transmutation the paired disasters known as the cataclysm occurred and it was a mess a deitylevel impossibletofixinstantly mess the seventysome years before the cataclysm were called the mage wars because velgarths native magic fields had been harnessed like never before by cabals and individuals in the centuries before magic work had been at what might today be called journeyman level at best and those who used sorcery had few if any mentors spellwork was mostly experimentation experimentation was often lethal magery wasnt a career choice for a long life some of these early wizards did keep notes though and the ones that didnt die in a flash of mageshaped embers passed their notes along and so schools of thought regarding magic and what could be done with it led to those that could eventually be called adepts these mages often became more than tyrants and more than leaders they became strategic weapons alliances and onetime deals shaped the courses of tribes and nations alike just having the social favor of a mage could be enough to stop a rivals invasion of your duchy or hunting grounds a warlord of great strategic ability could employ a mage for tideturning battle tactics and the mage would be kept safe and comfortable by the warlord all the rest of the time everybodyand let me stress that everybodywho understood any sort of civilization knew that those who worked magic were to be respected the next turning point after adepts came very swiftly an adept could train others to do parts of spellwork and then combine their subworks into a great work this was first used to enrich an eroded floodplain while the barons men built levees to make use of the renewed soil this historic great work used just under sixty journeymanlevel mages and a single adept one of the journeyman mages was a very young man named urtho at this time the texture of velgarths magic was very rough it took a brute force approach to cause something to happen and great works nearly always resulted in serious injury for twothirds of the magic users involved because excess energy would manifest as light and heat very often spellwork simply wasnt worth the chance of losing a percentage of your mage teams to blindness and burns magework was reserved solely for things that laborers soldiers and engineers could not replicate and not incidentally wherever there was magic something was going to explode this was partly because no one had the slightest concept of static electricity and magework would sometimes create a huge potential charge that would ignite materials and gasses nearby that never helps other times enchantmentprone materials would accidentally get charged up and detonate this led to a brief and illadvised fad of naked spellcasting which ended not long after the first spate of fullbody smoking head and groin hair burns obviously comparing notes literally couldnt hurt a bold tradition arose by urthos doing that got mages together in salons to share their information freely about spells and energies regardless of their political leanings or ranks it was against common law even considered traitorous by some but the fear of and respect for mages were such that these salons were not once raided urtho was to put it mildly likable whereas so many colleagues were gruff or pained by old wounds or insufferably selfimportant urtho had kind eyes and a kind heart to match his ability to maneuver socially a knack for bribery didnt hurt either urthos salons became a movable feast that would travel village to city mage school to secret cabal and every year they became more lavish and the food much better mages were always wealthy the salons advanced magical theory to a level that might have taken a century more had they not flourished inevitably these gatherings collapsed due to schism and war but the world gained much knowledge and fewer explosions from them urtho gazed at an oil lamp one evening and mused if it were a bowl of oil touched by this fire it would explode but it is a lamp and the wick is restricted so only the wick burns it gives just a little light and heat and that is just what i ask of it urtho wrote this in one of his many notebooks unaware that by doing so he had just changed the history of the entire world and the spirit realms above and below it urthos great accomplishment in the years after the salons was to develop a set of weights and measures for magic use it all began with that first observation from the oil lamp his title mage of silence was because spellwork at the time put out a huge signature that could be detected even at long distances but urthos spellwork used exactly as much power as was needed and no more thus silence and others feared and respected the fact that urtho could have operations going and operatives active right beside them that they simply couldnt detect it became the bluff that saved countless lives magery like anything has its trends and fashions animal husbandry enhanced by magic came into fashion and from that came something called uplifting creatures could be made stronger and swifter yes but also smarter adepts by this time numbering in the scores and as influential as kings became bored with being the eras equivalent of field cannon several put their knowledge to work on improving horse breeds and others toward creating giant versions of small but deadly creatures like icedrakes the hertasi could be described as semisentient at the time urtho picked up where a predecessor of his khal herta had left off the wild hertasi were mildtempered reptiles available in large quantity living fairly simple lives after hertas experimental work hertasi had simple structures organized hunting and fishing and rudimentary medicine several of the bands settled at kavenusho were former followers of herta who adopted urtho when herta passed on they brought khal hertas notes and all of the hertasi with them knowing that the kyamvirs unified tribes would easily subjugate the hertasi if any stayed in their native northern swamps urtho took the approach of increasing the intelligence of hertasi social leaders encouraging them to breed with their subordinates and then increasing the intelligence of their offspring it created a surprisingly seamless acceptance among the hertasi for those who were far smarter than any had been before were their own children not strangers from an adepts lab part of khal hertas uplift process was instilling a mild compulsion in the hertasi to be appreciative for what they had become and urtho left that intact this lives on into the current timeline as the unstoppable helpfulness the hertasi as a whole have even the grouchiest hertasi knows that they owe urtho for having as good a life as they do interestingly that compulsion did not carry through into the tyrill the bigger siblings of the hertasi urtho constantly struggled with ethical questions of practicality and free will and when the compulsion bred out of the tyrill he simply let it go almost as if he were making up for its presence in the hertasi it is also important to mention here that urtho was but one man but the work of uplifting a species was done by a small legion of lesser mages working under urthos direction urthos greatest work the gryphons took forty years of constant design and spellwork by nearly three hundred lowerranked mages and each of them had a personal staff of helpers urthos tower had as many sublevels as it had floors plus scores of outbuildings every day urtho made the rounds of the workrooms and directed the swarms of probability sprites that tested each organ and behavior of the species urtho is the great mage who got the credit but thousands of others supported him including the survivors who would become the tayledras kalenel the goddess revered by the hawkbrothers is like every other velgarthian deity a nonphysical creature of limited abilities when the cataclysm was on their horizon the deities of velgarth could see that it was much more than they could handle much as a ships crew cannot stop a storm but can choose a course and batten down the hatches the deities that had genuine prophets knew the cataclysm was coming and could only adjust their sails so to speak the most compassionate of deities made plans and worked great magics to preserve their followers some deities to put it plainly blundered did not survive and are only remembered in historical documents the cataclysm was so horrible even for the gods because it consisted of one of urthos weapons that they knew little about and could not counter indeed to attempt to counter it would only worsen it as you may remember a spell is the use of magical and nonmagical physics in a structure to produce a desired effect a spell is a process not a thing its nearest analogy might be the construction of a simple arch bridge where specially shaped materials depend upon each other both to stay cohesive as a bridge shape and to perform the task of being a bridge urthos weapon was an unspell a selfsustaining disjunction in his words and it was not some nuclear fireball one might imagine from something named a cataclysm to continue the bridge analogy it caused the pieces of the bridge to cease to have a hold on each other the friction and pressure required to maintain an arch simply broke down into thousands of fissures and the bridge ceased to be a bridge catastrophically and then the debris from the bridge caused whatever it touched to disintegrate as the bridge did and so on like most things the mage of silence created it began slowly and it initially spread from its epicenter at a pace similar to a walk its wave peaks were higher and closer together at its epicenters each lengthening out until their bow wave reached a level of equilibrium where the arcs between magical materials were simply too far apart to sustain the effect the edges of lake evendim and the dhorisha plains resulted from the settling of debris pushed along by the waves when they reached this exhaustion the disjunction most simply put broke down the links between energy fields that sustained longlasting spellwork when a spell or items power was violently released its magical shrapnel struck the next nearest one and so forth therefore the enchantment that helped a land barge float would not just collapse it would fly apart in many thousands of strands that would grasp onto any other magical field or device in its path like chainshot they in turn would lose their cohesion and their own magical threads would fly out to latch onto the next device or mage energy and so forth throwing off light heat and debris the gross effect of this during the cataclysm was that raw strings of magic snagged onto enchantable material like say a good bit of hardwood or a sword with a wellmade crystalline forging and arced across them in heat and light while physically pushing them away from the disjunctions epicenter the ground lunged upward from magicinduced liquefaction while under the surface crystals and other enchantmentreceptive materials snatched up bits of loose raw magic and then exploded bursting from the ground at the next wavepeak the ground level dropped by as much as two hundred feet as the disjunction wave spread outward due to the sudden aeration and then collapse of earth what was left behind was not only tightly packed but in many cases entire acres were fused into glassine plates such as where a magical ax or bow once lay urthos tower itself though had been designed to collapse in on itself in a very specific way its hundreds of keystones were enchanted to project light most people thought of this as a mere convenience but urtho did this knowing that if the disjunction was ever unleashedand odds were if things ever got that bad it would involve the towerthe towers calculated implosion would safely entomb and preserve the chambers below it this is why the towers ground floor was so thick the southerly kavenushodhorisha crater was wider and shallower than the predainevendim crater because of the successful evacuations that took so much magical material away through gates the evendim crater was far deeper due to the cruder higherpowered magics used by maar and his followers compared to those near kavenusho its disjunction effect was far more violent enough so that the backlash from the expanding waves pushed up the earth behind it into what would eventually become the wracked islands at the center of lake evendim the ash plume from the craters rose for weeks and spread mostly to the southwest but over time they spread into a haze the world over dropping global temperatures for years the ash fallout took its toll but ultimately it helped improve soil quality all the way to the southern seas kalenels closest friend vykaendys took on all the people who gated into the area now known as iftel and created what was known for centuries as the hard border hiding them away from the world at large when the schism between the goddess survivors happened kalenel did what was within her power sacrificing much and nearly disincorporating doing so the seething chaotic spell strings already mutating or stunting what plant life remained in the crater were effectively gathered up by her by the creation of the dhorisha shina the plains of sacrifice in a great making and its excess energy bled into the pelagirs the pelagirs hills and forests already home to some very strange and deadly things before the cataclysm became a realm of terrors the wild magic scrambled the genetics of even the most common of animals and plants and it soon became clear to mortal and god alike that what would come out of the pelagirs could eradicate anyone and anything left in the world if left unchecked through spirit intermediaries the stareyed goddess in agreement with the wisest and besteducated souls of the spellfavoring clans developed ways to draw in the wild magic and apply progressively tighter forms of order upon it kalenel then faded back for several centuries leaving only her spirit representatives to help her followers while she recovered from the cataclysm and reached accords with the remaining deities the culture known as the tayledras arose despite staggering odds against them this can be attributed to an early cautious consolidate fortify and methodically expand policy centered around hawkbrother stations tayledras stations became known as vales after they adopted the practice of using ravines or narrow valleys for their foundation the hertasi discovered that using a ravine meant less sheer mass movement to create the lower levels and their cave and tunnel networks could be dug in sideways after shoring up the ravine walls themselves by compressing the stone erosion ravines became the sites of choice since a ready water supply could be channeled as needed and easily cisterned at the lowest level of the vale ravines or valleys were also chosen based upon their orientation so that the scatteredmagic refinement would more easily create ley lines in desired directions linking vales and future nodes to create a skeleton to aid future work this is why vales tend have an elongated ovoid shape in fact there has only ever been one tayledras station that was perfectly spherical its fields and tunnels extending as far below as above in a perfect circle khala the first vale long abandoned with its quiescent node intact underneath what is now haven the capital of valdemar tayledras scouts are known for being tougher than nails and for good reason essentially the pelagirs wants to kill everyone and everything the forest will try to kill by poison by gas by infection and pitfalls clouds of deadly insects or hordes of bugs that swarm and eat you while youre asleep thorns scratch deep and leave toxins deep canopy confuses direction and hides everything from giant spiders to hivemind boring beetles there are snakes slime molds decayed husks of housesized trees serving as dens for diseased monsters wolves anklebreaking vine twists and bottomless pits with possible packs of armored carnivorous wyrsa to complete the joy of each miles travel the most experienced scouts can cover an average of four miles through the pelagirs on their best day the question concerning the reordering of wild magic especially before the storms shouldnt have been thats all theyve done for a thousand years but rather they made it that far make no mistake establishing a vale is a fight and not always a winnable fight expeditions have been destroyed or had to fall back and try again sometimes as many as six times before a safe perimeter could be established the sheer mass of growth in the pelagirs makes a vale site hard to pick out but once a scout finds a likely candidate he faces due north and then stares at it committing it to memory then he thinks back along the path he took to get there upon returning to his home a dyheli stag will pull the mental images from him and share them with the senior mages and hertasi builders cartographers sharing these visions make notes and later consult with the scout to confirm the route if the site looks viable an expedition will go there often with as many as forty in the mixedspecies party the expedition will always include a team of hertasi stonecrafters with their powerful magical stoneshaping tools the party travels two days then stops for a night or two whereupon the hertasi examine the ground and pull up a protective stone wall still referred to as a palisade of bedrock pulled up into flat tall sheets about a foot at the base and tapering up to a few inches at manheight with two exits the excess heat from the stoneshaping is bled off into a pile of usually wet deadfall gathered while they begin and the heat dries the wood and then combusts it for the camps comfort fire these palisade camps are left behind as convenient waystations when the new vale site is reached the hertasi use their instruments to map the topography and then probe into the underlying rock bed if it is found to be of sufficient density the very first stage of vale groundbreaking is begun this consists of a very largescale version of the earlier camp palisades drawn up through all the dirt and plant growth one sharpenedtop sheet of stone is pulled up each day severing the root systems of the forest growth by punching upward like a stroke by a giant ax blade scouts dyheli and hertasi reduce the downed trees into usable firewood and lumber and make a first clear patch sheet by sheet these stone palisades create a wall around the eventual vale sitea relative zone of safety to live inside this invariably attracts creatures like wyrsa packs and anything starving and insane which the pelagirs never lacks living nontoxic trees within the palisade perimeter that can be cleared of dangerous parasites are left as intact as possible to become the host trees of ekeles useful bushes and vines are similarly left in place and this extends all the way down into the undergrowth of the vales ravine ideally a vale should begin with a ravine at least ten stories deep with a steadyflowing stream originating from mountain runoff or natural springs when the incipient vale reaches a state of defensibility and the mages confirm that it will be an effective site for the cleansing duties word is carried back to their origin vale and hertasi and others descend upon the trailblazed site in force the sides of the ravine are stonecrafted into a series of ramps switching back between platforms that support terraced gardens the ramps are for carts assembled on site and for the ease of any gryphons who wish to walk up or down gryphons are fine with climbing stairs but terrible at descending them so modern vales always use ramps but most especially for the incredibly swiftrunning hertasi dashing around the level resting places of each outwardfacing switchback is lengthened an extra ten feet or so to make landings easier for gryphons in modern vales while the innerfacing ones are covered by awnings the first stage of making hertasi burrows begins with creating guest apartments alongside the ramps these are not just a courtesy for the humans they are also where the hertasi stonecrafters get truly intimate with the rock around them probe spheres and spellwork imaging soundings are sent in from these locations and once the native rock is mapped and found to be worthy the apartments are given over to the humans and the hertasi burrow tunnelling begins nearby the burrow tunnels go level and deep in concentric circles around where the heartstone will eventually be placed once the vale is roofed at ground level a sturdy wooden bridge is built across the ravine its center pole marking where the heartstone will eventually be surveying lines radiate out from the pole and at equidistant points tripods with pulleys are set up from these the hertasis plumb bob drilling devices are slowly lowered they scoop up earth and rock as they drop increasing its plasticity and compressing it into the hardened sides of the shafts hertasi stand well back because the compression and tunnelling creates a lot of heat which fires up out of the hole in a jet when the plumb bob drill reaches a set depth it is powered down and pulled back up then a homing crystal is lowered down into the hole after a days cooling period and left there eventually between thirty and sixty shafts are made on either side of the vale each shaft with a homing crystal at the bottom these crystals are the targets that the sideways tunnelling will track on the hertasi use a specialized set of magical digging and stoneworking tools that include a cooler which comically looks like a spoon at the end of a polearm the cooler sucks away the heat given off by the other tools it is a vital tool as excavations increase in scale hertasi diggers start in from the valley side and aim at the nearest homing crystal then expand and reinforce the tunnel section once theyve reached that crystal then the next crystal is aimed for and so on and eventually a circular ring tunnel is produced this pilot tunnel is the reference ring and access for all the valleyside tunnel work that is to follow it is from this main ring that the vales water distribution heartstone cooling system and the radiating underground magical tuning channels are built up compressed hardened stone is scooped out as a result of the tunneling process and is in turn either reformed into marbled brick or ground into concrete one of the first durable structures built inside the guard walls at a new vale site is a charcoal oven one team splits seasons and stacks the local wood while a second team makes a brick kiln brick and concrete work better than stonepulling in many applications like pathways and once the tayledras scouts and the lesser mages have secured the area even the original palisade is ground down to make pathways if the vale site has good kaolin and clay in the area ceramic bricks are the top choice if there is a good source of lime nearby concrete is preferred if a coal seam can be mined the fly ash is saved for a particular type of structural concrete cement and concrete have been used for thousands of years in velgarth urthos tower at kavenusho was a triumph of architecture and concrete use hertasi usually do the brickwork and pointing at a vale site but even among the hawkbrothers there are human masons depending upon the regolith of the vale site the upper rooms and corridors in the ravines sides could have either a glassy or a ceramic finish caused by the compression effect of the devices firing the earth into a hardened crust this could be used to great effect structurally since the compression strength could be quite high once support ribs of a foot thick or more were formed convenient shelving is usually built between the support ribs the hertasi stonepulling devices of various shapes have the property of changing stones plasticity without creating a detrimental crystalline matrix more accurately stone pulling makes the stone draw like a pulled clay or molten glass into the desired shape and then the crystalline structure that gave the stone strength does not form until the stone is released by the stonepuller when stone is drawn out into its final shape the largearea stonepuller called the setter aligns the crystallization inside the stone from all the previous smaller pulls this is why the soaring bridges and buttresses used to create rooms and floors underneath a vale are effectively singlepiece structures since the setter fuses the subassemblies together into a contiguous form the setter also smooths out walls ceilings and floors some of the small hills and mounds inside a vale are actually hollow with multiple rooms created by stonepulling a dome and setting it and then building a layer of soil over the dome for landscaping hertasi are experts at disguising structures the tayledras famed bathing pools are stonepulled creations that make use of a network of heatregulating formedtunnel pipes that circulate water from the furnaces upward to the surface and to heatsink cisterns down the vales slope hot water is diverted to create artificial springs that bubble up to the highest level of the pools and then cascade over the sides to the progressively cooler pools bathing starts at the lowest cooling levels which is where the outright filth and dirt gets washed off then the next higher levels are cleaner warmer water until the highest level is reached where the hottest water and most of the socializing can be found the pelagirs are brutal and most of what sticks to a pelagirs traveler also stinks and probably carries disease or toxins so the hot pools are more than a hedonistic indulgence theyre vital for health and hygiene it is important to remember when you consider a vale that it is essentially a machine that houses a small city the tayledras adepts in particular are technical and procedural in how they harness and refine the pelagirs wild magic this applies to their delicate spellwork as well subterranean workrooms are isolated from each other and put behind layers of physical shielding ranging from lead sheet to embedded crystal dust mats so that subtle magic or miniature versions of great work spells can be laid out at low risk of interference the floors are inscribed with diagrams and reference points and their geometry act as an instruction set for what will happen during the course of a casting once the model is constructed the spellwork is diagrammed and hertasi scribes make records of every small detail since when a great work is played out at full size a small detail could affect an area the size of a city these scribed accounts form a standardized reference for every mage involved in the castings much as architects have multiple sets of blueprints and copies are eventually distributed to each vale and tayledras settlement hertasi being no strangers to magic use themselves and definitely no strangers to how hawkbrothers do things embed two or more of the main galleries of each vale with the workrooms gridwork for spell construction just in case some pelagirswide catastrophe should need to be solved by a largescale spell that for some awful reason could not be done above ground the arched galleries themselves are more than just to the short hertasi vast spaces to make bigger surfacedwellers feel more welcome they are also meant for evacuations every vale has enough room in the galleries to take in a complete vales complement of gryphons humans and other species plus their pets and bondbirds twice over with sanitation and basic provisions for up to six days fresh air is brought in from the lowest levels inside the ravine aided by waterwheels powered by the ravines stream and circulates up to the surface by convection beltdriven fans and the bustle of activity under the vale the hertasi motto we can do this reflects their inventive nature and their ability to define and produce solutions to problems of almost any complexity the walls of many hallways under a vale are covered in chalk designs open to annotation by anyone who passes them lists and charts of vale issues sometimes including tayledras personal relationships that need help line the major uprights of the galleries constantly updated by runners or hearsay as a necessity of the multilayered field integrity of the upper veil the vale has only two points of entry at the surface level these entries are always in the form of two spires curving toward each other at the top or a full arch field tuning rods are set on the outermost edges of the spires usually completely covered by greenery the veil is a set of shields each adjustable that form a dome over the vale the shimmer effect comes from convection heat transfer caused by the venting of the furnaces and often steam the veil thickness tapers from around twenty feet at the base of the dome to around five at the very peak it is not a hard shell type of shield but rather a set of resistive layers permeable enough to fly through with just the feeling of encountering a sudden stiff crosswind it can also be walked through slowly the veil functions much like an air curtain you might encounter at a supermarket and it blunts the effect of even the strongest snow and ice storms resulting in a warm rain inside the dome lighter rainstorms may not even penetrate the veil at all or might produce a pleasant mist unsurprisingly the veil is designed to absorb lightning strikes which the hawkbrothers believe a heartstone attracts its actually the static buildup caused by the veil itself that does it but the tayledras arent quite experts in electricity still the frequent ionization from the lightning strikes benefits the plant life below which is part of why vales are so lush with greenery strictly patrolled small wetlands are developed in the halfmile area around a vale host to rice ponds frog and fish farms and reed stands flax is grown between the wetland patches decorated trellises of grapevines encircle the vale but like many tayledras and hertasi designs they conceal another purpose the control rods that maintain the shape of the veil are in every trellis upright and the outermost ones begin the tuning process upon the raw rough magical energy drawn toward the heartstone from the surrounding countryside a hundred or more control stones are placed as decorations in the clearings surrounding the vale for a quartermile all around they act like a breakwater when there is a surge together these stones and rods act as a collimator accurately aligning and directing the rough magic the adepts draw in from the many miles around directly into the heartstone even a novice mage will tell you that the biggest danger in using magic power comes from using too much of it limiting the amount that is drawn upon is what makes the difference between a miracle worker and a charred corpse uncontrolled magical power manifests as excess heat sometimes in sheets and flares that cause clothing to combust and skin to burn an adept is respected not just for his skill at spellwork but for his skill at staying alive this brings us to the heartstone a heartstone is a physical object that acts as a capacitor for huge amounts of magical energy which the tayledras mages draw in through the breakwater stones veil curtain and tuning rods of the vale the intent is to take in the flawed raw random strings of energy align them and give that energy a stable place to stay however just like the individual strings by the billions are largely unpredictable so too can their flow into the vale be unpredictable tayledras mages work together because they can buffer each other from the surges of the rough magic through skilled use of shields the heartstone isnt just something thats left running and checked on once in a while a heartstone is crafted on site from rock excavated during that vales construction hertasi stoneshaping tools are used to create it and the most important part of the procedure is the monthlong pulling to align the stones inner crystalline structure to be as close to perfectly vertical as possible traditionally heartstones are sculpted as spires or obelisks and they have a broad base that tapers beneath the visible ground level into a rounded point that seats into a socket in the top of the vales great furnace the heartstones lower point flares off the excess energy below the surface of the vale into the bed of the ceramiclined beehiveshaped magicgrounding great furnace which is ringed by six to eighteen lesser furnaces each of them has check systems both magical and physical using series of diagonal sliding stones to handle the shock pressures and temperatures caused by these flares every furnace has a system of ceramiclined tunnels that circulate water often heated to live steam by the check systems these provide steady heat throughout the vale and tunnel systems as well as sterile fresh drinking water and they also supply the bathing pools several of the furnaces are used to turn sewage to sterile ash which is then sluiced down through the lowest level of the vale and out into the valley others are used for domestic functions such as garbage removal and cooking and at least one is always used for body disposal the great furnace always has at least two heavy adjustable accesses that are used to aid smelting glasswork and blacksmithing with up to six in the largest vales the smithing vents and lesser furnaces are used as inspection accessways when the heartstone is periodically put into a resting mode generally at the height of summer the great furnace slowly cools and adepts architects and hertasi go inside every furnace in turn to check and repair any structural problems replace any damaged slider valves and seal water tunnel cracks this is also a time for surfacelevel celebrations feasting and rest you can picture a functioning vale in its simplest form as making order out of a badly jumbled vector field and it can be seen more complexly as a tensor field with the control and tuning rods stones and spells acting upon magicalstring factors of stress strain and elasticity the area of that vector field increases over the years as the adepts reach out farther from their vale until ultimately the vectors within the vales reach are judged adequately alignedand the wild magic has been calmed time to move on fight monsters survive scout build another vale thats how it was for centuries the thing is now the hawkbrothers dont have to they have whole new problems though the mage storms of around years later were ripple effects of the cataclysm disjunction literally traveling around the planet and returning to their points of origin the mage storms were not echoed through time as some have said it simply took that long for the waves to travel that distance and by then they had changed from being disjunction disruptions into more like a strain or sieve effect you already know the story of how the mage storms were handled and some of the aftereffects the storms left available magic in a much different state than before for example gryphons whose wingbeats filter ambient magic to be absorbed and processed by their bone linings to produce the lift for their heavy bodies to fly now have an easier time than ever achieving flight since the ambient magic was now more evenly spread out and particulate just the same it created a fog effect for anything longdistance returning magework to a very personal level rather than worldranging this really annoyed a lot of people who depended heavily upon longdistance spell effects most notably the eastern empire and they were already pretty cranky it is vital to remember that unlike many religions of velgarth that have religious faith the tayledras and hertasi have absolutely zero doubtnot just that there is a goddess but that this goddess takes an active interest in them on a personal level there is no more crisis of faith in tayledras life that a deity is involved in what you do than there is a crisis that water is wet or that fire is hot every tayledras has a personal encounter with an aspect or representative of the goddess no less than once in their lives and usually much more often than that tayledras have stupendously difficult lives in some regards and while they train and strive to fend for themgelves sometimes it just isnt enough spirits of ancestors and fellow tayledras work in the goddess service these spiritssouls detached from physical bodies incarnated into spirit beingsare each assigned to multiple tayledras to watch over and help them through things they can not handle on their own however a direct intervention takes a lot out of them so theyll usually depend upon affecting something small in the physical world if a hawkbrother is drowning in a river theyll nudge over a weakened branch to clamber onto rather than teleport the person to dry land its also important to remember that while these guardians have otherworldly insights they are not omniscient and ideal and they can screw up to be utterly blunt at present the goddess kalenel concentrates most
