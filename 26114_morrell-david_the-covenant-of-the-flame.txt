david morrell the covenant of the flame to barbara and richard montross in memory of matthew saturday nights and a castle in spain if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned the gospel according to john prologue a fury slinging flame ash wednesday spain archdeacon ferran martinez driven to excess by his fervent catholicism preached increasingly inflammatory sermons against all heretics on march ash wednesday his charismatic hatefilled oratory aroused his parishioners to such a frenzy that they stormed from his church toward the jewish quarter of seville if not for the orderly minded civil authorities a massacre might have ensued instead two leaders of the mob were seized and scourged but their punishment far from being a discouragement to fellow bigots made the leaders martyrs and fueled the fires of their followers hate antiheretical fury spread from seville to neighboring cities and finally throughout spain with the terrible consequence that during the summer of an estimated disbelievers were executed most by beatings and stonings several though were put to the torch guardians of the faith france the religious mania in spain was not unique since the start of the middle ages a heresy derived from ancient mideastern theology had attracted so many followers that the church felt threatened the heresy known as albigensianism maintained that good and evil were balanced forces that two gods not one controlled the universe that satan was equal to in combat with and as cunning as the lord the body flesh was satans domain the mind the spirit was the path to salvation the thought of two gods horrified the church christ the physical incarnation of the blessed father could not have been evil a version of god in the flesh he could not have been part of the devils work when crucified he sacrificed himself to redeem his decadent children the heresy had to be crushed the resultant crusade against the albigensians was merciless tens of thousands died but the heresy persisted thousands more died until at last in at the mountain fortress of montségur in the pyrenees of southwestern france the last stronghold of the albigensians was surrounded assaulted and set on fire but there were rumors that the heresy despite the crusades brutality had not been eradicated that a small group of heretics had used ropes to descend from the mountain the night before the massacre taking with them a mysterious treasure and that this core of heretics had impossibly survived to disperse to burrow deeply their repulsive errors festering the place of burning spain the massacres at seville and montségur were but two examples of religious hysteria in the middle ages jews moors albigensians and protestants became the common target of a papally authorized purification of the faith its official title the inquisition the northern countries of europe rejected the inquisitions influence but italy england and france committed atrocities in its name nowhere else however was religious intolerance as extreme as in spain there the inquisition initially conducted by the sunkeneyed dominican priest tomas de torquemada resulted in tens of thousands of tortures and executions the intent was to educate heretics and to guide them toward the true belief victims had their hands tied behind their back from which a rope was raised the pressure on their shoulders excruciating confess they were ordered confess the victims moaned your heresy heresy the victims wailed raise the rope the inquisitors commanded arms were strained shoulders popped if the victims survived they were stretched on the rack and if they still survived but persisted in denying their theological error the inquisitors thrust a tube of cloth down their throat water was poured when the victims came near to drowning the tube forcibly extracted brought with it not only water but blood these victims had lost both their property and the right to question their accusers helpless they had only two choices to confess and beg for mercy but more important to implicate fellow heretics or else to insist that they were innocent that jealous neighbors had lied when informing against them to confess even if the victim was not a heretic brought the chance for freedom to insist that thered been a mistake to refuse to implicate others caused the harshest penalty at the quemadero the place of burning the accused were dragged from prison for their autodafé or act of faith all wore yellow robes and peaked caps those whod been sentenced to death had black flames pointing downward on their garment the others could still not be sure that they would survive only when they climbed to the scaffold would they be certain of the inquisitors judgment some a few were set free their confessions had been believed although penance would have to be suffered others were sentenced to prison a reprieve of a lingering death still others were strangled but the worst offenders were burned alive at the stake their ashes were scattered along with those of suspected heretics whod died before the inquisitors could question them even after death those suspected heretics were not immune their bodies exhumed and purified by flames this zealous protection of the faith persisted for a longer period of time than is generally realized for centuries from the close of the middle ages into the renaissance and then to the socalled age of enlightenment the inquisition enforced its beliefs only in was the institution finally disbanded officially at any rate but there were rumors one causes and consequences the lord is my witness one senate cleanair battle looms washington dc june ap in this years most tense confrontation between democrats and republicans the senate today begins its debate on the controversial barkerhudson cleanair bill which advocates that the nation not only adopt but exceed the stringent atmospherecontrol policies recently adopted in california our airs as foul as the smoke from a field of burning tires senator barker dem new york announced in a smoggy press conference on the steps of the capitol building yesterday take a deep breath that is if youre brave enough try not to gag we ought to be wearing gas masks and stay indoors the bills cosponsor senator hudson dem new hampshire added my wife and i went out for a stroll last night five minutes was all we could bear we rushed back home and made sure all the windows were closed igave up smoking a dozen years ago might as well not have bothered according to my statistics the atmospheres so filthy we inhale the equivalent of two packs of cigarettes every day if you dont care about yourselves then at least protect your children weve got to stop destroying their and your lungs the barkerhudson bill advocates a complete ban on smoking in all public places an exorbitant fine for car and truck manufacturers if they fail to reduce emissions within two years an equally exorbitant fine for industries that fail to reduce atmospheric pollution within the same length of time a surcharge on automobile license fees for owners of more than one vehicle a mandatory airexhaust filtration system outside restaurants drycleaners and two georgetown washington as was his custom the republican senior senator from michigan roland davis woke at six am careful not to disturb his wife he went downstairs made coffee fed his cat leaned out the front door to pick up the washington post and carried the folded newspaper into the kitchen the june sunrise shone dully through a smoghazed bay window onto the table davis sipped his steaming coffee put on his glasses spread open the paper and scanned it for any mention of his name he didnt have to read far the headline referred to the barkerhudson bill and in the ensuing twocolumn story davis was frequently cited as the leader of the republican partys opposition to an extreme repressive radical and economically suicidal approach to a temporary admittedly serious problem that requires time and care to be corrected davis nodded approving both his rhetoric and the reporters accuracy in quoting him he was fiftyeight tall with a full head of distinguishedlooking gray hair a patricians face and a photogenic slender body that he kept in shape by a halfhour daily workout on a stationary bicycle better get peddling he thought got a busy day coming up besides he was eager to watch the early morning news but first he wanted to finish the story in the post barker and hudson made more apocalyptic statements about poisonous air pollution contributing to the greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer increasing rate of skin cancer risk of drought melting polar icecaps rising ocean level state of emergency sounded like a plot for a sciencefiction movie davis snorted those democrats didnt stand a chance of getting their bill through the senate although he had to give barker and hudson credit they knew how to get the attention of the media and that wouldnt hurt come election time at least with the liberals in their districts or maybe their tactic would backfire nobody wants to reelect losers and barker and hudson were sure to lose today clean air great idea the trouble is americans didnt like making sacrifices what they preferred was for the people down the street to make the sacrifice every smoker multiplecar owner factory worker worried about his job everyone whose life style or pocketbook would be affected by the bill would urge his senators to vote against it hadnt barker and hudson ever heard of compromise was moderation not in their vocabulary didnt they realize you had to approach a problem one step at a time instead of jumping on it all at once davis finished the story pleased that hed been quoted once more near the end the voice of reason i think wed all agree the airs not as clean as it could be weve got a problem yes at least in some big cities at least in june through september conditions will improve though when the weather gets cooler that doesnt mean i recommend we sit on our hands but we cant change society overnight although my distinguished colleagues seem to want to do just that what we need instead and what i intend to propose as soon as ive evaluated all the statistics is a balanced moderate carefully implemented nondisruptive solution time air pollution took time to develop and it requires time to be reduced excellent davis thought the post gave me plenty of space and im sure to get even more press in michigan the smokers in my constituency will feel less put upon so will twocar families threatened with a surcharge on their license fees but most important davis thought the automobile manufacturers will be awfully grateful when they dont have to worry about meeting new restrictions on exhaust from their cars and their factories awfully grateful and mighty generous yes indeed the doorbell rang davis frowned at the digital clock on the microwave across from him whod be here so early at once the obvious answer occurred to him an eager reporter in which case id better make sure i look presentable davis used his hands to neaten his hair tied his housecoat securely left the kitchen and did his best to look cheery when he opened the front door abruptly he scrunched his eyebrows together because no one was there he scowled up and down the hazy street lined with elegant townhouses but except for a car disappearing around a corner he saw no activity who the why the suddenly an object on his doorstep attracted his attention a large manila envelope frowning harder davis picked it up peered once more along the street went back inside his house and locked the door behind him couldnt have been my assistant davis thought susan would have called first if she had something important for me to look at this early even if she didnt have time to phone she wouldnt merely have left this envelope and rushed away without an explanation troubled davis unsealed the envelope and pulled out several documents too curious to wait to go into the kitchen and sit down to read them he quickly scanned the first page but managed to complete only half of it before a moan escaped him jesus oh dear christ he rushed to finish the page and flipped through the others fucking mother of the documents provided dates places names and amounts every bribe hed ever received every illegal campaign contribution every expense paid vacation every and after the documents there were photographs that made davis grope for a wall to steady himself afraid that his sudden chest pain meant he was having a heart attack the photographs clear glossy professionallooking blackandwhites depicted davis and his gorgeous young female assistant naked on the deck of a yacht and not simply having sex but performing several illegal versions of it including sodomy and cunnilingus davis vividly remembered that exquisite summer afternoon he and his assistant had been alone taking care that they werent followed each had traveled separately to the small private caribbean island owned by one of davis s most powerful constituents theyd been assured that the island would be deserted but just to be extra cautious davis had taken the yacht out to sea where no one could spy on them no gary hart screwups for him but someone had spied on them from the downward angle of the photos davis concluded that theyd been taken with a long distance lens from a plane and the photos were so sharply defined that davis and his assistant almost appeared to be posing certainly their faces were easily recognizable except when davis had the back of his head to the camera while he hungrily burrowed his mouth between his assistants legs and damn it there was more after the photographs which made daviss chest heave no longer in pain but rage he shuddered at the sight of an unsigned typed note its implied threat as chilling as it was proportioned we suggest that you rethink which way youll vote on the barkerhudson bill davis tore the documents the photographs and the note into halves quarters then eighths the clumps became so thick that he had to subdivide them as he kept tearing all the while he cursed with furious quietude so he wouldnt waken his wife cocksuckers he thought dimly aware of the irony that one cocksucker the evidence about whom he wanted desperately to destroy was his female assistant at the same time he was also aware that no matter how many times he shredded the damning evidence his frenzy was useless because whoever had sent this package wouldnt have been so foolish that they hadnt kept copies yes whoever but there wasnt any doubt who they were barker and hudson davis shook with indignation junior democratic senators threatening a senior republican senator had they no conception of the power that a seasoned politician like davis could muster ill yes youll what exactly what will you do confront them reinforce the validity of their accusations no matter what you do to them its nothing compared to what they can do to you if they decide to reveal what was in this package your career will be finished ruined a joke then what are you going to do dear davis flinched as he heard his wife coming down the stairs in a rush he shoved the torn evidence into the envelope did i hear the doorbell davis s wife appeared at the bottom of the stairs her wrinklerimmed eyes were baggy her pudgy cheeks and belly sagged her white hair was in curlers yes love davis answered it was nothing just a messenger with some lastminute information about the cleanair bill oh my how tedious i wish they wouldnt bother us this early i know sweet davis said but it was important it made me rethink which way ill vote im beginning to sympathize with barker and hudson the children dear we have to protect the nations children we have to insure them clean air so they can have clean lungs but what about my generous supporters in detroit i guess ill just have to make them understand dear davis thought about the photographs about the arousing smell of his assistant yes thats right i guess ill just have to make my generous supporters understand three the amazon basin brazil a haze filled the sky juanita gomez wearing a long black dress fought to maintain her strength as she squinted through tears and a veil toward her husbands makeshift coffin yes be strong she thought her soul aching you must for pedro its what he would have wanted around her she knew her husbands mourning followers watched her as intensely as they did the coffin if she lost control if she gave them the least cause to suspect that her grief had weakened her resolve to continue her husbands work then her husbands enemies would indeed have accomplished what theyd hoped to achieve by killing him for pedro she thought be strong juanita was twentyfive short and thin with a narrow face and tawny skin she wasnt beautiful she readily admitted and had never been able to understand why pedro had chosen her her single attractive feature was her shoulderlength dark hair which despite the poverty of her diet had a sheen how pedro had loved to stroke it how hed bragged that their two infant children had inherited juanitas lovely hair what am i going to do without you juanita thought barely able to restrain the trembling in her legs but the answer it seemed she heard pedros impassioned voice inside her brain instantly made her stand straighter have courage juanita dont give up make sure i didnt die uselessly take my place inflame my discouraged followers say the words give the speech yes juanita thought and raised her angry eyes toward the thickening haze that obscured the sky the speech since her husband had been shot two days ago juanita had felt an overwhelming pressure of words inside her although shed never been gifted with her unschooled husbands amazing ability to speak in public and capture a crowds attention shed suddenly known that she had to make a pronouncement at his graveside it was almost as if shed been commanded to do so throughout the preparations for pedros funeral while his bulletravaged corpse lay on precious hardtofind ice juanita had mentally rehearsed what her compulsion dictated last night too distraught with sorrow to sleep shed perfected the words soon when the elderly priest finished droning his words over the coffin it would be her turn she would say hers pedro her beloved husband would speak in her with her through her and provided that she remained strong her husbands followers would subdue their fear overcome their discouragement and persist in their fight to save the land be strong the cemetery was ancient the majority of its wooden crosses listing from decay the graveyard stood on a barren hill that overlooked the shacks in the village of cordoba and the siltchoked mudcolored tributary of the oncemagnificent amazon river the silt was caused by runoff juanita knew by erosion when the rain washed away the soil that the roots of the former majestic forest could no longer protect because of the fires because of the slashandburn tactics of her husbands enemies those enemies had compelled the villagers to cut down the trees to set fire to them and to use the cleared land to grow more crops that was why a thickening haze obscured the sky juanita trembled with increasing rage because of the fires in the distance on the rim of the dwindling forest the soil was extremely thin even with the ashes from the trees and after a few years of intensive farming the soil stopped being fertile as a consequence more trees were burned more land cleared more crops planted until that soil too became infertile a sickening pattern of progressive destruction but there was even more sickening destruction juanita knew for her husbands enemies who owned the land forced the villagers to leave and brought in heavy equipment to stripmine the treeless land to get at the minerals beneath it in the end nothing of worth remained wherever juanita looked barren ugliness surrounded her the priest had almost finished his prayers juanita felt heat in her soul a furious need to turn to her husbands followers and say her words to urge them to persist in their fight pedro had organized these villagers convincing them to refuse to allow the wealthy greedy evil men in the nations capital to continue destroying gods creation pedro had learned from visiting foreigners what had they called themselves ecologists that the dense smoke from the widespread fires was poisoning the earths air the foreigners had also said that this largest forest in the world took something bad she remembered the meaningless term carbon dioxide out of the air and added something good what was it oxygen that if the forest disappeared which it would at the present rapid rate of millions of acres each year the carbon dioxide in the air would accumulate until the weather changed the temperature rose and the rains no longer came the world depended on this forest the foreigners had insisted the burning had to be stopped pedro had understood what the foreigners had told him but hed also understood that the peasants wouldnt fight to save the forest merely because foreigners claimed it was important to the world at the same time pedro had known that the peasants would fight to save their homes to preserve the rubber trees that gave them both shelter and the crop from which they earned their living to protect the river from the muddy erosion that choked the fish they depended on for food theyd fight that is if someone showed them how to fight if someone banded them together if someone gave them the confidence to realize that in numbers there was strength so pedro had accepted the challenge and for a time he and his followers had been successful forcing the enemy from the land apparently too successful for the evil men in the capital had sent assassins with machineguns to shoot to shred pedros body while he made a speech in a neighboring village and now the air was again thick with smoke once more the ominous fires burned you mustnt give up juanita heard pedros voice in her head you must continue the fight as the priest backed away from the coffin she spun toward her husbands followers about to raise her veil to let them see the furnacelike determination in her eyes to say her words but her impulse was interrupted her husbands followers distracted by a long black car that bumped unexpectedly along the dusty road and stopped at the base of the cemetery the villagers watched in confusion as a stranger got out he was a tall refinedlooking man in a suit as black as his expensive car his tie as well was black in contrast with his immaculate gleaming white shirt perhaps the only such shirt the villagers had ever seen with dignified funereal steps the stranger proceeded toward the rear of the car opened its trunk removed a cardboard box and carried it somberly up the hill through the smoky haze toward the mourners in the dismal cemetery please forgive me senora gomez the man whispered and bowed in respect his polished accent and careful pronunciation made it clear that he came from the city i deeply apologize im extremely reluctant to intrude at this sensitive trying time for you i extend my sympathies and offer a prayer for the soul of your brave departed husband i would not have troubled you but a man instructed me in fact he insisted that i do so man her back muscles rigid juanita studied the stranger with suspicion what man alas i do not know my client never told me his name yesterday he arrived unexpectedly at my office i own a limousine service in the city he paid me a generous amount to drive to this village and deliver this package this gift he said at this precise moment with greater suspicion juanita stared at the box gift what is it her immediate thought was that the evil men in the city had sent a bomb to destroy her in such a dramatic fashion during her husbands funeral that pedros followers would surely lose their will to fight my client would not reveal to me what was in the box in fact he warned me that if i unsealed it prematurely he would discover my transgression and punish me severely he assured me and instructed me to assure you that the gift is not a danger that instead youll find it a comfort juanita squinted harshly to drive all this way and on such a mysterious mission you must have been paid very well true senora as i confessed the fee was generous the man looked embarrassed as if comparing his fine clothes with the poverty around him with the strangers compliments senora juanita reluctantly accepted the box its size reminded her of a cake box but its contents which made a thunking sound were much heavier than a cake troubled juanita stooped to set the box on the ground beside her husbands humble coffin she tried but when her trembling fingers couldnt break the seal a villager stepped forward and used his knife to open it compelled juanita pried up the flaps then gazed warily inside at once she gasped the villager whod used his knife to unseal the box gasped as well with equal suddenness juanita moaned but not in shock instead in triumph she eagerly thrust her hands inside the box and held up its contents a human head the severed skull of one of the evil men in the city whod ordered her husbands death the head its features contorted grotesquely vividly communicated the agony that the man had suffered while being decapitated the skull was wrapped in a plastic bag the bag evidently intended to prevent the jagged necks blood from soaking through the cardboard box with a wail of victory juanita yanked off the bag grasped the skull by its hair and jerked it as high as her arm would permit so that all her husbands followers could see the wondrous gift that her unknown benefactor had sent the messenger stumbled back in horror a hand raised to his mouth as if he might vomit nearly toppling him the villagers surged forward to get a better look fight she screamed for pedro for yourselves for the land the villagers shouted with determination juanita swung the head toward pedros coffin my husband my beloved can you see your enemy dear father of our children you didnt die in vain we wont be beaten well fight well continue fighting well never stop fighting never until were victorious until the day the fires stop four the coral sea the south pacific the argonaut a supertanker carrying crude oil from the persian gulf to a refinery near brisbane on australia s eastern coast was three hours ahead of schedule clear weather and smooth seas all the way a completely uneventful voyage cant ask for better than that the captain thought his name was victor malone a twentyyear veteran of the ocean most of which time hed spent in the service of the pacificrim petroleum corporation he was fortyeight of medium height with receding brown hair and a stocky build although while at sea he seldom left the interior of his vessel his somewhat puffy face had a ruddy complexion in the supertankers bridge which despite its windows had lately caused malone to feel claustrophobia he checked the weather sonar radar and navigation instruments nothing unusual another ten hours and well be in port he thought certainly by tomorrow morning confident of a routine evening malone told his watch officer that he was leaving the bridge if you need me ill be in my cabin five minutes later after locking the door to his cabin behind him malone unlocked a drawer in his desk and removed a halfempty bottle of vodka a condition of malones employment was that he abstain from alcohol while commanding a pacrim vessel and for most of his career malone had abided by that rule guiltridden puzzled he wasnt sure when or why hed begun to bend and finally had broken the rule perhaps it had been the trauma of the divorce his wife had demanded three years ago after falling in love with a salesman in the realestate office where she worked in boston a man who shed angrily explained wouldnt abandon her for months at a time or perhaps it had been the lonely nights in foreign ports that had long ago stopped being glamorous for whatever reason a sip now and then before he went to sleep had turned into periodic secret binges in which malone tried to counteract the boredom of too many lengthy voyages aware that his vice was getting out of control hed tried to exercise discipline on this voyage and had indulged his need for alcohol only when absolutely desperate even so hed come close to finishing all eight bottles that hed smuggled aboard amazing how they go so fast he mused as he poured two inches of vodka into a glass and leaned back in the chair behind his desk he wished he had ice and vermouth but tomorrow morning after docking at the refinery as soon as his obligations were completed he would go ashore find an isolated bar where he wouldnt be recognized and at last be able to enjoy a martini again several martinis hed rent a room to sleep off his drunkenness and the next day return to work with no one suspecting that was the beauty of vodka it didnt taint his breath after what seemed a few sips malone was surprised to discover that hed emptied his glass confused he squinted blearily assessed the situation and decided what the hell were almost in port thisll be my last chance before we dock a routine assignment no problems coming up why let the rest of the bottle go to waste so malone poured another two inches into his glass and by the time he fell asleep a halfhour later the bottle and the glass were drained abruptly his watch officers gravelly voice roused him captain malone struggled and managed to raise one eyelid captain malone through his halfopened right eye sought the source of the voice and gradually realized that it came from the wall from the intercom captain were having some problems with our sonar reception with difficulty malone raised his head he shook it to try to clear his thoughts opened both eyes and blinked his vision blurry his glass fell off his lap as he lurched to his feet and groped for the intercoms speaker button uh yeah what uh what was tell me that again captain i said were having problems with the sonar malone rubbed his throbbing forehead problems what kind of intermittent fadeouts malones tongue felt thick he strained not to slur his words sounds like an that word was a tough one his lips were rubbery an electrical short thats what it seems to me captain ive ordered a maintenance crew to look into it good yes good a maintenance crew good let me know what they report captain i think youd better get up here absolutely i was having a nap ill be there shortly as soon as possible too many ss malone nervously realized despite his grogginess he picked up his glass rinsed it in his cabins sink and set it on a counter next he placed the empty vodka bottle inside his desk and locked the drawer better brush my teeth better gargle and wash my face but when malone scowled in the mirror above the sink the stupor in his bloodshot eyes appalled him come on he thought wake up he washed his face with hot then cold water and swallowed two aspirins with alarm he noticed that his shirt was wrinkled better change it he thought look alert from the intercom the watch officers gravelly voice blurted captain the sonar has failed its garbled voices in the background completely dead malone somehow didnt waver as he crossed his cabin and reached the intercom pushing its transmit button completely the screen is blank switch to the backup system i did but its not working either captain not malone inhaled dear god im coming right up with trembling fingers he fumbled to change his shirt as a lastmoment thought he splashed his face with aftershave lotion on the offchance that a crew member might somehow smell the supposedly undetectable vodka god was merciful no one saw malone stumble from his cabin grasp a bulkhead straighten himself and waver onward status report malone demanded when he entered the control room with what he hoped was convincing authority the same his watch officer replied both primary and secondary sonar systems are not in operation give me the navigation charts i assumed youd want them ready for you captain should i stop the engines no not yet not until we have to malone glared toward his officers what the hell was wrong with them didnt they realize how long it would take for the huge heavy argonaut to coast to a stop and after the sonar was repaired to regain maximum speed three hours were three hours ahead of schedule the refinerys expecting us well probably get a bonus for being so efficient but all well get is shit if we stop to fix a minor problem with the sonar and we show up god knows how late the lingering effects of the vodka were making him overreact malone realized but he couldnt help himself hed counted on reaching the refinery by tomorrow morning eager to relieve himself of his obligation to escape this massive vessel the walls of which had lately seemed to close in on him most of all hed counted on his reward the martinis he could almost taste them but captain without the sonar its just an electrical problem malone insisted the maintenance crew will find what it is and repair it he spread the navigation charts on a table and studied them noting the varying depths of the ocean and the pattern of reefs yes these waters were just as malone remembered to avoid the reefs in the torres strait to the north hed guided the argonaut around new guinea then southward through the soloman sea into the coral sea carefully skirting the great barrier reef along australia s northeastern coast once past the great barrier except for a few smaller reefs the ocean was clear all the way to brisbane what was our position when the sonar went out right here captain the watch officer said naming a latitude and a longitude pointing at the chart perfect malones skull felt as if a spike had been driven through it no problem then all we have to do is make sure to avoid these two reefs striving to maintain his balance he turned from the chart twenty degrees starboard aye aye captain the watch officer said he repeated the course correction to the helmsman who acknowledged his instructions by repeating them as well twenty degrees starboard malones hands shook as he lit a cigarette now lets get that electrical problem fixed hed amazed himself by thinking so clearly given his hangover and order some coffee up here itll be a long night ninety minutes later malone requested confirmation of the argonauts speed determined the tankers position on the chart satisfied himself that the first reef had been avoided and turned to order another course correction as he did so he bumped his cup of coffee knocking it onto the floor shit get someone to clean this up ten degrees starboard aye aye captain ten degrees starboard the control room became tensely silent the sonar screen flickered captain the maintenance crew has located the problem were ready to there the sonars functional i told you a minor problem no need to stop malone and his officers leaned forward to study the suddenly glowing console jesus someone said malone clasped a hand to his mouth the outline of a reef flashed before him at the same time a sickening rumbling crunch shook the supertankers hull as malone lost his balance and fell to his knees the coffee hed spilled soaked his trousers legs wet he gaped down in shock as another crunch shook the tanker the coffee so dark so much like five good evening this is dan rather cbs news the worst oil spill in history continues to become more catastrophic since striking a reef off australia s eastern coast yesterday the argonaut a pacificrim petroleum corporation supertanker remains in danger of sinking while efforts to contain its cargo have been alarmingly ineffectual an estimated thirty million gallons of crude oil now pollute the formerly pristine coral sea prevailing currents direct the spill toward one of the worlds finest natural wonders the thousandmilelong great barrier reef ecologists predict that unless a miracle occurs the delicate microscopic organisms that form the basis of the reef will be destroyed and along with those organisms the great barrier itself will be destroyed as our correspondent in brisbane explains yet another magnificent and irreplaceable glory of our planet is about to cease to exist six australia captain victor malone trembling haggard left the brisbane courthouse where hed been interrogated throughout the day about the mistaken directions hed given his watch officer to avoid the reef that the argonaut had struck ten degrees port hed insisted hed told his subordinates but ten degrees starboard is what his watch officer and helmsman insisted theyd heard fools no cowards thats what they were damned disloyal cowards they didnt have the guts to stand by their captain some of them even claimed they suspected hed been drinking a good thing no one had thought to test his blood until twelve hours after the accident the chemical analysis would be inconclusive if a small trace of alcohol did show up in his blood malone could always claim that hed had a drink to steady himself after the helicopter had flown him ashore as malone left the courthouse and photographers snapped his picture he raised his arm to shield his face and stumbled angrily down the courthouse steps through the crowd toward the car hed hired to take him away his muscles shuddered a vodka martini he kept assuring himself all i need is if i can manage to escape these bastard reporters a martini thatll set my mind straight malone jabbed his elbow into a photographers chest shoved the doubledover man aside oblivious to his anguished moan and reached the hired car but the dark sedan was empty where the hell was the driver sure malone thought the son of a bitch he ran the crowd made him panic hes a coward the same as my officers malone lunged behind the steering wheel slammed the door shut jerked the ignition key stomped the accelerator and roared from the courthouse while he veered around a corner grinning free eager to taste his martinis his body erupted as did his car the explosion which he never heard sprayed blood bone hair and chunks of metal for thirty yards in every direction the site of the blast had been perfectly chosen as dan rather explained the next evening it appears that the method was deliberate and selective no one else was injured only the argonauts captain died seven hong kong chandler thompson chief executive officer of the pacificrim petroleum corporation strained not to squint from the glare of tv lights while he stood authoritatively straight behind a podium on a platform addressing a throng of reporters in the conference room of pacrims headquarters fortyeight with stern chiseled features hed been extremely reluctant to agree to this press conference but the mounting furor about the disaster left him no choice he had to diffuse the controversy and bolster pacrims devastated reputation his thousanddollar suit was impeccably pressed hed made sure to button its coat before he strode with military bearing into the room and onto the platform were we aware that captain malone had a drinking problem no its stringent corporate policy that all of our crewmen abstain from alcohol while on duty and for twentyfour hours prior to boarding a pacificrim vessel do we test samples of their blood to insure that they abide by the rule its never seemed necessary our officers are rigorously screened before theyre hired we have utmost confidence in our personnel captain malones violation of the rules was a singular exception theres no reason to question the professionalism of our other officers but yes from now on we do intend to administer random blood tests to check for alcohol and drugs have we any idea whos responsible for the murder of captain malone the police continue to investigate it would be premature for us to make unwarranted accusations our delay in responding to the oil spill what delay the containment team snapped into action the moment we learned of the accident insufficient staff lack of training and preparation minimal equipment nonsense we were ready for any emergencyone at a time please i didnt hear the questionthats true several members of the containment team were at home asleep at the time of the accident but our nightshift supervisor immediately alerted them i assure you from now on our night crew will operate at the same strength as our day crew no unfortunately we havent been able to prevent the argonaut from discharging more of its cargo thirty million gallons to date i regret to say thats correct efforts to keep the oil from spreading have so far proved futile portions of the great barrier reef to my great sorrow have indeed been contaminated repeat the question please yes some containment equipment did malfunction rumors of disorganization confusion a twentyfourhour delay why didnt the argonaut have a reinforced double hull so the reef couldnt rupture the cargos interior wall before i answer further questions i want to assure you that the pacificrim petroleum corporation is a responsible publicminded harried movement on thompsons left distracted him a nervous pacrim executive stepped onto the platform hurrying forward with a folded note the executives face was ashen you idiot thompson thought youll ruin for gods sake dont you know enough not to interrupt me we have to keep up a show of confidence i was just about to repressing a furious scowl thompson took the note and mentally vowed to fire the executive the moment the press conference ended excuse me ladies and gentlemen thompson told the reporters straining to look dignified he opened the note scanned its typewritten message and instantly forgot his rage his heart pumped so fast that he felt dizzy he grasped the podium for support the note seemed to swirl our brisbane office reports kevin stark director of containment planning stark yet another executive whom thompson planned to fire the bastards preparations for controlling a major oil spill had been abysmally inadequate it was starks fault that containment procedures had been delayed because of insufficient staff and illmaintained equipment it was starks fault that the oil had reached and was killing the great barrier reef was found an hour ago drowned his body upside down in a barrel of oil reporters responded to thompsons evident shock and crowded toward him shouting further questions still dizzy suddenly thirsty he groped for a glass of water on the podium as thompson swallowed the water he noted its bitter aftertaste and abruptly gasped fire coursing through his stomach his legs felt knocked from under him photographers flashed more pictures video cameras whirred while thompson dropped the glass fell to his knees clutched his stomach gasped again and pitched forward dead before he hit the platform but not before blood spewed from his mouth spattering the front row of reporters eight houston texas virgil krause the newly appointed chief executive officer of the pacificrim petroleum corporation urgently thrust documents into his briefcase about to rush from his topfloor office in pacrims american headquarters an hour from now he was due at houston s intercontinental airport where a company jet made frantic preparations to speed him to hong kong krause was forty in excellent health known for his energy and resilience but already the shock of his sudden promotion had made him breathless hed been able to spare just five minutes to phone his wife and explain his new responsibilities she would join him in hong kong as soon as possible meanwhile krause anticipated an intense mostly sleepless flight during which he would not only have to review the mistakes that had caused the argonaut disaster but would also have to come up with solutions for cleaning the spill and avoiding another one more to the point krause wouldnt get much sleep on the flight because he feared that the promotion hed so often prayed for would be his damnation malone stark and thompson their brutal deaths had been as startling as the argonaut disaster will i be next krause thought his hands trembling as he shut his briefcase a secretary intercepted krause as he darted from his office this telegram just came for you sir krause crammed it into his suitcoat pocket got to hurry ill read it on the plane but the messenger said it was urgent he insisted you read it as soon as possible krause faltered yanked the telegram from his pocket and tore it open the three sentences made him more breathless mistakes demand punishment dont let the argonaut happen again the lord is your witness god bless one manhattan in her office on the fifteenth floor of a sootdinged building on broadway near thirtysecond street tess drake set a reproduction of a painting onto her desk the painting by an early nineteenthcentury artist was a colorful representation of a wooded slope in the adirondack mountains in upper new york state typical of his time the artist had idealized the wilderness making it so romantically lush so idyllic and gardenlike that the painting seemed an advertisement for pioneers to settle there an american eden next to the painting tess set a photograph dated of a similar section of the adirondack mountains because of limitations in color photography during that period the hues werent as brilliant as in the painting a further contrast was that the photograph didnt idealize the landscape but rather presented the forested peaks realistically the cluttered chaotic woods more impressive as a consequence finally tess set down a photograph taken last week of the slope depicted in the photograph and now the contrast was startling not because improvements in color photography made the hues vivid quite the contrary the image was alarmingly drab disturbingly lusterless except for a hazy blue sky there were almost no colors no green of lush foliage only a muddy brown as if something had gone wrong when the film was developed and indeed something had gone wrong but it hadnt happened in the processing lab it had happened in the air in the clouds in the rain this section of the forest had been killed by acid in the water that was supposed to nourish it the trees denuded of leaves looked obscenely skeletal the grassless slope cursed tess leaned back in disgust to study the sequence of images they made their depressing point so effectively that the article she was preparing to write to accompany them couldnt possibly be as strong although of course the article had to be written just as shed written god knows how many others on related environmental disasters in the hope that people would at last respond to the global crisis her commitment explained why despite lucrative employment offers from such mainstream publications as cosmopolitan and vanity fair shed chosen to work for earth mother magazine she felt an obligation to the planet granted she readily admitted it wasnt any sacrifice for her to be idealistic at the age of twentyeight while most of her contemporaries seemed obsessed with money she had the benefit of a trust fund from her late grandfather that gave her the freedom to be indifferent to the temptation of highpaying jobs ironically that trust fund provided not only independence but a motive for her to devote herself to environmental causes for the considerable money in that trust fund had come from her grandfathers extremely successful chemical factories the improperly discarded wastes from which had killed rivers and contaminated drinking water throughout several sections of new jersey and pennsylvania it gave tess satisfaction to think that she was doing her best to make amends she was statuesque fivefeetnine with cropped blond hair attractive glowing features and a sinewy sensuous figure that she kept in shape with a daily workout at a health club near her loft in soho her eyes were crystal blue her only makeup a slight touch of lipstick jeans sneakers and a cotton pullover were her favorite clothes she reached toward an apple in a wellstocked bowl on her desk savored the taste of the fruit sensed someone behind her and turned toward a man in the open doorway to her office working late again the mans eyes crinkled youll make me feel ashamed for going home his name was walter trask the editor of earth mother magazine he had his suitcoat draped over the arm of his wrinkled white shirt his top button and his tie were open fiftyfive portly he had gray thinning hair and paler gray sagging cheeks late tess glanced at her watch good lord is it seven oclock already ive been putting together my piece on acid rain i guess i got so involved i tomorrow tess give yourself a break and do it tomorrow the planet will manage to survive till then butyou wont last much longer if you dont go easy on yourself tess shrugged selfconsciously i suppose i could use a swim trask shook his head how i wish i had your energy vitamins and exercise what i need is thirty less years have you read the papers the murders at the pacrim corporation after the spill what do you think tess raised her shoulders its obvious oh the spill pissed somebody off sure trask sighed thats not what i meant do you think we should do a story on it earth mother magazine isnt a tabloid the spills the story not the murders theyre a sidebar a small one fanatics hurt our cause too many people think that were fanatics exaggerating the threat to sure trask said again but our profitandloss statements in the red if we could well never mind lock up when you leave will you tess and soon okay word of honor good see you tomorrow kid his shoulders stooped trask walked down the hallway disappearing a halfminute later tess heard the elevator descend she finished her apple assessed the artwork for her article and decided that trask was right she needed a break but the trouble was she knew that after her swim at the health club after a shower a walk home a salad a meatless tomato sauce on pasta with plenty of mushrooms onions and green peppers shed still feel compelled to work on the article so in spite of trasks advice she packed up her artwork and two boxes of research slung her purse across her shoulder hefted both boxes as well as her clipboard of legalsized yellow notepaper used an elbow to shut off her office light switch and proceeded along the hallway elbowing other light switches as she passed them a further nudge of her elbow turned on the intruder alarm stepping back from the infrared beam she fumbled to open and close the door which locked behind her automatically in a small waiting area she nudged her arm against the elevators button sagged against the wall heard the elevator rise and finally admitted she was tired fatigue or fate for whatever reason when the doors hissed open and tess stepped into the elevator she lost her grip on her clipboard it fell to the floor dislodging the gold cross pen shed clipped onto it the pen a gift from her father on the day shed entered college had bittersweet significance her father had never lived to see her graduate with a mournful twinge she pressed the button marked lobby felt the elevator sink and stooped with her purse and boxes to grope for the clipboard and pen bent over her hips angled into the air she tensed when the elevator unexpectedly stopped as its doors slid open she peered backward up past her knees and a man loomed into view casting a long shadow over her her awkward undignified pose made tess feel vulnerable at the very least embarrassed nothing like presenting my better side she thought but the mans goodnatured smile put her instantly at ease with a sympathetic shrug he picked up her clipboard and pen and although tess realized it only later his act of courtesy changed her life in nightmarish days and weeks to come tess would compulsively reanalyze these next few moments and wonder if shed never dropped her clipboard and pen maybe theyd never have started talking maybe none of the pain grief and terror would ever have happened but her conclusions were always the same events had controlled her no matter the horrifying results she couldnt have changed a thing any more than shed have been able to repress the immediate attraction she felt toward this man absurd illogical yes call it chemistry or call it vibrations call it a confluence of the planets or a merging of the stars whatever the explanation her knees had felt weak her groin warm and shed briefly feared that she might faint but instead of sinking shed managed to straighten face the man and keep herself from wavering the man was tall sixfeetone at least and tess who was also tall appreciated men whose shoulders werent even with her own he had healthy glowing tanned skin and squarejawed rugged classically handsome features his body was perfectly proportioned muscular yet trim his clothes were similar to hers sneakers jeans a blue cotton shirt the collar of which projected from a burgundy cotton pullover but his eyes though they were what tess most noticed they glinted with a radiance that seemed to come from his soul and their color was unusual gray a tint that tess had encountered only in the heroes of arousing romance novels that shed read with guilty pleasure during her middle teens as she tried to look dignified the strangers goodnatured smile persisted tough day not bad just long tess said the stranger pointed toward the boxes she held and apparently about to get longer tess blushed i guess i try to do too much thats better than doing too little the stranger pressed the elevator button marked lobby and narrowed his eyes toward her pen gold cross he said noting the manufacturers name the words seemed to have particular significance for him he attached the pen to the clipboard and gave them to her briefly their hands touched static electricity must have leapt for tesss fingers tingled you work for earth mother magazine the stranger asked how did you the labels on those boxes oh of course tess blushed again and you you came from the floor below mine theres only one business on that floor a tv production firm truth video right by the way ive read your magazine its excellent in fact im putting together a documentary thats related to your work a video on the lack of sufficient safeguards at nuclearwaste sites between your work and mine i cant think of anything more important than trying to save the planet tess nodded despondent if only more people felt the same way well thats the problem isnt it oh tess frowned i see so many problems which one do you human nature im not sure the planet can be saved tess felt surprised by his response the elevator stopped do you need help with those boxes the stranger asked no really i can manage then let me hold open the lobby door they emerged to frenzied pedestrians blaring traffic acrid exhaust fumes and a smogdirtied sunset this is what i mean the stranger shook his head sounding mournful im not sure the planet can be saved he helped tess hail a taxi peered around as if in search of someone told her god bless and walked briskly away blending with the crowd disappearing almost magically into it tesss fingers still tingled two the next morning standing in the lobby waiting for the elevator tess glanced toward the right noticed the stranger enter the building and felt her cheeks flush well hello again he said flustered by her attraction to him doing her best to hide it tess managed a pleasant smile nice morning isnt it though when i went for my run a breeze cleared the air theres still not much smog yet you run every day hey so do i tess said it shows tess felt her cheeks flush even more good for the body the stranger said good for the soul i try they lapsed into silence the silence lengthened this elevator tess sighed yes awfully slow but i do my best to take everything as it comes sort of like patience is a virtue the man debated lets call it a discipline the doors slid open there you see the stranger pointed everything in time they entered the elevator i promise not to drop anything tess said i was pleased to help but i didnt have a chance to thank you not necessary the stranger said youd have done the same thing for me tess watched him push buttons for his floor then hers and noted with satisfaction that he didnt wear a wedding ring the stranger turned i suppose if were going to keep bumping into each other we ought to introduce ourselves tess loved the way his gray eyes twinkled she told him her name or at least her first name by habit she deliberately didnt mention that her last name was drake because people occasionally associated it with her wellknown father and she felt upset whenever she had to talk about the brutal way hed been killed tess the stranger cocked his head and nodded beautiful thats short for theresa again she didnt tell the stranger the full truth although tess was sometimes used as a shortened form of theresa her nickname resulted from her fathers teasing practice of calling her contessa theresa when she was a child hed finally shortened it lovingly to just tess of course the darkhaired strikingly handsome man said theresa the spanish mystic the originator of the carmelite order of nuns tess blinked surprised i didnt know that is i wasnt aware of it doesnt matter ive got a knack for collecting all sorts of useless information and your name tess asked joseph no last name tess noted just as she hadnt volunteered hers the elevator jerked to a stop i guess its time again for my penance joseph said it cant be that bad last night i got the impression you enjoyed your work documenting the decay of the planet thats hardly enjoyable still i do get satisfaction from trying to accomplish some good joseph left the elevator and turned to her his face glowing god bless as the doors slid shut and joseph disappeared tesss stomach sank but not from the upward motion of the elevator three the next day friday tess became so absorbed in her article that she worked through her lunch hour at quarter after two the rumbles in her stomach made her finally decide that her concentration would suffer if she didnt get something to eat when she entered the elevator she thought of joseph descending it stopped at the floor below hers again she tingled no she thought this is just a coincidence but her knees went weak when the doors slid open and joseph entered he grinned apparently not at all surprised to see her looks like were destined to keep bumping into each other he pressed the button marked lobby hows your penance standing close to him feeling his arm against hers tess tried to control her breathing penance abruptly she remembered that hed used that expression yesterday oh you mean my work im doing an article on acid rain its going well cant ask for better than well i yes dont you think its odd to say the least that you and i decided to take the elevator at the same moment joseph shrugged the worlds an odd place long ago i decided to accept fate instead of question it some things are meant to happen like kismet or karma providence josephs gray eyes glinted late lunch tess smelled his aftershave lotion and couldnt keep her voice from quavering i lost track of time me too clock time anyhow theres a deli across the street care to join me gooseflesh prickled tesss arms only if its dutch treat joseph spread his hands whatever you like but for me itll still be a treat outside on the noisy sidewalk they waited for a break in traffic and darted across toward the deli the afternoon was humid the struggling sunlight dull with exhaust haze as tess reached the opposite sidewalk she glanced toward joseph and couldnt help noticing that just as the first time shed met him he peered around as if searching for someone in the crowd why she repressed a frown wondering influenced by her fathers habits did joseph think that he was being watched come on she told herself this isnt a secret meeting get real the brightly lit deli after the noonhour rush was only a quarter full our pastramis very good today the waiter said thanks no meat though joseph said id like your tomato sprouts and cucumber sandwich cole slaw how about a dill pickle might as well and a bottle of mineral water sounds good tess said the same for me when the waiter left she studied joseph no meat youre a vegetarian its not a big deal meat just doesnt agree with me besides this is friday tess a roman catholic thought she understood the reference years ago catholics had not been allowed to eat meat on friday but only elderly extremely conservative catholics still obeyed that outmoded rule and joseph like her was young enough that he couldnt have been conditioned to abstain from meat on friday for fear of committing a sin the reason i asked tess subdued her puzzlement is that im mostly a vegetarian too well thats something else we share in common like being roman catholic joseph frowned what makes you think im a catholic no meat on friday ah joseph said i see no i dont belong to that religion sorry i apologize i guess im asking too many questions dont worry about it im not offended then as long as im if you dont mind let me ask you something else tess said im waiting why did you look so nervous when you crossed the street joseph laughed in new york with all the junkies and crazy drivers who doesnt look nervous one more question sure would you like to see me tomorrow tesss boldness surprised her her heart skipped would joseph concentrated peered down at the table toyed with his knife and fork then focused his intense gray eyes upon her of course id enjoy your company very much tess exhaled but i have to be honest damn tess thought here it comes this is what i was afraid of a man this gorgeous hes probably going to tell me hes involved with someone by all means she straightened and pressed her hands on the table preparing herself i appreciate honesty we can only be friends im not sure what what i mean is we can never be lovers his frankness startled her hey tess said i wasnt making a proposition its not like i asked you to go to bed i know that really your behaviors impeccable joseph reached across the table and tenderly touched her hand she noticed he had a jagged scar on the back of his wrist i didnt mean to offend or embarrass you its just that there are certain things about me you wouldnt understand i think i do understand oh youre gay is that it joseph laughed not at all i mean it wouldnt bother me or anything if you are gay id just like to know i dont want to make a bigger fool of myself than i already have believe me tess im not gay and you havent made a fool of yourself then maybe youve had some kind of accident and you mean have i been emasculated hardly the truth is im extremely flattered that you want to spend time with me but i have certain well lets call them obligations i cant explain what they are or why i have to abide by them you just have to trust and believe and accept the point is i welcome your friendship friendship tess squirmed i once got rid of a persistent boy in high school by telling him that i only wanted him as a friend but this isnt high school joseph said if you want my companionship and id enjoy yours i hate to sound formal but those are my terms listen tess bit her lip maybe we ought to forget it why because you cant imagine a male and female relationship that doesnt result in sex joseph asked god i feel like such an idiot dont joseph said youre a healthy intelligent attractive woman with normal desires but imjosephs gaze intensified totally different youll get no argument and maybe thats whyshe couldnt believe she was saying this i want to be with you platonically joseph said all right sure for now but who knows no tess not just for now but always trust me that way is better why because its eternal youre the strangest man i ever met tess said ill accept that as a compliment okay tess increased her resolve what time tomorrow ten am joseph suggested the upper east side carl schurz park off eightyeighth street next to the mayors house i know it theres a jogging track beside the river since we exercise every day we might as well do it together swell tess said so we jog and i work off my attraction to you exercise works wonders my platonic friend maybe for you joseph grinned with good nature its like a cold shower i have to warn you tess said ill do my best to tempt you it wont do any good joseph said really im untemptable i consider that a challenge four even at ten am the jogging track off the wooded park next to the east river was crowded the absence of commuter traffic freed the air of smog and exposed an unfamiliar glorious sky senior citizens sat on benches enjoying the weekends peace on the left in a court past a waisthigh wrought iron fence teenagers played basketball sunbathers spread blankets on grass enjoying the unusually intense june sun people walked dogs through the trees what a gift tess thought what a beautiful day how rare shed worn a blue jogging suit that complemented the turquoise color of her eyes although loose it managed to reveal her figure her lean lithe body and firm upwardly tilted breasts a red sweatband encircled her forehead emphasizing her short blond hair she leaned her taut hips against the railing that separated the jogging track from the river and studied the runners surging past many of whom listened to earphones attached to miniature radios strapped to their waists her own preference was not to be distracted by music but instead to devote herself exclusively to the high she gained from prolonged exercise the zenlike pleasure on the runners sweating faces made her eager to join them soon she thought joseph will be here anytime as she waited she continued to be amazed by her irresistible attraction to him certainly he was goodlooking but tess had gone out with many goodlooking men and had never felt so intense an identification with them most had been so aware of their looks that she couldnt bear their egos shed discovered that one had been seeing three other women while pretending that tess was the only woman he cared about another had been an upandcoming tv executive whose primary interest in tess was having someone to tell him how great he was while he gained power for the past six months she hadnt gone out with anyone maybe that explained her attraction to joseph tess thought a combination of overwork and loneliness but the more she considered that explanation the more she dismissed it there was something she couldnt find the proper words different about him a handsome man who wasnt in love with his handsomeness who treated her with deference who was easy to talk to who related to her as a human being not a potential sexual conquest all of that certainly counted even so shed never before been this insistent and candid to a man about her interest in him why there was something else about him what was it the unfamiliar sensation not only puzzled but disturbed her she didnt know which direction joseph would come from right or left or straight ahead through the wooded park so she turned her gaze often watching for him we should have chosen a specific spot to meet she decided and continued to scan the crowd still theres no one nearby on either side of me joseph shouldnt have any trouble noticing where i am because shed looked forward to spending time with him tess had arrived here early at quarter to ten but now as she glanced at her joggers watch she was troubled to see that it was quarter after ten had they failed to see each other she studied the crowd more intensely then her watch showed halfpast ten and with frustrating slowness eleven oclock and she told herself that something important must have delayed him but when her watch showed eleventhirty then noon she angrily understood the explanation for his absence this had happened to her only once in her junior year of college her date having gotten so drunk at a saturday afternoon frat party that hed become too sick to take her to a movie that night and hadnt bothered to phone to explain he wasnt coming that had been the end of that relationship and now joseph too had stood her up she couldnt believe it disappointment fought with fury fury won the son of a hed seemed too good to be true and thats exactly what he was tess we can only be friends well buddy you blew it were not friends seething tess joined the stream of joggers too distraught to bother with the preliminary ritual of stretchandwarmup exercises her anger so fueling her long urgent stride that she outdistanced the fastest runners bastard five sunday was dreary a dismal rain reinforced tesss depression barefooted wearing the shorts and rumpled tshirt that shed slept in she sipped from a steaming cup of strong black coffee and scowled from a window of her loft in soho three floors down across the street a drenched pathetic cat found shelter under a seesaw in a small playground behind her the tv was on a cable news network anchorwoman somberly reporting the latest environmental disaster in tennessee a train pulling twenty cars of anhydrous ammonia a toxic gas shipped in the form of pressurized liquid and used in the manufacture of fertilizer had reached a rural section of illmaintained tracks and toppled down an embankment the tanks had burst and the cargo had vaporized spewing a massive poisonous cloud that so far had killed the entire train crew sixteen members of families on local farms dozens of livestock hundreds of wild animals and thousands of birds a northeastern wind was directing the dense white cloud toward a nearby town of fifteen thousand people all of whom were fleeing in panic emergency workers were powerless to stop the cloud and unprepared to organize so huge an evacuation at last count eight motorists had been killed and another sixteen critically injured in car accidents due to the chaos of the towns frantic attempt to escape eventually the anchorwoman reported the heavy gas would settle to the ground but paradoxically although anhydrous ammonia was used to make fertilizer it wouldnt benefit the land not unless diluted instead its present extremely concentrated nitrogen level eightytwo percent would sear hundreds of acres of woodland as well as destroy crops and become absorbed into streams wells ponds and reservoirs poisoning the towns water supply tess drooped her shoulders turned off the tv and frowned up toward the monotonous unnerving gusts of rain on her skylight she shuddered with the realization of how even more disastrous almost unimaginably so the accident would have been if it had happened near a major urban area one day though thats exactly where it will happen she knew because of carelessness poor planning badly maintained equipment government lethargy greed stupidity overpopulation and tess shook her head so many reasons too many piece by piece the earth was dying and there didnt seem any way to stop it a line from one of yeatss poems occurred to her things fall apart the center cannot hold she felt exhausted abandoning her plan to go to her health club this morning she decided she needed a long hot bath ive been pushing myself too hard what i ought to do is curl up in bed and read the sunday times but the news would only depress her further she knew then watch some old movies she told herself rent some cary grant screwball comedies but she doubted that shed do much laughing how could she laugh when without minimizing the gravity of what had happened in tennessee she admitted reluctantly that part of her depression was the consequence of her bitterness that joseph had failed to meet her yesterday her anger still smoldered why would he joseph hadnt seemed the type to be rude okay i admit i came on awfully strong i kept trying to get him to say that we could be more than friends i overreacted i probably scared him away in that case her indignation flared the least joseph could have done was phone and explain that he had second thoughts and didnt plan to show up he didnt need to keep me waiting phone you tess suddenly thought your number isnt listed and even if it were you never told him your last name for all you know he had a legitimate reason not to meet you but he didnt have a way to get in touch and let you know should i swallow my pride and call him dummy you dont know his last name any more than he knows yours six monday selfconscious tess almost expected to see joseph enter the lobby while she waited for the elevator but this time a coincidence didnt happen in her office she tried to concentrate on her article glancing frequently from her computer toward the telephone whenever it rang she tensed hoping it would be joseph disappointed when it wasnt by eleventhirty frustration made her check the yellow pages for truth videos number she picked up the phone only to slam it down whats wrong with me im the one who got stood up why should i call him have i lost my pride do i need to beg for an apology at two when she went for lunch she again wondered if shed see him in the elevator but the car passed truth videos floor without stopping on impulse she decided to eat at the deli across the street no sign of joseph thinking of him she ordered what both of them had eaten on friday a tomato sprouts and cucumber sandwich she didnt see him waiting back at the elevator didnt receive a call from him in her office and didnt cross paths with him when she left the building just after seven screw him he had his chance but tuesday when she still didnt see him and he still didnt phone she banged down the gold cross pen shed been using to edit the printout of her manuscript and decided that an apology was exactly what she wanted in fact she demanded it not on the phone though no by god she wanted to see him squirm she wanted him to the son of a bitch had to apologize in person seven truth video had a narrow reception area separated from its offices by a thick glass wall and door a secretary peered up from a desk and spoke to tess through a slot in a window her hand poised to press a button that would free the electronically controlled lock on the door may i help you tesss determination wavered dont be a fool hell think youre think im what chasing him he should be so damned lucky taking a breath tess forced herself to look businesslike not at all angry inwardly though she smiled when i see the creep when the secretary hears what i tell him and the gossip gets around by all means yes im looking for a man who works here i dont know his last name but his first names joseph the receptionist nodded although her eyes looked puzzled theres only one joseph who works here you must mean joseph martin martin tess mentally repeated the name early thirties tall trim dark hair gray eyes yeah thats him all right well if he hasnt gone to lunch would you kindly tell him id like to speak with him sorry the receptionist frowned i dont know if hes having lunch but he certainly isnt here great then ill try again later any idea when hell be back well thats the question isnt it i dont understand joseph hasnt reported for work since he left the office on friday what we havent seen him yesterday or today the receptionist said he didnt call in to tell us he was sick or had a family emergency or he just never showed tess felt offbalance the editing departments been frantic to meet a deadline without his help and tesss anger no longer mattered she pressed her fingertips against the window why didnt you phone him thats another problem if hes got a phone he never put its number on his employment sheet the receptionist studied her are you a friend of his in a strange sort of the receptionist shrugged it figures josephs strange enough look if you run into him why not give us a break and tell him to call we cant find his notes for the project were working on the editing departments climbing the walls to find those notes and meet their deadline but didnt anyone go to josephs home the receptionist strained to look patient i told you we cant find his notes but the messenger we sent over says that no one lives at the address joseph gave us whats the address it doesnt matter the receptionist said believe me it wont help tess again raised her voice i asked you whats the address the receptionist tapped her pen against her chin youre wasting your time but if it means that much to you it does mean that much to me you sure must be a friend of his the receptionist exhaled flipped through a rolodex and gave an address on broadway tess scribbled it down im telling you though the receptionist said its i know a waste of time eight but when tess got out of the taxi to confront the blaring horns and noxious fumes of congested traffic on broadway near fiftieth street she began to wonder comparing the address on the dismal building before her to the numbers shed written on her notepad she understood with belated apologies to the receptionist why shed been told shed be wasting her time the building had a touristtrap overpricedcameraandelectronics shop on the bottom floor the second floor had a dusty window with a sign sexual educators the thirdfloor windows were all painted black god alone knew what they hid but tess braced her shoulders determined to find out because the address shed been given had specified a number on the third floor she stepped around a drunk or more likely a junkie passed out on the sidewalk entered a hallway that stank of urine climbed equally foulsmelling stairs mustered the confidence to ignore the oppressive absence of lights and reached the gloomy third floor the names of businesses on various doors reinforced her increasingly despondent certainty that this building was strictly commercial that neither joseph nor anyone else would have an apartment here but then why she brooded convinced that something was wrong had joseph told his employer that this was his address she found an open door with a number on its grimy frosted glass that matched the thirdfloor number on her notepad inside she studied a frizzyhaired woman with too much lipstick who sat behind a desk the woman chewed gum while reading a paperback on every wall from floor to ceiling there were eightinchsquare cubicles with closed metal hatches that had numbers and locks tess haltingly approached the desk the woman kept reading excuse me tess said the woman turned a page tess cleared her throat if you dont mind the woman splayed her book on the desk and frowned upward im looking for tess shook her head there isnt a sign on the door what kind of business is this the woman gnawed her gum a mail service i dont like a postoffice box the mailman brings it i sort it i put it in those slots the customers pick it up have you ever heard of im looking for a man named joseph martin sorry it doesnt ring any bells maybe if i described him honey the woman raised a chubby hand before you get started im just a temp the regular gal got sick appendix or something i dont know any joseph martin but he told his employer that this is where he lives the woman chortled sure maybe he sneaks in at night and sets up a cot come on i told you this is a mail service what this martin guy probably meant was this is where he wanted his check sent tesss pulse quickened if hes one of your customers maybe yes maybe no i just started this morning no one named joseph martin came in but if he is a customer could you find out if he picked up his mail on saturday or monday the woman squinted nope why not because that informations confidential honey when i started this morning the guy who hired me made sure i got two points first i have to get id from customers before i let them unlock their box and second im not allowed to give out information about the clients theres too many process servers the woman eyed tess with suspicion im not a process server so you say look im just worried about my friend hes been missing since friday and you say me i have to protect my buns if this gal i replaced gets sick enough to quit or die or something maybe i can make this a permanent job so why not get lost huh for all i know you work for my boss and he sent you here to check out if im doing what he told me so look for your friend somewhere else nine in a taxi on the way back to work tess trembled frustrated she tried to assure herself that shed done her best if joseph decided to quit his job and drop out of sight that wasnt her concern she told herself but despite her insistence she couldnt ignore the queasy churning in her stomach suppose josephs disappearance had something to do with her dont kid yourself she thought nobody quits his job just to escape a woman who was too insistent about starting a relationship anyway joseph didnt quit his job the receptionist at truth video said he never called in to explain why he wouldnt be at work so what that doesnt prove a thing lots of people quit their job without calling in to say theyve quit they just never show up again but joseph didnt seem that irresponsible tess thought sure just like he didnt seem the type to stand you up stop being naive you met him only three times you really dont know anything about him you admitted in fact you told him hes the strangest man you ever met even the receptionist at truth video called him strange and maybe thats why youre attracted to him tess bit her lip admit something else youre concerned because you think something might have happened to him for all you know hes sick at home too weak to phone for help that explanation would certainly soothe your wounded pride tess sagged in the back seat of the taxi whats wrong with me do i actually hope hes too sick to make a phone call on the taxis radio an announcer gave a tense update about the toxicgas disaster in tennessee three hundred dead eight hundred critically injured fields littered with thousands of dead animals and birds already the forests and crops were turning brown from the caustic effects of the poisonous clouds searing nitrogen the environmental protection agency among many other government agencies had rushed investigators to the nightmarish scene with orders to search for the cause of the trains derailment their conclusions so far according to an unnamed but highly placed informant indicated that budget cuts at the financially troubled tennessee railway had resulted in understaffed maintenance crews the railways owner could not be reached for comment although rumors suggested that his recent divorce costly and caused by an affair with one of his secretaries had distracted him from crucial business decisions as well the foreman of the maintenance crew was reputed to have a cocaine addiction jesus tess thought while im worrying about a possibly sick man who stood me up the planet gets worse a gruff voice intruded on her thoughts what tess straightened im sorry i didnt lady the taxi driver scowled i told you were here you owe me four bucks ten surprised to discover that shed been gone from the office for almost two hours tess tried to concentrate on the revisions shed made in her article but as she jotted notes for a possibly stronger last paragraph she found herself staring at her gold cross pen she remembered the day her father had given it to her and how dropping it had been the catalyst that brought joseph and her together abruptly she stood left her office proceeded along a row of other offices and stopped at the end of the corridor at the open door of the final office with equal suddenness she felt her determination wither because what she saw was walter trask the fiftyish portly avuncular editor of earth mother magazine hunched over his desk rubbing his temples and shaking his head at what looked like financial statements tess turned to leave but trask must have felt her presence shifting his worried gaze toward the open door he changed expressions and smiled hey kid how are you tess didnt answer come on whats the matter trask leaned back and raised his hands youre always so cheery it cant be that bad get in here sit stretch your legs talk to me tess frowned and entered what is it trask raised his eyebrows trouble with your article trouble yes she sank toward a chair but not with the article which means it might be trask raised his eyebrows higher personal tess felt a greater hesitation this is embarrassing maybe i shouldnt have nonsense thats why my door is always open personal problems always result in professional problems when my staffs unhappy the magazine suffers talk to me tess you know im fond of you think of me as a confessor and i hope i dont need to add anything said in this room believe me goes no farther tess tried not to fidget given her late fathers background she knew she ought to be more sophisticated about certain matters what i wanted to ask you know these companies that hold mail for people trask narrowed his gaze emphasizing the furrows around his eyes hold mail for people sort of like postoffice boxes except theyre not in a post office ah yes now i mail services sure trask said what about them tesss stomach hardened who uses them why trask leaned forward considered her then ordered his thoughts that all depends quickbuck mailorder outfits for one the kind that advertise in the back of supermarket tabloids and sex magazines you want a genuine world war two nazi bayonet or an inflatable lifesized anatomically correct female doll what you do is send your check to suchandsuch an address the creep who placed the ad picks up his mail at one of those services lets the scam last three or four months until he figures his customers are impatient enough to call the police and then he skips town with all the cash of course there were never any bayonets or inflatable dolls but tess gripped her thighs why make it so complicated why not just use an official postoffice box because trask raised his shoulders i know this is hard to imagine some people who read those ads in the tabloids and magazines are smart enough to smell a scam if the company theyre tempted to send the check to doesnt have a permanentlooking address besides those con artists risk being charged with mail fraud the last thing they want is to go near a post office where a clerk might wonder about hundreds of letters addressed to vaguely suggestive names world war two collectibles and home anatomical education okay tess frowned in a sick way that makes sense but surely there are other reasons to use these places she suddenly remembered what the frizzyhaired woman had told her to stay away from process servers you figured that out you bet trask said a guy whos afraid of being served with a summons to testify in court or whos running from a lawsuit or who hasnt been paying his child support and doesnt want his wife to know where he lives tess considered and shook her head i still dont wouldnt a process server merely wait around until his target came in to get his mail process servers get paid for results trask said they know a mail drops trouble i mean they could wait around for days maybe weeks and still not if someones really nervous about being found all he has to do is pay to have the service forward his mail to another address mind you there are legitimate reasons to use a mail service instead of a postoffice box tess waved her hands for trask to continue why is this so important to you trask asked please okay so maybe your job takes you out of the country a lot and you dont want to depend on the post office to forward your mail or maybe you live in another state but for legal reasons you need a corporate address in new york city or maybe you own a legitimate mailorder business but youre well aware of the resistance that potential customers have to temporarylooking postofficebox numbers there are many legitimate reasons but basically in my experience seven times out of ten someone uses a mail service because they dont want anyone to know where they live you got it trask said tess stared at her gold cross pen thanks whatever your problem is listen kid i dont want to pry but i hate to see you looking so dejected since ive answered your question return the favor and answer mine i might be able to help why is this important to you tess slumped shaking her head i its just that well i found out a friend of mine at least sort of a friend uses one of these services a friend trask assessed the word are you saying this friends a man tess nodded glumly oh trasks voice dropped i was supposed to meet him on saturday but he didnt show up and he didnt report for work this week oh trasks voice dropped lower and now im trying to find out why be careful tess i cant help it my prides involved i need to know what happened to him well maybe trask sighed what this is just a guess but it could be you dont want to hear tell me maybe if he didnt want someone to find him whoever he didnt want to find him an exwife who hasnt been getting her alimony for instance might have gotten too close its possible your friend was forced to move on tess shoved her pen in her purse im sorry i interrupted you thanks walter ive taken too much of your time ill let you get back to work she stood no tess please wait i told you i might be able to help perhaps you didnt know but before i founded earth mother magazine when i worked for the times i was their expert in tracking down reluctant sources then how do i find him top line first given the implications of the mail service your friend used are you absolutely sure you want to find him think it over yes im sure should i take it that means youre in love with him tess hesitated yes no maybe she swallowed despite a constriction in her throat im so confused god help me what i do know is im worried about him and i want to be with him a clear enough answer okay my friend i could write down a list of people and places for you to check but youd find it exhausting and time consuming not to mention a pain in the ass to go through them all besides youre a good enough reporter that youve probably already thought of them so ill save you the hassle and cut to the bottom line im going to let you in on a secret because you confided in me ill confide in you but just as ill keep your confession in confidence i take for granted youll keep mine word of honor yes i know i can count on you this is the reason i was so legendary at the times for being able to track down reluctant sources trask wrote two words on a piece of paper tess frowned at them lieutenant craig he works for missing persons central division one police plaza just mention my name if he doesnt cooperate tell him i said to remind him of nineteen eightysix nineteen eighty six i doubt youll have to remind him though he owes me a favor hes well aware he cant ever completely repay and unless hes had a lobotomy hell stop whatever hes doing and give your problem his full attention but if he doesnt let me know because in that case ill send him a copy of a letter along with some audio tapes thatll give his memory one hell of a jolt i guarantee eleven lieutenant craig was a tall beefy man late thirties with tousled hair a ruggedly handsome face and sharply creased cheeks that gave his mouth a pinched expression when he heard trasks name his dour look intensified swell just swell the finishing touch on a crummy day craig wore a rumpled suit that matched his haggard features that leech is a never mind you dont want to know my opinion of him my language would ruin your day so whats that bloodsucker got in mind this time squinting toward tess craig gestured toward a stout wooden chair in front of his cluttered desk tess sat trying to ignore the phones that rang constantly at desks behind her detectives answering the calls while pecking at typewriters and computer keyboards well actually she tasted bile ill at ease walter i mean mr trask doesnt want anything craig closed one eye and squinted more severely with the other then why did he tell you to mention his name i guess because tess clutched the arms of the chair needing to steady her hands he figured youd give me extra help craig laughed a crusty outburst that sounded like a cough hey im here to serve the public no kidding im really a devoted civil servant rich or poor young or old male or female white black chicano christian jewish or muslim did i touch all the bases regardless of race or creed etc everyone who shows up in this office gets my full and complete attention unless of course theyre relatives of politicians and then i really snap to attention the lieutenant laughed again and abruptly did cough damned allergies so fine you need my help and walter sent you here so what can i do for you tess glanced toward the ceiling look whatever it is dont let it embarrass you ive heard it all before and then some believe me its not that im embarrassed exactly tess said then its just that now that im here im not sure i mean hey its almost six im supposed to be offduty why did you want to see me it seemed awfully serious a couple of hours ago but involving the police sure i understand theres serious and then theres serious craig said the thing is count on me its my job to tell the difference so as long as you are here you might as well explain why youre clutching the arms of your chair so tight hey lady take advantage of the taxes you pay unburden your soul whats the worst that can happen you can make me think im wasting your time not likely craig said the truth is i love it when people waste my time it gives me enormous satisfaction to tell the taxpayers theyre worried for nothing think of it this way after you talk to me i could reassure you enough its possible that you might even get a good nights sleep tess felt her stomach harden but suppose what i tell you gets a friend of mine in trouble with the law look the way we do this is first we discuss your problem then we decide whats next but if i understand the reason walter sent you here its not to make waves but to smooth the waters so if its possible lets keep the law out of this thats not a guarantee what i said was if its possible tess nodded surprised that shed grown to like this man all right ill give it a try amazed she released her hands from the arms of the chair theres a man i know it took her a while dont stop keep going craig said with delicate prompting and a welcome cup of coffee tess finally finished her story good craig set down his pen better than good impressive an excellent description but after all you work for walter so i take for granted youre a skilled reporter with a wonderful memory the lieutenant studied his notes yes gray eyes extremely unusual and the last time you saw him was friday and he uses a mail service and his employer doesnt have his home phone number and he has a habit of glancing nervously around him yes if you dont mind i have one no two more questions tess felt exhausted what are they your home and work addresses and your telephone numbers both places tess wrote them down a day or two and ill be in touch thats it youll be in touch craig coughed again what do you think i use a crystal ball or a ouija board for starters ive got to phone the hospitals the morgue morgue you mean you never ive been trying not to think about well its always a possibility thats where we start of course there are other possibilities other reasons why a man would disappear you put me in an awkward hey theres always what always hope craig straightened the files on his desk but in conscience i ought to warn you about a man who keeps checking behind him craig stood never mind well talk all of a sudden tess stood as well i dont want to yes thats what my former wife used to say but you and i will talk soon i promise in the meantime i suggest you see a movie get drunk whateverll help you relax enough to sleep twelve tess seldom drank and this hardly seemed a good time to start to rely on alcohol but a long swim and a fifteenminute sauna did relax her loosening her tensionknotted muscles at nine when she returned to her loft she felt exhausted enough that after a salad she went to bed but her mind wouldnt shut down she kept recalling reexperiencing the troubling events of the day joseph what had happened to him why had he guarded his privacy so much when would lieutenant craig phone tense again she tried to read but couldnt concentrate on the new ann beattie novel she turned on the tv and frequently switched channels impatient with the forced cheery conversations on what seemed an endless stream of talk shows it wasnt until after two that she finally managed to sleep but her dreams werent restful at work wednesday morning she had a headache that aspirins did nothing to soothe regardless she strained to focus her thoughts on her new assignment an article about the overuse of herbicides and pesticides on midwestern farms and the recent discovery that those poisons had passed through the soil and now were present in alarming quantity in the water supply of various cities each time the phone rang she lunged to pick it up hoping to hear josephs voice simultaneously dreading what she might be told if the voice wasnt josephs but instead belonged to ms drake speaking tess winced recognizing the gravelly voice this is lieutenant craig yes she squeezed the phone with one hand while using the other to massage her throbbing forehead i promised id call as soon as possible the lieutenant said are you free to take off work and go for a drive tess felt dizzy and closed her eyes ms drake call me tess please yesterday craig hadnt commented on her last name apparently not associating it with her father to simplify matters she didnt want him to make the connection which he might if he repeated drake often enough have you found something why dont we talk about it in the car is fifteen minutes too soon ill pick you up outside your building fine tesss throat cramped sure thats fine dont look for a cruiser to keep you from feeling selfconscious ill use an unmarked car just wait at the curb tess set down the phone and shuddered outside on the busy noisy exhaustacrid sidewalk she paced ten minutes later exactly when promised a brown chrysler sedan stopped in front of her the lieutenant waving for her to get in the moment she sat beside him and buckled her seatbelt craig steered out expertly into a small break in traffic tess studied his face trying to read his thoughts well the husky lieutenant coughed rotten throat my doctor says i might have asthma no wonder this crummy air youre avoiding my question just making conversation it never hurts to be pleasant okay heres the thing what ive got is good news and maybe bad news i believe tess said that my lines supposed to be ill take the good news first right that never hurts either craig turned off broadway heading east on thirtieth street i checked all the hospitals you never know your friend might have had an accident been hit by a car maybe had a stroke a heart attack whatever and be in a coma if he wasnt carrying a wallet at the time the hospital personnel wouldnt be able to identify him and since this is supposed to be the good news tess said i gather you didnt find my friend at any hospital plenty of coma patients but not anyone who matches your description of him well thats some reassurance at least craig raised a hand from the steering wheel not necessarily i checked only the hospitals in the metropolitan area if your friend took a trip this weekend to new jersey lets say or pennsylvania or up to connecticut and if he did have an accident that put him into a coma i wouldnt know about it yet these days almost everythings in computers but it still takes a while to get access to those other states hospital records ive got someone working on that incidentally but my hunch is gutfeeling well come up negative thats not a promise mind you just a hunch i note and appreciate your qualification simply being cautious craig said long ago i learned the hard way seldom affirm seldom deny people often dont pay attention to what im telling them they hear what they want to hear and later they claim i was more positive than i this reporter understands cautious statements please get on with it tess said im waiting for the other shoe to drop the possible bad news yes well craig stopped the sedan in a blocked line of traffic on the narrow confines of thirtieth street ahead at the crowded intersection of lexington avenue a policeman waved cars around a stalled pizza truck my next choice was the morgue is that why we seem to be heading toward first avenue craig frowned in apparent confusion if we keep going in this direction tess said well reach the new york university medical center and next to it across from thirtieth street is the medical examiners office so i was hoping to prepare you yes thats where were going over the weekend then monday and tuesday there were several unidentified guests of the medical examiner craig peered ahead and resumed driving as the traffic cop on lexington avenue supervised the removal of the stalled pizza truck most of the corpses didnt match your description of your friend but a few though what about them a floater in the hudson river same height same apparent age same body type with allowance for bloating i hate to add graphic details i dont shock easily lieutenant i was in ethiopia during the recent famine ive seen my share of too many corpses sure no doubt that was bad im just trying to prepare you its possible you havent seen corpses like these the problem with floaters is the water clouds their eyes so we cant tell whether the color was green or blue or in this case what were looking for gray theres also a junkie we found in an alley overdosed on heroin joseph isnt a drug addict to keep her hopes up tess insisted on using the present tense that might be but its not always easy to tell and as you explained your friend has a habit of keeping secrets the point is this junkies description is the same as your friends except for his eyes no help there either rats ate them out tess inwardly cringed i get the idea if youre as determined as you told me yesterday i am i could show you photographs thats the usual procedure and a lot less traumatic the problem is as vivid as the photos are they still dont give the same perspective as in cases where the face has been damaged its often difficult to make a positive id unlessare you this is a terrible question are you willing to look at the corpses yes tess shuddered for my friend im willing thirteen despite her various experiences as a reporter tess had never been to the new york city mortuary uneasy she expected something like in the movies a wall of refrigerated steel cubicles a shiny hatch being opened a sheetcovered corpse being pulled out on a sliding table instead craig escorted her along a hallway to a small room where she faced a large window beyond which was a dumbwaiter shaft craig gave instructions into a phone set it down and explained to save time i made arrangements earlier the staffs got everything ready tess its still not too late to change your mind no i have to do this she trembled not sure what would happen next bracing herself a halfminute later she flinched hearing a motors drone apprehensive she watched cables rise a platform being lifted as the platform stopped beyond the window she found herself staring at the swollen leadcolored face of a corpse with filmy eyes and skin that seemed about to slip off its cheekbones although the skin was gray its texture reminded tess of a split peeling parboiled tomato turning away she felt nauseous craig gently touched her shoulder yeah i know for what its worth as many times as ive been here i always feel queasy tess fought to restrain the insistent spasms in her stomach thanks i thinkshe breathed i think ill be okay apparently im not as tough as nobody is the day i get used to looking at corpses in as bad shape as this is the day i quit my job the sheet that comes up to his neck it covers the stitches from the autopsy right this is gross enough without craig hesitated is it him your friend tess shook her head are you positive from being in the water so long the face is disfigured you might not be able to its not disfigured enough that i wouldnt recognize him this isnt joseph craig sounded awkward that must be some relief to you tess felt clammy so far so good so far thats the trouble unfortunately there are others do you think you can hurry lets finish this craig picked up the phone and gave new instructions again tess heard a drone still averting her gaze from the window she imagined the platform descending the corpse disappearing can i yes its gone you can turn around now tess slowly pivoted her legs unsteady her breath rate increased once more the drone of the rising platform made her flinch she became lightheaded and mustered all her discipline forcing herself to study the next corpse that stopped beyond the window craig had warned her that rats had eaten the eyes but she wasnt prepared for the further damage that the rats had inflicted the corpses lips had been chewed away exposing teeth that seemed to grin the nose was gone leaving two grotesque slits there were jagged gaps in the cheeks a shredded oval hole beneath the chin like an obscene second mouth and tess spun away get it out of here despite the pounding behind her ears she heard craig speak to the phone and in a moment mercifully the drone of the descending platform craig gently touched her arm again tess felt him waiting and sensed his hesitation the uneasiness with which he tried to think of a sympathetic remark before hed be able to ask no it isnt joseph tess shook his foreheads too narrow she breathed his hairs the same length but the parts on the right instead of the left thank god it isnt joseph come over here sit down ill be okay sure all the same you look pale craig guided her come on take a rest sit down tess obeyed leaned back closed her eyes and felt cold sweat on her brow is that the end her voice was a whisper in the car you mentioned only those two corpses i want to know about my friend but i hope to god there arent any more craig didnt answer slowly nervously tess opened her eyes craig glanced toward the floor what tess asked with effort craig pursed his lips tell me tess frowned her voice regaining strength are there others youre what are you holding back there is one more tess exhaled but i dont think the victim can be identified not this way anyhow not visually probably only by bone x rays dental records and craig gestured ill at ease he was burned over much of his body especially his face i dont know what use it would i really question whether you should look at him its that hopeless definitely worse than what youve seen i doubt that viewing the body would accomplish anything except make you sick you mean sicker than i already am craig grimaced i guess thats what i mean tess debated concluding with relief if thats your opinion i want to do everything possible to learn what happened to joseph but if the only reason i even mentioned the victim is craig peered toward the floor again youre still holding something back is where he died tess felt a worm of fear uncoil in her stomach where he died what are you trying to say lieutenant you mentioned you were supposed to meet joseph on saturday morning yes so what to go jogging right tess straightened on the upper east side at carl schurz park damn it i asked you what are you trying to say lieutenant thats where this victim was found at three am on saturday night in carl schurz park tess surged to her feet jesus how did he get burned were not certain yet the victim might have been a derelict sleeping in the park it closes at one am and its supposed to be patrolled but sometimes street people sneak in and manage to hide the victim was doused with gasoline and set ablaze the autopsy shows he died from the flames not from a knife wound or a gunshot that a fire is sometimes used to conceal the blaze destroyed his clothes so we cant tell if he was a derelict but as we know sometimes kids get their kicks by tracking down vagrants while they sleep and setting them on fire that neighborhood doesnt see much trouble so near to the mayors house the gangs tend to stay farther north and west all the same the scenario i just described is consistent with what happened but do you believe that scenario you wouldnt mention this victim unless you thought there was a chance tess could hardly say the words he might be joseph all im doing is pointing out a common denominator carl schurz park craig nodded but its probably just a coincidence your friend wasnt a derelict what would he be doing in the park at three am especially that night whats so unusual about last saturday night on sunday it rained remember yes well the storm began around two in the morning even if your friend couldnt sleep and felt tempted to take a walk is it reasonable to believe hed have gone out after he saw it was raining and if he did why would he have left the street to climb the fence of a park that was locked for the night craig shrugged the scenario that doesnt raise questions is the one i described a derelict snuck into the park to find shelter kids followed him and set him on fire tess bit her lip all the same i dont have a choice excuse me i have to look at the body to try to assure myself it isnt joseph otherwise ill never stop wondering i meant what i said its much worse than the others please lieutenant craig studied her why dont we compromise i dont tess swallowed understand i admire your loyalty to your friend but why not do yourself a favor this time look at photographs since visual identification is almost hopeless the difference wont matter and you can still put your mind at rest she thought about it dismally nodding ill be back in a minute craig said alone in the room tess waited nervously darting her eyes toward the window and the horrors shed seen beyond it she wondered what greater horror she soon would lieutenant craig reentered the room carrying a folder he opened it then hesitated remember the fire disfigured most of the body especially the face all of the body would have been disfigured but it seems that the victim had strength enough to run through the rain and get to a pool of water he managed to roll in it and put the flames out before he died tess reached for the folder she slowly removed what felt like six photographs discovering that they were frontside down a short reprieve tense she turned the first one she gasped what once had been a head now resembled a roast that had been seared scorched blackened charred and oh my god tess jerked her eyes away but the image of the grotesque mutilation remained in her mind the blistered skull had no hair no features nothing that could possibly resemble josephs handsome face sootfilmed bone protruded from dark whorls of crisped her voice quavered lieutenant im sorry i doubted you here let me theres no need to torture yourself any further craig reached for the photographs tess shook her head fiercely i started this ill she turned the next photograph another head shot equally repulsive in a rush she set it aside only four more to go hurry she thought she wasnt prepared for the next photo the corpses on the platform beyond the window had each been covered with a sheet to the neck but now she winced at a full view of a naked almost totally charred body only the legs to the knees and the left arm below the elbow hadnt been scorched however what tess noticed most with mounting nausea were the bulky stitches that ran from the pelvis up to the ribcage then right and left forming a y where the pathologist had closed the body after the autopsy had been performed i cant take much more tess inwardly moaned hands shuddering and flipped another photograph whatever horror shed dreaded she would see she discovered exhaling sharply reprieved that she was staring at the corpses unburned left leg and foot thank you lord now if only she turned the nexttolast photograph and again exhaled reprieved viewing the corpses unburned right leg and foot one more to go one last photograph and if im lucky tess thought she was at the same time she wasnt for although the final photograph wasnt threatening indeed it was predictable given the logic of the sequence a shot of the corpses unburned left arm below the elbow something in it attracted her shocked attention abruptly her memory flashed back to when shed talked with joseph in the delicatessen last friday afternoon we can only be friends hed said im not sure what what i mean is we can never be lovers his frankness had startled her hey shed said iwasnt making a proposition its not like i asked you to go to bed i know that really your behaviors impeccable joseph had reached across the table and tenderly touched her hand ididnt mean to offend or embarrass you its just that there are certain things about me you wouldnt understand and while hed said that tess had glanced down at the back of the hand the left hand that joseph had placed on hers just as tess now glanced at no riveted her eyes upon the back of the left hand in the photograph she felt as if shed swallowed ice cubes as if her stomach were crammed with freezing chunks of a choked sound escaped from her throat she slumped back in the chair forced her eyes away from the photograph fought to speak and told craig its him what craig looked surprised but how can you be the corpse is so on friday when we ate lunch joseph touched my hand i remember glancing down and noticing he had a scar a distinctive jagged scar on the back of his left wrist weary heart sinking with grief tess pointed toward the photograph like this scar on this left wrist hes dead my god josephs let me see craig grasped the photograph as if clinging to joseph she resisted the lieutenant gently pried at her fingers and carefully removed the photograph craig scowled down frowning nodding yes an old scar judging from its thickness the wound was deep no one mentioned this to me otherwise id have told you about it and saved you the pain of looking at the other photos he raised the picture closer not a knife scar not jagged the way it is more like a wound from a broken bottle or maybe barbed wire or tess are you sure in my mind i can see his hand on mine as vividly as i see that photograph theres no way to measure them but yes id give anything not to be im sure the scars are identical this is joseph joseph is tess felt pressure behind her ears in her stomach but most of all around her heart her voice sank abruptly she felt numb dead joseph is tess im sorry dead fourteen in the mortuarys parking garage tesss walk became more unsteady she was barely conscious of craig helping her into the car then going around and sitting behind the steering wheel she fumbled to put on her seatbelt again barely conscious that craig snapped it into place for her with unfocused eyes she stared toward the blur of other vehicles in the dimly lit garage at last craig broke the silence coughing where shall i drive you home after what youve been through youre trembling i dont recommend that you try to go back to work tess turned to him blinking only now fully aware of his presence home work she crossed her unsteady arms and pressed them hard against her chest restraining her tremors would you thisll sound do me a favor i already promised id help as much as possible take me to where he died craig furrowed his brow to the park yes but why would you tess hugged her chest harder wincing please craig seemed about to say something instead he coughed again turned the ignition key put the car in gear and drove from the garage emerging onto first avenue following the oneway traffic northward thank you tess said craig shrugged tomorrow first thing ill make a point of telling walter how cooperative youve been she said walter hey youve got the wrong idea im not doing this for walter im doing my job or have been but at the moment im doing this for you im sorry i apologize tess almost touched his arm i didnt mean to sound insulting as if i thought you were only paying back a debt or you didnt insult me dont worry about it but i like to make sure things are clearly understood not many people would have done what you just went through for a man theyd only met a few times but considered a friend loyaltys a rare commodity youd be amazed how many people dont care when someones missing i admire your persistence your sense of obligation so if you tell me you want to go to the park fine thats where we go the office will just have to do without me till this afternoon joseph martin must have been special tess thought about it different i dont understand its hard to explain he had a sure he was handsome but more important he had a kind of magnetism he seemed to the only word i can think of is he seemed to glow tess raised her chin and by the way in case youve been wondering there wasnt anything sexual between us i never suggested there was in fact the reverse joseph insisted that we could only be friends that we could never have sex craig turned to her frowning i know what youre thinking and so did i wrong he didnt say that because he was gay or anything but because how did he put it he said a platonic friendship was better because it was eternal thats how he talked almost poetically yes grief squeezed jesss throat sorrow cramped her heart joseph was special craig concentrated on driving but continued frowning they crossed the intersection of fortyfifth street passing the united nations building on the right heading farther northward so tess quivered and straightened what happens next after the park i talk to homicide and tell them weve got a tentative identification of the body tentative that scar is you have to realize homicide needs more than that to be absolutely certain theyve sent the fingerprints they managed to get from the left hand to the fbi even with computers though it can take several days for the fbi to search its files for a match to those prints especially given the backlog of cases but now with a possible name for the victim they can speed up the process go to joseph martins file compare prints and who knows it could be the scar is coincidental you might be wrong dont i wish but im not tess felt dizzy im just trying to give you hope and im afraid that hopes as rare as loyalty tesss breathing became more labored the closer they came to eightyeighth street tense she watched the lieutenant steer right cross two avenues and just before the final one manage to find a parking space with greater distress she got out of the car with him locked it and in hazy sunlight faced the opposite side of east end avenue to the left partially obscured by trees was the sixfoothigh stockadelike wooden barrier that encircled gracie mansion one of the first new york city houses along the east river it had been built by archibald gracie in huge with many chimneys and gables as well as numerous verandas it had once been the museum for the city but was now the wellguarded mayors residence straight ahead however compelling tess was the wroughtiron fence that encircled the woods and paths of carl schurz park youre certain you want to before the lieutenant could finish his question tess clutched his arm and crossed the avenue they passed through an open gate a sign warned that no radios tape players or musical instruments were permitted between pm and am and proceeded along a brick walkway thick bushes flanked them overhanging branches of densely leaved trees cast shadows where tess sounded hoarse the guards at gracie mansion saw the flames at three oclock sunday morning just about craig glanced around there he pointed toward a cavelike contour in a granite ridge behind bushes to his right the mayors guards are pros they know whatever happens they dont leave their post after all the flames might have been a diversion a trick intended to draw them away and expose their boss so they called the local precinct in the meantime the mayors guards saw the flames streak from here craig indicated the cavelike contour then gestured ahead past bushes toward a miniature amphitheater beyond an overhead walkway to there toward that statue tass wavered approaching the humansized statue it increased in definition becoming a bronze child knee raised peering sideways downward toward the brick surface in the middle of the fiftyfoot perimeter of the circular enclosure the statue resembled a nymph perversely it reminded tess of peter pan and in the stonelined basin tess heard her voice crack as she swung toward craig remember you asked to come here i havent forgotten and the officers from the local precinct found the rain had pooled on these bricks the victim yes you told me he tried to roll in the water and put out the names where behind the statue tess craig raised his hands and stepped closer i dont recommend its necessary tess slowly rounded the statue and sank to her hips on a ledge at the statues feet the contour of a man lying sideways his knees pulled toward his chest had been blackened into the bricks oh im sorry tess i didnt want to bring you here but you kept insisting with a sob tess stooped toward the dismal dark shape on the bricks she touched where josephs heart would have been do me another favor her voice broke please just one more favor take you away from here no tears streamed from tesss burning eyes through their blur she begged him silently craig understood he opened his arms and sobbing harder she welcomed his embrace fifteen memphis tennessee billy joe bennett couldnt stop sweating moisture oozed from his scalp his face his chest his back his legs it rolled down his neck it soaked his shirt as he nervously drove through one am traffic in this bardistrict of the city he felt as if he was sitting on a puddle the problem was that he didnt sweat because of the hot humid night in fact he had the windows of his chevy blazer rolled shut and the air conditioning on full blast still no matter how much he shivered from the cold air rushing against him he couldnt stop sweating because he shivered from something else and sweated for the same reason two reasons actually the first was tension after all he was due to testify before a shitload of government investigators this morning and the second was a desperate need for cocaine jesus he thought how could anything that made you feel so good when you snorted it put you through this much hell when you didnt have it billy joes insides ached as if every organ scraped against the other his muscles contracted so forcefully that his cramped hands seemed about to snap the steering wheel god almighty the glare of headlights stabbed his eyes the blaze of neon signs over taverns made him wince if i dont get some nose candy soon he kept glancing furtively toward his rearview mirror desperate to make sure he wasnt being followed those damned government investigators were worse than bloodhounds since sunday theyd been tailing him everywhere they had a car parked on his street when he was at home each day since the trains derailment theyd forced him to give them urine samples the tests on which hed passed because billy joe wasnt any dummy no siree boy he read the papers and he watched the news on tv and months ago hed realized that random drug testing would soon be required for anyone who worked in transportation so hed planned for the day when he might be tested hed paid his brother who never touched cocaine to piss in a sterile jug for him then hed taken the jug home poured urine into several plastic vials and hidden them behind the toilet tank in his bathroom the second hed heard about the derailment hed gone to the bathroom smeared vaseline over one of the vials and inserted it lord that had hurt up his rectum and sure enough sunday a government investigator had knocked on his door shown him a court order handed him a glass container and requested a urine sample so billy joe had said of course ive got nothing to hide hed gone into the bathroom locked the door removed the plastic vial of urine from his rectum poured the warm fluid into the glass container returned the vial to his rectum and come out of the bathroom telling the investigator sorry i dont piss so good on demand this is the most i could coax from my bladder the investigator had given him a steely look and said this is all well need believe me youre wasting your time yeah sure we are after that billy joe hadnt gone anywhere without a vaselineslicked vial of urine up his rearend talk about cramps and pain man oh man but he was a railroad worker broadshouldered bigchested from twenty years of lifting rails shifting ties and hefting a sledgehammer he was tough he told himself right on no two ways about it and if those government investigators thought they could scare him those pansies in their cheap suits had another think coming at the moment though billy joe did feel scared because on monday hed used up his carefully hidden stash of cocaine and the first day without it hadnt been too bad a slight case of the shakes is all but the next day his stomach had started to squirm and the day after that hed thrown up and couldnt stop sweating now at one am thursday morning soaking wet trembling doing his best to drive without wavering he feared hed go fucking out of his mind if he didnt get a jolt of coke soon dear god in heaven he couldnt testify before those government investigators this morning if he looked and shook and sweated like this he couldnt keep his thoughts straight he wouldnt be able to concentrate on their questions hed stammer or worse maybe even babble and theyd know right away that he wasnt just nervous like from stage fright but suffering from withdrawal and that would be that he didnt know what the government could do to him if the investigators proved he was an addict but this much he did know he wouldnt like it one damned bit three hundred people were dead because that section of track had given way toppling the train twenty cars of anhydrous ammonia had split open and ever since sunday the newspapers had been full of stories about possible criminal negligence even manslaughter shit man they put you away for that so all right as foreman of the maintenance crew hed checked those tracks and theyd looked okay to him granted maybe he hadnt checked them as thoroughly as he could have but it had been late afternoon and hed been eager to get back to town and snort some coke it wasnt his fault that the jerk who owned the railway had mismanaged the business because he was too busy dipping his wick in his secretary the dummys wife had caught him kicked him out of the house divorced him and taken him for millions hell no billy joe thought it wasnt my fault that the railroad was forced to cut back on its maintenance fund so the jerk could pay his divorce settlement if thered been more guys checking the tracks the accident wouldnt have happened but thats not my problem no way not now never mind fixing those tracks im the one who needs fixing so i dont fall apart eight hours from now when those government investigators try to crucify me again billy joe scowled at his rearview mirror hed been driving at random watching if headlights behind him took the same routes hed made sharp turns run red lights veered down alleys done everything he could think of remembering all those detective and spy movies he liked to watch and the way the heroes got rid of tails satisfied that he hadnt been followed he drove hurriedly from the bar district heading toward the river he didnt have much time each night at onefifteen his supplier set up shop for five minutes and only five minutes at a secluded parking lot next to a warehouse close to the mississippi wiping sweat from his eyes billy joe glanced at his watch christ it was almost ten after he pressed his trembling foot on the accelerator the dark parking lot looked deserted when he steered past the warehouse and stopped no dont tell me im late its onefifteen on the button i cant be late or maybe hes late yeah billy joe decided heart pounding thats what it is he just hasnt got here yet at once the headlights of another car turned into the lot billy joe relaxed then shook with sudden worry that this wasnt his supplier but government investigators whod been tailing him fighting not to panic he told himself theres no crime in taking a drive to the river hey all i have to do is tell them i couldnt sleep i needed to relax i felt like watching the lights of the barges on the water sure no problem he didnt recognize the blue ford that stopped beside him not a good sign but maybe not a bad one his supplier often took the precaution of switching vehicles but when a tall thin man wearing a tshirt got out of the ford billy joe didnt recognize him either and that for certain was not a good sign the man knocked on billy joes window billy joe lowered it yeah he tried to sound gruff but his shaky voice didnt manage the job youre here to do business the man asked i dont know what the fuck youre talking about cocaine do you want to score or dont you entrapment billy joe thought if this guy was an investigator hed blown his case right there what makes you think i look dont waste my time the regular delivery man had to leave town for his health couldnt stand the competition if you get my meaning ive got this route now and plenty of other stops to make four minutes more and im leaving make up your mind billy joe suddenly realized that the ford had approached the parking lot from the opposite direction that he himself had used this guy whoever he was couldnt possibly have been tailing him billy joe realized something else that he was sweating more profusely and shaking so bad his teeth were clicking together okay ive made up my mind barely controlling his trembling hands he awkwardly opened his door and stepped out legs wobbly lets do business same price as the other guy charged the stranger unlocked the trunk of the ford no the feds have been making too much trouble intercepting too many shipments ive got extra expenses billy joe felt too desperate to object but this one time only im being generous adding more to each package sort of a goodwill gesture a way of introducing myself to my customers hey fair enough rubbing his hands together billy joe followed the man to the trunk of the car and peered eagerly inside what he saw was a bulging plastic garbage bag that the stranger opened revealing white powder what the what kind of way is that to a sharp pungent odor reached his nostrils the trunk smelled like a laundry that was it a laundry why would all for you billy joe hey how come you know my name the stranger ignored the question yes we brought all of this for you we car doors banged open three men whod been crouching out of sight in the ford rushed toward the trunk grabbed billy joe one on each side and one behind him bent him over and shoved his head toward the powder in the plastic bag billy joe strained to shove back squirming twisting frantic but even years of hefting a sledgehammer didnt give him the strength to resist the determined men all for you billy joe he struggled with greater desperation but the powerful hands kept pressing him downward as his head came closer to the white powder the strong pungent smell became overwhelming making him gag he recognized what it was now ammonia powdered bleach no jesus stop i his words were smothered as his face was thrust against the powder it smeared his cheeks it caked his lips then his face was rammed beneath the powder it filled his ears it plugged his nose he fought to hold his breath but as the three men held him down while the fourth man twisted the mouth of the plastic bag around his neck billy joe finally inhaled reflexively and felt the stinging powder surge up his nostrils spew down his throat and cram his lungs it burned my god how it burned the last thing he heard in a panic before he lost consciousness was we know its not the powder youre used to but how do you like it billy joe you let three hundred people die from ammonia its time you got a whiff of it yourself sixteen the eastern bank of the mississippi ten miles north of memphis in the bedroom of his country mansion harrison page huffed and puffed but finally admitted that his frustrating efforts were pointless the irony of the word wasnt lost on him pointless it exactly described his penis out of breath giving up he rolled off the woman his affair with whom had caused his wife to divorce him and lay on his back staring bleakly at the dark ceiling sweetie thats okay the woman jennifer said you dont need to feel your manhoods threatened youre tired is all youre under stress yeah under stress page said well try again later sweetie page had only recently admitted to himself how much her shrill voice annoyed him i dont think so ive got a headache take one of my sleeping pills no page stood put on his pajamas and walked toward a window parting its drapes brooding oblivious to the moonlight glinting off the river then maybe a drink would help sweetie if she doesnt stop calling me that page thought no he said irritated ive got a meeting with my lawyers before i testify at the hearing this morning i have to be alert just doing my best to be helpful sweetie he spun trying to control his temper the moonlight through the parted drapes revealed her naked body her dark mound between her legs her lush hips slender waist and ripe breasts overripe page bitterly thought theyre like melons so swollen theyre about to go rotten and her skin when he stroked it had lately begun to make him cringe because beneath its smooth oncearousing softness was a further softness like jelly like fat page decided the way she lies around all day watching soap operas eating chocolates shell soon be as fat as although he stifled the angry thought another thought insisted how could i have been such a fool im fiftyfive shes twentythree if id kept my dick in my pants where it belonged the first time after we screwed when she started calling me sweetie i should have realized what a mistake i was making we dont have anything in common shes incapable of an intelligent conversation why didnt i stop right then give her a bonus transfer her to another office and thank god i didnt ruin my life but the fact was page dismally admitted hed let his dick control his brain he had ruined his life and now he didnt know how to salvage it im going downstairs ive got some testimony to prepare before i walk into that hearing whatever sweetie go with the flow i always say just remember ill be waiting yes page thought subduing a cringe isnt that the hell of it youll be waiting he put on slippers and left the bedroom shuffling along a corridor gripping the curved bannister of a marble staircase unsteadily descending relieved to be out of her presence her excessive perfume like the smell of flowers at a funeral had been making him sick except for jennifer and himself the mansion was deserted hed sent the butler cook and maid away lest they overhear conversations that might incriminate him if the servants couldnt keep their mouths shut when the investigators questioned them footsteps echoing he felt the emptiness around and within him as he crossed a murky vestibule entered his study and turned on the lights there he hesitated chest heaving staring at a stack of documents on his desk the possible questions that his lawyers had anticipated hed be asked at the hearing and the numerous calculated responses he would have to know by heart weary he rounded the desk slumped in his chair and began reviewing the depressing documents if only his exwife patricia were here hed be able to talk with her to sort out the problem and try to solve it shed always helped him that way listening sympathetically rubbing his taut shoulders offering prudent advice but then he wouldnt have this problem if patricia were here because they wouldnt be divorced and she wouldnt have nearly bankrupted him in the settlement and he wouldnt have been distracted from managing the railroad let alone have been forced to cut maintenance costs so he could squeeze out more profits to make up for the millions hed been forced to pay his exwife three hundred people dead tens of thousands of acres of forest and pasture turned into a wasteland an entire countys water supply poisoned all because i thought with my dick instead of my head a noise made him jerk him eyes toward the left with a flinch fear burning his stomach he saw one of the french doors that led to the patio swing open three men and a woman stepped in all were in their thirties trim goodlooking dressed in dark jogging clothes page lurched to his feet his years of being an executive had trained him never to show weakness but to react aggressively when feeling threatened what the hell do you think youre doing get out of here they shut the door i said get out they smiled the woman and one of the men had their hands behind their back page fought to control and conceal his fright they looked too cleancut to be burglars not that he knew what burglars would look like but maybe they were damn it if youre reporters youve picked the wrong way to get an interview and besides ive stopped giving interviews were not reporters the woman said we dont have any questions one of the men said im calling the police it wont do you any good another man said they approached him the woman and one of the men continued to hold their hands behind their back page grabbed the phone and tapped suddenly realizing that the line was dead see the third man said it doesnt do any good i locked those doors i turned on the security system how did were handy with tools the first man said like these tools the woman said they brought their hands from behind their back page opened his mouth but terror choked his scream while two of the men grabbed pages arms and forced him flat across the desk the remaining man held up a railroad spike and the woman swung a sledgehammer driving the spike through pages heart seventeen impaled on a stack of bloodsoaked documents that confidential sources indicate were statements that harrison page had been prepared to make at the hearing this morning the bespectacled television reporter paused somberly appalled tess sat on a stool at the kitchen counter in her loft watching the twelveinch tv next to the microwave the red numbers on the radaranges digital clock said shed been trying to make herself eat breakfast fruit salad wholewheat toast and tea but after yesterdays ordeal at the morgue and her discovery that joseph was dead she didnt have much appetite the reporter continued in a further grotesque aftermath of the tennessee toxicgas disaster the body of billy joe bennett foreman in charge of inspecting the section of the track where the derailment occurred was found early this morning in a memphis parking lot near the mississippi river bennett had been under investigation for possible negligence due to alleged cocaine addiction the tv image shifted from the reporter to a harshly lit videotape of stern policemen standing near a warehouse staring down at something a closeup of a garbage bag on the parking lots asphalt the bag filled with white powder then a panning shot of a sheetcovered corpse being lifted on a gurney into an ambulance offcamera the reporter explained the grisly means by which bennett had been murdered with renewed pangs of grief tess was reminded of the brutal way in which joseph had been murdered the reporter came back on the screen police speculate that bennett and page were killed for revenge by relatives of victims of the toxicgas disaster a commercial for disposable diapers interrupted the news tess rubbed her forehead peered down at her breakfast and felt even less hungry the phone rang startling her while she rinsed out her teacup whod be calling this early troubled she left the kitchen walked to the section of the loft where the furniture was arranged to form a living room and picked up the phone halfway through its third ring hello the gravelly voice was so distinctive that the speaker didnt need to identify himself this is lieutenant craig her fingers cramped around the phone i apologize for calling at this hour craig said but i wont be in the office and i wasnt sure id have a chance to phone you at work this morning thats if you feel up to going to work yes im going tess sat dejected i almost decided not to but it doesnt do any good to brood maybe work will distract me sometimes it helps to be with other people im not sure anything will help she slumped weary what can i do for you lieutenant i wanted to know when you take your lunch break lunch why would i doubt ill be eating lunch today thats why you called to invite me to lunch not exactly theres something i might want you to look at craig said and i figured if you were going to be free at a certain hour we could make an appointment tess felt cold is this about josephs death possibly youre holding back again this might be nothing tess really id prefer not to talk about it until im sure i dont want to upset you without a reason and you dont think im upset already okay one oclock can you pick me up outside my office building at one oclock ill make a point of it who knows maybe the meeting wont be necessary thats what i mean dont think about it sure dont think what a great idea eighteen but tess had many things to think about she kept remembering josephs burned corpse and the dark contour of his body seared into the bricks at carl schurz park in the elevator at work she shuddered identifying it with joseph numbed that shed never see him again at earth mother magazine she went immediately down the hall to walter trasks office and told him everything that had happened trask frowned more haggard than usual he stood came around his desk and clasped her shoulders im sorry tess honestly more than i can say but who would have done that to him why i wish i had answers trask hugged her his features gray he stepped back but this is new york sometimes there arent any answers im reminded of the jogger who was raped and nearly killed by that marauding gang in central park the kids who did it werent raised in a slum they came from middleclass families poverty cant be blamed for their behavior it doesnt make sense like too many other things but why would joseph have been in carl schurz park in the rain at three am tess listen to me you dont know anything about this man you found him attractive but he thisll sound harsh nonetheless it has to be said when you mentioned that he hadnt given his employer his phone number and he used a mail service i was worried the man had secrets possibly his secrets caught up to him with eerie clarity tess recalled what joseph had told her in the delicatessen friday afternoon i have certain lets call them obligations i cant explain what they are or why i have to abide by them you just have to trust and believe and accept maybe maybe he did have secrets tess said but that doesnt mean the secrets were bad and it doesnt mean i have to turn my back and pretend i never knew him believe me i sympathize trask put an arm around her really all im asking you to do is try to be objective protect your emotions right now the last thing im capable of being is objective tess said look perhaps you shouldnt have come into work today take a break give yourself a rest go to your health club whatever relaxes you well see how you feel tomorrow no tess said being alone would make me feel worse i need to work i have to keep busy youre sure the more work the better in that case what ive got something i want you to do tess waited itll mean postponing your article on the overuse of herbicides and pesticides on midwestern farms but thats an important issue tess said automatically those poisons are sinking through the earth and into the drinking water all the same there might be a story we ought to do first the tv news this morning did you watch it the murders in tennessee remind you of anything i gather youre thinking of the murders at the pacificrim petroleum corporation last week thered been three two in australia and one in hong kong after the massive oil spill that continued to endanger the great barrier reef victor malone captain of the supertanker that had run aground kevin stark executive in charge of cleanup efforts and chandler thompson director of the pacificrim petroleum corporation had each been killed following widespread allegations of drinking while on duty failure to respond to the spill in time to contain it and corporate refusal to admit its negligence malone had been blown apart as he drove from brisbane s courthouse stark had been drowned his body discovered upside down in a barrel of oil thompson had been poisoned when he drank a glass of water during a press conference remember we talked about those murders last wednesday trask said tess sank toward a chair dismally remembered something else that evening shortly after their conversation shed first met joseph she dug her fingernails into her thighs forcing herself to concentrate on what trask was saying i suggested we do a story about the killings and i said earth mother magazine isnt a tabloid tess replied we shouldnt add to the controversy fanatics hurt our cause well now it seems weve got some fanatics in tennessee no the parallel isnt exact the police suspect that bennett and page were killed by relatives of thats what they said on television trask scowled but i just checked my sources at the times theyre preparing a story that quotes a memphis policeman who wonders if some nutso ecologists might be responsible what already the major environmentalprotection groups like the sierra club and greenpeace are anticipating the charge condemning the murders as totally irresponsible but its absurd to suspect tess jerked forward sure some greenpeace members were once arrested for taking over a whaling ship in peru and it often puts boats filled with people between whaling ships and their quarry but theres a big difference between seizing private property or risking your life to save an endangered species and executing someone you blame for contributing to the destruction of the planet trask raised his eyebrows of course and dont get me wrong greenpeace is a reputable organization i certainly dont think it would ever resort to violence but the new director of the pacrim corporation did receive a note warning him that hed better make sure another spill doesnt happen so we know that fanatics were responsible for those murders my point is i agree with you extremists hurt our cause every time protestors invade a nuclearpower facility or steal research animals from a medical lab or throw blood on a woman who wears a fur coat the public reacts as if all environmentalists are a bunch of lunatics the rest of us who believe that education common sense and good example are the proper ways to gain converts become guilty by association so lets not avoid the issue lets face it headon and make clear that the majority of environmentalists are not crazed looneytunes weirdos that we dont approve of excessive protests any more than the public does tess studied her boss and slowly nodded burdened with grief she fought to pay attention you know walter the more i think of it not a bad idea of course if i say so myself does that mean youll do the piece tess nodded again pensive straightening good i see several possibilities her voice sounded cramped with effort she continued while im condemning extremists ill still be able to emphasize the threats to the environment that make them behave the way they do right motives wrong methods you got it kid and if you get deeply enough into the story you never know maybe youll be able to take your mind off what happened to your poor friend i doubt it walter very much but lord knows ill try my best her eyes misted i definitely need distracting for the rest of the morning tess almost succeeded struggling to immerse herself in the subject and stop brooding about josephs death she searched through her files determined she called the reference department at the public library the daily news and the times she jotted notes and quickly made lists trasks reference to animalrights activists prompted her to recall that last year a group of protestors whod stolen rabbits being used for medical research had destroyed a fiveyear experiment that might have resulted in a cure for muscular dystrophy in another case the animals that were stolen had been infected with anthrax to test a new vaccine a minor epidemic had resulted before the animals were recovered seeking further examples tess recalled what had happened in brazil last week pedro gomez a rubbertree tapper whod been trying to organize his fellow villagers to stop developers from their slashandburn destruction of the amazon jungle had been blown apart by automatic weapons while making a speech at his funeral his wife had received a gift the head of the financier suspected of ordering gomezs death the theory was that one of gomezs followers had killed the financier to get even nonetheless the beheading like the supposed revenge slayings of billy joe bennett and harrison page in tennessee was related to a major environmental catastrophe and tess decided to include the incident as an example of radical behavior ultimately caused by an ecological crisis and while condemning that behavior she still could emphasize the crisis itself by noon tess had a rough outline for her article amazed by how much shed been able to accomplish so quickly given her need to distract herself but the truth was a festering corner of her mind continued to brood about joseph more and more she kept glancing at her watch its hands proceeding relentlessly with surprising speed yet paradoxical slowness toward one oclock and her appointment with lieutenant craig what had he wanted to show her why had he been evasive yet again nineteen the lieutenant drove an unmarked rustcolored car this time when he stopped at the curb and tess got in to fasten her seatbelt she noticed that his creased brow was beaded with sweat his blue suitcoat was lumped beside him the front of his wrinkled white shirt and the underarm she could see were dark with moisture sorry he coughed the windows were open but the only breeze on this sultry smoghazed june afternoon came from passing cars the air conditioner doesnt work ill adjust good that makes one of us asthma you said what your cough oh craig steered into traffic yeah my cough thats what my doctor tells me asthma allergies this towns killing me then maybe you should move sure like to someplace wholesome like to iowa whats that line in the movie field of dreams yeah thats the movie is this heaven and kevin costner says no its iowa cornfields give me a break i was raised here this is heaven craig frowned his voice dropping or at least it used to be he turned east off broadway were heading in the same direction we did last time tess became rigid dont tell me were going back to the morgue craig shook his head and coughed id have warned you no well be driving up first avenue again to carl schurz park but i dont want to no not there either let me do this my way all right so i can explain and prepare you and dont frown i swear cross my heart you wont see anything gross youre positive im not saying it wont disturb you but i guarantee it wont make you sick on the other hand okay heres the deal you told me your friend was different thats an understatement according to the fbi he doesnt exist doesnt what are you we sent your friends name to the bureau to help them find a match for the fingerprints on the corpses unburned left hand they searched their computers for a file on joseph martin no surprise its a common name there are plenty of joseph martins what is surprising is that none of the fingerprints in those files matched the fingerprints we sent to the bureau but surely not everybody has fingerprints in the bureaus files right craig continued toward first avenue so the next step is to check with social security to match the number your friend gave his employer with the names and addresses on their list and craig steered around a ups truck its driver hurrying to make a delivery and there is a joseph martin with that number the trouble is he lives in illinois or used to live in illinois because and this took several phone calls joseph martin who has that social security number died in nineteen fiftynine theres some mistake craig shook his head i doublechecked the result came up the same joseph martin your joseph martin should have quit fooling everybody he should have done the decent thing stretched out on the floor crossed his arms stopped breathing and been as dead as the joseph martin whos in a cemetery in illinois while craig reached first avenue and headed north tess felt pressure behind her ears youre telling me joseph assumed the identity of a dead man actually dead child infant remind me how old did you estimate joseph to be early thirties lets make it thirtytwo craig said because thats how old the other joseph martin would be today if he hadnt been killed in a car crash along with his parents in fiftynine and ill bet there were no surviving close relatives oh craig assessed her you understand how this is done tess spread her hands someone who wants a new identity chooses a community at random and checks the obituaries in the local paper for the year in which he himself was born he looks for an infant who died that year and was either an orphan or was killed along with his immediate family that way he doesnt look older or younger than he says he is and theres no one who can contradict his claim to be that person the next step is to find out where the child was born that information is often in the obituary soandso was born in thisorthat city the person seeking a new identity then writes to the courthouse in that city tells its record office that he lost his birth certificate and asks for a replacement people often lose their birth certificates its not unusual for someone to ask for another copy and clerks almost never bother to check if the name on the birth certificate matches the name of someone whos dead as soon as he gets the birth certificate the person sends a photostat to the social security office explains that he lived abroad for many years and didnt need a social security number but now he does the social security office seldom objects to such a request with a birth certificate and a social security number the person can get a passport a drivers licence a credit card all the documents he needs to appear legitimate to enter the system get a job pay taxes etc very good craig said continuing northward im impressed reporters pick up all kinds of information tess certainly didnt intend to add that the real way shed learned about assuming false identities was by overhearing her fathers phone conversations with business associates craig brooded passing fortyninth street with some cooperation from the federal government ive been able to learn that joseph began to use his assumed identity in may of last year thats when he first started paying income taxes and social security since then hes had two jobs not counting his present one the first was in los angeles the second in chicago obviously he didnt want to stay in any place too long and he felt the need to put a lot of miles between one location and another in each case he worked for a video documentary company okay breathing too fast tess concentrated not to hyperventilate so joseph had something to hide everything about him was a lie that explains why he didnt want me to get close to him the question is what the hell was he hiding maybe youll be able to tell me when you see where im taking you certainly i cant figure it out craig said figure out what where are we going no not yet what the problem is see first i have to explain some other things tess raised her arms in exasperation be patient when i talked to the accountant where joseph worked craig said i asked to see the paychecks he cashed theyre too large for a supermarket or a liquor store to accept them hed have needed to take them to a bank and the bank would have sent the cancelled checks to his employers bank which in turn would have sent them to the employers accountant as it happens joseph cashed all his checks at the same bank back there craig pointed we just passed the bank on fiftyfourth street so you went to the bank showed them a court order allowing you access to their records and examined josephs account tess said craig assessed her again youd have made a good policeman police woman craig ignored her correction yes thats what i did i went to the bank and the address they had for joseph was the mail service on broadway that was also the address he told the bank to print on his checks no surprise what was surprising is that the microfilm records of josephs cancelled checks show that he hadnt made any payments for electricity or rent obviously he had to live somewhere and pay his utilities so how was he keeping his landlord and con edison happy turns out every month he sent a check for thirteen hundred dollars to a man named michael hoffman now take a guess who hoffman is an accountant tess replied craig studied her with greater intensity youre better than good right an accountant clearly joseph was trying to increase the smokescreen that protected his privacy so i spoke to hoffman he told me that joseph and he had never met they conducted all their business through the mail and over the phone but hoffman paid josephs major bills tess anticipated no compliment this time youre correct okay with hoffmans records and cooperation from con edison you ought to be able to find out where joseph lived in theory tess frowned another smokescreen right josephs arrangement with his landlord was that the landlord would pay the utilities and joseph would reimburse him so con edison couldnt help us but the landlord could craig didnt answer whenever you purse your lips like that whats the matter tess asked the landlord is a realestate conglomerate that owns thousands of apartments all their records are stored in a computer they looked up joseph martins name gave me his address in greenwich village but when i went there i discovered that the agency had given me the wrong address that joseph didnt live there in fact the realestate firm didnt even own that apartment you mean someone made a mistake and typed the wrong information into the computer thats one possibility the agencys looking into it craig scowled toward a traffic jam on first avenue one whats another possibility the lieutenants somber expression made tess nervous suppose i keep thinking of smokescreens im suspicious by nature i keep wondering if joseph found a way to access the firms computer and tamper with their records he might have been that determined to keep someone from finding out where he lived or maybe he bribed a secretary to falsify the records for him however joseph did it it makes me more determined to find out why craig said but if you dont know where joseph lived where are we going tess rigidly clasped her hands together did i say i didnt know i made a few assumptions one was that since josephs bank is on the east side and he arranged to meet you at carl schurz park and died there tess squeezed her eyes shut repressing tears the upper east side that maybe josephs apartment is in that direction of course his mail service is on the opposite side of town but given his phobia about secrecy its logical for him to break the pattern so i asked the precincts around here to find out if anything unusual happened from friday night onward something that might help us thats how we caught son of sam while the bastard was shooting his victims he overparked and got tickets on the weekend there were lots of incidents but after i sorted through the reports and eliminated several possibilities i read about a fight in an apartment building on east eightysecond street an apparent attempted mugging one of the tenants a man was assaulted he ran from the building chased by several men they made enough noise that several other tenants woke up and peered out their doors seeing shadows struggling on the stairs someone coming in late from a party noticed what appeared to be a gang chasing a limping man down the street east toward the river yes craig sighed and this happened on saturday night or rather at halfpast two on sunday morning oh tess said jesus i spoke to some of the tenants who were wakened they said the fight began on the seventh floor that building has only four apartments per floor this morning i got there early enough to talk to the people who live in three of those apartments but i didnt get any answer at the fourth the tenants in the other apartments said it had been several days since theyd seen the man who rents that apartment not unusual apparently they hardly ever see him hes a loner friendly but distant keeps to himself tess frowned more rigid the name on the downstairs mailbox for that apartment is roger copeland of course that means nothing anyone can put a false name on a mailbox the neighbors describe the man as handsome tall in excellent physical condition in his early thirties with dark hair and a tawny complexion my god tess winced it certainly sounds like joseph the thing is what the neighbors noticed most were his eyes gray with what they described as a glow tess quit breathing and his unusual way of speaking craig added on the few occasions they spoke to him he didnt say goodbye but god bless tess felt a chill joseph used that expression often you told me so i got some keys from the landlord checked the apartment and tess fought to restrain a tremor id rather not describe what i found craig said its better if you see it fresh without expectations but i really dont understand what i thats why im taking you there maybe you can make sense of it craig steered toward the side of the road parking in a narrow slot tess all at once realized that shed been so engrossed by their conversation that she hadnt noticed theyd turned onto eightysecond street its just up the block craig said you learned all this since yesterday afternoon thats why i phoned you early and told you i wouldnt be in the office i had plenty to do but shouldnt homicide be working on this not missing persons craig shrugged i decided to keep my hand in but you must have hundreds of other cases hey i told you yesterday im doing this for you with a cough craig stepped from the car puzzled by craigs statement was he saying hed become attracted to her tess joined him her confusion immediately changing to apprehension as she walked past garbage cans along the curb approaching the mystery craig wanted to show her twenty the apartment building one of many narrow structures crammed together along the street looked different from the sootgrimed others only because its brick exterior was painted a dingy white at each window a fireescape ladder led down from a rusted metal platform craig opened the outside glass door escorted tess through a vestibule hanked by mailboxes roger copeland c pulled out a key and unlocked the inside door the interior smelled of cabbage they proceeded along a hallway and reached concrete steps on the left that crisscrossed upward an elevator faced them on the upper landing the architect saved costs craig said the elevator stops at only every other floor lets walk tess said youre kidding to the seventh floor i didnt get my run in this morning youre telling me you run every morning craig asked for the past twelve years holy tess glanced at craigs beefy chest a little exercise might strengthen your lungs can you manage the effort if you can do it i can the lieutenant stifled a cough just a guess did you ever smoke two packs a day for more years than youve been running he coughed again i stopped in january why doctors orders good doctor well hes certainly persistent thats what i mean a good doctor tess said as long as you stop lighting up well itll take a few more months to get the nicotine out of your system and a few more years to purge your lungs but youre in the right age group late thirties on balance youve got a good chance of not getting lung cancer the lieutenant stared at her are you always this dismally reassuring i guess i hate to see people damage themselves the way they seem determined to damage the planet i keep forgetting youre an environmentalist an optimist im hoping if i try hard enough and if others try hard enough we might actually be able to clean up this mess well craig coughed and gripped the bannister im prepared to do my share lets go seven floors no problem but listen if i get tired can i lean on your shoulder twentyone craig was out of breath his brow beaded with sweat when they reached the seventh floor but he hadnt complained and he hadnt stopped to take a rest tess gave him credit for being determined there thats my exercise for the month craig said dont break the start of a pattern try again tomorrow maybe you never know i might surprise you the lieutenants mischievous grin made tess suspect that he was trying to make her feel at ease to the left they faced c there wasnt any name in the slot below the apartments number a metal sign on the door said ace alarm system youd better put these on craig said he handed her rubber gloves and coverings for her sneakers homicide was here this morning they took photographs and did a preliminary dusting for fingerprints but theyll be back and even though ive got permission to show you the apartment we dont want to disturb it anymore than necessary craig had rubber gloves and shoe coverings for himself as well after knocking and getting no answer he pulled two keys from his pocket and unlocked two deadbolts but when he twisted the doorknob tess placed a nervous hand on his arm is something wrong craig asked are you sure theres nothing inside thatll gross me out youll be disturbed but i guarantee this wont be like the morgue trust me you dont need to feel afraid okay tess compacted her muscles im ready lets do it the lieutenant swung the door inward tess saw a white corridor a red light glowed on an alarm box to the right the alarm was primitive no number pad just a switch presumably because the landlord had economized by installing the least expensive model craig flicked the switch down the light went off they entered the corridor beyond the alarm box tess saw a small bathroom to the right a sink a commode a tub no shower stall the tub was old enough that its rim was curved oval instead of rectangular metal feet supporting it but despite its age and that of the sink and commode the pitted white surfaces gleamed tess concentrated so hard that the sound the lieutenant made when he shut the door surprised her making her flinch notice anything craig said behind her tess studied the neatly folded clean towel and washcloth on a shiny metal rod next to the sink on the sink itself a toothbrush that looked new stood in a sparkling glass the mirror on the medicine cabinet shone joseph was a better housekeeper than i am thats for sure look closer craig edged past her entering the bathroom he opened the medicine cabinet tess peered inside a razor a package of blades a tube of old spice shaving cream a tube of crest toothpaste the tubes were methodically rolled up from the bottom and set in an ordered row a bottle of old spice aftershave lotion a bottle of redken shampoo a packet of dental floss so tess asked the basics only the basics in fact for most people less than the basics in all my years of being a detective of searching the rooms that belong to missing persons ive never yet seen a medicine cabinet that didnt contain at least one prescription medicine an antibiotic or an antihistamine for example tess opened her mouth to respond craig raised his hand to interrupt okay from the way you describe him joseph was healthy exercised every day ate right took care of himself but tess there isnt even an aspirin bottle and everybody i dont care how healthy joseph was keeps aspirins i mean everybody i checked the rest of the apartment i found vitamins in the kitchen but aspirins the lieutenant shook his head the guy was a purist whats so strange about that he didnt like taking chemicals no matter how benign they are so what im not finished yet craig motioned for her to follow they left the bathroom continued along the hallway and reached a kitchen on the left there the stove refrigerator and dishwasher were several years old but like the sink commode and tub in the bathroom they were polished until they gleamed the worn but bright counter was bare no toaster no microwave no coffee pot craig opened the cupboards they were empty except for a plate bowl and cup in one and a few spotless stainless steel pots and a colander in another craig opened every drawer they too were empty except for a knife fork and spoon in one and two larger metal spoons appropriate for stirring food cooked in the stainless steel pots to put it mildly joseph felt compelled to strip things down to the absolute essentials the vitamins are in the spice rack behind you by the way no sage no oregano never mind salt or pepper only vitamins and no alcohol anywhere not even cooking sherry so joseph didnt like to drink big deal tess said i dont drink much either keep an open mind im just getting started tess shook her head bewildered as craig pulled open the fridge orange juice skim milk bottled water fruit a shitload of lettuce tomatoes peppers sprouts vegetables no meat no joseph told me he was a vegetarian dont you think he was taking it to an extreme not necessarily im a vegetarian tess said you ought to see my refrigerator the only thing different is i sometimes eat fish or chicken but only white meat craig gestured impatiently around him no cans of food in the cupboards of course too much salt too many preservatives the taste is synthetic no offense but i hope i never have to eat your cooking dont jump to conclusions lieutenant i cook very well im sure you do but if i dont get a steak now and then youd have less cholesterol tess said and maybe less weight around your belt craig squinted then chuckled then coughed i suppose i could use a few less never mind as i said were just getting started let me show you the living room tess followed leaving the kitchen proceeding down the corridor and faltered except for thick open draperies at the windows the room was totally empty no carpet no lamps no chairs no sofa no tables no shelves no television no stereo no posters no reproductions of paintings bare floor bare walls not even a phone craig said seeming to read her mind not in the kitchen not here and not in the bedroom no wonder joseph didnt give his employer his phone number he didnt have a phone he didnt want one and my guess is he didnt have any use for one because the last thing he wanted was a call from someone or to make a call your friend had reduced his life to bare necessities and dont tell me thats typical of a vegetarian because i know better ive never seen anything like this trembling tess opened a closet and stared at a jogging suit on a hanger next to a simple but practical overcoat no boxes on the upper shelf below on the otherwise barren floor she saw a solitary pair of nike jogging shoes trembling harder she clutched the edge of the closet door to steady herself and turned okay im convinced this isnt no one lives like somethings wrong but i havent shown you the best part or i should say the worst with a stark expression craig nodded toward a door the bedroom what youll see in thereno dont cringe it wont make you sick ive promised you that several times but i need to know what does it mean his footsteps echoing craig crossed the room and opened the bedroom door as if hypnotized tess stepped forward twentytwo the bedroom was almost as empty as the living room plain draperies but no carpet there was something in the corner but here the draperies had been shut the room too shadowy for tess to be able to identify the murky shape she groped along the inside wall and found a lights witch however when she flicked it nothing happened theres no lamp craig said and the overhead bulb doesnt work then how did joseph keep from stumbling around in the dark instead of answering the lieutenant pulled the draperies open hazy sunlight flowed in making tess blink as her eyes adjusted abruptly she blinked for another reason because what she saw in the room bewildered her the murky object shed glimpsed dimly in the corner was a mattress on the floor no not even a mattress a pallet sixfeet long threefeet wide oneinch thick made of woven hemp joseph didnt exactly pamper himself craig said no pillow no sheet just that one blanket i looked there arent any others in the closet tesss forehead pounded with mounting confusion she noticed that the blanket the lieutenant referred to had been folded at the bottom of the pallet with the same meticulous care that the towel and washcloth had been hung so neatly on the rack in the bathroom and theres your answer for how he kept from stumbling around in the dark craig said the pain in her skull increasing tess frowned toward where the lieutenant pointed and shook her head next to the pallet a dozen candles stood in saucers somehow i dont think he was just trying to save on his electricity bill craig said to the right of the pallet tess squinted at a plain pine threeshelved bookcase feeling pressure in her chest she walked toward it examining the titles the consolation of philosophy the collected dialogues of plato holy bible scofield reference edition eleanor of aquitaine the art of courtly love the last days of the planet earth i guess he never heard of the new york times bestseller list craig said philosophy religion history heavy id hate to have spent a weekend with him not many laughs he wasnt boring tess said distracted continuing to examine the shelves several books about the environment yes thats something else you and he shared in common trembling no matter how hard she tried to control it tess drew her index finger past a book called the millennium and noticed a title that wasnt in english the volume was bound in wellworn leather and looked very old can i take it out as long as you put it back exactly where you found it craig said with care she removed the book from the shelf and examined its dry cracked cover el circulo del cuello de la paloma looks like spanish craig said right im still working on english can you read it no tess exhaled frustrated i took a few courses in high school but i dont remember the vocabulary below the title craig said abu muhammad ali ibn hazm alandalusi he stumbled over the words i assume thats the authors name it barely fits across the cover muhammad sounds moslem tess nodded wrote the title and authors name on a notepad then opened the book its pages were brittle the entire text in spanish impatient she returned her gaze to the bookshelf in particular toward the scofield bible earlier something about it had troubled her it didnt look right she cautiously replaced the spanish book and withdrew the bible finding that its covers slanted inward with a frown she stared inside and discovered shocked that most of its pages had been removed a straight line showed where a knife or scissors had been used to cut out the pages why would thats one of many things i want to know craig said tess read the names of the sections at the top of the heavily underlined remaining pages he cut out everything except the preface and she flipped more pages johns gospel johns epistles johns book of revelation i dont understand youre not the only one and this craig pointed whatever the damned thing is on the bookshelf this is the weirdest of all tess raised her eyes shed noticed the object when she walked toward the bookshelf but it made so little sense that shed postponed examining it in the hope that the other things in the room would help her interpret the grotesque image the object was a statue or to be exact a basrelief sculpture one foot tall and wide fashioned out of white marble it depicted a longhaired muscular handsome man straddling the back of a bull jerking the struggling animals head up slashing its throat with a knife blood cascaded from the wound toward what appeared to be wheat growing out of the ground at the same time a dog lunged toward the blood while a serpent sped toward the wheat and a scorpion attacked the bulls testicles to the right and left of the grisly scene torch bearers watched the torch on the left was pointed upward the torch on the right pointed downward and above the torch bearer on the left a bird an owl hard to tell stared with fixated eyes toward the slashing knife and the cascading blood what does it mean craig asked since i first saw it this morning the things been haunting me tess had trouble speaking her mouth tasted bitter her shoulder blades felt frozen its horrible repulsive disgusting yeah just your ordinary everyday decoration around the house attached to the wall behind the statue imitating the torches that flanked the eerie grotesque scene were candles in holders one facing up the other down a saucer had been set beneath the latter candle to catch the melting wax when it fell joseph didnt have a lot of respect for the fire code craig said if the landlord had known about all these candles your friend would have found himself and his few belongings out on the street its a wonder he didnt burn down the building but this is crazy it sure as hell spooked me look theres no way i can borrow the bible and the spanish book right tess asked homicide would have my ass if i let you well can i at least take pictures youve got a camera always a reporters habit okay but i want you to promise craig said you wont publish the photographs unless youre given permission from homicide or me agreed then be my guest craig said tess removed a small mm olympus from her burlap purse and took several closeup photos of the statue from different angles then she opened the bible and photographed the most heavily underlined pages next after putting the bible back on the shelf in the spot where shed found it she photographed the entire bookshelf and finally the pallet flanked by candles she put away the camera all set theres one other promise i want you to make craig said if you learn anything from those photos i want to hear about it in case its something we havent already discovered word of honor craig fidgeted that look on your face youre doing it again tess said holding back the thing is what are you ready for another shock you mean there is more in the closet craig opened it notice he had few clothes a pair of clean jeans an extra shirt a spare only one cotton pullover a few pairs of socks and underwear on the shelf and this craig reached to the right toward the inside wall of the closet whatever it is i dont want to see it im sorry tess but its important i have to show you the lieutenant pulled an object from the closet the object was a footlong section of wood that seemed to have been cut from a broomstick handle a halfdozen threefootlong pieces of rope were attached to one end tess shuddered a whip with dried blood on the ropes he i believe the term is flagellated himself twentythree the tsavo national park kenya africa the hunter waited patiently clutching his longdistance highpowered rifle hunkering with practised discipline in a shelter of scrub thorn next to a cluster of baobob trees his view of the water hole was unobstructed at midday near the equator the heat was so severe that the targets would soon lumber into view forced to seek water although his widebrimmed hat and the bushes around him provided some shelter from the glaring sun the hunter sweated profusely his khaki hunting shirt dark with moisture but he didnt dare raise his canteen and drink lest his motions reveal his position after all his quarry was extremely cautious vigilant against intruders still the hunters patience and determination had been rewarded many times before he simply had to maintain professional conduct later when his hunt was successful he could afford the luxury of drinking his nerves tingled there to his left he sensed more than heard the approaching rumble of huge plodding feet then he saw the dustcloud they raised and finally the massive animals emerged from a stand of flowering acacia trees warily assessing the open grassland nervously judging the water hole elephants the hunter counted ten their wide ears were flared straining to detect unfamiliar threatening sounds with disappointment the hunter noted that four were tuskless children and that the adults had tusks that were barely hard to tell from this distance four feet long with greater disappointment he remembered a time twenty years ago when the curved tusks had been six eight and sometimes tenfeet long on average the weight of each tusk had dropped from eighteen pounds to nine as a consequence it required much more killing to achieve the quota demanded by ivory merchants twenty years ago the hunter mentally shook his head forty thousand elephants had roamed this plain but last year hed estimated that only five thousand remained and that figure didnt include the two thousand carcasses hed come upon during his increasingly determined expeditions soon the ivory trade wouldnt exist because the elephants themselves would no longer exist twelve tons of tusks the harvest from thirteen hundred elephants were worth three million dollars but smaller tusks meant less weight and more killing in order to achieve the quota his fingers rigid on his rifle the hunter watched the reluctant elephants finally overcome their nervousness and approach the water hole they were so magnificent he focused his intensity clasped his rifles trigger and slowly angrily swiveled his vision scanning the grassland around the water hole again the hunters nerves tingled instincts quickening to his right he saw motion figures rose from the shelter of waisthigh grass these figures too held rifles men dressed in camouflage khaki the same as himself other hunters but he and they werent competitors not at all quite the contrary they existed in a complex deadly condition of symbiosis their purpose demanded his purpose and with angry resolve the executioner swung his rifle toward those predators even from a distance he could tell that they werent using hunting rifles but automatic weapons ms and aks hed stumbled upon the evidence of their slaughter too many times before entire herds destroyed riddled with bullets their carcasses rotting in the sun their tusks grotesquely hacked from their faces their meat which could have been used by starving natives left for ravaging jackels and swarming maggots god damn those other hunters to hell which was exactly where this hunter intended to send them careful not to reveal himself he slowly stood raised his rifle braced it against his shoulder intensified his vision through the rifles highenlargement sights steadied his finger on the trigger and with enormous satisfaction squeezed without removing his gaze from the rifles sights he saw in closeup the predators skull blow apart nothing like explosive bullets at once the hunter saw another predator surge upward from the grass recoil in horror raise his hand to his mouth and stumble back fleeing no problem with a slight shift of angle and focus the hunter shot yet again and blew the second predators chest apart so how does it feel the hunter thought when you died did you feel like did you identify with did you imagine and regret and feel sorry for the agony you caused so many of gods magnificent irreplaceable creatures the elephants shit no youre incapable of emotion except for greed but youre not feeling that now are you youre not feeling anything because you bastards youre one less curse on the planet native bearers scrambled from the waisthigh grass and fled toward a distant ridge their panicked outlines were tempting but the hunter restrained his trigger finger and lowered his rifle his message had been delivered he understood although disapproved of their motives the native bearers needed employment yes they needed money they needed food but no matter their desperation they shouldnt help to destroy their heritage the elephants were africa the elephants were the hunters anger diminished his churning stomach made him want to vomit as the native bearers scrambled below the curve of the distant ridge he stood with professional caution assessed the grassland around him regretted that the elephants had been spooked by his gunshots and had retreated from their desperate need to drink from the shallow muddy water hole but he felt tremendous pride that hed done his duty it took him five minutes to reach the first of his executed predators his dead antagonist looked pathetic the robust mans skull blasted open his blood soaking into the dirt but then the hunter reminded himself the dead elephants looked even more pathetic because when alive so magnificent the elephants had been a triumph of creation an example had to be made the hunter removed a pair of pliers knelt propped open the corpses mouth and began the necessary but repulsive work of reinforcing the example ivory he muttered his voice choked is that what you want ivory well here damn it let me help you out i mean unlike the elephants youve got all the ivories anybody needs with torturous effort the hunter began to yank out each and every one of the corpses teeth he set them neatly in a pile beside the sunkenmouthed corpse he then proceeded toward his other victim by every means necessary examples reprisals had to be made the slaughter had to be stopped twentyfour im sorry craig said for what really i didnt mean to upset you this much its not your fault tess said i had to i needed to see that apartment earth mother magazine wont go out of business because im not there i wouldnt be much good to them anyhow ive got some thinking to do with a troubled expression craig doubleparked on the noisy crowded street outside tesss loft in soho well while youre thinking remember your promise homicide will investigate thoroughly but if something occurs to you that might help explain what we found in josephs apartment let me know the lieutenant gave her a card thats my home telephone number at the bottom if its important dont wait to call me at the office hey dont worry if i have to ill call you in the middle of the night craig grinned thats fine with me im a very light sleeper he coughed that is when i sleep at all which reminds me tess fumbled in her purse i almost forgot while i waited for you to pick me up i brought you a couple of presents oh a copy of our magazine maybe thatll help put you to sleep i doubt it if anything im sure itll keep me awake you have my word ill read it cover to cover ill have a quiz prepared also i brought you this she handed him a box of cough drops craig looked amused thanks people dont often give me anything except grief he cleared his throat take care huh you too echoing josephs words she surprised herself by adding god bless craig nodded after getting out of the car tess watched the lieutenant drive away pretending to climb the steps to her apartment building she waited until craigs car disappeared around a corner then instead of entering her building she walked briskly in the opposite direction toward a shop down the street twentyfive quick photo a sign said on the window a bell rang when tess opened and shut the door a middleaged hispanic clerk glanced up from stacking boxes of film behind the counter his voice had no trace of an accent when he asked can i be of help tess hesitated the clerks tawny skin there was something about it reminded tess of josephs skin shed assumed that josephs swarthy skin was due to a tan but maybe she wondered could joseph have been hispanic that would explain the spanish book on his shelf yes in your window you advertise onehour film processing of course but for an extra charge the clerk said no problem tess unloaded her camera and handed the clerk the film its important i need it back as soon as possible one moment the clerk took the film through a door behind him and returned a halfminute later my brother is beginning to process it now he poised a pen above an order form your name tess gave him all the information he needed the clerk handed tess a claim check is there anything else i can help you with yes i want more film three rolls thirtysix exposures each asp two hundred from trialanderror tess had learned that for her simple easytocarry inexpensive camera an asp of two hundred was a good compromise for getting clear indoor and outdoor pictures i you look do you speak spanish the clerk smiled si senorita muy bien then if you dont mind could you tell me what this means tess pulled her notepad from her purse and showed him the title shed written el circulo del cuello de la paloma the clerk shrugged the circle or possibly the ring of the neck of the dove tess frowned disappointed shed hoped that the title would give her an indication of what the book contained well have you ever heard of a book with that name my apologies senorita no then what about this she pointed toward the authors name abu muhammad ali ibn hazm alandalusi why is the authors name so long the clerk raised his shoulders in spanish long names are common they often include the parents names but muhammad isnt a spanish name it sounds moslem arabic thats true the clerk said and what about at the end here alandalusi that means he comes from andalusia if i remember tess said thats in spain right yes the southernmost province i dont understand why would someone whos arabic come from a spanish province the clerk spread his hands and shook his head my former countrys history is complicated he glanced at a clock on the wall your pictures should be ready by five ill be back thank you de nada twentysix tess hurried to her apartment building ignored the elevator and ran up the stairs to her loft after locking the door behind her she rushed to pick up her portable phone tapped some numbers and went to a closet pulling out a suitcase the receptionist at earth mother magazine answered betty tess is walter free good then put me through walter its tess i need a favor i cant come into work for the next few days can you spare me yes ive been working on the article this isnt connected lets call it family business the point is i have to leave town what is this about joseph okay all right you guessed it are you a mind reader now walter i have to do this be careful hey what else i promise with relief tess broke the connection carried the suitcase toward her bureau and pressed more memorized numbers on the portable phone public library reference department please while she waited she tossed a change of clothes into her suitcase reference department im a journalist im on deadline and id appreciate if you checked your computer for a book im trying to find its called the circle or the ring of the neck of the dove waiting again tess entered her bathroom and placed an emergency kit of toothpaste etc into her suitcase no thank you but tess felt hollow as she zipped her suitcase shut she left the bathroom reached her volume of the yellow pages and finally found what she wanted again she pressed numbers on the portable phone trump shuttle i need a seat on the six oclock flight to washington yes i know you guarantee seats but i dont want to wait if you have to bring out another plane my am ex number is she slumped on her sofa tried to clear her mind and pressed more buttons mother im coming to town tonight thats right its been a long time well catch up im fine mother listen as i recall you had some influence with the library of congress director didnt he used to come to fathers dinner parties good i want you to call him ask him if he knows about and can get me this book tess gave the title eight mother maybe later im trying i just dont know exactly dont keep dinner waiting yes i love you too she pressed the disconnect button searched her address book and pressed more numbers actually she jabbed them brian hamilton please yes thats what i expected hes always unavailable tell him theresa drake is calling yes that drake the name had magic or possibly caused fear for whatever reason brian hamilton answered quickly how are you tess his voice was smooth its been a long time not long enough but i want to get reacquainted brian in person oh does that mean you bet im coming to town be at my mothers house at eight tonight im sorry tess i cant im scheduled to attend a reception for the soviet ambassador with all respect to the soviet ambassador respect exactly were suddenly allies i have to youre not

like a threat a threat brian i dont make threats i make guarantees im a journalist remember i know your secrets just as i knew about my fathers i might be tempted to write a story about them unless you want to put out a contract on me hey tess lets not overreact you know we dont just be at my mothers eight oclock brian hesitated if you insist for the sake of old times and your father i look forward to tess broke the connection twentyseven on schedule at five oclock her clothes moist from urgency tess carried her suitcase into the quick photo store again the bell rang again the middleaged hispanic clerk glanced up at her tess eased her suitcase onto the floor and breathed out my pictures theyre ready but of course the clerk said as we advertise onehour service he reached in a drawer here they are tess opened her wallet im sorry your friend got angry my friend the man you sent to pick up the photographs for you but i a month ago we gave out some wedding pictures by mistake in truth it was my fault i forgot to ask for the claim check since then i dont give out any pictures unless heres the claim check tess said her hand shook you did the right thing i didnt send what did he look like tan early thirties tall wellbuilt goodlooking the clerk paused then frowned he became quite insistent when i wouldnt give him the photographs he was so upset that i almost feared hed force me to give him the photographs i reached under the counter the clerk held up a baseball bat for this in case he turned violent perhaps he noticed my gesture fortunately it wasnt necessary just then three customers came in he left in a hurry the clerk frowned harder what i noticed most about him were his eyes his eyes tess gripped the counter for support what about them their color was unusual gray yes senorita how did you tess gaped feeling sick she dropped money on the counter grabbed the package of photographs and mustered the discipline not to tremble she rushed toward the door to find a taxi youre certain i did the right thing senorita absolutely from now on you get all my business the overhead bell rang as tess lunged out scanning the smoggy street she suddenly realized her stomach burning that she wasnt just looking for a taxi the man the clerk had described sounded like joseph but joseph was dead how could as she hailed a taxi and scrambled into it tess surprised herself by assuming one of josephs habits nervous she darted her eyes in every direction to see if she was being followed urgent fury one la guardia airport the grimfaced man in the taxis back seat leaned forward rigidly straining to keep the taxi ten cars ahead of him in sight he was thirtyeight of medium height and weight with brown hair and unremarkable features so average that no one ever remembered him he wore a conservative moderately priced nondescript suit a cottonpolyesterblend white shirt a subdued striped tie his briefcase looked no different from thousands of others which airline the taxi driver asked the passenger hesitated watching the taxi he was following hey friend i said which airline just a moment im checking my tickets dont you think you should have done that a little sooner ahead the taxi the passenger studied turned right off the busy ramp rounded a curve and sped past a crowded parking lot a sign said trump shuttle delta northwestern pan am shuttle turn right the passenger said you waited long enough to tell me which airline the driver repeated im still checking my tickets hey if you miss your flight pal dont blame me the passenger squinted forward noticing that the taxi he followed steered around the parking lot passed the signs for pam am delta and northwestern and approached a large new building on which a huge red sign announced trump shuttle up here will do the passenger said well finally when the driver stopped behind a limousine in front of the terminal the passenger had already checked the taxis meter he added the cost of the bridge toll and a twenty percent tip shoved several bills toward the driver grabbed his briefcase and hurried out his door hey buddy you want a receipt but the passenger was gone as he walked toward a set of automatically opening doors in the shuttle complex he glanced unobtrusively to his left seeing the woman he was following get out of her taxi pay the driver and carry her underseat suitcase toward another set of doors they entered the terminal simultaneously moving parallel to each other separated by a throng of arriving travelers the brownhaired nondescript man paused next to a group of similarly ordinarylooking businessmen and pretended to inspect his ticket while he watched the woman hurry toward a line at a counter the line moved quickly trump guaranteed promptness nonetheless the woman looked impatient when she got her turn she urgently presented a credit card signed a voucher grabbed a folder that presumably contained a ticket and rushed past the counter toward where the attractive female clerk pointed excellent the chameleon thought he veered through the crowd following his quarry shed already passed through the security station by the time he arrived there strictly speaking no one without a ticket was allowed beyond this point no problem though the chameleon always carried a bogus ticket with him and in his considerable experience few security personnel actually bothered to check that ticket he set his briefcase on the conveyor belt that led into the xray machine a uniformed attendant nodded for him to proceed through the metal detector the chameleon by habit carried no metal not even coins or a belt buckle when he was working his watch was made of plastic the metal detector remained silent as he stepped through and picked up his briefcase on the other side of the xray machine the briefcase of course contained nothing that would arouse suspicion only innocent boring documents certainly no weapons his expertise was surveillance after all the chameleon had no need of weapons although on a very few occasions emergencies had forced him to defend himself his average height and weight deceptive his martialarts skills impressive he increased his speed climbing a moving escalator just another of many harried businessmen in a rush to get on a plane ahead on the spacious upper level his quarry walked faster again no problem the chameleon didnt want to catch up to her but only keep her in sight he glanced at his watch five minutes to six peering ahead he saw his quarry present her boarding pass to an attendant and disappear quickly through an open door toward the tunnel to her plane the chameleon waited until the door to the tunnel was closed then proceeded toward a window and watched the plane pull away from the boarding platform but he still wasnt satisfied experience had taught him that he had to wait until the plane left the ground five minutes later the chameleon had to give trump credit as advertised the shuttle left on time turning he walked toward a counter near the passenger door on a board behind the counter he noted the planes destination excuse me he asked the attendant what time will that flight arrive hearing the answer he smiled thank you he had only one more thing to do at a bank of phones he used a credit card to contact a longdistance number peter its robert both names were fake on the slim chance that this phone would be monitored or that someone on a neighboring phone would overhear never take chances im sorry to have kept you waiting but our friend had trouble making connections i know how much you want to meet her shes on a trump shuttle to washington national airport shell arrive at sevenohseven can you thats what i thought peter youre a pal i know shell be glad to see you his work done the chameleon hung up the phone clutching his briefcase he retraced his steps through the concourse but on second thought his work was not yet done not at all it never ended never not that he objected his duty was too important it occupied indeed it possessed his mind and his soul first as soon as he returned to manhattan he would quickly arrange to have a tap put on the womans phone that hadnt seemed necessary until today until her visit to the apartment on east eightysecond street made it obvious that the woman continued to be obsessed with the death of her friend if her phone had been tapped earlier yesterday while shed been at the morgue for example the chameleon might have learned that shed made arrangements to fly to washington and his task of following her would have been less complicated that oversight in his surveillance of her would now be corrected her trip to washington might have nothing to do with the death of the man called joseph martin but the chameleon couldnt depend on might have he needed to know everything that she knew next he would check with the members of his team to learn if theyd been successful in tracking down the man whod tried to intercept the pictures that the woman had left to be developed at the photo shop near her apartment building the chameleon had been one of three people whod entered the store while the man was arguing with the clerk as a consequence the chameleon had gotten a good look at the man when he stormed from the shop enough to give a thorough description to the members of his team in particular what had interested the chameleon intensely so were the mans gray eyes finally while the chameleon waited for his contacts in washington to warn him when the woman would be returning to manhattan he would occupy his time by following someone else the detective lieutenant craig was showing unusual interest in this matter after all the investigation now should belong to homicide not missing persons perhaps the lieutenants real interest was in the woman the chameleon didnt know yet but he would know soon everything about the detective because anyone as persistent as lieutenant craig had become might learn things that were very very useful two on the trump shuttle to washington tess did her best to ignore the drone of the engines and concentrate on her priorities she always felt discomfort after takeoffs and now rubbed her forehead while she opened and closed her mouth trying to relieve the aching pressure in her sinuses and behind her ears nonetheless the photographs in her purse insisted she wanted to seem casual however not attract attention be cool she was still disturbed that someone had tried to steal the pictures only after glancing at the passenger next to her did she decide to open her purse the passenger was reading usa today the frontpage sidebar of which said that a third of all species of north american fish were in danger of extermination the next paragraph indicated that for every tree that was planted four others were killed by acid rain dried streams or commercial development angered by the article her frustration intensifying she opened her purse removed the package of photographs and studied them the closeups of the titles on josephs bookcase immediately attracted her attention with equal immediacy she noticed that the seatbelt sign was off and stood to walk up the aisle toward a row of phones mounted on the bulkhead at the front of the cabin using her credit card she put a call through to new york and her favorite book store the strand on lower broadway lester hows it going me howd you guess is my voice that distinctive well yeah a little fuzzy im on a plane to washington no just family business listen can you do me a favor i assume

alone you sound in stress stress you dont know the half of it just get me those books as soon as possible got it sweetheart ill check our stacks as youre well aware weve got just about everything send them to tess almost said her loft in soho but all at once suspicious remembering the incident at the photo shop she told him the address for earth mother magazine up from the strand s location on broadway stomach cramping she replaced the phone and returned to her seat ignoring the curious glance of the passenger who set down his usa today tess closed her eyes in truth squeezed them tightly painfully shut when she anticipated dreaded her arrival at washington national airport and her eventual meeting with her mother not just her mother her dead fathers nemesis that son of a bitch that murderous bastard that fucking brian hamilton three alexandria virginia although the sun had just begun to set every downstairs window of the colonial mansion was brilliantly lit every outside floodlight gleaming as the taxi steered through a tall open metal gate tess scanned the shrubs that bordered the fence then directed her gaze toward the spacious upwardly sloping lawn the numerous elaborate flower gardens the magnificent towering oaks from one of which shed fallen and broken her arm as a child with painful fondness she remembered her father rushing to help her the fountain that shed loved to wade in what a tomboy i was she thought and managed a smile at once her smile dissolved as the taxi continued along the extensive curved driveway approaching the mansion and a silver rolls corniche parked below the white stone steps that led past columns to the huge doubledoored entrance the corniche had government plates a chauffeur bodyguard stood alertly next to it his hands at his sides while he squinted toward the taxi no doubt about it brian hamilton had arrived tess paid the driver and got out of the taxi staring at the chauffeur when she passed him giving him a good look at her brian had presumably told the man what she looked like with a nod he stepped back ignoring her directing his attention toward the taillights of the taxi as it continued around the semicircle of the driveway and disappeared down the quiet treelined street yes definitely a bodyguard tess thought she carried her suitcase up the steps and hesitated beneath the portico finally ringing the doorbell ten seconds later a butler in livery answered tess hadnt been here in so long that she didnt recognize him ive come to see my mother i know ms drake my name is jonathan he gave her a solemn smile welcome youre expected if you please let me carry your suitcase he shut the door when she entered and with echoing footsteps escorted her across the large lofty marblefloored vestibule toward the drawing room on the right on the way tess noticed that a new matisse had been added to the collection of paintings along the wall the drawing rooms sliding oak door was closed when the butler pulled it soundlessly open tess tried to appear calm the moment she saw her mother rise from a french regency sofa to the left of the fireplace theresa dear how wonderful to see you her mother had never approved of her fathers calling her tess trim tall in her sixties her mother looked ten years younger due to numerous face lifts that nonetheless gave her aristocratic features a pinched expression as always in the evening she wore a formal dress this one made of expensive amber silk that whispered when she walked and considerable jewelry a diamond necklace matching earrings a ruby brooch a sapphire ring on one hand her glinting impressive engagement and wedding rings on the other despite her husbands death six years ago she persisted in wearing them an emerald bracelet on one wrist a gold piaget watch on the other really truly how wonderful like so many graduates of radcliffe in the pure old days before that womens college had crassly god help us whats the world coming to been integrated with the men at harvard she walked as if a board had been strapped to her back and with husky tones reminiscent of lauren bacall who hadnt gone to radcliffe she tended to emphasize her words its been so long you know how i miss you you mustnt be such a stranger by then her mother had reached tess and with the obligatory fashionable almostkiss brushed her right and then left cheek barely touching against tesss yes mother and its good to see you tess managed to smile jonathan will take your suitcase to your room come in sit down you must be exhausted from your travel mother its only an hours flight from new york oh really well yes i suppose thats true then why dont i see you more tess walked toward the french regency chair placed across from and matching the sofa my work keeps me awfully busy i barely have time to do my laundry let alone your laundry tesss mother cocked her head back you do your own i keep forgetting you want to be independent thats right mother tess squirmed against the scrollwork on the chair while her eyes searched the room but disturbingly found no sign of brian hamilton independent and your work how is your little magazine doing it isnt little mother and i think its doing some good well thats what we want tesss mother fidgeted on the sofa its about the environment something about pollution tess nodded and the problems getting worse well of course at my age i wont live long enough to never mind the important thing is that youre happy yes mother despite her confused emotions about josephs death about the man whose description resembled him the man whod attempted to steal the photographs shed taken of josephs bedroom tess managed a genuine smile she imitated her mothers habit of emphasis i am happy well her mother smoothed her dress in that case she straightened her necklace i suppose thats all that matters but she didnt looked convinced tess felt selfconscious as her mother assessed her sneakers jeans and shortsleeved cotton pullover i know mother you wish id dress like a lady at the moment you appear to have come from an athletic event at the very least you could have worn a brassiere i feel more comfortable this way mother especially when its so humid humid precisely your pullovers so damp that i can see your ill never forgive myself for allowing you to go to georgetown university instead of one of the seven sisters tess bristled it wasnt you who let me go it was father tesss mother shook her head thats an ancient topic weve discussed it far too often im sorry i raised it since we see each other so seldom lets do our best to be agreeable thats all i want mother very well then its settled well be agreeable tesss mother smoothed her dress again i know you told me not to have dinner prepared but i took the liberty of having edna prepare some liver pate you always enjoyed that as i recall very much tess lied and some tea of course i think we could all use some tea as her mother picked up and daintily jingled a tiny silver bell tess peered around again speaking of all of us i asked brian hamilton to meet me here tess frowned i think thats his corniche in the driveway but i dont the door to the drawing room slid open tess swung her head sharply a maid stepped in she wore a uniform complete with a bonnet and carried a silver tray of toast and pate placing them on a thirtythousanddollar antique table someone else appeared a man who wore a tuxedo and carried another silver tray upon which were tea cups and a twohundredyearold japanese teapot i apologize for taking so long on the phone melinda i hope you dont mind i thought id make myself useful and help edna bring in the things mind of course not im sure edna appreciates the courtesy and no guest of mine can ever do anything wrong the man set his tray beside the toast and pate on the table then turned to tess and smiled he was in his early sixties but for all that he was straightbacked trim solid with thick dark superbly cut hair and a rectangular ruggedly handsome face he photographed extremely well in newspapers the captions beneath the photographs usually emphasized his numerous medals from vietnam and his legendary career as a maverick general in the marines his smile exaggerated the crinkles around his eyes and made him look more rugged his voice was husky but with the smooth cadence of a tv announcer how are you tess he held out his manicured muscular hand reluctantly tess shook it his grip was firm ive been better brian at the moment ive got a problem so i gathered on the phone brian turned toward the maid then raised his eyebrows toward tesss mother but before we discuss tesss mother got the hint thatll be fine edna we can pour the tea ourselves as you like maam edna curtsied and left the room pulling the door shut behind her there tesss mother said now im sure you wouldnt mind doing the honors brian of course he picked up the teapot no wait tess said before we im really not they frowned at her thirsty or hungry i grabbed a pretzel in the airport pretzel tesss mother looked horrified id like to get to the point tess said and brian since youre wearing your tuxedo i assume that means you either just came from or still plan to go to the reception for the soviet ambassador i also assume that means youre anxious either to return or arrive there so i wont keep you any longer than necessary believe me i dont want to waste your time she tried not to sound sarcastic tess you could never waste my time brian set down the teapot came around the table and faced her i told you on the phone for the sake of old times and your father i want to do everything i can to help exactly my father we were friends brian said but that didnt stop you from sending him to beirut now honestly her mother said if this conversation is going to be unpleasant i dont intend to sit here and thats a good idea mother why dont you leave brian and i have things to talk about no melinda you stay right where you are its time we cleared the air brian said for all of us he sat beside tesss mother and clasped her hand at once for the first time tess had the suspicion that they might be having an affair her fathers best friend the man whod sent that best friend to his death could that monster possibly be screwing his best friends wife the thought of the two of them in bed together made tess so queasy that she wished she hadnt eaten the pretzel on the way from the airport okay the three of us tess said thats fine with me just so long as i get what i want your father was a committed diplomat brian said he went to that insanity in beirut because he thought he could make a difference help settle the violence among the christians the moslems and all their splinter groups in his heart he believed he could actually stop the killing you sound like youre making a speech tess said brian shrugged an occupational hazard in fact that bromide you just gave me i think i read those same words in the washington post at the time of my fathers death possibly brian looked despondent unfortunately on occasion because im asked so many questions im forced to repeat myself but what you didnt tell the post was that my father was sent to beirut to negotiate an arms agreement with the side you wanted to win the christians and you also didnt tell the post that your security was so damned sloppy that the moslems found out and kidnapped my father to stop him from completing the arms deal now tess thats all speculation dont treat me like a fool the moslems wanted my father to confess about us interference on the side of the christians but my father wouldnt confess no matter what they did to him no matter how much they tortured him so they beat him they starved him and when he still wouldnt talk they slit his throat and dumped him into a gutter as an example to america not to interfere tess thats your interpretation weapons had nothing to do with it he was there as a wellintentioned negotiator pure and simple nothing about what you bastards do is pure and simple tesss mother flinched i refuse to tolerate vulgar language in no let her finish melinda for once and for all well settle this brian said i know what you ordered my father to do i know he disapproved of the assignment but wouldnt refuse an order from the white house tess said how do i know because i overheard his conversations on the phone and when he brought documents from work i not only secretly read them i made copies before he shredded them if you did tess thats a breach of national security there are serious penalties for as serious as what happened to my father what would you do to me put me in jail of course not id talk so unless you want another irancontraarms scandal youd have to kill me thats enough tesss mother jerked upright thats all i intend to hear your father was a great man and i wont listen to you sully either his or brians reputation no melinda wait brian clasped her hand again his voice disturbingly calm i think tess is almost finished i believe shes leading up to something and when she finally gets to the point i suspect well finally settle the ghost that haunts us tess excuse me but if i can be allowed to be vulgar cut to the chase what in hell do you want tess inhaled and answered as calmly as she could whenever i see your name in the newspaper i look away in fury but i dont live in limbo i hear things despite the change in administration i gather youre still very much associated with the government thats correct brian straightened with the national security council among other things tess said an unsubstantiated rumor hey brian were talking about payoff time a favor in exchange for my silence i wont forgive you for what you ordered my father to do but i swear god help me if you do what i want ill never raise the subject again the ruggedfaced war hero studied her thats a tempting offer then take it the diplomats eyes became more calculating so whats your problem tesss cramped muscles abruptly went limp i have that is i had i dont know what to call him a friend slowly haltingly for the next quarterhour tess explained describing her meetings with joseph his failure to join her at the park her grotesque experience at the new york city morgue her disturbing visit to josephs apartment she ended her stressful account by displaying the photographs of the puzzling objects in josephs bedroom brian studied the photographs weird are you sure your friend wasnt on drugs drugs no way and he didnt drink either he didnt even use aspirin he was fanatical about his health but he acted as if he might have been followed and brian shook his head i honestly what do you want me to do use your influence with the fbi and the cia i think that joseph might have been spanish i know he assumed a false identity the fbi has his fingerprints make copies of them and send them to interpol get in touch with whatever it is you do do it pretend the countrys been threatened if that gives you motivation i want to know josephs real identity i want to find out who killed him and who tried to steal these photographs and who might be following me and wait brian interrupted you believe youre telling me you think youve been followed im so confused i dont know what to think all right calm down let me all right those photographs can i borrow them and make copies not a chance i wont let them out of my sight in other words you dont trust me to keep them safe ill have copies made myself and send them to you very well brian said clear enough i have one more question ive got nothing to hide ask it you met this man three times and only three times and yet you feel this obligated to find out who killed him does that mean you fell in love with him tess glared defensively its more complicated than that he was different special lets say i cared for him so what just so i know your motive my motive is justice brian the same motive youre supposed to have as long as it doesnt involve selling weapons in beirut all right brian stood military straight youll hear from me the sooner the speed isnt always a virtue brian said but thoroughness in that im an expert then prove it tess said one day i hope you wont hate me i dont know why you would care no tess shook her head thats wrong ive got a suspicion so brian if im right for my father and your relationship with my mother bust your ass theresa her mother objected mother if you dont mind keep out of this oh my her mother clasped her mouth brian extended his hand a deal tess if you deliver yes its a deal she shook his hand it was no longer firm as soon as i can knowing you and your skills tess paused you should have been a diplomat far too ugly brian perhaps youre right excuse me melinda ive got some work to do dont forget the reception for the soviet ambassador tess said bitterly i havent but ive decided not to go as you put it on the phone fuck him but by all means with respect yes by all means brian hamilton strode toward the oak door slid it open and disappeared really tesss mother said did he have to say fuck mother for heavens sakes hes a war hero if youre attracted to him youd better get used to hearing him use foul language on occasion good gracious i hope not mother didnt father ever say fuck well yes but i ignored it then youve got a problem ive changed my mind hand me some of that toast pour me a cup of tea ill ring for edna no mother youll pour the tea and incidentally i hate liver pate four parked down the shadowy street from the mansion in this elite district of alexandria virginia the chameleons surrogate his height weight and features equally unremarkable except that his hair was sandy not brown sipped stale coffee from a plastic cup his empty thermos on the seat beside him next to his browning mm semiautomatic pistol concealed beneath his oversized metal briefcase the briefcase was open a cord from an audio scanner plugged into the cars cigarettelighter receptacle to use energy from the vehicles battery the scanner could not detect broadcasts from twoway radios such as those used by the police and taxi drivers which operated on a uhf frequency in the range of fourhundred megahertz instead the scanner was intended to intercept conversations from cellular telephones such as those used in cars which broadcast on a much higher frequency the eighthundred megahertz band while it was legal to possess equipment to eavesdrop on police transmissions it was a punishable offense to own a receiver that intercepted broadcasts from car phones not that the chameleons surrogate cared hed broken many laws in his career this was the least of them indeed he was prepared to break many more laws and it didnt matter to him how serious they were after all he had his orders a mission to complete and so far this mission had gone smoothly hed had no difficulty in following the tall blond attractive athleticlooking woman from washington national airport to here at the moment with an equal lack of difficulty another member of his team was arranging to put a tap on the mansions telephone system eventually the mansion itself would be bugged meanwhile this limited electronic surveillance would have to do periodically the man who wore an ordinary mediumpriced business suit and had a talent for making himself virtually invisible in a crowd heard a dim conversation from thisorthat frequency on his scanner after listening carefully he decided that their topics did not concern him periodically as well he turned on his cars engine so that the scanner wouldnt drain the vehicles battery although he directed his stern attention toward the mansion and in particular toward the entrance and the exit from the semicircular driveway he repeatedly darted his eyes both ahead and upward in the latter case toward his rearview mirror what troubled him were headlights if he saw any approaching him hed immediately shut off the cars engine disengage the plug from the cigarettelighter receptacle place the cord in the briefcase and close the lid after all this exclusive area was likely to be patrolled by police cars the officers in which might be tempted to stop to ask him why he was out here at this hour that was the trouble with trying to establish an automobile surveillance site in an upperclass suburban neighborhood few people if any parked on the street this night however the watcher had gotten lucky a halfblock down from the mansion someone was having a party or what in so exclusive a district was probably called a reception and not all the visiting cars had been able to fit in the spacious driveway a few cadillacs and oldsmobiles sat out here on the street behind him but although the watchers dark ford taurus didnt blend with those expensive automobiles the watcher doubted hed have any problems in convincing a curious policeman that he was a hired driver whod been forced to use this taurus when the cadillac he was supposed to use turned out he would claim to have a faulty fuel pump earlier this evening the watchers luck remained with him no police cars had so far driven by abruptly he straightened seeing a silver rolls corniche emerge from the mansions driveway and head in the opposite direction after quickly removing nightvision binoculars from beneath his seat he studied the corniche and satisfied himself that only a chauffeur and a man in the back seat were present in the vehicle the corniche had a government license plate intriguing the watcher noted the plates number on a slip of paper and would later use his contacts to determine who owned the car but for the moment since the woman wasnt in the corniche his duty was not to follow the car but instead to maintain his surveillance on the mansion at once he heard beeps then buzzes that were interrupted by a voice from his audio scanner so distinct that it had to be coming from a car phone that was near presumably in the corniche hello a man said with a formal tone mr chathams residence this is brian hamilton i know its late i hate to disturb him but is eric home he is however hes about to retire for the evening tell him whos calling please and tell him its important the watcher increased his concentration eric chatham chatham was the director of the fbi and brian hamilton evidently the passenger in the corniche was the former secretary of state currently an advisor to the president also a member of among other things the national security council my my the watcher thought heavy hitters by all means just a moment mr hamilton the watcher stared toward the red light on his audio scanner and the voices coming from it brian a sonorous voice asked tired and puzzled i was just getting into my pajamas ive been looking forward to reading the new stephen king something that has nothing to do with never mind whats going on my assistant tells me this is important i apologize hamilton said i came across some information tonight and id like to discuss it with you now cant it wait until the morning at my office my schedules crowded but i can squeeze you in for fifteen minutes just before lunch i might need more than fifteen minutes hamilton said in private undistracted the reception became less distinct as the corniche left the neighborhood in private eric chatham sounded confused yes this relates to a case your people were asked to work on but in truth its personal it has to do with remington drake his widow and his daughter i need to ask a favor remington drake dear god and this favors important to me yes very important brian hamilton said a favor well if youre putting it on that basis youve certainly done enough favors for me and remington drake was certainly my friend how quickly can you be here ten minutes ill be waiting thanks eric i appreciate your cooperation dont speak too soon i havent cooperated yet but i have every confidence that you will ten minutes the transmission ended the watcher frowned trying to interpret what hed heard but hed been concentrating so hard that hed failed to hear something else the soft rush of rubbersoled shoes on the street darting toward his side of the car because of the heat the watcher had left his window open after all he couldnt keep his engine running constantly at the risk of attracting attention just so he could use the cars air conditioner in alarm as the watcher stomach burning snapped his head toward the rushing footsteps he gaped at a pistol being shoved through the open window startled he didnt have time to grab his browning from beneath his briefcase the equipped with a silencer made a spitting sound the watcher groaned from the impact of the bullet against his skull the closerange wallop was forceful enough to jolt the watcher sideways blood spewed he shuddered and toppled to the right across his audio scanner but the small bullet didnt kill him shocked powerless in excruciating pain he retained sufficient consciousness to sense hear and quiver as the assassin jerked open the drivers door the assassin grabbed the watchers body twisted it and shoved it crammed it onto the floor below the passenger seat at once the assassin shut the door started the car and drove at a steady unobtrusive speed from the shadowy neighborhood slumped on the floor the watcher blinked unable to see feeling his life drain from him as his blood soaked the carpet his skull felt as if a nail had been driven through it if the assassin had used a more powerful weapon the watcher would have been killed instantly he dimly realized but a large caliber pistol even with a silencer would have made a discernible noise not much more like a cough than thes spit all the same perhaps just loud enough that someone leaving the party down the street might have heard and become suspicious a silencerequipped though especially if the ammunition had a specially calculated reduced socalled subsonic amount of powder was almost as quiet as a handgun could be in a sickening daze the watcher felt the car turn a corner as his blood pooled in front of his face threatening to drown him he was murkily amazed that he wasnt dead through his terrible pain a weak thought struggled to assure him that he might have a chance of surviving survive hey who are you kidding give me a break with a head wound no way but he knows im still alive he can hear me wheezing why didnt he shoot a second time and finish me an amateur no god in heaven no the watchers fading mind concluded thoughts spinning the stench of his cascading blood making him gag he blearily decided im wrong not an amateur when the watcher had pivoted toward the rushing footsteps hed noticed that the pistol had an unusual shape a baffle attached to the top where the slide would normally jerk back and eject the empty cartridge then snap forward to position a fresh round into the firing chamber but the baffle prevented the slide from moving back and forth and allowing sound to escape from the weapon the baffle was a reinforcement of the silencer thus the could be fired only once that was why the assassin hadnt pulled the trigger again and made sure i was dead no not an amateur a professional very professional a welltrained experienced killer the assassin was good enough to need only one shot hes aware i dont have a chance he knows its only a matter of time until the watcher even more weak and lightheaded began to pray in agony with fervent desperation it was all he could do now he had to protect his soul his only consolation was that he couldnt be interrogated nonetheless he regretted that he wouldnt be able to prevent the assassin from searching him and taking the ring that he kept hidden in his suitcoat abruptly he felt the car stop he heard the assassin get out and heard another car stop beside the taurus so theyre going to leave me here wherever this is to die hope made his weakening pulse regain some strength maybe i can muster the energy to crawl from the taurus maybe i can find someone to help me to drive me to a hospital but his hope was cruelly destroyed for the next dim sound he heard wasnt the assassin getting into the other car instead he heard liquid being spattered into the taurus he felt it soak his clothes and retched from the sharp stench of gasoline no the last thing he heard was a match being struck and the whoosh as the gasoline ignited flames filled the taurus and swooped across his body no dear god in absolute torment he prayed more fervently our father who art in heaven amazingly his will was powerful enough that he got as far as deliver us from evil before the excruciating blaze consumed him five in the mansions vestibule as tess walked toward the huge wide staircase her mother said despite the evenings regrettable unpleasantness i really am glad that you came to visit i hope a good nights sleep will put you in a better mood thanks mother and its good to see you tess drooped her shoulders but somehow i doubt ill sleep much ive got too much to think about well perhaps if you had something to read that always puts me to sleep oh my tesss mother halted abruptly on the staircase whats the matter i completely forgot you asked me to phone the director at the library of congress he found that book you wanted and sent it here by messenger tesss mother retreated down the stairs its in the drawing room but he says you made a mistake about the title the circle or else the ring of the neck of the dove apparently thats a literal translation from spanish but in english the prepositions disappear and tesss mother hurried into the drawing room and came back removing a tattered book from a package the doves neck ring yes thats what its called the book smelled old tess quickly opened it her spirits rising when she saw that it was in english thank you she hugged her mother who blinked at so forceful a show of affection i appreciate it honestly thank you her mother looked confused ive never seen anyone get so excited about a book before when i paged through it waiting for you to arrive it certainly didnt appear very interesting on the contrary mother i expect to be fascinated heart pounding tess wanted to rush upstairs to her room so she could start reading but she forced herself to climb the steps slowly matching her mothers pace in a long upper corridor lined with paintings by french impressionists they paused outside tesss door good night mother tess kissed her cheek again her mother looked surprised i apologize for making a scene but you cant imagine what ive been through the past few days you have my word ill try my best not to upset you anymore dear with a choked voice her mother hesitated you dont have to apologize good heavens youre all i have ill never stop loving you make as many scenes as you want youll always be welcome here and i promise ill do everything i can to help solve your problems tess felt pressure in her tear ducts at once her mother did an amazing thing she kissed tess in return no casual brush of a cheek against cheek but an actual kiss her lips placed firmly yet tenderly on tesss brow remember what i used to tell you when i tucked you in bed when you were a child sleep tight dont let the bed bugs bite tess brushed a tear from her eye i remember i what dear i dont say this often enough i love you mother i know ive never doubted it stay in bed as long as you want phone the kitchen in the morning and tell edna what you want for breakfast then please phone me id like to join you tess sniffled wiping her cheeks i look forward to it i wish you wouldnt cry of course i remember emotion always made you uncomfortable its not so much feeling emotion but showing it her mother said very early a diplomats wife learns the difference well mother im afraid im not a diplomats wife im merely his daughter the daughter of remington drake not merely not at all between your father and me youre made from strength obey your heritage be strong i will mother i promise i repeat i love you and by the way there arent any monsters under your bed i guarantee it tess watched her mother proceed down the corridor a tired elderly woman whose footsteps faltered slightly but who nonetheless maintained her posture trying to walk with dignity only when her mother stepped into her bedroom did tess heart aching go into her own six the room had been tesss bedroom for as long as shed been alive turning on the overhead light shutting the door behind her she studied the canopied bed the covers of which a servant had folded down the servant presumably the butler had also unpacked her suitcase placing her shorts and tshirt on a lacerimmed pillow with bittersweet emotion tess scanned the room her complex layers of memory making her see it as if transparent photographs had been placed in front of one another all the different stages of her youth her childhood bed her doll house which her father had made her stuffed play animals then the larger bed and her baseball glove on the bureau her bat and ball beside it the posters of baseball and football stars that had given way to posters of rock stars and her stack of records beside her stereo the books shed studied in college shed refused to live in a dorm at georgetown university prefering to stay at home so she could be near her father all gone now all lost and gone with a shudder of regret she subdued her nostalgia peered down at the book in her hand and forced herself to pay attention to why shed come here the doves neck ring the title page indicated that the book by ibn hazm had been translated from spanish by a r nykl in leafing through the introduction as she walked toward the bed she learned that ibn hazm had been an arab whod emigrated from northern africa to southern spain in the early eleventh century and had written this book a treatise on platonic love in plato tess suddenly remembered the collected dialogues of plato that shed seen on the bookcase in josephs bedroom and she painfully remembered something else josephs insistence that his relationship with her could never be physical only platonic that way is better hed said because its eternal dejected she turned on the bedside lamp reached for the switch that extinguished the overhead light and slumped on the bed propping pillows behind her continuing to scan the book she could understand why her mother had found it boring the book was an elaborate essay not a narrative and its stilted english translation tried to recreate the feel of medieval spanish it was crammed with homilies and abstractions according to the introduction the doves neck ring had been extremely popular in its day often copied by hand the printing press had not yet been invented eventually the book had made its way upward through spain to southern france where in the midtwelfth century it had been one of the texts that formed the basis for an idealized view of the relationship between men and women known as courtly love the expression caught tesss attention she suddenly remembered another book that shed seen in josephs bedroom the art of courtly love but why had joseph been fascinated by that subject reading with greater curiosity tess learned that the notion of courtly love had appealed to and been sponsored by the then queen of france eleanor of aquitaine the title of another book in josephs bedroom and later by eleanors daughter marie de france both of whom had gathered poets and minstrels around them directing them to compose verses and songs that celebrated a ritualized highly polite and refined set of rules that dictated how men and women should behave toward one another tess scrunched her forehead in confusion she didnt know how these puzzling details fit together but joseph had obviously acted toward her in keeping with the strictest of the codes of courtly love while one branch of this ancient tradition treated courtly love as a type of foreplay a prelude to sex the other branch of the tradition had maintained that sex was an impure imperfect form of love according to the author of the doves neck ring true love wasnt based on physical attraction but rather on an attraction between kindred spirits compatible souls these souls had once existed in harmony during a prelife that reminded tess of heaven when born into the physical world the souls had been separated and thereafter felt incomplete compelled to keep looking for one another never to be satisfied until they met just as their original relationship had been pure in the sense of nonphysical nonsexual so their relationship in this world should be the same uncontaminated by the vulgarities of the flesh this idea of a heavenlike prelife evidently came from platos dialogues tess again remembered the book by plato in josephs bedroom and the notion of nonsexual highly spiritual affection between men and women was thus known as platonic love tess scrunched her forehead harder a deep corner of her subconsciousness straining to understand for certain shed felt an instant identification with joseph the moment hed entered the elevator when shed first met him last wednesday had it been only a week ago but her reaction to joseph had not been merely an identification much more an attraction powerful what romantics liked to describe as love at first sight but what the longdead author of the doves neck ring would have called love at second sight all theory speculation surely it didnt explain tesss overwhelming determination courtly love plato why in gods name had joseph been so obsessed with these ideas her chest ached on impulse she glanced at her watch surprised to discover that it was almost two am although shed told her mother that she was so disturbed she doubted shed be able to sleep she abruptly felt exhausted and decided to get out of her clothes change into her shorts and tshirt and try to sleep but as she stood and removed her cotton pullover she noticed the phone on the bedside table the mansions air conditioning made her breasts cold nipples rising still she hesitated staring at the phone i ought to call my loft and check if ive got any messages on my answering machine she told herself no it can wait till morning sure but so much has i ought to make sure that nothing else has happened so she tapped buttons on the phone listened to the static on the longdistance line heard a buzz then another buzz and finally her voice on the answering machine this is tess i cant answer the phone right now please leave a message at the tone immediately she tapped two more numbers her birthdate the security code that shed programmed into her answering machine and would prevent anyone else from calling her home pressing two numbers at random and gaining access to her messages a mans gravelly voice was instantly recognizable tess its lieutenant craig the time is garbled voices in the background quarterafterfive call me at the office as soon as you can a beep signalled the end of the message curious shivering because of it tess waited to hear if she had any other messages its lieutenant craig again halfpast six call me at once another beep the urgency in the lieutenants voice made tess even more anxious to hang up and phone him but she resisted the impulse still needing to know if she had other messages its lieutenant craig its almost eleven where the hell are you call me this time there were three beeps the signal that all the messages had been replayed tess broke the connection removed her wallet from her purse found the card that craig had given her and decided that even though his first message had told her to call him at the office he wouldnt be there now at two in the morning quickly tapping numbers she called his home again she heard longdistance static then a buzz another buzz and another by the fifth buzz she began to suspect that craig was at the office by the sixth she became certain and lowered her hand toward the disconnect lever so she could try his office when her hand was an inch from the lever a crusty voice said hello and coughed she pressed the phone hard against her ear its tess im sorry if i woke you but your messages where have you been my god you had me worried im in alexandria virginia in the background tess heard soaring music an orchestra a chorus a soprano hitting impossibly high notes alexandria what are you doing there the sopranos voice swooped then rose again my mother lives here i caught the six oclock shuttle but you havent answered my question what are you trying to explain what we saw in josephs apartment my mother has contacts with the library of congress and tess hesitated not wanting to tell the lieutenant about her mothers powerful connections with the government because of her father is that opera i hear in the background puccinis madame butterfly just a second ill turn it off a moment later the music stopped i didnt know you liked opera tess said somehow you dont seem the type to listen to me craig said dont ever leave town like that again not without telling me you have to let me know where i can reach you when i kept calling and you didnt answer your phone i got worried that something had happened to you well in a way something almost did what those pictures i took at josephs apartment i left them at a onehour photo shop while i packed when i went back to the shop the clerk told me that a man who claimed id sent him tried to get the photographs jesus the only way the man could have known about those pictures is if hed followed us when we left josephs apartment and he saw me go into the photo shop tess said with urgency that sure as hell sounds logical to me jesus the lieutenant said again and coughed thats what i mean you cant stay out of touch youve got to let me know where you are and what youre doing this might be dangerous for you theres more i dont understand it but when the clerk described the man it sounded like joseph the man even had gray eyes could i have been wrong at the morgue could joseph be alive could no tess you werent wrong that much i can guarantee whoever the man was he very definitely wasnt joseph but how can you be sure how do you explain the gray eyes coincidence maybe craig said i dont know but you yourself said that the scar on the corpses wrist wasnt enough for an absolute identification maybe that scars a coincidence too since the fbi hasnt been able to match the corpses fingerprints with anyone in their files maybe no tess we do have a match thats one of the things i tried to call you about from the fbi tess asked quickly they know josephs real identity not from the fbi from our own lab they dusted josephs apartment and matched the prints they found there with those from the unburned left hand on the corpse in the morgue tess the fingerprints match point by point they match and they also match fingerprints on josephs desk at truth video your identifications been verified joseph died in carl schurz park tesss knees abruptly weakened she sank toward the bed and shivered so much that she wrapped a sheet around her since the incident in the photo shop her fear that someone might be following her had been tempered by the hope that whoever it was would be joseph that joseph might somehow still be alive but now she suffered a renewed aching surge of grief her stomach sinking her chest hollow her mind offbalance tess she tried to answer tess craig emphasized her name sounding worried im here im yes im all right for a moment i thought look im sorry i guess i could have been more delicate i felt never mind ill be okay tess said youre sure all that matters now is getting even finding out who killed joseph and why tess shook her head bitter you said the matching fingerprints were one of the reasons you tried to call what else its about the photographs craig paused and tess frowned youre going to make me ask what about them its a good thing you took them and a damned good thing the clerk didnt give them to the guy who claimed youd sent him whats wrong someone broke into josephs apartment they torched his bedroom tess jerked upright the sheet falling off her shoulders torched it almost burned the whole top floor before the fire department put it out its a miracle no one was hurt christ when did this happen four oclock about the same time the guy was trying to steal my pictures which are the only record of what we found in josephs apartment craig said but i thought you said homicide got there before we did and took photographs i was wrong craig said what they sent was a fingerprint team when they saw the bedroom they decided they wanted pictures the photographer was scheduled to show up in the afternoon but he didnt not in time after all the apartment wasnt a crime scene there didnt seem any urgency oh shit just make sure those photographs are safe hide them have copies made from the negatives craig said first thing tomorrow morning several copies keep another set are you coming back to manhattan tomorrow i dont know yet tess said i still have things to check then send the other copies to me federal express craig gave his office address at one police plaza theres one other problem im not sure i want to hear it after the fire department put out the blaze when they thought it was safe they let me search the torched apartment that building has concrete floors there wasnt any risk of my falling through or of anything else having fallen through i dont know what youre getting at tess said nervously i had to use a pole to move sections of the toppled ceiling and walls but i knew where to look so it didnt take me long to clear the spot i wanted what spot what are you where the bookcase was craig said where the statue stood on the bookcase the books were destroyed as youd expect so was the bookcase just ashes but the statue was made of marble and marble doesnt burn it might crack from heat but i kept looking the statue couldnt have fallen through the concrete floor and when it toppled from the bookcase it couldnt have rolled very far its gone tess the statues gone whoever torched the apartment must have taken it when they left i dont know what the hells happening but i want you to promise me swear it be careful seven east of maine the north atlantic the united states coast guard cutter seawolf out of portland continued its speedy mission through a moderately choppy sea clouds obscured the moon and stars intensifying the night although even in daylight the sea wolfs destination was still too far away to have allowed for a visual identification on the cutters bridge captain peter omalley could see his objective as a blip on the radar however and its implications made him frown distance fourteen thousand yards a crewman said looks like air reconnaissance was right captain its course is erratic minimal speed omalley nodded six hours earlier a group of air force f fighter pilots practising night maneuvers in a military corridor off the new england coast had noticed the blip on their radar screens its unusual behavior had prompted the flight groups leader to radio his commander at loring air force base near limestone maine and request permission to contact the vessel permission was granted but all attempts to communicate with the vessel had failed identify yourself no response do you need assistance no response after repeated efforts the groups leader had requested further permission to change course and descend for a visual inspection again permission was granted after all the vessels radio silence combined with its puzzling slow random course and its proximity to united states waters justified concern at a cautious distance using intensemagnification nightvision apparatus the flight groups leader determined that the vessel was a massive fishing trawler english lettering on the stern indicated that the trawlers name was the bronze bell its home port pusan south korea the english lettering wasnt unusual many oriental commercial ships used english identification symbols when operating in western waters what was unusual indeed disturbing however was that in addition to its erratic sluggish approach toward us waters the trawler displayed no lights not even the mandatory signal lights that maritime law required during night voyages to prevent converging vessels from failing to see each other and colliding the troubled commander at loring air force base insisted on confirmation the equally troubled flight group leader repeated that the trawler was totally i mean absolutelydark the situation became delicate the potential for an international incident disturbing a misjudgment could destroy careers if the approaching foreign vessel had been military in nature the united states military would have gone on alert but since the vessel was civilian it required a less severe response the air force immediately contacted the coast guard and since omalleys cutter was the nearest government vessel in the area the sea wolf was at once dispatched to investigate now five hours after having received his orders omalley a redhaired twentyyear veteran with a home in portland and a wife and daughter whom he loved very much continued to frown at the blip on the radar screen thats it captain a crewman said she just crossed the twohundred mile boundary shes in our waters and drifting omalley sounded as if his best friend had died thats what it looks like captain and still no response to our radio messages affirmative captain omalley sighed battle stations the crewman pressed the alarm aye aye captain through the cutters hull the alarm sounded muffled but effectively shrill below it would be excruciating the rest of the crew snapping into action you think therell be trouble thats the problem isnt it omalley said excuse me captain what should i think trouble for sure obviously somethings wrong the question is whose trouble ours or that trawlers i guarantee this my dear departed mother god rest her soul didnt raise her son to be a dummy i second that opinion captain thank you lieutenant omalley allowed himself to grin despite his nervous preoccupation and i promise you ill do everything in my power to insure that every mothers son in my command lives to see his family again we already know that captain i appreciate your confidence but it wont get you a better rating on your duty report the lieutenant chuckled i want a boarding party omalley said yes captain armed yes captain get the zodiac ready aye aye captain omalley continued to frown toward the radar thirty minutes later the sea wolfs nightvision screen revealed the enormous south korean trawler wallowing in waves a thousand yards ahead its bulky outline made eerily green by the monitor the lieutenant straightened cocking his head the air force wasnt exaggerating sir ive never seen a darker ship i want every gun manned omalley said aye aye captain still no response to our radio messages afraid not sir pull portside and hail them on the bullhorn omalley nervously waited as a communications officer crouched protectively beside a housing on the deck and blurted questions through the bullhorn ahoy bronze bell ahoy please respond you have entered united states waters please respond ahoy do you need assistance fuck it omalley said get a team in the zodiac make sure theyre fully armed berettas msixteens and for gods sake make sure theyre fully protected from our deck when they cross to the trawler the fiftycaliber machineguns the fortymillimeter cannons the works aye aye captain the zodiac a rubber outboardmotorpowered raft sped toward the bronze bell its sevenmember team holding ms at the ready in the dark as they reached the trawler and threw grappling hooks connected to rope ladders over the trawlers side omalley said a quiet prayer for their safety and mentally made the sign of the cross the team shouldered their rifles unholstered their pistols jacked a round into each firing chamber and clambered briskly up the rope ladders disappearing over the side omalley held his breath regretting that his duty required him to remain aboard while these other men good men brave men potentially risked their lives something was very wrong captain the twoway radio beside omalley crackled picking it up omalley answered reception is clear report sir the deck is deserted understood remain on battle alert establish sentries omalley said with caution check the lower decks affirmative captain omalley waited the longest five minutes in his life captain theres still no sign of anyone keep checking affirmative captain omalley waited another tense five minutes flashlights wavered on the trawlers deck lights came on the twoway radio crackled captain we cant find anyone the trawler appears to be completely deserted omalley knew the answer to his next question the team would surely have reported the information but he had to ask it anyhow did you find any corpses no one alive or dead captain unless theyre hiding somewhere the vessels been abandoned its kind of spooky in a way sir what do you mean well captain the televisions on in the crews recreation area theres a radio playing in their quarters theres food on plates in the galley whatever it is happened it must have been fast omalley frowned what about damage to the trawler any evidence of a fire any reason they might have abandoned ship no sir no damage at all and anyway the lifeboats are still aboard then what the hell happened where in gods name did they go how omalley nervously wondered but didnt allow his apprehension to affect the sound of his voice understood he said with authoritative calmness the trawlers engines shut down but we got them started again no problem captain fuel the tanks are half full what about the shortwave radio we found it turned off but its in working order sir if they wanted to if there was trouble they could have sent a mayday alert no ones reported hearing any keep checking aye aye captain omalley set down the walkietalkie pensive he stared through the darkness toward the lights on the massive trawler on occasion hed heard stories about vessels found abandoned at sea the explanations were usually obvious a rustbucket that an owner had scuttled in order to collect insurance but that had failed to sink as the owner intended or a yacht that pirates had looted after killing the passengers raping them as well if there were females and throwing the corpses overboard or a fishing boat that drug smugglers had abandoned because they feared that the drug enforcement agency suspected their cargo and was about to try to capture them in previous centuries omalley was aware a crew would sometimes though rarely mutiny execute their captain toss him to the sharks and use lifeboats to escape to a nearby coastline again from previous centuries he knew about ships upon which a plague had broken out onebyone the corpses of victims hurled overboard until the last man alive suffering from the hideous disease had managed to complete a diary about the ordeal and then jumped into the ocean preferring a quick relatively painless death by drowning instead of a prolonged agonizing one then too omalley had heard legends about crewless ghost ships the flying dutchman for example although in that case the captain was reputed to be still aboard doomed to drift for all eternity because of a gamble that hed lost with the devil the most famous abandoned ship was the marie celeste a brigantine transporting commercial alcohol from new york to italy found crewless between the azores and portugal in but omalley had never understood why that ship acquired its mysterious reputation after all its sails had been damaged its cabins soaked with water its lifeboats missing obviously a severe storm had frightened the crew into thinking that the marie celeste was about to sink theyd foolishly used the lifeboats to try to escape and been swallowed by the stormchurned sea all easily explainable but despite omalleys familiarity with these accounts hed never in all his lengthy varied experience in the coast guard actually ever come across an abandoned vessel certainly hed seen barges torn apart on reefs because of a storm but they didnt fit in this category a ship in calm open water drifting without a crew for no apparent reason omalley shook his head he wasnt superstitious or fanciful although he felt a chill he didnt believe in lost gambles with the devil or visitors from outer space abducting humans or time warps or the bermuda triangle or any other of the ridiculous theories that the supermarket tabloids promoted something was terribly wrong here yes but its explanation would be logical and by god he intended to find out what that explanation was he turned to a crewman contact headquarters in portland tell them what weve got here ask them to send another cutter also ask for assistance from the local police maybe the dea and the fbi who knows how many other agencies will be involved by the time we sort this out also im sure headquarters will think of this theyd better notify the bronze bell s owner right away captain omalley brooded again toward the massive trawler there were so many details to anticipate he couldnt leave the bronze bell with his men on board her but as soon as the other coast guard cutter arrived either it or the sea wolf would begin a search for sailors in the water at dawn air reconnaissance would join in the search meanwhile the bronze bell would be escorted to portland where various investigators would be waiting the twoway radio crackled still nothing captain i mean weve looked everywhere including the cargo hold ill tell you this they sure had good luck fishing the holds almost full a thought abruptly occurred to omalley almost full what were they using to fish this big a catch they had to use nets sir yes but what kind of nets omalley asked oh shit sir i think i see what you mean just a minute omalley waited the minute stretched on and on damn it you were right sir the bastards were using drift nets furious omalley pressed his hands on a console with such force that his knuckles whitened drift nets sure the bronze bell was owned by south koreans they the taiwanese and the japanese were notorious for sending trawlers into the north atlantic s international waters casting out drift nets made of nylon mesh that spread for dozens of miles behind each trawler it had recently been estimated that as many as thirty thousand miles of these nets were in use in the north atlantic scooping up every living thing in effect stripmining the ocean the nets were intended to be an efficient means of trapping enormous unconscionable amounts of tuna and squid the effect was to depopulate these species worse the nets also caught dolphins porpoises turtles and whales creatures that needed to surface periodically in order to breathe but that couldnt when caught in the nets eventually cruelly they drowned their carcasses discarded as commercially useless when the nets were reeled in thus those species too were depopulated the bastards omalley thought the murderous bastards he strained to keep rage from his voice as he spoke to the walkietalkie is the net still in the water yes sir then turn on the winches haul the damned thing in well be taking the bronze bell to portland the weight of the drift net will hold her back ill give the order sir omalley seethed glowering at the trawler shit shit those fucking drift nets those irresponsible a voice blurted from the walkietalkie oh my god captain jesus oh my the man on the other end sounded as if he might vomit whats the matter whats wrong the drift net were hauling it in you cant believe how much fish it christ and the dolphins the porpoises ive never seen so many dead theyre all dead tangled in the net a fucking nightmare the crew what say again the crew twenty thirty were still counting oh god in heaven jesus mary and joseph weve found the crew they were tied to the net they drowned the same way the dolphins and the next sound from the walkietalkie was unmistakable anguished guttural gagging the coast guard officer throwing up eight brooklyn the sign on the stake outside st thomas more grade school said closed no trespassing property of f and s realty stapled to the sign was a piece of paper which in legallooking fine print explained that this area had been rezoned for multiplefamily dwellings another sign this one on the schools front door said scheduled for demolition future site of grand view condominiums the school a threestory drab brick structure had been built in its wiring plumbing and heating systems were so in need of expensive repairs that the local diocese at the limit of its financial resources had been forced to sell it and arrange for catholic students in the neighborhood to attend the newer but already crowded st andrews school two miles away parents who in their youth had gone to st thomas more and had sent their children there mourned its passing but as the bishop had indicated in his letter read by the local pastor to his parishioners during sunday mass the church faced a looming monetary crisis regrettable sacrifices had to be made not only here but in almost every diocese across the nation prayers and donations were required at eight the smog was already thick the air sultry as three cars turned into the teachers abandoned parking lot beside the school the cars were dark fourdoor american sedans each with f and s realty stencilled in yellow on their sides two men got out of each car greeting the others with a nod in their late thirties to early forties they wore subdued lightweight polyester suits five held clipboards the sixth an oversized metal briefcase they considered the once vital school and the plywood that now covered its windows a pity one man said well another man said nothing lasts forever nothing at least on earth true the third man said and you know what the bottom line is the fourth man said the fifth man nodded the collection plate did you bring the key the sixth man asked the first man patted his suitcoat pocket they approached the schools front door waited while the first man unlocked it and stepped through its creaky entrance letting their eyes adjust to the shadows smelling dust and mold the first man shut the door and locked it the shadows thickening his voice echoed emphasizing the buildings desolation i suppose any room will do its better on the second floor the man with the briefcase said less chance of our being overheard in case someone stands outside near a window i noticed gaps in some of the plywood agreed the second man said all the same wed better check this floor youre right the first man said of course now the echo came from their footsteps as they crossed the hallway while four of the men inspected each classroom the boys and girls rest rooms a storage room and the various closets the fifth man made sure that the back door was locked and the sixth man checked the basement only then did they proceed up the creaky stairs throughout the first man had the eerie sense that they were intruding that the spiritual residue of more than eighty years of eager laughing children had been absorbed by the building that there were for lack of a better word ghosts here and that all they wanted was to be left alone to play here one last time their final summer sentimental he admitted but in a profession that so often required him to be cynical he decided that for a few harmless seconds at least he could indulge himself the man was of medium height and weight with brown hair hazel eyes that tended to assume the color of the clothes he wore and unremarkable features so average that no one ever remembered him over many years hed trained himself to be a chameleon and yesterday afternoon hed followed tess to laguardia airport when he reached the second floor he squinted higher toward the continuing stairs then right and left noticing opendoored classrooms and two drinking fountains that seemed unnaturally low until he recalled that they werent designed for adults shrugging deferring to the man with the oversized briefcase he said which room do you like the one on the left above the parking lot as you wish but not until the man with the briefcase pointed upward toward the final floor do you really think its necessary the dust on the stairs hasnt been disturbed i was trained to be thorough your expertise is surveillance but mine is the first man nodded and you do it superbly i accept the compliment the mans eyes glinted ill check the upper floor while the others inspect the rooms on this floor in the meantime since were under pressure can you yes ill set up my equipment five minutes later after having inspected the musty upper floor where he found no one the first man descended to the middle floor and the room on the left above the parking lot he and his associates had been very careful in selecting this meeting place it was highly unlikely that their enemy had managed to trace them here mostly he suspected the man with the briefcase was concerned that despite the abandoned schools locked doors and barricaded windows a drug addict or else one of the citys innumerable homeless might have discovered a way to gain access and find sanctuary here even a drug addict might make sense of their conversation and become an informant at the same time the chameleon reminded himself that the enemy over many years had demonstrated remarkable cleverness extreme survival characteristics ruthless determination including the ability to counterattack no matter how carefully this abandoned school had been chosen the fact was that the rendezvous site had been used four times already a pattern had been established and whenever a pattern occurred that pattern could be discovered the man with the briefcase was right there was no harm in being cautious the chameleon noticed two things when he entered the classroom first the sixth man the electronicsecurity specialist had opened his oversized briefcase plugged a monitor into a battery and was using a metal wand to scan the blackboard the ceiling the walls the floor and the furniture second the other men normally so serious and dignified were seated in cramped positions in miniature tabletopped chairs designed for tenyearolds the absurd situation reminded the chameleon of scenes from gullivers travels and alice in wonderland its clean the sixth man said replacing his equipment in the briefcase shutting it and locking it then well begin although the chameleon had been deferential until now he assumed the place of authority sitting at the teachers desk as one each member of the group reached into his suitcoat pocket removed a ring and placed it on the middle finger of his left hand each ring was identical handsome distinctive a twentyfour karat band on top of which a large gleaming ruby was embossed with the golden insignia of an intersecting cross and sword may the lord be with you the chameleon said and with your spirit the five men replied deo gratias all six of them said together completing the ritual the chameleon scanned his fellow hunters to begin i must make a confession the group narrowed their eyes straightening as best they could in the confinement of their diminutive chairs you the chameleon nodded toward the sixth man the electronicsecurity specialist who unlike the others was somewhat overweight earlier we exchanged compliments about our respective skills but im forced to admit that ive made a mistake in terms of my skills or at least my team has made a mistake and i always take responsibility for the men ive trained what sort of mistake the second man tilted his glasses frowning over them one of the enemy tried to intercept photographs that the woman took in our targets apartment the fourth man hunched his broad shoulders perhaps the attempt was an unrelated matter weve been distracted by false alarms before how can you be positive that this person is one of the enemy he has gray eyes the chameleon said ah the third man pursed his thin lips in that case indeed the fifth mans gaunt cheeks throbbed i entered the photo shop and pretended to be a customer i stood as close to him as i am now to you the chameleon said i couldnt fail to recognize the characteristics he might as well have been the targets brother perhaps he was the broadshouldered fourth man said i still dont understand what was your mistake my responsibility was to follow the woman my teams responsibility was to pursue and capture the man the chameleon shook his head in distress they failed what the sixth man the electronicsecurity specialist glared they saw him leave the shop and he was brilliant from reports i was given he seemed to sense immediately that he was being stalked he ran my team gave chase he darted down alleys he rushed across streets veering through traffic still he was chased he entered a restaurant and the chameleon raised his hands he vanished how if my team had been able to determine that they certainly would have continued to chase him i repeat i accept responsibility for their failure but that does no good the sixth man continued accept as much blame as you want the ultimate fact is the enemy was within your teams grasp but they didnt succeed yes the chameleon lowered his head thats the ultimate fact he must have had an escape route planned the third man pursed his lips again no doubt the solidly built fourth man said theyre like ferrets they can dodge and squirm and find holes where youd never expect how else could they have eluded us for so long thats not the point the overweight sixth man objected their survival skills are well known but were supposed to be better and we are the second man adjusted his glasses because virtue is on our side but sometimes it appears that providence tests our determination i dont accept rationalizations if what youre telling me is that the lord helps those who help themselves then were obviously not trying hard enough the sixth man glowered toward the chameleon or in this case you and your team arent trying hard enough certainly ive done my part i installed a tap on the womans phone and on the policemans phone within an hour of your instructions i also arranged for our people in washington to be able to monitor calls made from car phones every important government executive has one these days although i dont understand why they use them given the security risk what more do you want me to say i cant change the past however i can resolve to do better in the future but this isnt the first time youve made mistakes the sixth man added when you managed to find our target you should have arranged immediately for his abduction and interrogation i disagree the chameleon gestured since the target didnt realize hed been discovered i thought it prudent to continue watching him in case he might lead us to other targets or but why would he have done such a foolish thing the man was a fugitive from his group they wanted him as much as we did exactly the chameleon said we waited in case his group caught up to him as a consequence wed have had other vermin to capture question and eliminate regardless the tactic failed the sixth man complained his group did discover where he was and instead of being captured they succeeded in eliminating him it was raining that night the weather interfered with the sixth man scoffed the weather how did the targets fellow vermin catch up to him the chameleon scowled probably using the same method we did the target was skilled in hiding he constructed a new identity for himself he never stayed longer than six months in any city he arranged for elaborate smoke screens to conceal where he lived in theory he was undetectable but human nature is imperfect there were certain things about the man that he couldnt or wouldnt change specifically his fascination with video documentaries thats how we found him the first time in los angeles by checking the video companies of course hed moved on before we found his employer but then we picked up his trail once more the same way in chicago yet again hed moved on but finally after using all the resources at our disposal we located him at truth video in manhattan and if we could find him that way i take for granted that the vermin he was running from could still that raises another question the muscular fourth man said after they executed the target appropriately by fire the same method we would have used why did they also set fire to his apartment and why did they wait several days before they did it my surveillance team tells me that the targets hunters never entered his apartment the night they killed him the chameleon said from friday evening onward he acted with greater caution as if he suspected hed been located he broke an appointment with the woman tess drake on saturday morning he remained in his apartment all that day saturday night he apparently decided to flee under cover of the storm my team had concluded that his behavior was too erratic they planned to grab him while they could in the middle of the night as he slept but that plan was interrupted when other targets arrived with the same intention as our group events occurred quickly the hunters discovered their quarry when he rushed down the stairs as we know the man was in superb physical condition well arent they all the second man asked rhetorically but he was also skilled in handtohand combat the chameleon said he fought with his hunters eluded them raced from the building but during the fight hed injured his leg and yes yes the electronics expert said impatiently they trapped him and burned him alive before your team could formulate a new plan and if not capture and interrogate at least exterminate them all another nest would have been wiped out you werent there dont make judgments the chameleon said my team was composed of three men sufficient for their original mission but the target and his hunters amounted to six the only equalizer would have been pistols but in so heavily guarded an area as the mayors house near carl schurz park if thered been shooting the police would immediately have been put on alert and blockaded the district my team could not take the risk of being captured and questioned by the authorities what risk the sixth man growled your men knew the rule if they were captured before they could be interrogated they had an obligation to kill themselves he tapped his ruby ring and the poison capsule hidden beneath the stone on his and every other ring i wonder the chameleon said in my teams place would you have been eager to take a chance that you knew would fail with the certainty that youd have to kill yourself you bet your soul i would no not my soul yours the chameleon said i doubt youd have risked being captured youre a technician not a combat operative and your pride makes you want to live too much maybe you dont hate the vermin as much as i do the sixth man said i doubt that as well youre evading the issue the fire in the apartment what about it my assumption is that the other targets had made such a commotion in the apartment building that they didnt dare go back right away for fear of being found by the police also it may be that the targets concluded that the man who called himself joseph martin had been so scrupulous about hiding his true nature that he wouldnt leave anything incriminating in his apartment thats all speculation but this is not we know that they decided to watch the woman hed befriended in case she behaved in a way that suggested she knew his secret we of course watched the woman because she was the only connection we had with the target she went to the morgue and managed to identify his body the next day the detective from missing persons took her to the targets apartment immediately afterward she left a roll of film at a onehour developing service it doesnt take a genius to conclude that she must have found something of such interest in the targets apartment that she took photographs there and wanted them developed at once when one of the targets executioners failed to get the photos he and the others decided that the apartment now had sufficient priority for them to risk going back whatever they found they needed to destroy it and fire of course not only purifies it conceals theft but what did they find the third man asked my guess the chameleon hesitated an altar the fourth man gasped probably one of their statues that above all they would have to retrieve regardless if someone had seen it and taken photographs of it the revelation wouldnt matter as much as the object itself the statue would be too sacred to them for it to be allowed to fall into unclean hands the group squinted in disgust god damn them the second man said he has the sixth man said but now after having come so close weve lost them not necessarily the chameleon said oh the fifth man raised his head youve got a new lead the fourth man asked they appear to have become fixated on the woman the chameleon said recent events suggest that they believe she knows too much especially given the photographs she took and then of course her sudden trip to alexandria virginia as we know from our background check her father was powerful in the government and had many even more powerful associates with whom her mother remains in contact it would appear that the woman tess drake is determined to find out why her friend died it would also appear that our targets are equally determined to stop her and conceal all evidence of their existence wait a moment ago you said recent events the sixth man straightened what recent events well the chameleon said yes he hesitated theyre the reason i requested this meeting his eyes and voice became somber last night he described what had happened to his counterpart they burned him the sixth man turned pale yes the chameleon tasted bile as he stood from the dusty teachers desk our watcher had two men working with him both were on foot one hiding behind the mansion in case the woman went out the back the other farther along the street among bushes the latter man saw a silver corniche leave the mansion when the car drove by he managed to get its license number eventually using his contacts to find out who owned the car thats how we know that brian hamilton was at the mansion the latter man also saw the assassin rush toward the watchers car and shoot him the next thing the assassin drove the taurus away the watchers backup man hotwired a cadillac on the street and pursued he found the taurus burning in a shopping malls otherwise empty parking lot when he realized that there wasnt any way he could help he left the scene before the police arrived but if our man was already shot why did they the second mans voice cracked set fire to him the chameleon grimaced no doubt to make an example to demoralize us in that case they failed the third man said with fury theyll pay ill put them in hell we all will the sixth man said and make them pay for other things as well the chameleon said his mouth tasting sour you mean theres more the fourth man jerked upright inadvertently banging his knees against the top of the small desk unfortunately last night at the same time our operative was shot while he watched the mansion nine brian hamilton set down the cellular telephone in the shadowy back seat of his silver corniche frowned and leaned forward toward his bodyguarddriver steve you heard the husky former marine an expert in reconnaissance nodded firmly that was eric chatham you want me to drive to his home exactly get me to west falls church as soon as possible im already headed toward the freeway with that taken care of brian hamilton slumped back and brooded the story that tess had told him and the photographs shed shown him troubled him greatly whoever the man called joseph martin had really been there was something hed been hiding or running from hamilton was sure of that yes whatever that something might be it was as terrible as the bloodstained whip in joseph martins closet and the grotesque sculpture that tess had photographed back at the mansion hamilton had described that photograph as weird but the adjective understated his severe revulsion the basrelief statue filled him with disgust he bit his lip with a deepening apprehension that tess had become involved in something so twisted and dangerous that it might get her killed hadnt she said that she feared she was being followed hamiltons jaw muscles hardened whatever was going on he intended to use all his power all his influence every iou at his disposal to find out what threatened tess and to make sure it was stopped after all he owed her for several reasons not the least of which was that hed been her fathers friend but had followed orders from his superiors and reluctantly sent remington drake to beirut to negotiate a secret arms deal with the christians against the moslems as a consequence hed been responsible for her fathers abduction by the moslems drakes torture and eventual brutal death it wasnt any wonder that tess hated him by all means she had good reason but if helping her and possibly saving her life would erase that hate brian hamilton had all the motivation he needed especially since her mother and he had come to an arrangement after all he couldnt very well have a stepdaughter who loathed him continuing to brood he noticed that his bodyguard had reached the freeway and was speeding toward falls church virginia ten miles away in a very few minutes brian hamilton would be able to describe his problem to the director of the fbi and demand that eric chatham use the full resources of the bureau to find out who joseph martin had been and who had killed him as much as hamilton owed tess eric chatham owed him and now by god it was payback time sir we might have a problem the bodyguarddriver said what problem hamilton straightened its possible were being followed his stomach suddenly cramping hamilton pivoted to stare through the cars back window the minivan behind us yes sir at first i thought it was just a coincidence but its been tailing us since before we left alexandria lose it thats what im trying to do sir the corniche sped up but so did the minivan persistent the driver said i told you to lose it where sir were on a freeway if you dont mind me pointing out the obvious im doing ninety and i dont see an exit ramp wait a minute its changing lanes it looks like it wants to pass us hamilton said yes sir it could be possibly maybe im wrong the minivan having veered into the passing lane increased speed and came abreast of the corniche but as hamilton watched he felt his heart lurch on the minivans passenger side someone was rolling down a window look out hamiltons driver blurted too late from the open window someone threw a bottle the bottle had a rag stuffed into its mouth the rag was on fire jesus the bodyguard swerved toward the freeways gravel shoulder frantically reducing speed but the bottle which must have been constructed from specially designed brittle glass shattered on impact against the corniches windshield and spewed blazing gasoline over the car blinded by flames on the hood and oh christ on the windshield the driver tried desperately to control his steering in the backseat hamilton gaped to the left horrified to see the van streak sharply toward the corniche he felt the van slam brutally against the corniches side slam it again and again and propel the corniche off the freeways shoulder hamiltons stomach dropped the corniche now completely engulfed with flames crashed through a guardrail soared through the air and collided with hamilton screamed he never knew what the car hit the sudden shocking force of the crash slammed him forward catapulting him up over and beyond the front seat walloping his skull against the dashboard but what the passengers in the minivan saw with calculated satisfaction was that the corniche had impacted against a massive steel electrical tower the collision burst the corniches fuel tank a huge exploding fireball disintegrated the car and spewed pieces of flesh bone and metal for fifty yards in every direction the flames gushing upward for a hundred feet as the minivan sped onward disappearing among traffic its rear window reflected the spectacular pyre in the darkness beside the freeway ten the chameleon removed the folded front section of the new york times from beneath a notepad on his clipboard he held it up so the group could see the headline former secretary of state dies in fiery freeway disaster then handed the newspaper to the second man when youre finished pass it around ive already read it i didnt know the connection but the moment you mentioned brian hamilton i realized what you were getting at well the third man said i didnt have a chance to read the paper this morning let me see onebyone the somberfaced men read the article fire the sixth man said with disgust theyre so in love with fire lips curled he set down the paper and studied the chameleon you seem to have so many answers what about this one why did they kill him i dont have answers exactly what i do have are calculated assumptions the chameleon said tess drake makes a sudden trip to see her mother when she gets to the mansion in alexandria is it a coincidence that the former secretary of state and current main adviser to the president just happens to be waiting there when she arrives not likely i have to conclude that so important a man was summoned by the woman that hamilton a friend of her dead father was the person she primarily wanted to see and not her mother that tess drake was using her late fathers influence to enlist powerful help in discovering who joseph martin was and why he was killed the third man shrugged assumptions as you admit however i grant that theyre logical and i also have to conclude that the enemy followed tess drake to the mansion just as our own people did the chameleon continued when the enemy identified hamiltons corniche in the driveway and realized what the woman was doing they must have decided that hamiltons death was essential to keeping their secret its my belief that they wanted to prevent him from telling others what hed learned and using his connections with the government to enlarge the scope of the investigation the fifth man traced his finger along pencil engravings on the desktop of his miniature chair possibly you dont sound convinced well your assumptions make sense to a point but what i have trouble with is if the enemy went to the trouble and took the risk of assassinating hamilton they still wouldnt have solved their problem at least not completely their secret would not yet be fully protected to accomplish that theyd have to be totally absolutely thorough and the most important person to eliminate would be the chameleon nodded precisely youre telling me yes dear god the sixth man said my thought as well dear god last night shortly after two eleven standing rigidly in her bedroom in the mansion in alexandria tess cramped her fingers around the telephone as she listened to craigs gravelly urgent voice i want you to promise me craig said swear it be careful i guarantee tess emphasized i wont take any chances keep your word and promise me this as well swear youll phone me tomorrow as soon as you get copies made of the photographs then fedex them to me as fast as possible i will i promise tess said look i dont want to sound like a jealous lover but ill feel a whole lot better when you get back here honestly tess said ill be okay just because someone torched josephs apartment its a big leap to thinking im in danger oh yeah craig raised his voice then what about the guy in the photo shop tess didnt answer she reluctantly admitted to herself that shed been feeling more and more uneasy okay whats your mothers address and phone number craig asked and coughed i think its a good idea i want to be able to reach you if anything else happens that you should know about tess gave him that information good craig said i repeat i wish youd get back here look even if i were in manhattan what could you do assuming youre right and im in danger you cant stay with me all the time you never know it might come to that hey dont exaggerate tess quivered youre scaring me good at last im finally getting my point across the lieutenants voice dropped the longdistance static crackling and anyway he sounded nervous would it really be so bad if i was with you all the time what tess frowned im not sure what you mean i told you yesterday on the way to josephs apartment this started out as police business now it belongs to homicide not missing persons but i still want to stay involved because of you tess frowned harder no response craig asked im trying to sort this out are you saying what i think youre saying as far as im concerned this isnt business anymore i want to get to know you but whatever it is say it tess youre ten years older than me so what youve got a prejudice you dont like mature men dependable men guys like me whove been there and back and around some and dont have any illusions or expectations and dont make problems its not exactly that i mean tess squirmed its just well i never thought about well do me a favor and give it some thought i dont want to be pushy i know a lots been happening not the least of which is youve lost your friend and im sorry for that and i repeat i dont want to make problems for you im patient but hey i bathe every day tess couldnt help it she laughed good craig said i like that i like to hear you laugh so think about it would you or at any rate keep it in the back of your mind no big deal no pressure but maybe damn it im so maybe when this is over we can talk about it sure tess swallowed if when i promise when this is over well talk about it thats all im asking you dont sound enthusiastic but thats okay i appreciate your patience this next part however is business i dont care how busy you are just make sure you call me tomorrow when you send me the copies of those photographs word of honor tess said good night good night craig responded and by the way i dont gamble i seldom drink and im kind to animals children the poor the infirm not to mention the aged think about it the lieutenant broke the connection tess listened to the emptiness of the longdistance static breathed out in confusion trembled and set the phone on its receptacle for several moments she didnt move oh christ she hadnt counted on this shed been vaguely aware of the lieutenants attraction to her but shed ignored it thered been too many other things to concern her but now that the subject was in the open tess didnt know how to respond craig was pleasant enough and indeed he was good looking in a rugged sort of way for sure hed taken pains to be kind and helpful and shed definitely appreciated his company in trying circumstances but did she feel attracted to him physically sexually certainly it didnt match the powerful overwhelming identification shed experienced with joseph the first time shed met him tess recalled the theory in the doves neck ring that love at first sight was actually love at second sight because the souls of the lovers had known each other in a previous existence and now recognized each other in this reborn earthly form damn it tess thought what am i going to do i dont want to embarrass or insult the lieutenant but after all craig is older than me at the same time tess paced i do feel something for him and maybe being comfortable with a man is better than suffering a sickening blaze of passion she remembered that the doves neck ring had referred to physical as opposed to spiritual passion as an infirmity a type of illness what am i going to do tess felt guilty shed been distant and perhaps even rude to craig when hed raised the subject of his attraction to her at the end of their conversation her guiltiness troubled her i cant let the subject hang in the air she thought too many other things to worry about i have to get this settled she picked up the phone to call the lieutenant to explain to him what shed just been thinking to be totally honest and with kindness confess her uncertainty but when she held the phone to her ear she frowned there wasnt a dial tone impatient she jabbed down the disconnect button raised it and listened again still no dial tone more impatient she tapped the disconnect button several times nothing the line was dead but the line had been working a minute ago why would tess trembled a chill surging through her earlier shed felt a chill as well caused by the mansions airconditioning system now the whisper of air from the vent contributed to her chill but not because the air was cool nostrils widening she stepped toward the vent low on the wall hidden by a chair beside her bureau pulse rushing she stooped moved the chair away and sniffed the stream of air a vague acrid smell made her shiver smoke is that her throat felt stung it cant be smoke but the smell intensified and with the next deep breath that flared her nostrils she coughed panic squeezed her chest as she gasped she straightened in terror seeing a thin wisp of gray drift out of the vent fire for a moment her body refused to move abruptly a spring seemed to snap within her and she charged toward the bedside phone to dial instantly her stomach dropping deeper faster she remembered that the phone had been dead the last time shed tried it frantic she tried it again still no dial tone jesus she grabbed the cotton pullover that shed taken off earlier and desperately put it back on then she clutched the doves neck ring along with the photographs and crammed them into her purse with a final look toward the airconditioning vent from which an increasing wisp of gray drifted out and made her cough harder she darted toward the bedroom door yanked it open and lunged out twelve the hallway was dark someone presumably the butler had turned off the lights after tess and her mother had gone to their rooms even the staircase to her left and the vestibule below it were shrouded in darkness only the glow from the lamp on her bedside table allowed her to see she rushed to the right along the murky hallway and reached the door to her mothers room urgent she shoved it open and groped to flick at the lightswitch the overhead chandelier blazed she stared her mother who lay in a canopied bed similar to tesss wore eyeshades even though the draperies were closed as a consequence she didnt respond to the sudden gleaming light tess coughed even harder this room too was hazy from smoke wafting out of the airconditioning vent mother she hurried toward the bed her mother was snoring mother tess shook her uh her mother turned onto her side tess shook her repeatedly mother wake up uh her mother stopped snoring i what lethargic she pawed at her eyeshades and clumsily raised them to her forehead squinting through sleeppuffed eyes tess why are you whats the you have to get out of bed hurry whats that her mother coughed haze it smells like smoke the house is on fire hurry mother you have to get out of bed shock jolted her mother fully awake fire she fumbled at the sheets and squirmed to raise herself quickly call the fire department i cant what i tried the phone isnt working tess said its got to be working her mother reached for the bedside phone no im telling you mother the phone isnt damn it come on we have to leave her mother strained to overcome her grogginess and raise herself she wore a frilly rosecolored nightdress it had bunched around her knees but as she lurched to her feet its hem dropped toward her ankles she pivoted in confusion mustered strength and shuffled toward a closet help me get dressed there isnt time tess grabbed her arm we have to get out of here the room was thick with haze now both women coughed for gods sake mother lets go with a hand on her mothers back tess urged her toward the bedrooms open door but only when they reached the shadowy hallway did tess stiffen with complete understanding dread flooded through her jesus she thought first the phone stops working then the mansions on fire it isnt a coincidence its not accidental they did this they think i know too much they want to kill me craigs right why didnt i listen it was her mothers turn to insist on moving forward hurry she shoved at tess whats the matter why did you stop dear god tess thought what if theyre in the building smoke detectors wailed in the bedrooms in the corridor in the vestibule the kitchen and other locations downstairs their combined unnerving shriek made tess want to clamp her hands across her ears but her panicked mind alerted her no they wouldnt just start a fire and run theyd want to make sure i what if theyre in the house theyll try to stop us from getting out theyll want our deaths to seem like an accident but if they have to if we try to escape theyll kill us before the fire does tess why are you stopping her mother frowned at the same time pressing the sleeve of her nightdress against her mouth breathing stridently through it whats wrong the smokes worse well suffocate if we dont mother as tesss premonition worsened a fierce startling thought controlled her whatever happened to fathers handgun do you still have it i dont understand why would you tess whirled toward her mother just pay attention after father died did you keep it do you still have his handgun her mother coughed why does it matter we have to the handgun mother what did you do with it nothing i left it where he always put it the same as i left his other things even after six years renewed grief strained her mothers already fearstrained features you know i couldnt bring myself to part with anything he owned smoke swirled behind them to the left in the vestibule below the staircase the darkness was interrupted by a flicker as if from a hesitant strobelight the fire tess cringed she gripped her mothers shoulders in the other bedroom yes that rooms exactly the way it was the day your father said goodbye to me and went to beirut tess fervently kissed her mothers cheek god bless you hurry follow me but we need to i still dont understand i dont have time to explain all you need to understand is i love you mother and im trying to save your life well her mother strained to breathe thats good enough for me with a terrified glance toward the flickering flames in the vestibule tess jerked her mothers hand and urged her toward the right along the hallway just pray and do everything i tell you she reached a farther door to her right and banged it open in the darkness she fumbled along the inside wall to find the lights witch before you theres something id better tell you her mother said not now but as tess flicked the switch and the overhead light gleamed tess knew what her mother had wanted to explain she blinked in astonishment this bedroom was the one that her father had used when he came home late at night after emergency meetings at the state department so he wouldnt disturb tesss mother when he undressed to go to sleep but now the bedroom resembled the dilapidated interior of miss havishams house in great expectations six years of dust covered everything the carpet the bed the end tables the lamps the phone the bureau cobwebs clung to the corners and dangled from the ceiling making tess flinch as if she were about to enter a nest of spiders the rapid movement of the door shed shoved open had caused dust to swirl the cobwebs to sway creating a haze that was emphasized by the smoke spewing out of the airconditioning vent mother i tried to tell you horrified tess rushed ahead each frantic footstep raising dust she swung her arms clearing the cobwebs repelled by their stickiness i left everything the way it was her mother struggled after her coughing the day i learned that your father was dead i took one final look at this room closed the door and never came in here again i told the servants to keep that door closed with increasing revulsion tess noticed that even her fathers slippers layered with dust remained beside the bed she was too distraught to ask her mother what on earth had made her turn this room not into a shrine but a crypt but the smoke was denser all she had time to care about was she yanked open the top drawer of a table next to the bed fearing that her father might have taken his pistol with him when he went to beirut but exhaling sharply she saw that the handgun was where he always kept it her father had been an operative in marine intelligence when he served in vietnam that was where hed met brian hamilton a marine general supervising eye corps after the war her father had joined the state department belonging to its littleknown intelligence division later after brian hamilton had retired from the military he too had joined the state department in the diplomatic division eventually convincing tesss father to switch from intelligence to diplomacy but tesss father had retained his nervous habits from vietnam although he seldom went armed when on an assignment in a potentially dangerous foreign country hed made sure to keep a handgun in the house where he could easily get to it in case someone broke in at night the weapon was made in switzerland a sigsauer mm semiautomatic pistol a compact shortbarreled handgun it held an unusually large number of rounds in the magazine sixteen and unlike most other pistols it had a double action which meant that it didnt need to be cocked to be fired all you needed to do was pull the trigger tess knew all this because when she was twelve shed happened to see her father cleaning the gun and had shown such curiosity that her father had decided shed better be taught about it so shed respect it and more important stay away from it after all shed been a tomboy she hadnt been repelled by guns the way many girls her age might have been and she took to target shooting as easily as shed developed expertise in basketball track andfield and gymnastics frequently when her father went to a range to practise his marksmanship hed invited her to come along hed taught her how to take the weapon apart clean it and reassemble it hed instructed her in the proper way to aim both hands on the pistol both eyes open both front and rear sights lined up but the main trick hed said was to focus your vision not on the sights but rather on the target the sights would seem blurred as a consequence but that was okay you got used to it after all the target was your objective and you had to see it clearly any time the sights were in focus but the target was blurred you were aiming wrong after an equally thorough explanation of how to load the magazine insert it securely into the handle and pull back the slide on top of the pistol so that a round was injected into the firing chamber her father had finally allowed tess to fire the weapon dont yank on the trigger squeeze it shed felt slightly apprehensive about the recoil but to her delight from the first shed discovered that the jerk when the gun went off had not been nearly as bad as shed feared indeed shed enjoyed the recoil the release of power and the noise of the gun going off had been muffled by the ear protectors that her father insisted she wear toward the end of her teenage years shed been able to place all sixteen rounds in a circle the size of a basketball at a distance of thirty yards but then as shed started college shed lost all interest in shooting with the same abruptness that shed initially been fascinated by it perhaps because her father had been away from home so much she grabbed the pistol from the drawer and mentally thanked her father for having taught her he might have saved her life she pressed a button on the side and disengaged the magazine from the handle nodding when she saw that the magazine was loaded after reinserting the magazine she pulled back the pistols slide and let it snap forward chambering a round the hammer stayed back she gently squeezed the trigger and with equal gentleness lowered the hammer so the gun wouldnt go off accidentally so far so good but it worried her that the pistol hadnt been cleaned and oiled in six years the slide had felt slightly hesitant when she pulled it back if her worst fear was justified and she was forced to defend herself would the gun jam when fired tess didnt dare think about it come on mother lets go but you still havent told me why did you want the gun insurance what do you mean tess didnt answer but rushed with her mother through the cobwebs toward the open door and the hallway now the flicker of flames downstairs radiated upward and made the hallway seem lit by shimmering candles urging her mother tess raced to the left toward the top of the staircase staring nervously downward pistol ready but instead of targets what she saw was a blaze that crackled growing to a roar in the vestibule the bottom of the stairs was consumed by flames tess felt and stumbled back from the upward rush of heat there wasnt any way that she and her mother could run through the swelling fire and cross the vestibule to reach the mansions front door for certain her mother didnt have the dexterity to keep up with tess and equally for certain tess had no intention of getting ahead of her mother at the sight of the flames her mother whimpered the back stairs tess said hurry she guided her mother along the smokefilled hallway coughing bent low because the air near the floor was less hazy they came to the stairs that led down to the kitchen here too a flicker illuminated the bottom but at least it was a reflection off a wall the fire itself wasnt in view we might have a chance tess thought she led the way descending telling her mother stay close the smoke alarms kept wailing at once a figure appeared at the bottom charging toward them tess aimed the pistol a man blurted mrs drake jonathan tesss mother said nervous tess lowered the pistol the butler reached them he wore pajamas i was sleeping the smoke nearly if the fire alarms hadnt wakened me he had trouble breathing i tried to come up the front staircase to warn you but the vestibules we know tess said can we get out through the back the fires in the kitchen but the servants quarters havent been touched yet the three of them rushed down the stairs did you see anyone else inside tess demanded anyone else edna what about edna tesss mother sounded hoarse i woke her and told her to leave before i came for you jonathan said you didnt see anyone else tess repeated urgently the butler sounded confused why no miss drake i dont understand what you mean who else would tess didnt have time to explain at the bottom she squinted to her left toward an open door and the harsh glare of flames in the kitchen the heat was so intense that she had to raise an arm to shield her face but the heat singed that arm if the flames reach this hallway before tess realized what she was doing she lunged grabbed the side of the door and slammed it shut her hand stung nonetheless the pain was worth the risk shed taken the door provided a buffer she clutched her mother and stumbled forward following jonathan along a hallway toward the servants quarters despite the closed kitchen door this hallway too was filled with smoke a hot wind making the haze swirl but at least tess didnt feel scorched although she barely saw the doors to the butlers room and the maids the closer she came to the exit at the mansions rear the more breathable the air became she couldnt wait any second now theyd be outside in the clear cool night but her second fear made tess falter trembling theyre probably hiding in the garden aiming from the shrubs ready to kill us when we try to leave tess youre shaking so much her mother said dont worry were almost free free tess thought theres a good chance were about to be shot they reached the back door it was open smoke billowing out as cool air spewed in then the smoke dispersed and as jonathan hurried forward tess saw beyond him twenty feet ahead in the glow of the flames from windows a woman sprawled facedown in the grass blood soaked the back of her nightgown edna jonathan gasped tess tried to stop him no but jonathan pried away and raced toward his fellow servant edna the last word he ever said halfway toward her jonathan straightened seemingly jolted by a cattle prod a lethal prod dark fluid erupted from his neck more fluid spurted from his back jonathan appeared to be attempting a trick to grasp his neck his chest and his forehead simultaneously not enough hands like a clumsy acrobat he fell thrashed pathetically quivered lay still tesss mother screamed either she didnt understand what had happened or else she did understand and panic seized her or perhaps she felt desperate to try to help her servants for whatever reason she fought to squeeze beyond tess and scramble out of the mansion tess clawed to stop her but the hand that clutched her fathers pistol failed to snag on her mothers nightgown the other hand clasped at lacy frills which snapped from the strain her mother escaped her no tess gaped as her mothers frail dietthinned body didnt heave back like a catapulted acrobat but rather pirouetted then sank arms fluttering like an exhausted ballerina with bloodspurting holes in her abdomen and chest tess wailed in grief in horror in rage bees seemed to buzz around her walloping the doorframe slamming against the corridors walls bullets from silenced handguns in the backyard shrubs the bullets overcame tesss shockinduced paralysis she stumbled backward pivoted to run and lurched to a halt at the sight of flames eating through the closed kitchen door what am i doing i cant run back inside im trapped too many thoughts sped through her mind her mothers death the gunmen outside the fire paralysis again controlled her i cant stay here but i cant go outside think the fire kept licking through the kitchen door brightening the smokefilled hallway the basement i can get to the basement the doors in this hallway i can hide downstairs in a corner i can use the laundry tub to soak rags and wrap myself in no thats crazy i wouldnt have a chance when the smoke filled the basement no matter how many wet rags i tried to breathe through id still be suffocated and the heat would be unbearable and the overhead floor would eventually collapse id be buried by flaming fear made her tremble so hard that her bladder muscles nearly failed but i cant just stand here the smoke made her bend over retching at once a new thought gave her frantic hope it might not work but god help me its my only chance she held her breath and scurried forward dodging past the fiery kitchen door the heat struck her clothes for a terrifying moment she was certain that their cotton would burst into flames blinded by the smoke she reached the stairs tripped banged painfully forward and clambered on her hands and knees up the steps the heat became mercifully less although the smoke increased and when she had to breathe her lungs rebelled her chest racked with spasms determined she scrambled faster harder and suddenly the steps ended pawing at nothing propelled by her thrusting knees she arched through the air and sprawled slamming her chin on the upstairs floor ahead at the hallways midpoint even with the smoke she had no trouble seeing the flames at the top of the vestibules staircase with a roar they swelled toward the ceiling hurry the smoke made her eyes weep it seared her throat she struggled to a crouch and darted forward moaning as she neared the increasing heat the spreading blaze the crackling whoosh of the flames became deafening she whimpered seized with terror that she might not be able to reach her destination that the surge of blistering heat would force her back no choice now she cursed mustered her resolve and veered to the left chased by a gushing arm of flame she found her open bedroom door lurched through it and slammed the door shut behind her by comparison with the furnace of the hallway the air in her bedroom was wonderfully cool although thick acrid smoke continued to sting her eyes her exertion forced her to breathe and made her cough so deeply that she spit out phlegm she didnt care she had a chance now move the glow of the lamp on her bedside table was useless so enveloped by haze that it was almost invisible that didnt matter in this familiar bedroom she didnt need to see in order to do what she had to she lunged past a chair and reached french doors when she yanked them open she couldnt believe how delicious the outside air smelled flames that shattered windows to her right illuminated the gardens and shrubs below her but all tess paid attention to was the giant oak tree beyond the small balcony outside her room that oak tree had been the reason tess had broken her arm when she was eleven one saturday afternoon after having come home from her gymnastic class shed been so excited by her progress on the overhead bar that shed studied the oak tree from the balcony and wondered how easy it would be to leap toward the nearest branch then swing toward a farther branch until she reached the trunk and climbed down hand over hand to the ground tempted beyond her ability to resist shed leapt grabbed the branch clung by one hand while shed stretched her other hand toward the next branch and screamed when she felt her fingers slipthen screamed again even more fiercely when shed hit the lawn her left arm twisted under her the arm had projected in a wrong a horribly wrong direction until that moment shed never known a greater agony her father had burst from the house and rushed to pick her up then raced to the garage and driven her speeding through red lights to the nearest hospital her father dead how much she missed him and now her mother was dead as well tess still couldnt adjust to the sight of the blood from the bullets that had struck her mothers abdomen and chest she couldnt believe it had happened dead her mother couldnt be dead you bastards as flames squeezed through the top bottom and sides of her bedroom door tess crammed the handgun into her burlap purse tugged its top closed and wrapped the purses strap repeatedly around her wrist until there wasnt any slack the flames no longer squeezed but erupted through the sides top and bottom of her door no time tess retreated into the smoke of her bedroom responding to her years of training she crouched braced one foot behind the other and bent her knees in a sprinters pose she blurted a prayer and propelled herself forward thirteen she jumped felt her sneakers touch the balconys ornate metal railing and vaulted outward hurtling through the air in the dark she feared that the past would reoccur that shed lose her grasp on the tree limb and plummet toward the lawn but she was twentyeight now her tall lithe body reached the tree much sooner than she expected her long arms stretching her firm hands clutching the jolt of grabbing the branch swung her down then up toward another branch she took advantage of that motion and as the branch she held began to droop she hooked her legs around the farther branch and dangled her hips bent toward the ground balancing her weight between one branch and the other the moment the branches stopped bobbing she groped handoverhand shifting her legs toward where the two branches converged with an expert twist she upended herself facing downward now and inched along the two branches finally clutching the trunk where she huddled supported by stout limbs concealed by leaves her heart pounded so fiercely that she feared she might become sick had the gunmen seen her leap from the balcony despite the flames that burst from windows near the front of the mansion she strained to convince herself that this area remained in shadow the branches had bobbed true yes she couldnt pretend that they hadnt but if the gunmen were concentrating on the doors from the mansion they might not have thought to look toward this side of the house where there werent any doors and in particular they might not have thought to glance toward the least likely exit a balcony on the upper floor well tess trembled ill soon find out she yanked open her purse and tugged out her pistol it gave her great satisfaction to think that the men whod killed her mother might be killed by the gun her father had trained her to use even though it hadnt been cleaned in six years even though the spring in its magazine might have been weakened from so many years of having been loaded tess couldnt think about that risk all she could think about was descending the tree doing her best to escape through a barrier of thick evergreen shrubs toward the darkness of a neighboring mansion she climbed down the tree huddled at the base of its murky trunk aimed toward the shadowy back of the mansion saw no one and bolted toward the shrubs on her right a bee seemed to buzz a bullet splintered the oak in midstride tess whirled crouched and raised her fathers pistol a lunging target appeared silhouetted by flames that suddenly gushed at the back of the mansion a target with a gun a target who stooped and aimed toward tess the lessons at the shooting range came back to her she squeezed the trigger the pistol roared its recoil jolting the barrel upward ignore the recoil never take your eyes from the target she stared at the gunman and realized heart lurching that shed missed oh jesus she dove as the gunman fired his weapon had a silencer she didnt hear the spit when the gun discharged but she definitely heard the bullet whiz over her flat both hands gripping the pistol tess aimed more deliberately concentrating more fiercely firing again the roar made her ears ring with an inward scream of triumph she saw the gunman stagger back and topple at once her stomach cramped from tension from the shock of what shed just done she couldnt allow herself to feel guilty about she had to get away scrambling upward consumed by frenzy she raced toward the shrubs on the right in the distance sirens wailed the fire department maybe the police someone in a neighboring mansion must have called them but the sirens were too far away they wouldnt get here soon enough to help her keep running someone shouted from the front of the mansion tess pivoted a man with a gun darted into view reflexively tess aimed she squeezed the trigger again then again the first bullet struck the mansions wall the second hit a tree behind the gunman but the third knocked the gunman backward tess again screamed inwardly with triumph directly the silent cheer stuck in her throat no the gunman had managed to stay on his feet he continued to raise his weapon her own gun roaring tess fired again and slammed the man onto the lawn she sprinted past a flower garden hearing bullets zing from the back of the mansion they slashed the evergreens she ran toward and made her dive again frantic she rolled against the bottom of the shrubs twisted aimed at a gunman racing in her direction from the back of the house shot three times missed but at least made the gunman scramble behind the cover of a gazebo the mansion was completely in flames now the sirens wailed louder closer as the gunman leaned from the side of the gazebo aiming tess angrily shot yet again he spun out of sight but not smoothly tess tried to assure herself that it was possible shed hit him although maybe shed merely splintered wood near his face she couldnt tell it didnt matter no time she crawled through a narrow gap at the bottom of the shrubs felt branches scrape her skull her back her hips and charged to her feet the moment she was through the hedge she ran through the fireilluminated shadows in the spacious back yard of the neighboring mansion lights were on in the house she imagined the frightened residents scrambling toward the street in case the fire spread and their own house caught fire despite the roar of the blaze she heard branches scrape behind her whirling she shot three times toward where the hedge moved heard a man groan and urged herself onward through the deepening darkness of the extensive yard she veered past trees lunged through flower gardens tripped against the low rim of a lily pond nearly tumbled into the water but caught her balance and skirted the pond running faster count how many rounds youve shot her father had always insisted but in her frenzy to escape tess had forgotten her fathers rule how many times did i shoot she couldnt remember more than ten she was sure of that perhaps thirteen or the pistol would be almost empty fear chilled her despite the sweat that soaked her clothes and dripped from her face she had to conserve her ammunition chest heaving she came to another line of evergreens in the darkness she couldnt help spinning to face the blazing mansion a hundred yards away flames licked from her bedroom the violation made her furious her past her youth were being destroyed trembling she detected no sign of anyone chasing her and sank to the ground scurrying beneath the farther shrubs in the next mansions yard she realized tense that she couldnt keep running in this direction it was too predictable all her pursuers had to do was hurry along the street in front of the house get ahead of her hide and wait to kill her when she tried to leave the area her only hope was that the sirens now very close would force her hunters to flee but she couldnt count on that she had to guarantee her protection how breathing rapidly shaking confused afraid she made an urgent choice and instead of continuing to sprint across this yard she darted toward its rear after passing through the darkness between a swimming pool and a tennis court she found her way blocked by a high stone wall she glanced around desperate in search of a ladder or a tree near the wall anything that would allow her to get over the top nothing jesus she retreated toward the swimming pool next to a maintenance shed she found a long metal pole the pole had a net at one end obviously used for skimming leaves and other debris from the surface of the water hurry she pressed the pole against the bottom of the shed squeezing it flexing it twisting the pole was strong yet pliant maybe her temples throbbed from the force of her rapid heartbeat no choice tess crammed the pistol into her purse which still hung securely from her wrist with equal speed she gripped one end of the pole shifted the other end toward the back of the yard lifted the pole and raced toward the wall when the far end of the pole was five feet from the wall she rammed it into the lawn and hurtled upward it had been years since shed practised this event in trackandfield pole vaulting had never been her favorite activity but now she had to pretend she was in the olympics as her body arched higher she felt the pole begin to bend its metal creaked if it snaps with a stunning jolt she slammed against the top of the wall clawed with one hand snagged the rim let go of the pole fumbled with her other hand and dangled from the wall squirming upward at the top hands scraped and bleeding ignoring the pain tess lay flat then hung from the other side and dropped toward blackness she feared shed hit a bench that might break her ankle or a stake that supported a sapling and might impale her instead her feet struck the soft earth of a garden and with practised agility she bent her knees tucked her elbows against her sides then rolled across pliant dirt and cushioning flowers in a frenzy she sprang to her feet studied the gloom ahead the vague shadows of trees the bulky dark outline of another mansion drew the pistol from her purse and ran when shed been ten her best friend had lived here theyd often played in this yard and one of their favorite games had been hideandseek tess remembered an afternoon when shed found so good a hiding place that her friend had finally given up looking now tess hurried toward that hiding place hoping that the yard had not been relandscaped when she heard the trickle of water she increased speed in a corner at the back she came to boulders that had been piled and cemented together to form a miniature shoulderhigh imitation of a mountain from the top of which water bubbled and streamed down a series of zigzagging crests toward a goldfish pond a pump in an alcove behind the boulders kept the water circulating the alcove had a metal hatch to protect the pump from bad weather bushes flanked the boulders tess crept through the sharpedged bushes knelt at the back and groped in the darkness finding the hatch she squirmed into the alcove closing the hatch behind her in total blackness with the pump whirring next to her she sat with her knees bent toward her chest her arms around her knees her head stooped the cramped position made her muscles ache but at least she could rest and gain time to decide what to do years ago the reason her friend hadnt been able to find her was that theyd once investigated this alcove and tesss friend had been disgusted by the spider webs inside her friend hadnt thought to look here because her friend would never have chosen to hide here but tess had been a tomboy and spider webs had meant nothing compared to winning the game now feeling spider webs against her hair as well as something tiny with many legs skittering across her right hand making her skin tingle tess again ignored what would have nauseated her friend although she needed all her discipline to repress a shudder the main thing was that shed reached safety in this grownup deadly version of hideandseek no stranger could find where shed hidden because no stranger could possibly know about this alcove behind the boulders tess winced her hands hurt from scratches and burns her back stung from when shed crawled through the shrubs her legs arms and chin throbbed from the numerous times shed struck objects or fallen but the pain in her body was nothing compared to the pain in her soul her mother was dead no tess couldnt believe it she couldnt adjust to it shed killed at least two men tonight and she couldnt adjust to that either no matter how much shed cursed and continued to curse the gunmen whod killed her mother and no matter how fiercely shed sworn to get even she wanted to vomit no instead silently she wept hot tears streaming down her cheeks as she trembled in the cool damp black confinement of the alcove she needed to think in time when she decided the area would be safe she needed to get away but more than anything she needed to find out who was after her and why theyd turned her life into hell and get even the bitter angry thought kept coming back yes someone definitely was going to pay she fingered her purse as exhaustion overwhelmed her she thought of the photographs that her purse contained and one photograph especially as repulsive as it was confusing the basrelief statue a muscular longhaired handsome man straddled a bull and sliced its throat while a dog lunged at the gushing blood a serpent sped toward a clump of wheat and a scorpion attacked the bulls genitals insanity fourteen in the dustladen classroom on the second floor of the abandoned school in brooklyn the chameleon completed his report the room shadowy because of the plywood over its windows was silent for a moment the chameleons associates frowning so the woman escaped the fourth man finally asked unconsciously twisting the ruby ring on the middle finger of his left hand grasping its insignia of an intersecting cross and sword the chameleon hesitated i believe so the member of our watchers team who hid behind the mansion didnt see the woman leap from the balcony to the tree but he did see her climb down the tree to the lawn and he definitely saw her shoot two men but where did she get the weapon the fifth man asked the chameleon shrugged are you sure the enemy didnt chase the woman and catch her the second man asked i cant be certain the fire department and the police arrived their approaching sirens gave the enemy ample warning time to pick up their dead and flee the area before the authorities arrived i hope that our own operative fled successfully the third man said the chameleon nodded more i believe theres a good chance that the woman is safe but we dont know where she is the sixth man scowled the enemy doesnt either if i understand your logic you counted on using the woman as bait to attract the quarry but your plan wont work now were back to where we started not necessarily the chameleon squinted at the moment we dont know where the woman is but we will and soon how you put a tap on the womans phone as you ordered the electronics expert said and on the policemans phone in her place desperate confused afraid what would you do the chameleon asked ah the sixth man leaned back of course shell contact the policeman with a smile he added so now we concentrate our surveillance on him eventually hell lead us to the woman the chameleon said more important i take for granted that the enemy will be as clever as always after all theyve had years of practise does anyone doubt that their logic will be as calculated as mine that theyll come to the same conclusion the fifth man traced his finger through the dust on his miniature desk theyve proven their survival skills again and again theyve anticipated our traps but perhaps not this time the chameleon said wherever the policeman goes hell be the bait that attracts the quarry the hunt continues at the moment i have a team watching lieutenant craig although their primary purpose of course is to watch for the enemy in that case wed better join the hunt the fourth man said absolutely the third man said the others stood quickly the chameleon gestured a moment before we leave theres one other matter i need to explain they waited as we know the enemy the vermin are increasing their repugnant activities theres no anticipating the horrors to which theyll descend as a consequence of their hellish errors at the same time i grant that in the past week a great many errors tactical were committed on our side several were my fault ive readily admitted that but judgment day is now recent events prove how unstable the situation has become id hoped that we could accomplish this assignment on our own im no longer certain we can pride is not my shortcoming i dont hesitate to ask for help if i think our mission requires it help the sixth man furrowed his brow ive contacted our superiors ive explained the situation they agree with my assessment and agree with my request at halfpast noon a team of specialists will arrive at kennedy airport specialists the sixth man paled thats right ive sent for a team of enforcers two outrage and retribution the sacrificial victim one newark new jersey in his ramshackle office in a rusted corrugatedmetal building on the fringe of the citys docks buster right hook buchanan scraped a wooden match across his desk and lit the remnant of a cigar hed butted out last night before going home no point in being wasteful after all this was a cuban cigar the last of a box that don vincenzo always thoughtful had sent to him on his birthday two weeks ago good old don vincenzo he knew how to make his employees happy especially those who worked hard for him and buster right hook buchanan was as hard a worker as hed been a tough longshoreman in his youth and then a fierce boxer a contender for sure on impulse reminded of his favorite profession buster clenched his fists did a little fancy footwork jabbed rapidly right and left then delivered his famous powerful right hook got you he glared down at his phantom kod opponent but at once the thought of his longago glory in the ring made buster frown the cheers of the frenzied spectators the stroking praises of his manager the different kind of stroking from women so many women gorgeous women eager to fuck a celebrity buster shook his head the cheers the praises the women some nights it seemed as if they haunted him buster tried a little more footwork a little more jabbing but he was overweight now twenty years older and let a fact be a fact his doctor had warned him to take it easy not that buster was afraid hell hed never been afraid he could still drop three guys in a barfight any time hadnt he done so last night in his neighborhood tavern on the way home from work damned right nonetheless his impulsive footwork and jabbing combined with the smoke from the cigar stub in his mouth made him wheeze he felt like that one time hed taken a vacation to colorado and had never been able to catch his breath in the mountains maybe i ought to give up these cigars after all thats what the doctor said shit no lifes too short hey what does that frigging doctor know was he a contender sure its easy enough for him to give advice he looks like a kid for christs sake and that rolex he wears he must have been born with a silver spoon in his asshole he doesnt understand too bad too damned bad about those last three bouts buster had always regretted being forced to take a dive no three dives because don vincenzo had a cousin who was a fighter and whod been chosen to be the contender that buster was supposed to be well that cousins glass jaw had put the kabash on his career buster thought with bitter delight but my career had gone in the toilet and never mind waving smoke from his face puffing on the final remnant of his cuban cigar at least don vincenzo remembered the guys he owed favors buster told himself he had work to do or else don vincenzo would be pissed buster savored the final puff from castros tobacco and crunched the last of the butt in an overflowing ashtray got to get this frigging place cleaned up some time he thought but there was work to do and as buster scowled at the scratch mark that his match had left on his battered wooden desk straight across a circular stain made by a beer can he told himself that a working man needed rewards now and then not just cigars but yeah buster groped beneath his desk and grabbed the last can of beer in a hollowsounding twelvepack he popped the tab and took several deep swallows vitamins yeah he licked his lips then reminded himself work to do any minute big joe and his brother were due to arrive at this warehouse with the truck the three of them would unload the red plastic containers that except for their color and what they were made of resembled the canister of natural gas attached to busters outdoor barbecue grill not that buster liked to barbecue although his nagging wife did what a pain in the ass when he big joe and big joes brother emptied the containers into several large metal bins theyd close the hatches on the bins to conceal their contents and use a forklift truck to place the bins in a sling which would hoist them onto a barge tonight the three of them would take a cruise down the hudson river and across to the tip of long island and dump the shit they were carrying because their cargo buster sipped more beer and shivered was medical waste used needles contaminated bandages infected blood rotting human tissue well buster thought and guzzled more beer its a dirty job he forced himself to chortle but some poor bastard has to do it especially for don vincenzo despite the beer that cleared his head from this mornings hangover buster sobered yeah especially for don vincenzo because if you refuse the don you make him unhappy and when the dons unhappy you get your knees broken and thats only for starters fuck the cuban cigars when the dons unhappy he doesnt just have your knees broken he butchers you and anyway whats the harm in dumping the needles and the bandages into the ocean buster asked himself wishing hed thought to buy more beer theres a landfill crisis thats what i read in the frigging papers too much garbage not enough space to get rid of all that shit too many frigging condominiums not enough holes in the ground and nobody wants what do they call them incinerators to get rid of medical waste the damned yuppies think theyll get a disease if they breathe the smoke but don vincenzos got the biggest garbagedisposal outfit in eastern new jersey so wheres he supposed to put all the junk especially the crap from the hospitals the answer was simple theres plenty of ocean you bet more than half the world maybe threequarters is frigging water isnt it plenty i mean plenty of room for a few barges of needles and bandages okay all right the tide sometimes works against us buster thought sometimes the shit drifts back toward land sometimes the needles and bandages float up on the beaches give me a break is that my fault i do my job i dump the stuff if the ocean works against me im not to blame yeah he thought sure so a few yuppies dont get to swim in the ocean for a couple of days while the junks cleaned up so what let the cleanup squad do its job while i do mine a buzzer sounded buster set down his beer and straightened the buzzer was the signal that big joe and his brother had backed the truck toward the warehouse and were waiting for buster to raise the door about time buster pressed a button a rumble shook the rickety warehouse as its door rose big joes truck backed into the warehouse toward the barge containers its engine burping the truck stopped buster jabbed the button that lowered the rumbling door and stalked from his office youre late he growled as the drivers door swung open but big joe didnt step down in his place a man whom buster had never met jumped lithely onto the concrete floor hi the man in his thirties in great shape grinned who the hell are you i hate to say it but big joe had an accident tragic terrible accident what kind of horrible a fire his trailer died in his sleep my god buster wheezed but big joes brother where is he does he know in a way that doesnt make sense either he does or he doesnt well he did thats for sure the handsome robust stranger said but he doesnt anymore see hes dead another fire awful his house burned down last night what are you telling me youre next with a bang the trucks passenger door jolted open two men leaping down buster rubbed his eyes the other men resembled the first man trim lithe handsome tawny skin early thirties as they neared him buster realized that they resembled each other in a further way it had to be a trick of the light they all seemed to have gray eyes so buster weve got a problem the first man said oh yeah buster stepped backward and raised his famous right fist what problem the needles the bandages the contaminated blood youre poisoning the ocean hey all im doing is what don vincenzo tells me sure well you dont need to take his orders anymore don vincenzos dead what would you believe it amazing really no kidding yet another fire buster stumbled farther backward what the fuck hey dont come any closer im warning you yeah yeah yeah with unbelievable agility the first man ducked under busters jabbing fists avoided the former contenders famous right hook and slammed his nose so hard that buster fell to the floor seeing double spewing blood listen carefully the man said were not going to burn you sickened by his pain and his doubled vision buster wheezed in relief he had to admit that any of these three men were in better condition than any opponent hed faced if they were willing to bargain maybe he had a chance so youll let me go buster wished that hed never met had never surrendered to don vincenzo afraid not the man said actions have consequences but flames arent always the best deterrent sometimes the punishment has to fit the crime a different example is often required just a moment before i show you the three men put on surgical facemasks gowns and rubber gloves jesus buster said if thats your preference my companions will now hold you down no dont resist your death will be more painful as buster squirmed and struggled and screamed while two men held him down the other man shoved a handkerchief into busters mouth to silence him then the man adjusted his rubber gloves and proceeded to unscrew various red plastic containers on the truck pull out numerous contaminated hypodermic needles and plunge each of them into various portions of busters body his arms his legs his throat his groin his eyes wherever when the three men were finished after they left the warehouse and the body was finally discovered the newspapers described the corpse as a pincushion inaccurate buster right hook buchanan was really a needlecushion and if the thousands of points shoved into every portion of his body hadnt killed him at least one of the diseases from those many infected needles would have eventually led to his death that is if his lung cancer from his years of smoking cigars hadnt killed him first two lieutenant craigs apartment was a oneroom efficiency in the cramped basement of a converted townhouse on bleecker street in lower manhattan once hed owned a house in queens or at least the bank had but four years ago his former wife had gained title to the property during their divorce agreement craig dearly wished he was back there not because of the house hed never liked mowing the lawn shoveling snow or doing any of the other chores that a house required although the truth was that his work had kept him so busy hed seldom been home to do those chores or to pay enough attention to his wife and two children thats what he really missed not the damned house but his family some nights his heart ached so fiercely that he couldnt sleep and he lay on his back on his foldout bed staring at the ceiling how he wished to god that hed tried harder but craig had discovered that marriage and police work seldom mixed because being a cop was like having a second marriage and a cops wife could get as jealous about his work as she could about another woman so many other guys in his department were divorced as well the only good thing was that at least craigs former wife had been generous about his visitation privileges he did his best to spend time with his son and daughter on weekends probably more time than when hed been married but the trouble was that his children were in their teens now and being with their father didnt excite them as it had when they were toddlers i sure made a mess of things craig thought as he entered his shower closed the door and turned on the faucets hot water stung him so what am i thinking how come i want to get involved with a woman whos ten years younger than me am i nuts the only reason tess and i are connected is the trouble shes having when that gets settled you mean if no when hey dont get pessimistic shell want nothing to do with me she certainly didnt sound enthusiastic about the idea of a friendship a close friendship when i talked to her on the phone last night craig increased the lancing pulse of hot water rinsed shampoo from his hair and shook his head hey what do you expect shes in mourning never mind that she met her friend whoever joseph martin really was only three times theres a good chance somebodys following her shes preoccupied not to mention scared your timing was lousy he shut off the water stepped from the narrow shower stall there wasnt a bathtub and toweled himself dry with the meticulousness of a divorced man whod come to realize the tremendous amount of maintenance that his former wife had done and hed never noticed he used a squeegee to wipe water off the shower stall so there wouldnt be lime stains hed already shaved all he needed to do was comb his hair slap on some aftershave dab on a little deodorant the maintenance never ended get dressed and make himself eat breakfast in his bedroom which was also his living room and his kitchen craig started to boil water for coffee by habit he turned on his radio to catch the news and on impulse he picked up the phone it might not be a smart idea hed probably be repeating his mistake all the same he felt a compulsion to talk to tess to explain that he was sorry for putting pressure on her he read the note hed made last night when shed told him her mothers phone number and as he pressed buttons on the phone he vaguely heard the radio announcer describe a new round of mortar battles that had broken out between the christians and moslems in beirut why dont they get their shit together craig thought and listened to the longdistance static he heard a buzz another buzz and then a female voice not tesss in fact not even a human voice but one of those robotsounding computer simulations the number you have called is not in service not in service craig frowned i must have pressed the wrong buttons he studied the note hed made wondering if hed written down the wrong numbers and tried to phone again the number you have called is not in service jesus i did write down the wrong numbers boiling water made the kettle shriek craig turned off the stove frowned harder as he spooned instant coffee into a cup then stiffened when the radio announcer said completely destroyed a mansion in an exclusive district of alexandria virginia alexandria a premonition made craig lunge toward the radio to increase the volume three people trying to escape the blaze were shot and killed two servants and melinda drake the announcer said craigs throat constricted widow of remington drake former state department envoy who was tortured to death by moslem extremists six years ago in beirut authorities have not been able to identify the assailants or determine their motive for the slayings but fire investigators have concluded that the blaze was due to arson arson two servants tesss mother but what about craig grabbed the phone jabbed the numbers for information got other numbers jabbed them got through to alexandria information and finally reached the alexandria police department a gruff man said homicide craig struggled to control his breathing click buzz silence come on come homicide a huskythroated woman said my name is william craig another struggle to control his trembling voice im a lieutenant in the missing persons division of the new york city police department my badge number is my superiors name is his office phone number is im calling from my home if you want ill give you that number while you verify who i am before we get complicated lieutenant why dont you catch your breath and tell me what you need the arson at melinda drakes house the gunshot victims did you find another victim the daughter tess drake no only the servants and the what do you know about a daughter lieutenant why would you think she was at the house whats your interest in this matter i its too complicated i need to think ill call you back craig slammed down the phone tess was safe no a sudden fierce thought made him grip the kitchen counter what if she didnt escape the fire what if she died in the house what if the investigators hadnt found her body yet trembling craig yanked open a cupboard and grabbed for the yellow pages desperate to make a reservation on the soonest flight to washington national airport hed rent a car there and drive to his hands faltered abruptly he shut the directory what the hell good would i do in alexandria id be useless all id do is end up pacing watching the investigators search the mansions wreckage but ive got to do something think hope all you know for sure is that two servants and tesss mother were shot while they tried to escape the flames but that doesnt mean tess didnt manage to escape please oh jesus please let her be all right if she escaped what would she do obviously shed be frightened shed hide from whoever had tried to kill her and then maybe just maybe shed call me who else can she turn to who else does she know she can trust and depend on i might be the only hope shes got three afraid tess felt naked shivering despite the mornings humidity she rang the mansions doorbell again she kept glancing nervously beyond the trees and shrubs in the large front yard toward the hedgeflanked entrance to the driveway so far shed been lucky since shed lunged to the porch no cars had passed along the narrow quiet street but if any did and if the drivers noticed her and if one of those cars belonged to the men whod tried to kill her hurry the next time she pressed the doorbell tess didnt take her thumb from the button another fear made her tremble what if the mansion wasnt occupied what if the caudills had gone to their summer place in maine desperate she wondered if she ought to break in no therell be burglar alarms her childhood friend had long since moved away first to college and then with her husband to san francisco but the parents still owned this mansion and during the night while tess had hidden in the damp black constricting alcove behind the boulders in the back yard fountain shed ignored the increasing pain in her cramped muscles and struggled to focus her grieffilled terrorracked thoughts in an effort to decide what to do next although the answer had been obvious her confusion had been so great that it had taken her until the morning to remember that the people who owned this mansion had once been like a second set of parents to her as the skin beneath her thumbnail whitened from the force with which she pressed the doorbell tesss hope dwindled her fear increasing please abruptly she breathed as the door was jerked open a rigid butler scowled surveying her grimy jeans torn pullover sootcovered face and grungy spiderwebtangled hair mrs caudill tess said please is she here mrs caudill donates to shelters for the homeless there are several downtown the butler began to shut the door tess shoved her hand against the door you dont understand mrs caudill can not be disturbed the butler straightened and grimaced his nostrils twitching tess realized that her clothes must reek from smoke sweat and fear ill be forced to call the police if you dont leave no listen to me tess said she pushed at the door the butler resisted my names tess drake mrs caudill knows me heart pounding she heard a car approach along the street and squirmed urgently to get through the narrow opening the butler struggled to block her way im a friend of mrs caudills daughter tess said and fought to shoulder the butler aside i used to come here often mrs caudill knows me tell her its tess a puzzled woman said in the background tess is that you mrs caudill please let me in on the street the car sounded nearer thats fine thomas open the door the unseen woman said very well madame the butler glared at tess as you wish the car was close to the mansions driveway as tess darted through the door the butler shut it muffling the sound of the car tess paused and breathed deeply she clutched her purse it felt heavy with its added burden of the photographs the book and the handgun and gazed in relief at mrs caudill who stood in the foyer near the entrance to the mansions dining room mrs caudill was fiftyfive short somewhat stout with pudgy cheeks that were emphasized by the circular rims of her glasses she wore a brilliantly colored oriental housecoat and blinked in surprise apparently not only because of tesss unexpected arrival but as well because of her disheveled appearance good lord tess are you all right now i am the fire last night i could see the flames from my bedroom window the sirens wakened me where have you been what happened to you although her legs were stiff tess managed to hurry toward her thank god youre home mrs caudill i need help im sorry for barging in like this but help why of course dear you know youre always welcome i remember when you used to come to play with mrs caudill almost reached to hug tess but restrained herself when she got a closer look at tesss filthy clothes and smelled the smoke wafting off her your arms look at those bruises and your hands theyre blistered youve been burned you need a doctor no what not a doctor not yet i dont think the burns are serious mrs caudill they sting though if youve got a firstaid kit yes exactly and we need to get you cleaned up quickly upstairs thomas mrs caudill spun toward the butler i dont recall where the firstaid kit where do we keep it bring it as fast as you can by all means madam the butler said dourly this is my daughters friend tess drake the fire last night yes madam that was her mothers house now i understand madam the butler said more dour tess drake however i regret its no doubt my fault but madam she spoke so quickly i apologize in the haste of the moment i failed to catch her last name thomas stop bowing and for the love of the lord stop scraping as my daughter used to say get with it of course madam mrs caudill grasped the long hem on her colorful oriental housecoat with unexpected agility given the combination of her age and weight she hurried with tess up the mansions front staircase but you still havent told me where have you been what happened to you why didnt the police or the firemen why didnt they take you to a hospital its all a tess rubbed her knotted brow and tried to sound convincing all a blur the smoke alarms woke me the flames i remember being trapped i remember jumping out my bedroom window jumping mrs caudill looked aghast but after that i dont know i seem to recall hitting my head i guess i ran evidently i collapsed the next thing i woke up in your back yard how on earth did you i have no idea mrs caudill i must have been hysterical no wonder in your place id have fainted it must have been horrifying youve been through a tess your mother i hate to do you realize what happened to your mother tess halted on the upper landing as grief cramped her throat and sorrow squeezed her chest tears blurred her vision and scalded her cheeks yes god help me that part isnt a blur im sorry tess i cant express how much i your mother was a fine noble woman the strength she mustered when she learned that your father had been killed she was remarkable and now i cant believe that someone shot her its all been so shocking whats this world coming to i truly cant imagine i tossed and turned most of the night you must be devastated yes mrs caudill i feel so devastated doesnt begin to describe it really thank you i appreciate your sympathy tess pawed at her tears feeling grit on her cheeks the tears streaked the soot on her hands no need to thank me in fact im flattered that you thought to come here regina s been away so long its been too many years since ive had a chance to mother anybody the sound of footsteps made tess spin with a stiffbacked stride the butler came up the stairs hands cradling a plastic container with a red cross on its white lid good the firstaid kit finally mrs caudill said come on tess your burns need attention were wasting time the portly woman guided her hurriedly toward a door halfway along the upper hallway you remember that this bathroom belonged to regina how could i forget i used it often enough mrs caudill smiled yes the old days in contrast with her smile she sounded melancholy the good days she opened the door tess faced a huge white bathroom with spotless countertops and tiles the same as she remembered reassuringly familiar in back a door on the right led to regina s bedroom also in back on the left a steam room stood next to a shower stall but what tess noticed most anticipating barely able to restrain her eagerness was the deep wide tub mrs caudill took the firstaid kit from the butler set it on the marble counter between two sinks and retreated toward the hallway soak tess dont worry mrs caudill i intend to and take as long as you want in the meantime ill sort through some clothes that regina left behind as i recall you and she were almost the same size tess nodded nostalgic yes we used to borrow from each other but mrs caudill please nothing fancy jeans if possible a shirt or a pullover id like to stay casual still a tomboy mrs caudills eyes twinkled i guess in a way dresses make me uncomfortable as long as ive known you they always did well ill do what i can now get in that tub and soak and while i think of it id better phone the police theyll want to no mrs caudill surprised by her outburst tess felt as if snakes writhed in her stomach i beg your pardon mrs caudills brow furrowed i dont understand whats the matter the police must be told they need to talk with you you might know something that will help them find the monsters who set fire to your mothers house and killed no not yet tess tried to restrain her panic i still dont understand mrs caudill deepened the wrinkles on her forehead youre confusing me im not ready i feel so if you call the police theyll hurry to get here but i dont think im strong enough to answer their questions right away i need to clear my head i need to my mother i doubt i can talk about what happened just yet id probably tears trickled down her cheeks i wouldnt be able to control myself mrs caudill debated allowing her brow to slacken of course how foolish of me i wasnt thinking youre still in shock but you realize youll have to talk to the police eventually itll be a strain but it has to be done i know mrs caudill later after i get cleaned up and feel rested ill call them myself soon i promise by all means first things first and the first thing is get into that tub while i try to find you some clothes despite her reassurance mrs caudill continued to look confused as she backed toward the hallway and shut the bathroom door or maybe her expression was one of pity tess couldnt tell as she found herself alone in the bathroom reflexively she locked the door her emotions in a turmoil she quickly undressed and threw her torn dirty smokereeking clothes into a corner evenher socks and underwear stank of smoke at once she opened the hotwater faucet on the tub shut the drain and poured in fragrant bath salts as soon as steam began to rise she adjusted the coldwater faucet used a finger to judge the temperature of the water and climbed into its wonderfully soothing warmth briefly the blisters on her arms and hands stung then the pain went away and she settled back enjoying the heat rising deliciously past her hips her groin her stomach her breasts only when the water came close to the overflow drain did she reluctantly grope forward to shut off the taps her cramped muscles gradually relaxed but she didnt feel contented as she stared at the soot that clung to the soap bubbles bobbing on the water she asked herself frowning why was i so insistent why didnt i want mrs caudill to phone the police dear god my mother was killed two servants were killed i was almost killed for sure whoever set fire to the house wont give up theyll keep hunting me whatever their reason its serious enough that theyre prepared to go to any lengths to get at me jesus why is it something to do with the photographs that man tried to steal from me what did i see in josephs apartment that they dont want me to know about and presumably anyone else to know about tess shuddered at the memory of the basrelief statue on josephs bookcase grotesque repulsive what did that statue mean what kind of sick mind could possibly have designed it and why was joseph attracted to it what did it say about his mind clearly he hadnt been the goodnatured gentle man that he seemed not if he had a habit of whipping himself until he bled and then going to sleep with that thing brooding down at him from the bookcase and now tess reminded herself josephs apartment had been burned the sculpture had been stolen and the only evidence of its existence was the photograph in her bulging purse she trembled so forcefully that the sootfilmed bubbles on the water rippled the first thing i should have done when i got inside this house was call the police i need help so why dont i want mrs caudill to phone them the answer came with startling urgency because i dont want anyone to know where i am whoevers hunting me will make the assumption that ill get in touch with the police so theyre probably monitoring police communications if i phone the police word will get out the killers will scramble to get here before the police and this time tess shuddered theyre so determined i dont think theyd fail theyd kill all of us the butler mrs caudill me tess imagined mrs caudill screaming as blood spurted from bullet holes in her body no i cant have their deaths on my conscience and i cant depend on the police to protect me i need time to think i have to keep hiding until im absolutely sure im safe lord help me what am i going to do four with greater anxiety craig paced his oneroom apartment in the background he barely heard the swelling voices of an opera puccinis turandot that by habit he played when he was nervous phone tess please if youre all right for the love of god phone but the longer he waited the more despondent he became something was very wrong he frowned at his watch and realized that he should have been at the office an hour ago immediately in midstride he froze struck by a sudden thought the office maybe tess figures thats where i am maybe thats where shell try to get in touch with me if she tries to get in touch with me if she wasnt killed in the fire and her body hasnt been found yet no dont think like that shes all right shes got to be all right craig grabbed the phone and pressed the numbers for his office impatient he heard a buzz another buzz missing persons a raspy voice said tony its bill i jesus and joseph finally miracles never fail where the hell have you been the phones keep ringing weve got eight new cases and the captains grumbling about everybody goofing off i promise tony ill be there soon listen have i had any messages plenty craigs heartbeat sped is there anything from tess drake just a minute ill check but whos that woman shrieking in the background opera since when did you become italian the messages tony check the messages yeah okay here ive got them give me a chance to bailey hopkins nope nothing from any tess drake craig slumped against the kitchen counter speaking of messages the captain got a call a while ago from the police in alexandria virginia they claim you phoned them something about a fire they say you sounded a little strange whats going on ill explain when i get to the office tony this is important if tess drake calls for me make sure you get a number where i can reach her craig hung up the phone while pavarottis rich voice soared toward the peak of an aria craig stared at the kitchen counter with a curse he roused himself into motion turned on the answering machine and shut off the stereo compelled he snapped his holstered revolver to his belt put on his suitcoat and hurried from his apartment locking its two deadbolts behind him as craig rushed up the ten steps from his basement apartment and emerged on the noisy street the morning smog irritated his throat and made him cough again near a row of garbage cans he stopped at the curb didnt see a taxi hunched his shoulders in frustration and broke into an awkward jog toward seventh avenue the sudden effort made him breathe heavily tess is right he thought i let myself get out of shape i need to start exercising tess the urgent thought of her triggered a flood of adrenaline into his stomach sweating he jogged faster desperate to find a taxi five behind him near craigs apartment on bleecker street two nondescript men bent down from the curb to examine the engine of a disabled car when they noticed craig start to jog toward seventh avenue they slammed down the engines hood scrambled into the small japanese vehicle made a tight uturn and hurried to follow him farther down the street inside a van the sides of which were marked with perfect copies of telephonecompany insignia a somber man picked up a cellular phone while his equally somber partner adjusted dials on a monitor and continued to listen to earphones the first man aware that cellular broadcasts were capable of being monitored spoke indirectly our friend has left the ballpark a few teammates are going with him the opposite team it seems theyre not ready to play at least we havent seen them but our catcher is worried about his girl friends health he hoped shed phone him at the clubhouse she didnt he believes she might call him at his office meanwhile weve got some time provided the opposite team doesnt arrive so well do our catcher a favor and hang around the clubhouse just in case his girl friend finally does call and wants to leave a message i take for granted that someone will be at his office good after all if his girl friend needs help id hate for our catcher to be alone six appallingly the water in the tub was so filmed with soot that tess had to drain it rinse the tub and refill it even after her second bath she still didnt feel clean and finally had to use the shower washing her tangled hair three times she couldnt find a blow dryer so she simply combed her hair which thank god was short and easy to manage and which now was finally blond again not blackened with ashes she used the firstaid kit to put antibiotic cream on her burns they didnt seem deep although clear liquid seeped from them and theyd begun stinging again she was tempted to bandage them but shed read somewhere that it was important for air to get at burns as long as they werent serious and she hoped these werent at the moment though her burns and bruises were the least of her problems mrs caudill had knocked on the bathroom door and explained that shed laid out some clothes in the adjoining bedroom tess wrapped a towel around her breasts and hips then stepped through the door to the right finding socks underwear jeans and a shortsleeved burgundy blouse on the bed she hurried to dress discarding the bra it felt good to have clean clothes against clean skin they fit her almost perfectly but the tennis shoes that mrs caudill had found were another matter a halfsize too small tess had to use the grimy sneakers shed hoped to discard grabbing her burlap purse which was grimy as well gave off smoke fumes and would have to be replaced she decided shed better get downstairs before mrs caudill changed her mind about calling the police in the foyer she heard noises from the dining room and entered to find a maid placing a silver tray of toast jam bacon scrambled eggs and orange juice at the end of the long oak table steam rose from a coffee pot mrs caudill had changed from her housecoat to a dress and sat near the end of the table the washington post before her seeing tess come in she smiled although her eyes were dim with melancholy well you certainly do look better with effort mrs caudill straightened i hope you dont mind i dont know your tastes but i took the liberty of having rosemarie prepare you a breakfast you must be famished the aroma of the food made tesss stomach growl she hadnt realized until now how weak she felt from hunger in place of supper last night all shed had to eat was the liver pate her mother liked her mother with renewed force grief swept through her chilling numbing she resisted the tears that came to her eyes knowing that given the stress ahead of her she didnt dare lose control it seemed impossible she still wasnt able to adjust to had trouble believing refused to admit that her mother was dead it couldnt be needing all her discipline tess somehow managed to return mrs caudills smile thank you youve been too kind spare me the compliments tess you can thank me by eating everything on your plate today will be excuse my french an sob youre going to need all your strength im afraid youre right tess sat at the table unfolded her napkin and with a trembling hand picked up a gleaming silver fork she amazed herself by how quickly she devoured the meal even though this was far from her usual breakfast shed long ago restricted eggs too much cholesterol and bacon carcinogenic nitrates from her diet as she finished the last of her orange juice gaining energy from the enormous amount that shed eaten tess impulsively thought to ask wheres your husband at the justice department up at your summer place in maine my husband mrs caudills face turned pale you mean you dont know know tess set down her glass know what im not sure my husband died three years ago oh tesss voice dropped shock rippled through her she felt paralyzed uncertain what to do or say next then she was certain and she reached to touch mrs caudills hand gently squeezing it im truly painfully sorry i liked him very much he always made me feel welcome mrs caudill bit her lip yes she restrained a sniffle he was a decent loving man if you dont mind what talking about it mind mrs caudill shook her head not at all in fact in an odd way it helps me go right ahead im a tough old lady what happened a heart attack mrs caudill sighed as much as i did my best i could never convince him to cut back on his work load i kept telling him to take more vacations or at least stay away from the office on weekends her lips trembled well i guess he died where he wanted to be not at home but the office death tess thought im surrounded by death so i know how you feel tess lord i wish i didnt but i do my husband your mother well miss them our lives are less without them mrs caudill braced her shoulders as if she didnt want to pursue the topic she nodded glumly toward the washington post in front of her the fire at your house the killings apparently they happened too late last night to be reported in this mornings paper but perhaps we should turn on the radio there might be some new information some further developments you should know about with a cringe tess recalled the nightmare the flames her mother being shot the thought of hearing it described on the radio appalled her nonetheless she was desperate to know if the police had managed to catch the men whod shot her mother yes thats a good idea and then of course now that youre rested youll have to phone the police exactly tess lied i was just about to do that but her attention was directed toward the newspaper in front of mrs caudill the headline faced away from her even so she managed to decipher what it said and turned cold stiffening she gasped leaned forward to grab the newspaper and twisted it so the headline glared up at her brian hamilton dies in freeway accident oh my god bile from her breakfast burned into tesss throat brian hamiltons dead she frantically read the article a van forced his car off the road mrs caudill sounded depressed either a maniac or a drunken driver tess kept scanning the article then brians car hit an electrical pole his car exploded if he wasnt killed in the crash the flames would have to think he survived all those years in combat in vietnam only to die in a pointless car accident but i just saw him last night tess jerked upright from her chair i spoke to him at my mothers house yes i forgot he and your mother were friends because of your father its not just that i asked him to do me a favor i a favor mrs caudill asked a welter of frightening thoughts collided in tesss mind the fire at the mansion the accident on the freeway she couldnt believe that the two were coincidental whoever had killed her mother had also killed brian hamilton theyd somehow found out that tess had summoned him they feared the information that tess had given him theyre killing everybody who knows what i know theyre killing everyone i come in contact with no mrs caudill if i dont get out of here shell be next i have to use your phone tess tried desperately not to sound terrified to call the police right tess said the police its time i need to talk to them theres a phone in the hallway another one in the kitchen hallway kitchen which would be more private a maid was in the kitchen the hallway tess blurted and hurried from the dining room her fierce thoughts multiplied shed hated brian hamilton because hed sent her father to beirut where hed been murdered but last night shed made a bargain with the man she hated and now the man she hated was dead because hed set out to cancel the debt he owed by trying to use all his power to learn everything he could about joseph martin death everyone i speak to not me though im still alive and ill get even she reached the phone in the hallway groped into her purse fumbled past the handgun and yanked out the card that craig had given her craig he was the only person whod understand the two of them had been through this nightmare together almost from the start but craig knew what she knew maybe he was in danger she had to warn him glancing urgently toward his card she pressed numbers on the phone this is bill craig im not home right now but if youll leave your name and shit shed forgotten the time hed be in the office now she jabbed the disconnect lever and pressed more buttons this time for missing persons a raspy voice said lieutenant craig tess struggled not to hyperventilate hes out of the office but if i can be of help im sure tess slammed down the phone no i need craig the only man i can trust is craig tess spinning tess faced mrs caudill whod nervously emerged from the dining room did you talk to the police you bet they want me downtown right now i hate to impose mrs caudill but if youve got a car i can my home and my cars are yours use my husbands car ive kept it licensed and maintained on the slim chance that id ever be brave enough to resist my memories and drive it what kind of car did he a porsche nineeleven its got plenty of what do the kids say guts just like your husband mrs caudill believe it tess take the car use it my husband would have liked that plenty of guts because ive got a feeling that your problems are worse than i imagine and terrible problems need guts tess raised her arms your intuitions on target mrs caudill i do have problems beyond belief i dont have much time not to be rude but quickly the keys where are the keys seven maintaining his composure but braced for a confrontation vice president alan gerrard stepped past the metal detector and the secret service guards in the white house corridor their features remaining stolid as he entered the oval office since gerrard had been chosen to the nations astonishment as the presidents running mate in the election three years ago gerrard had been invited to the oval office only eight times his few visits accounted for his renewed surprise that the office was so much smaller than it looked on tv outsiders might have been puzzled by the vice presidents lack of access to the president but gerrard understood too well after all hed been chosen as a running mate not because of any skills but merely because of three coincidental pragmatic political reasons one hed been a senator from florida and that southern connection balanced the presidents northern connection as a former senator from illinois two gerrard was forty fifteen years younger than the president and gerrards handsome moviestar features made him appealing so the presidents demographic advisers claimed to young voters especially women three and probably most important gerrard had a reputation for being compliant not causing trouble following the republican party line and hence he wouldnt be a rival to the president who already anticipated the next election and didnt want anyone upstaging his takecharge personality but no matter how much the campaigning presidents logic had made sense in theory its practical effects had almost been disastrous the public the media and political analysts had not merely been surprised by the presidents choice theyd been appalled gerrard knows more about tennis than he does about politics hes more at home at a country club than he is in the senate hes got so much money he thinks everyone drives a mercedes hes never made a decision about anything without asking advice from all of his contacts including his gardener god gave him great looks then went for a walk and forgot to add brains and on and on republican leaders had begged the future president to reconsider his choice for a running mate fearful gerrard had heard strong rumors that the president had almost relented but had finally concluded that to change his mind would make him look indecisive a poor way to start an election campaign so the president had kept gerrard on the ticket but had distanced himself as much as diplomatically possible from his running mate sending gerrard to make speeches in the least important least populated districts exiling gerrard to the boonies in effect making him disappear from the voters minds due to several factors the weak democratic opposition and the presidents strong connection with the previous revered administration gerrards side had won the election and the president had immediately distanced himself even more from gerrard using him as the token white house representative at the blandest of social functions then sending him on innocuous goodwill missions around the globe lately columnists had taken to calling gerrard the invisible man at least until four days ago oh yes indeed four days ago that was when gerrard had become very visible and exercised his limited authority shocking every political theorist in the country as gerrard shut the door behind him he noticed that the oval office was empty except for the president clifford garth who sat behind his wide polished desk in his highbacked bulletproof chair in front of a bulletproof window that overlooked the white house lawn the president was fiftyfive taller than he looked on tv trim from the two miles he swam every day in the pool in the white house basement he was narrowfaced which sometimes gave his mouth an unfortunate pinched expression he had authoritative dark eyebrows that contrasted effectively with a distinguished touch of gray in his neatly cut short hair his skin was normally tanned from daily exposure to a sun lamp but today the presidents cheeks were vividly scarlet his eyes which as a rule displayed a calm controlled reassuring thoughtfulness bulged and blazed with fierce emotion yes mr president you wanted to see me gerrard asked see you damned right i want to see you the president stood with force i waited as long as id have told you to get here four days ago but i needed that much time to control myself never mind the political liability i didnt want to get arrested gerrard shook his head i dont understand arrested sir for murder garth raised a rigid arm and gestured in a frenzy toward the ceiling moving his index finger from left to right imagine the headline imagine my satisfaction president loses his mind attacks vice president throws the bastard across the desk in the oval office and strangles the son of a bitch making his tongue stick out you dumb what the hell did you think you were doing just for fun did you decide to pretend you had power you stupid yes i understand i assume youre referring to the vote on the senates cleanair bill gerrard said my god im stunned i didnt know you had it in you youve suddenly become a genius you read my mind gerrard youre right thats what im referring to the senates cleanair bill mr president if we can discuss this calmly calmly this is as calm as i get when im you dimwit asshole in case youve had a memory lapse ill remind you im the president not you now i havent found out yet how the opposition managed to sway enough of our senators to vote against us but i guarantee you can bet your future and your childrens future i will but what gives me a shrieking headache the president shuddered what i havent found out and what keeps me awake all night and what makes me want to drive a pen through your heart is why you turned against me i almost dumped you three years ago you ought to be grateful i gave you a cushy job no responsibilities just coast and go to banquets try not to get too drunk and when your barbiedoll wifes not around youve got the chance to screw any republican groupie whos got big enough tits and knows how to keep her mouth shut except when its around your dick so why didnt you know enough to keep your mouth shut for gods sake gerrard the vote on the cleanair bill was tied since youve gone simple on me ill remind you the vice presidents job is to break the tie which means he votes for administration policy but you voted against me you broke the tie in the oppositions favor if youll just listen for a moment mr president listen garth shuddered to the point of apoplexy listen idiot i dont listen you do youre the assistant im the boss and what i say goes except that you dont seem to get the message the cleanair bills a good one gerrard said calmly the atmospheres polluted its poisoning our lungs the latest report gives us forty years before the planets doomed hey ill be dead by then what do i care you want to talk about doomed youre doomed come election time youre out pal i need a vp whos smart enough to cooperate which god help me i thought you were but all of a sudden and i dont understand this youve got a mind of your own i voted according to my conscience gerrard said conscience give me a break in my opinion the bill ought to go further this year every day in new york harbor alone weve had an oil spill not to mention along every coast alaska oregon california new jersey texas my home state of florida never mind the oil spills never mind the raw sewage in the rivers and harbors never mind the herbicides and pesticides in the drinking water or the leaks from nuclear plants lets just concentrate on the air its terrible government has to take control gerrard pay attention to realities our administration has to protect the industries that employ our voters keep our economy stable and pay taxes admittedly not as much as they could but hell lets not forget those industries contribute to our dwindling balance of trade with foreign nations the bottom line is gerrard let me guess when the crisis gets bad enough well somehow deal with it the president raised his jaw well what a surprise you finally got the idea the problem is gerrard said what you dont seem to grasp hey i grasp everything the crisis is now if we wait any longer we cant youve forgotten american knowhow youve forgotten world war two american enterprise has shown repeatedly that it can solve every problem yes but what that was then this is now and were not as enterprising as the japanese good lord i hope you havent told that to the press and reunited germany will be even more enterprising gerrard said but i dont believe that theyll save the planet anymore than we will greed mr president greeds always the answer it always wins out until we all tremble and wheeze to death you sound like a damned radical from berkeley in the sixties okay gerrard said i admit that stringent controls on air pollution will affect virtually every american industry the costs to contain the pollution sulphur dioxide chlorofluorocarbons cancercausing industrial emissions carbon dioxide from automobile exhaust i could go on but i dont want to bore you the expenses will be enormous finally gerrard im really surprised youve grasped the point sulphur dioxide which causes acid rain comes from coalburning power plants so if we outlaw coal in those plants we put hundreds of thousands of miners out of work chlorofluorocarbons which deplete the ozone layer are a by product of the cooling systems in refrigerators and air conditioners but theres no alternative technology so what do we do put those industries out of work do you honestly believe that any american would agree to do without an air conditioner automobile emissions contribute to global warming right but if we force the car companies to reduce those emissions itll cost them billions to improve their engines theyll have to charge more for the cars people wont be able to afford them and detroitll go out of business dont get me wrong gerrard i worry about the lousy air believe me after all i have to breathe the damned stuff so does my wife my children my grandchildren but you want to know what also worries me really worries me the faltering economy the negative balance of trade the growing national debt they give me panic attacks so i dont care about forty years from now i have to concentrate on controlling this month this year and youre not with the program gerrard so let me inform you of whats going to happen if the house agrees with the senate and the cleanair bill shows up on my desk im going to veto it veto good for you youre paying attention now do your best to stay alert when the senate reconsiders the bill this time youll urge them to vote against it open your ears and listen against is that clear enough very clear then dont screw up again gerrard seethed although outwardly he tried to seem humble of course mr president your logic is clear and indeed i understand your motives after all business is what this government considers most important you bet your ass business is what keeps this country going never forget it believe me mr president i dont intend to eight three minutes later after the president finished cursing gerrard his parents his wife his moviestar good looks and even his tennis abilities gerrard was finally allowed to leave the oval office again the secret service guards kept a stolid expression not simply because of professional detachment but as well because they sensed the political weather and realized that gerrard now had even less importance than when hed entered the presidents office or so gerrard concluded as he pulled a handkerchief from his suitcoat pocket and wiped his apparently clammy brow walking with equally apparent uncertain steps along the white house corridor presidential aides turned away attempting to conceal their embarrassment for him but clearly showing their relief that they werent considered expendable gerrard didnt care he had no pride what he did have was a mission and it struck him as ironic that the presidents last insult about his tennis abilities related directly to gerrards next appointment a tennis match at an extremely private washington club he took an elevator down to the white house garage and was driven in his limousine with two cars containing secret service agents one before and one behind him to a fashionable suburb there he entered a low sprawling glassandglintingmetal building that had won an architectural award three years ago even from the front the pockpockpock of volleyed tennis balls was audible gerrards driver and his secret service guards remained outside as he instructed they kept a discreet watch on the parking lot and the entrance to the building although they didnt maintain a maximum level of vigilance after all whod consider gerrard a sufficiently important target to want to harm him in the tennis clubs luxurious locker room he changed from his suit to a fashionable athletic top and designer shorts his fourhundreddollar tennis shoes were italian their leather handstitched a gift from a diplomat on one of gerrards so frequent goodwill missions his custommade racket constructed from spaceage materials and worth two thousand dollars had been a present from his wife he grabbed a monogrammed towel checked a mirror to make sure his moviestar hair was perfectly in place then strolled from the rear of the club and squinted in the smoggy sunlight facing eight chainlinkfenced courts seven of which were occupied in the eighth a lean tanned distinguishedlooking man of forty dressed in tennis clothes was waiting for him gerrard stepped through the courts open gate closed it and shook hands with the man how are you ken troubled and you alan the same i just had what the columnists would call a chewingout from the president gerrard massaged his right eye anything you couldnt handle as far as my ego goes no big deal but strategically ill tell you about it later i mean were supposed to be here to play tennis after all and to tell the truth i need to get rid of some stress again gerrard massaged his right eye whats wrong with nothing important the smogs so gritty it irritates my eyes if the itch gets any worse ill have a doctor give me some ointment but youre sure it wont interfere with your game ive been looking forward to beating you today the thing is id prefer to do it on even terms ken said no matter on even terms or not youd still have trouble beating me okay then challenge accepted serve with a smile ken walked to the opposite end of the court kens last name was madden and he was the deputy director of covert operations for the central intelligence agency he and gerrard had gone to yale together had both belonged to its influential secret society of skull and bones as well as yales tennis club and had kept in touch over the years their friendship was long and wellestablished no political commentators gave it much attention once a week since the present administration had come into power the two former fraternity members had made a habit of this game at least when gerrard was in town and not exiled by the president on yet another international goodwill mission the critical factor was that playing tennis was exactly what the media and the public expected gerrard to be doing and in so exclusive a setting where reporters and minor diplomats were refused admission the weekly game like so much about gerrard had become invisible as a rule gerrards and maddens skills were equal their matches won by a very close margin if madden was victorious one week gerrard would be victorious the next but today despite gerrards confident challenge the irritation in his right eye did impair his ability he lost the first set managed with difficulty to win the second but didnt have a chance in the third that was all they had time for gerrard bent over breathing heavily surprised by his exhaustion the smog he thought the damned smog sorry he reached the net shook hands with madden and toweled his sweaty face i apologize for the clumsy match ill try hard to be more challenging next week as he had repeatedly he rubbed his right weeping eye yeah since we started that eyes gotten worse its red now youd better do something about it maybe if i rinsed it with water why not madden shrugged give it a try at least the clubs got a reverseosmosis purification system otherwise the chemicals in the water would make your eye even worse they walked toward the side of the court while in the background other players continued their matches so tell me madden said they stood with their backs to the clubhouse taking care to block their conversation in case they were being monitored by directional microphones tell me about the president he plans to veto the cleanair bill madden shook his head dear lord the stubborn fool i guarantee i gave him my best arguments gerrard said but he just wouldnt budge according to him when the problem gets bad enough american businesses will suddenly come up with a miracle cure what a joke i didnt realize the president had a sense of humor even if it is unintentional madden said when the problem gets bad enough doesnt he realize that the problems bad enough already to him its like the mounting budget deficit let the next generation take care of it right now he says his primary obligation is to hold the country together gerrard toweled more sweat from his face madden sighed well its not as if we didnt expect him to react that way but we had to do the right thing we had to give him the chance despondent gerrard draped his towel around his neck however it gets worse oh the president feels betrayed hes confused in a panic he cant comprehend how the opposition swayed so many republican senators to switch party allegiance and vote for the bill hes so furious about their defection that he claims hes doing his damnedest using all his investigators to find out what made them do it we expected that as well political reflex madden said but i cant imagine many senators confessing they were blackmailed because after all the next obvious question would be why were they being blackmailed and i dont believe a senator would be stupid enough to destroy his or her career by confessing bribes kickbacks cocaine addiction adultery and a few other even more serious matters our people discovered insider stock trading hitandrun manslaughter while intoxicated one case of incest no those senators will keep their mouths shut theyre experienced better yet god bless them at the same time damn them theyre practical its a pity we couldnt find more senators with something to hide but on balance it kind of gives me faith in the system not everybodys got a deep dark secret even so if we had been able to scare just a few more senators the vote would have been in our favor and you wouldnt have had to compromise your position and break the tie by voting against the administration gerrard shrugged no problem i can tolerate the presidents contempt what is a problem is that after he vetoes the bill and after he sends it back to the senate well have to put pressure on more senators to gain the twothirds vote we need to override his veto wellmadden glanced around assessing the security of their position weve got the power weve got the influence all the same the votell be close in the meantime when you continue not to cooperate with the presidents policy yes that worries me gerrard said the president might restrict my activities even more he might put me on ice until he can choose another vice president when the next election comes up but its vital that i keep going on those goodwill missions i have to keep coordinating our efforts madden stared down at the concrete surface of the tennis court yes its vital he straightened regrettably he leaves us no choice but the group knew and they agreed that wed have to do it sooner or later and now gerrard said itll have to be sooner without question the president showed the nation not to mention the world how brave he was when he went to that antidrug conference in colombia last year cynical journalists were taking bets on when and how the cocaine lords would have him assassinated but the president survived i consider it miraculous and now hes overconfident next week hes flying to peru for yet another drugcontrol conference im not clairvoyant but i think that this one time i can definitely predict the future the president wont be coming back alive at least a week from tomorrow well have a new president a more enlightened one i hope im worthy of the responsibility gerrard said well as youre aware from your frequent goodwill trips youll have a great deal of help from our counterparts yes by sending me on those trips the president was his own worst enemy madden stared again toward the concrete surface of the tennis court something else unfortunately madden frowned whats wrong we may have a security breach madden said despite his tan gerrard paled what kind how serious why didnt you tell me before we might have to postpone i dont think thatll be necessary not yet although if we have to we will postpone next weeks plan of course i didnt want to trouble you until now because i thought the matter had been taken care of however it wasnt you need to be informed in case you can use your authority to help us what kind of security breach gerrard insisted i told you last week that our search team had finally found the defector i remember gerrard said impatiently and i also remember that you assured me hed been eliminated in the appropriate manner he was then the defector met a woman madden said the friendship was brief and recent to all appearance casual our search team didnt consider it important until the woman showed unusual interest in the defector after his death she went to the police and somehow managed to identify the charred body with information she supplied an nypd missing persons detective was able to locate the defectors apartment and take the woman there as soon as she left the apartment she delivered photographs to a shop that specializes in quick development naturally the surveillance team wondered what was in the photos they attempted but werent able to obtain them curious they decided to search the defectors apartment you mean they hadnt already gerrard flinched they admit the mistake in their defense the defector had assumed such deep cover that it didnt seem likely hed risk keeping anything from his former life youre saying he did in his bedroom maddens jaw hardened the surveillance team found an altar gerrard gasped they destroyed it madden said more important they took the statue but that still leaves the woman and the photographs correct last night a team tried to solve that problem tried they failed in the meantime shed spoken with brian hamilton and hamilton whats he got to do with he died in a freeway accident last night his connection with the woman i havent told you the worst part the womans name theresa drake tess not remington drakes daughter she went to alexandria last evening to use her late fathers influence with the government in an effort to learn about the defector at her request brian hamilton was on his way to the fbi director but our team managed to stop him we killed brian hamilton gerrard jerked his head back and the team did its best to kill the woman as well the fire at her mothers house perhaps you heard about it tess drake escaped we dont know where she is but theres no doubt that she threatens us were using every resource to find and stop her thats why im briefing you granted you have plenty to be concerned about as it is but you did know her father yes in fact i knew him well then its possible shell try to contact you and ask for help ah gerrard said now i understand it might not come to that we have a plan that we think might lead us to the woman how it involves the detective she went to for help there isnt time to explain madden looked around noticing a team of players waiting to take their turn on the court weve been here too long we need to leave before we attract attention assuming an emergency doesnt prevent it ill see you here next week god bless and god bless you by all means let me know at once if the woman gerrard nodded somberly so did madden they left the court assumed their public personalities made a few pleasant comments to the waiting players and entered the back of the clubhouse your eye looks worse madden said yes id better do something about it gerrard stepped into the shower area relieved to find that the room was empty he approached a mirror studied his bloodshot eye and tenderly removed a contact lens preparing to rinse the eye with water to all appearance his irises were a photogenic blue but without the contact lens which he needed not to correct his vision but because the lenss blue provided a disguise the color of gerrards right iris now was gray nine a woman phoned for me but you didnt get her number craig glared at tony in the missing persons office at one police plaza he was out of breath from having rushed into the building i told you hey she hung up before i could ask i couldnt even get her name for all you know she might not be tess drake might not isnt good enough i have to know do me a favor will you stop shouting it gives me a headache and why dont you just tell me whats going on a gravelly voice interrupted good idea thats what id like to know they swung toward the open door to a private office where captain mallory a bulky man in his forties peered angrily over glasses pushed low on his nose he had his jacket off his shirtsleeves rolled up the last i heard you worked in this department he stalked toward craig so id appreciate it and im sure the chief the mayor and the taxpayers would appreciate it if you showed up on time mallorys voice became more crusty in fact if you showed up at all for a couple of days this week i havent had the faintest idea in hell what youve been doing or where youve been whats this about the alexandria police department their homicide division called to find out if someone was impersonating a new york city detective you last night they had several murders down there rich a highsociety district what do you know about them craig swallowed stared and slowly sank toward a chair despite his cough he murmured i wish i hadnt given up smoking it wouldnt matter you cant smoke here anyhow im waiting craig whats going on craig hesitated on tuesday he struggled to order his thoughts a woman came to see me for the next ten minutes craig explained about the morgue carl schurz park joseph martins apartment he concluded with tesss sudden trip to alexandria and the news hed heard on the radio captain mallory made a sour face correct me if im wrong the sign on the door says missing persons right as soon as the corpse was identified it wasnt our responsibility anymore the job belonged to homicide so why the hell were you still involved i did turn it over to homicide craig said i kept them informed you havent answered my question why were you still because of the woman craig felt his cheeks turn red his voice dropped what about her mallory insisted she got to me what are you saying its personal not anymore as far as im concerned this is official i didnt want to stop seeing her youre telling me you fell in love with her i yeah i guess thats what happened thats right yeah i fell in love with her and all this happened since tuesday jesus she sure must be goodlooking mallory raised his hands in exasperation craig when you were at the police academy do you remember one of the rules your instructors kept pounding into your brain dont get involved with the customers it always leads to a foulup it causes mistakes it gets very messy hey you think i had a choice its not like i told myself why dont i do something stupid and fall in love with this woman it happened all of a sudden i couldnt help what i was feeling mallory slumped against a desk and shook his head brother brother brother okay so weve got a problem fine he straightened so well fix it the first thing is you phone alexandria homicide and tell them everything you know craig stared no i dont think so what im not sure getting in touch with them is a good idea not yet at least i gave you an order look if shes alive and tony took a call a while ago that makes me think she is shes on the run shes being hunted if we tell alexandria homicide and they start looking for her whoever wants to kill her will monitor the police radios the moment they find out where she is theyll do their damnedest to get to her before the squad cars do stop thinking like her boy friend craig and act like a cop she needs protection for gods sake i am thinking like a cop you know as well as i do no matter how hard the alexandria policy try they cant guarantee her safety anymore than we could if someone wants to kill you bad enough and what happened last night proves how determined these people are nothing can stop them but you think you can stop them mallory said what i think i can do is bring her in quietly safely john wayne to the rescue give me a break craig said whatevers going on its not like anything ive ever come across these people are vicious theyre organized theyre determined and they love to play with fire i dont know why they want to kill her maybe something theyre afraid she knows but theyve proven theyll take down as many people as they have to in order to get at her the moment she comes out of hiding if she asks the alexandria police for help and word gets around which its bound to shes dead i think tess has figured that much already it explains why she decided to avoid the police youre theorizing no otherwise alexandria homicide wouldnt have called you wondering what i know that they dont know okay mallory debated that makes sense but youve still got to talk to them this isnt just a matter of one department cooperating with another youve got to explain what you thinks going on otherwise youre concealing information about multiple felonies and you know what happens to people who do that youre not a bad guy all things considered but that doesnt mean i like you enough to visit you in prison pick up that phone no wait please just give me a few more minutes what are you hoping that shell call you right then maybe i will have something to tell the alexandria police she trusts me so maybe we can figure out a way to bring her in safely the phone rang on tonys desk before craig could stand and get to it tony picked it up missing persons just a minute tony extended the phone toward craig its her craig asked no alexandria homicide craig froze at once another phone rang and this time captain mallory picked it up missing persons yeah you bet right away craig glanced from one phone to the other in bewilderment better take it mallory said its a woman and the way she says your name its like shes in trouble and she needs help from god craig lunged for the phone ten tess is that you at the sound of craigs voice tess felt her knees weaken jesus at last after having nervously backed the sleek black porsche from the spacious garage next to mrs caudills mansion shed felt naked with fear her right hand had trembled as shed changed gears driving from the secluded expensive neighborhood shed passed few cars but that had only made those few cars more suspicious there was too great a chance that the killers would have left a sentry in the area repeatedly shed checked her rearview mirror no one seemed to be following her but when she left the exclusive neighborhood and increased speed onto a crowded fourlane thoroughfare next to which laundromats quickfood restaurants and video stores blighted the area she realized that in the dense traffic she wouldnt be able to tell if a car pursued her worse her own car costly and ostentatious was a liability in her youth shed overheard her fathers conversations on the telephone just make sure he once had said whatever car they use it cant be fancy it has to blend well this car certainly didnt blend passing drivers in nonluxurious vehicles assessed the porsche with envy damn she thought and clutched the purse beside her the pistol within it for reassurance when she saw the telephone booth at the edge of the crowded parking lot of a shopping mall she braked to a stop beside the booth hurried from the car fumbled a credit card from her wallet grabbed the receiver and again phoned craigs office yes she breathed its me i tried to call you earlier i thought that might have been you thank god youre alive i was so afraid they burned they killed my mother i know tess im sorry you must be when i see you ill try to i cant make the pain go away but ill do my best to share it whats important now is that you werent killed as well not yet but theyll keep hunting me im terrified that im being followed what am i going to do whoevers after me will watch the local police station i cant go there and if i phone the police im afraid the killers will tune in to police broadcasts i need help listen dont panic tess i promise ill make sure youre protected where are you i hear traffic in the background i dont i on the outskirts of alexandria im in a phone booth near a shopping mall christ you cant stay there craig coughed is there any place you can hide until i get to alexandria she trembled and tried to think tess i cant involve my former friends they might get killed i thought of a movie theater but with so many people around in the dark i wouldnt feel safe maybe the library maybe a museum but theyre so public i wouldnt feel safe there either just a minute i have to put you on hold dont hang up ill be right back no wait tess its important stay right there she heard a click then the line was silent except for the longdistance static her hands shook hurry please furtive she stared around at the crowded parking lot at ominous strangers getting out of cars two men stood next to a van and squinted in her direction tess shoved her hand in her purse grasping the pistol the two men rounded the van about to flank her but unexpectedly changed direction and walked toward the shopping mall tess exhaled realizing that theyd simply been admiring the porsche craig hurry at once his voice was back on the line tess what have you been doing her voice quavered look im sorry i didnt think that would take so long i needed some information ill be on a trump shuttle thats supposed to land at washington national airport at twoohseven how did you get to that shopping mall have you got a car yes what kind i need to recognize it a porsche nineeleven black i have to give you credit even if youre scared you travel in class craig spare me the humor im only trying to keep up your spirits okay if its business you want pay attention theres a marriott hotel in crystal city near the airport as soon as i arrive ill grab a taxi and watch for your car at the hotels entrance at the latest i ought to be there by twothirty but thatll be three hours from now ive already figured that drive to washington take a tour of the capitol building with so many guards there no one would dare try to get at you just be careful when you leave and return to your car be careful since last night being careful is all ive been trying to do well try even harder and in the meantime ill contact the alexandria police ill tell them whats going on no if this gets on their radio tess youve got to trust me ill talk to their chief ill make sure he keeps a lid on this i wont tell him where you are or where were going to meet all i want is to organize a team to take you to a place thats secure there isnt such a place believe me there is a house a hotel room a farm whatever wherever i guarantee youll be smothered with guards just keep control please a few more hours and thisll be over no youre wrong i dont theyll always be waiting theyll never give up this wont ever end it will if we can find out why they want to kill you once their secrets out whatever it is they wont have a reason to stop you from talking if we can find out what theyre so afraid i know if if if im telling you keep control but it doesnt stop just with me tess said im not the only one in danger i dont understand nobody else is wrong dont forget craig you were with me you heard me talk about joseph you went with me to josephs apartment you saw what was in his bedroom if the killers followed both of us to protect their secret they might come after you craig didnt answer for a moment so let the sons of bitches try he coughed again the marriott near the airport twothirty drive past it until you see me ill recognize your car you make me feel this isnt the time to be evasive confident ill be as clever as my father ill be there eleven she hung up the phone studied the strangers in the parking lot felt vulnerable and hurried to get into the porsche drive to washington craig had said take a tour of the capitol building but the idea of being in so public a place even in the presence of guards made her nervous there had to be a less dangerous alternative as she drove from the shopping mall tess checked her rearview mirror to see if she was being followed several cars left behind her with a deep breath she again touched her purse feeling the reassuring bulk of the pistol inside abruptly the pistol made her recall the men shed killed last night and the memory sickened her but anger and fear were stronger she hadnt counted how many times shed fired in this mornings confusion shed failed to remove the pistols magazine to see how many rounds were left her father would definitely not have approved the gun might be empty for all she knew ive got to be able to defend myself a quick glance toward the side of the road made her notice a cluster of stores one store in particular caught her attention she steered sharply toward it parked in front and hurriedly entered the building slowing when she closed the door doing her best to look calm yes maam the muscular sportinggoods clerk asked behind the counter he cast his eyes up and down assessing her face and figure smiling almost leering with approval how can i help you i need two boxes of ammunition for a sigsauer nine millimeter pistol you must have plans for some heavy shooting he made the remark sound suggestive the instructor in my targetpractice course insists that we buy our own ammunition well i can promise if you were in my class id give you the ammunition and the lessons for free the clerk raised his eyebrows in that case i guess its too bad youre not in my class tess said the clerk was too absorbed by her braless breasts beneath her thin blouse to detect her muted irony while he turned his back to get the two boxes of ammunition tess reached in her purse to pull out her wallet taking care that the clerk wouldnt see the handgun in the process her fingers brushed the packet of photographs as if shed been jolted by an exposed electrical wire she remembered that craig had insisted last night that she have copies made and fedexed to his office but everything was different now she didnt have time to obey craigs orders and for damned sure she wouldnt feel safe waiting for the copies to be developed she had to keep moving would you mind have you got an envelope she asked the clerk can i buy a stamp from you id really appreciate it for such a pretty lady why not thanks ill make a point of coming back believe me youd be welcome theres a range past that door we could do some what you might call private shooting tess struggled to tolerate his banter her mind in a turmoil and i bet your aims on target never had complaints give me a break tess inwardly screamed she managed not to cringe paid for the ammunition then took the envelope and the stamp the negatives she thought ill mail craig the negatives at least theyll be protected at once the thought of the photographs and the vivid recollection of the grotesque sculpture in josephs bedroom made tesss stomach burn with the forceful realization of where she had to go next it certainly wasnt the capitol building twelve craig slammed down the phone captain mallory startled by the furious determination on craigs face jerked up his arms well now ive heard everything a lieutenant giving orders to a police chief hey it worked didnt it the alexandria departments cooperating if you want to call it that even over here i heard him shouting when he gets his hands on you tell me about it what did you expect i didnt have a choice i couldnt i didnt dare give him specifics about my rendezvous with tess the killers are too well organized if even one patrol car talks about the marriott hotel on its radio and if their transmissions are being monitored tessll be shot when she arrives but apparently you got the alexandria chief to prepare a safe house i have to admit im impressed theres just one problem craig only one i see so many i yeah a problem i havent given you permission to leave you dont run this division youre way beyond your authority i told you im going even if i suspend you do what you have to fire me for all i care you stubborn i dont have time to argue all i do have time for is to grab a taxi and get to laguardia before that plane takes off in noonhour traffic lots of luck finding a cab then ill take a patrol car no what wrong you wont take a patrol car dont get in my tony will hell drive you to the airport craig blinked in surprise did you just say get moving craig watch your ass and if the alexandria chief gives you trouble tell him to phone me i cant believe i dont know how to thank me by getting back here alive by doing some work for a change tony if traffics really lousy use the siren thirteen as the patrol car squealed from one police plaza two men watched intensely from a perfect duplicate of a telephonecompany van parked down the street each had a ring in his pocket a gleaming ruby overlaid with a golden insignia of an intersecting sword and cross in the vans front seat the first man a stern surveillance expert compared the blurred passing faces in the cruiser to a photograph in his hand i think its him you think we have to be sure in the back the second man continued to monitor earphones i am sure but you said you think and thats not good enough i wish wed been able to put a tap on the phones in the missing persons office wait im getting something the second man adjusted his earphones my my the police dispatchers telling all patrol cars to run interference and make sure that cruiser its numbers match reaches laguardia in time for a one oclock trump shuttle to washington national airport is that good enough for you yeah the technician said definitely good enough make the call the man in the front seat picked up a cellular phone and pressed numbers the catcher has left the plate we think hes so upset about his girl friends health that he needs to see her in the washington ballpark he gave the details of the flight on the phone the chameleons voice responded but what about the opposition so far no show maybe they dont want to play right now not possible not when were in the finals you can bet their teams in the area keep checking for talent scouts well check the washington ballpark but dont forget the opposite team has a habit of showing up when we least expect them fourteen heart pounding tess scrambled into the porsche outside the sportinggoods shop and peered urgently around afraid that a car would suddenly park beside her that men would lunge out shooting she yanked the handgun from her purse maintaining sufficient presence of mind to keep the weapon low out of sight from anyone outside the car frantic she pressed the button that released the pistols magazine and discovered that there were only two rounds left in the magazine plus one in the firing chamber jesus quickly she jerked the cardboard lid off one of the boxes of ammunition shed bought and shoved fourteen more rounds into the magazine filling it in theory the weapon held only sixteen rounds but with the round that was already in the firing chamber one up the spout her father had liked to call it the handguns capacity now was seventeen the moment tess slid the magazine back into the pistols handle snapping it into place she felt as if a tight band around her chest had been relaxed at least now shed be able to defend herself she hoped ihave to get out of here she crammed the handgun into her purse shoved the boxes of ammunition under the drivers seat twisted the ignition key stomped the accelerator and urged the porsche into a break in traffic on the busy thoroughfare the envelope while in the sportinggoods store tess had printed an address on the envelope licked the stamp that the clerk had sold her and stuck the stamp on to the envelope now as she drove she fumbled with one hand to remove the packet of photographs from her purse open the flap and slide the negatives into the envelope ahead to the right tess felt her breathing quicken when she saw a postoffice truck at a dropbox outside a minimall she swerved off the road braked quickly beside the truck licked and sealed the envelope then leaned out the porsches window handing the envelope to the mailman as he carried a bulging bag from the dropbox toward the truck late delivery tess managed a smile i hope you dont mind makes no difference to me love your car thanks how does it handle watch tess rammed the gearshift into first tromped the gas pedal and squealed away but she wasnt showing off if anyone was following her she wanted to get away from the postman as fast as possible she hoped desperately that no one had seen her hand over the envelope too many deaths already too much grief she prayed that she hadnt put the postmans life in danger as well back on the road veering in and out of traffic trying to make it difficult for anyone to keep up with her tess drove as quickly as she dared without the risk of being stopped by the police for violating the speed limit her destination was washington as craig had advised but not the capitol building no way not anymore she had a better idea not a safer one but it was definitely more important more critical the statue that grotesque repulsive statue her life was threatened because she knew about the damned thing she had to find out what it meant and there was only one person she could think of who might be able to tell her fifteen slumped in the back seat of his limousine en route from the tennis club to his office the vice president brooded about the woman that the deputy director for cia covert operations had warned him about tess drake why did it have to be her who threatened him during his friendship with her late father alan gerrard had frequently met tess when she was a teenaged gangly sensuous tomboy her lean athletic body combined with her trim perky breasts and short blond saucy hair had appealed to him not in a sexual way of course not at all despite the presidents assumption that gerrard like many politicians took advantage of fund raisers to have sex with politically important groupies the truth was that gerrard through stern discipline had trained himself to repress his sexual urges gerrard was married yes and his wife was beautiful photogenic often featured in the top magazines but his wife upheld his pure rigid values and during their twentyyear marriage in the thousands of nights that theyd shared the same bed as companions as helpmates as soul mates theyd engaged in sex a total of only three times and during those three ritualistic occasions theyd permitted themselves to experience the base pleasures of the flesh strictly for the purpose of producing children no gerrards attraction to tess had not at all been carnal on the contrary hed merely admired her as a fine example of a blossoming healthy young woman a perfect example of the human species and now it deeply troubled him that she of all people given her biological perfection had become a threat and would have to be killed his distress did not prevent him however from dearly hoping that tess would be silenced as immediately as could be arranged in the back seat the phone buzzed gerrard straightened and hurriedly picked up the phone only a few people had this number and no one called it unless the matter was important perhaps the message related to tess perhaps shed already been found and silenced one moment sir a womans voice said the president is calling gerrard subdued his disappointment with amazing promptness clifford garths voice growled pack your bags youre taking another trip gerrard made a pretense of sighing as he replied to the man whose funeral hed attend as the newly appointed president ten days from now what is it this time a fund raiser in idaho any excuse to get me out of town no overseas spains president just died from a heart attack ive already sent my condolences youll be our official representative at the funeral funerals gerrard thought apparently ill be going to a lot of them he regretted the deaths no matter how much they were necessary if thats what you want right you just keep thinking like that garth growled you do everything i want and we might even get along i doubt it though with an expletive the president broke the connection pensive gerrard set down the cellular phone he wasnt totally surprised by the news of the spanish presidents death the media had reported that the mans health had not been good lately however to be sure the spanish presidents dwindling condition had been encouraged and in that respect the only true surprise was that the politicians death had occurred much sooner than the schedule gerrard had been told about indicated spain the country was fascinating like england it had a parliamentary monarchy if the king died his oldest child would take his place and his next oldest child after that or perhaps his wife or his nearest cousin or there was no way to control the succession but the spanish parliament was another matter its president chosen by the congress of deputies could be eliminated and replaced by another official and that official carefully placed elected by the pressure of blackmailing various members of the spanish congress of deputies would be sympathetic to gerrards concerns after all they were relatives admittedly distant but neither time nor separation could mute their bond each of them and many others who shared gerrards spirit and mission would soon fulfill their common destiny spain how appropriate gerrard thought sixteen eric chatham director of the fbi walked somberly up a slope past brilliant white tombstones in arlington national cemetery trim in his forties his face lined with weariness from the responsibilities of his profession he turned to study the cluster of smogveiled trees at the bottom of the hill in the distance even more veiled with smog the white marble obelisk of the washington monument towered chatham tried to remember the last time hed seen the monument totally unobscured with concern he watched a car stop on a lane a distance from where his own was parked kenneth madden deputy director of covert operations for the cia got out of the cars back seat left his bodyguards and proceeded up the hill to join him the two men assessed each other although in theory the fbi and the cia had different mandates and jurisdictions in practice those mandates and jurisdictions often blurred sometimes making the two organizations rivals for madden to visit chatham at his office or vice versa would have been sufficiently unusual that reporters might have taken notice similarly they couldnt have met at a restaurant or a comparable public place where their joint presence would not only have attracted attention but their conversation could easily have been overheard a phone call was the simplest solution and indeed madden had called but only to explain that he had something delicate to discuss and they ought to do it in person arlington cemetery had been acceptable few people would notice them here thanks for agreeing to meet me on such short notice madden said especially during lunch hour chatham shrugged its hardly a sacrifice i dont have much of an appetite today i know what you mean my own stomachs sour because of what happened to brian hamilton madden nodded mournfully it was quite a shock he surveyed the grave stones i realized only after we agreed to meet here that well be back on monday for the funeral i wasnt aware that you and brian were close chatham said not as close as the two of you but i thought of him as a friend at least as much as most people in this town can be a friend to anyone else we sometimes worked together in matters related to the national security council the deputy director of cia covert operations didnt elaborate and the fbi director knew that it would be a breach of professional ethics for him to do so what did you want to see me about chatham asked madden hesitated another tragedy occurred last night the fire and the deaths at melinda drakes house chatham inwardly stiffened but showed no reaction yes the widow of remington drake i agree another tragedy i tried to phone melinda drakes daughter in new york to express my condolences i couldnt reach her but the editor at the magazine where she works told me that theresa tess decided to fly down and visit her mother in alexandria last night im afraid that whoever set fire to the house and killed her mother i cant imagine why may have tried to kill tess as well but so far the fire investigators havent found her body in the wreckage that makes me suspect that tess escaped if so shes apparently in hiding too afraid to surface perhaps the fbi director said the assumptions reasonable but whats your interest in this matter do you know tess did you know her father madden shook his head tess not at all but her father by all means in the old days i often briefed him on hazardous conditions in various countries where he was going to negotiate for the state department and when he died the way he died the way those bastards tortured him well i wish hed been one of my operatives i despise what happened to him but god bless him he didnt talk he was a hero and his daughter for his sake deserves the full protection of the government the fbi director squinted protection of be specific i got a call this morning madden gestured from alan gerrard hey whatever your opinion of the vice president i listen and you would too when he gives an order he and remington drake were as close as you are were to brian hamilton gerrard wants every pertinent government agency to do what they can to help her that means you and me the bureau and the agency i have trouble with this is a domestic issue chatham said it doesnt come under your jurisdiction no argument im just telling you what the vice president said and in fact thats why im here because this is a domestic issue at least so far as i can tell although the agencys checking further i dont want to cause more rivalry between us the balls in your court what the vice president would appreciate is for you to make a call to the alexandria police if tess drake surfaces and gets in touch with them the vp would be grateful he emphasized that word grateful if you instructed the local police to turn the matter over to you and then to contact the vice presidents office as well as mine just in case in the meantime we do discover that this is more than a domestic matter chatham scowled assessing the deputy director from the cia he wasnt used to sharing information with the agency at the same time his friendship with brian hamilton insisted he was sorely determined to find out if the death of his friend had truly been an accident he phoned me last night chatham said who brian he insisted on coming to my home i expected him around eleven oclock he told me he needed a personal favor he said it related to remington drake his widow and his daughter madden who seemed to have a perpetual tan turned gray youre telling me that brians death and what happened at melinda drakes house might be related i dont know but i certainly intend to find out tell the vice president ill cooperate ill talk to the alexandria police chief ill make arrangements to take over and relay information i guarantee the vice president will appreciate appreciate fuck him i dont care what he appreciates all i care about is brian remington drakes widow and his daughter so do i eric so do i but since brians dead and remington drakes wife we have to concentrate on the living on tess for our friends we need to do our best to protect her chatham grimaced lord help me whats wrong you have my word chatham said but i have to tell you i dont like working this close with the agency relax its one time only and the goals worth the compromise thats exactly what weve got a compromise one time only for now this time madden said extending his hand chatham hesitated reluctantly he shook with him ill be in touch and i know youll do your usual best tense they separated each passing brilliant white grave stones down the slope toward his car after madden nodded to his bodyguards and his chauffeur he paused turned and stared back toward the cemetery although his group had a primary plan for finding tess drake maddens experience in cia covert operations had taught him always to have a backup plan and now that plan too was in motion he came close to smiling but triumph fought with melancholy madden regretted that brian hamilton would be buried here on monday a necessary sacrifice even so he didnt regret at all that ten days from now thered be another funeral here for the president and that alan gerrard would assume control seventeen trembling tess braked the porsche to a stop outside a wellmaintained victorian house near georgetown grabbed her purse with its reassuring pistol and hurried up the steps to the wide porch pressing the doorbell no one answered she rang the bell again still no answer nervous she wasnt surprised at least not exactly the man who lived here her former art professor at georgetown university was renowned for spending his summer vacation in his back yard tending caring for whispering to his magnificent collection of lilies but that had been in the old days tess remembered with painful nostalgia after all she hadnt seen her beloved professor since shed graduated six years ago professor harding had been old even then perhaps hed retired or perhaps hed gone to europe to study the art he so worshipped and the enthusiasm for which he so ably communicated in his courses all tess knew was that hed treated his students as if they were part of his family hed welcomed them to his home at sunset amid the glorious lilies in his garden hed offered them sherry but not too much he didnt want to cloud their judgment and described the glories of velazquez goya and picasso spanish professor harding had always been partial to the genius of spanish art the only competition for hardings admiration had been tess stepped from the porch and rounded the side of the house proceeding toward the back yard after so many years she hadnt remembered professor hardings phone number and in any case shed felt too panicked too exposed too threatened to stop at a phone booth and get his number from information needing somewhere to go shed decided to come here directly and take the chance he was home there was no alternative she had to know but as she reached the back yard her immediate fears were subdued she felt a warm flush of love surge through her chest at the sight of professor harding much older distressingly infirm as he straightened painfully from examining a waisthigh lily stalk the back yard was glorious with the flowers everywhere except for a maze of narrow paths that allowed visitors to stroll in admiration the garden was filled with abundant myriad trumpetshaped resplendent manycolored tributes to gods generosity tess faltered amid the beauty she clutched her purse and the weight of its pistol reminding herself of how far shed come not necessarily forward since leaving georgetown university how she wished she was back there professor harding turned and noticed her yes trembling he fought to maintain his balance youve come to see my flowers as usual theyre wonderful youre very kind professor harding used a cane and hobbled toward her to my regret there once was a time your regret the poisonous air the equally poisonous rain eight years ago i was here tess said i remember the lilies were professor harding wrinkled alarmingly aged sank toward a redwood bench his white hair was thin and wispy his skin slack dark with liver spots what you see is nothing a mockery there once was a time when nature was in control the lilies used to be sohe stared toward his cane and trembled next year he trembled increasingly i wont subject them to this poison next year ill let them rest in peace but their bulbs will be safely stored and perhaps one day grow flowers again if the planet is ever purified tess glanced defensively backward clutching the outline of her handgun in her purse then approaching but do i know you professor harding asked he steadied his wirerimmed glasses and squinted in concentration why its tess can it actually be you of course tess drake tess smiled her tear ducts aching im so pleased you havent forgotten how could i possibly forget your beauty filled my classroom tess blushed now youre the one whos being kind she sat beside him on the redwood bench and gently hugged him in fact if im not mistaken you were in many of my classes each year you took a course the professors voice sounded like wind through dead leaves i loved hearing you talk about art ah but more important you loved the art itself it showed in your eyes professor harding squinted harder as if at something far away mind you in honesty you werent my best student mostly bs im afraid but by all means you were certainly my most enthusiastic student the professors thin wrinkled lips formed a smile of affection and its so good of you to come back you know many students promised they would after they graduated and all his smile faded but as i learned to expect yes they never did tess felt a tightness in her throat well here i am late i regret as you always came late for class the old man chuckled just a few minutes i wasnt distracted but it seems you couldnt resist a grand entrance tess echoed the old mans chuckle really i wasnt trying to make a grand entrance its just that i couldnt manage to get out of bed on time well my dear when youre my age youll find that you wake up at dawn the professors frail voice faded and often earlier much earlier he cleared his throat their conversation faltered even so tess found that the silence was comfortable soothing she admired the lilies how i wish i could stay here forever she thought how i wish that my world wasnt falling to pieces professor can we talk about art for a while my pleasure as youre aware apart from my lilies ive always enjoyed a discussion about a basrelief statue id like to show you a picture of it apprehensive tess withdrew the packet of photographs from her purse taking care to conceal the handgun but why youre so somber professor harding narrowed his white sparse eyebrows have you lost your enthusiasm for the subject not for the subject tess said but as far as this goes she showed him the photograph of the statue this is another matter professor harding scowled creating more wrinkles on his forehead he pushed up his glasses then raised the photograph toward them yes i can see why youre disturbed he shifted the picture forward then backward and with each motion shook his head such a brutal image and the style so rough so crude its certainly not something i care for certainly not velazquez but what can you tell me about it tess held her breath im sorry tess youll have to be more specific what exactly do you need to know whats your interest in this where did you find it tess debated how much to tell him the less the old man knew the better if the killers found out that shed come here ignorance and infirmity might be the difference that saved professor hardings life a friend of mine had it in his bedroom that doesnt say much for his taste his bedroom this doesnt belong even in a tool shed i agree but have you any idea who might have sculpted it or why or what it means are there any sculptors you know or youve heard of who might have done it dear me no i can see why youre confused you think this sculpture might relate to a contemporary school of i dont know what id call them neoprimitives or avantgarde classicists professor forgive me im still not a very good student what you just said youve lost me ill try to be more enlightening this photograph its difficult to tell from the image but the sculpture seems to be in perfect condition distinct lines no missing sections no chips no cracks no sign of weathering i still dont pay attention pretend youre taking notes believe me im trying the object its craft its execution are recent very distinct but the image itself is professor harding hesitated old very old this is a copy tess of a sculpture from as long ago as oh id guess two thousand years two thousand years tess gaped an approximation its not my specialty im sorry to say anything before the sixteen hundreds is outside my expertise tess slumped then theres no way you can help me understand what it means did i say that please i merely admitted my own limitations what you need is a classical scholar with training in archaeology tess glanced at her watch halfpast twelve craig would be at laguardia by now hed soon be flying to washington she had to meet him at twothirty time she didnt have much time a classical scholar with tess breathed where on earth am i going to find young lady im disappointed have you forgotten the marvelous woman im married to shes the brains of the family not me and until five years ago she belonged to the classics department at georgetown university come professor harding leaned on his cane and stood from the redwood bench he wavered for a moment priscillas been taking a nap but its time i woke her it really isnt good if she misses lunch her diabetes you know perhaps youd care for a bite to eat professor i dont mean to be rude im really not hungry and please oh god i hate this im in a hurry this is important terribly urgent i need to know about that statue well professor harding studied her how mysterious you make it seem good i can use some stimulation the old man shuffled unsteadily along a path the fragrance of his lilies tainted by smog but if its that urgent if you dont mind the familiarity youd better put your arm around me so i can walk a little faster i confess im curious so lets wake priscilla and stimulate her lets find out what that odious image means eighteen kennedy international airport the pan am from paris arrived on time at among the four hundred and fifty passengers six men whod sat separately in business class were careful to leave the jet at intervals and with equal care took different taxis into new york they were all wellbuilt in their thirties each wore a nondescript suit and carried a briefcase as well as an under seat bag none had checked luggage their features were common ordinary average their only other shared characteristic was that while theyd been pleasant to the flight attendants their polite remarks had seemed to require effort as if each man had urgent business that preoccupied him their eyes communicated the gravity of their concerns distant pensive cold in manhattan at diverse locations each man got out of his taxi walked several blocks took a subway at random got off a few stops later hired another taxi and arrived several minutes apart on avenues west of the museum of natural history after assessing the traffic parked cars and pedestrians in the neighborhood each approached a brownstone on west eightyfifth street and rang the doorbell a matronly woman opened the door blocking the narrow entrance i dont believe weve met may the lord be with you and with your spirit deo gratias indeed the woman waited however a sign is required absolutely id feel threatened if you didnt ask the last man to arrive reached into his suitcoat pocket and showed her a ring the ring had a gleaming ruby the impressive stone was embossed with the golden insignia of an intersecting cross and sword deo gratias the woman repeated only then did the woman open the door all the way stepping backward bowing her head respectfully allowing the visitor to enter in an alcove to the left of the door a grim intense man in a kevlar bulletresistant vest lowered an uzi submachine gun equipped with a silencer the woman closed the door did you have a good flight it didnt crash the others arrived not long ago the visitor merely nodded then followed the woman up narrow stairs to the second floor he entered a bedroom where the five other members of his team had already changed into unobtrusive clothes and now were taking apart and reassembling pistols laid out on the bed the weapons austrian clock mm semiautomatics were made of sturdy polymer plastic their only metal the steel of the barrel and the firing mechanism lightweight dependable their main advantage was that metal detectors often failed to register them and when disassembled the pistols frequently werent noticed on airport xray machines your street clothes are in the bureau the woman said thank you sister your flight was long you must be tired not at all hungry hardly my purpose gives me energy ill be downstairs if you need anything you will have to hurry however the schedule has been increased you have tickets for a three oclock flight to washington national airport the bait is in motion im pleased to hear that sister and the enemy have the vermin taken the bait not yet they will however his voice became an ominous whisper i have no doubt thank you he guided her from the bedroom thank you sister thank you he shut the door the matronly woman gripped the banister proceeded hesitantly down the stairs then paused before the guard at the entrance they make me shiver yes the haggard man with the uzi said once before i worked with enforcers for a day afterward my marrow still felt frozen nineteen tess waited squirming impatiently on a chair at professor hardings kitchen table the spacious room in back of the victorian house was clean and uncluttered painted blue a large window provided a magnificent panorama of the thousands of glorious manycolored lilies but she was too preoccupied to pay attention to them some time ago too long professor harding had left her here while hed gone upstairs to wake his wife tess kept glancing nervously toward her watch it was five after one she fidgeted unable to control her anxiety she stood and paced locked the back door abruptly sat down again and continued fidgeting hurry craigs plane would be in the air by now he expected her at the marriott hotel near washington national airport in less than ninety minutes i wont be able to stay here much longer but i cant just leave ive got to know at once she exhaled hearing muffled footsteps on a staircase at the front of the house the next thing she heard murmured voices the footsteps shuffled along a corridor approaching the kitchen tess bolted to her feet as professor harding escorted his wife into view but at the sight of the woman tess felt her stomach turn cold no so much time ive wasted so much priscilla harding looked even more infirm than her husband she was tiny thin and stoopshouldered her wispy white hair was mussed from her nap her face wrinkled pale and slack like her husband she needed a cane they clung to each other professor tess said trying not to insult their dignity by revealing her alarm if only youd told me id have been more than happy to go upstairs with you and help bring your wife downstairs no need the old man smiled priscilla and i have managed to get along without help for several years you wouldnt want to spoil us would you however i appreciate your consideration here let me tess hurried around the table gently gripped priscilla harding and helped her to sit good the professor said breathing with difficulty our little exercise is over how do you feel priscilla the woman didnt answer tess was alarmed by the lack of vitality in her eyes my god she isnt alert enough to she cant possibly answer my questions professor harding seemed to read tesss mind dont worry my wifes merely groggy from her nap it takes priscilla a while to regain her energy but shell be fine as soon as the old man opened the refrigerators gleaming door and took out a syringe after swabbing his wifes arm with rubbing alcohol he injected her with what tess assumed was insulin given the professors earlier remarks about his wifes diabetes there the professor said he returned to the refrigerator and removed a plate of fruit cheese and meat that was covered with plasticwrap i hope youre hungry my dear he set the plate on the table took off the plasticwrap then shifted unsteadily toward a counter to slice some french bread i suggest you start with those sections of orange you need to maintain your blood sugar priscilla hardings voice was thicktongued surprisingly deep im sick of yes thats right youre sick but in a few moments after youve had something to eat youll feel much better by the way that navel orange is excellent i recommend you try it with a weary glance toward her husband priscilla harding obeyed her arthritisgnarled fingers raising a slice of the orange to her mouth as she chewed methodically she shifted her gaze puzzled now toward tess again professor harding seemed to read thoughts forgive my rudeness dear this attractive young woman is a former student of mine but of course her beauty can never compare to yours you bullshitter my dear tsk tsk and in front of company priscilla harding scrunched her wrinkled eyes in amusement her name is tess drake the professor said and she has a favor to ask she needs to make use of your scholarly abilities priscilla hardings eyes rose much less vapid my scholarly yes its a bit of a mystery we hope you can solve the professor said i tried to assist my former student but im afraid her questions are beyond me theyre not at all related to my field of expertise her eyes gaining brightness priscilla ate another section of orange the sliced beef is very good try it the professor said what kind of favor priscilla asked and continued eating her eyes even more alert what sort of questions shed like you to examine a photograph the photograph shows or so i believe a modern reproduction of an ancient basrelief statue a rather brutal one i should add so prepare yourself but when you feel your strength coming back if youd richard the older you get the more you avoid the point a photograph a modern replica of an ancient sculpture sounds fascinating by all means ill be happy to look at it tess felt tense from the pressure of speeding time mrs harding thank you please theres no need to be formal im priscilla she munched on a piece of bread wiped her hands on a napkin and reached toward tess the photograph tess took it from her purse and slid it across the table mrs harding pulled glasses from a pocket in her dress and put them on peering down at the photograph she kept chewing the bread stopped chewing and swallowed hard her jaws assumed a grim expression she didnt speak for several moments what is it tess thought hurry priscilla nodded grimly ive seen something like this a very similar image several times before muscles rigid tess leaned forward but why do you look so troubled the knife the blood the serpent the dog i know theyre repulsive but and the scorpion dont forget the scorpion priscilla said attacking the testicles of the dying bull and dont forget the flame bearers flanking the victim one torch pointing upward the other down the old woman shook her wrinkled face and the raven i thought it was an owl my god no an owl dont be absurd its a raven but what do they mean tess feared her control was about to collapse priscilla trembled ignoring tess she directed her attention toward her husband richard do you remember our summer in spain in seventy three of course the professor said with fondness our twentyfifth anniversary now dont get maudlin on me richard the nature of that occasion however much i enjoyed it is irrelevant what is whats important is that while you stayed in madrid and haunted the prado museum yes velazquez goya and but not picasso i dont believe picassos guernica was exhibited then please tess leaned farther forward her voice urgent the statue id seen the prado many times priscilla said and im a classicist not an art historian so i sent richard on his merry way while i went on my own way after all i like to believe im a liberated woman you are dear how often youve proven that the professor shrugged with good nature and nibbled on some cheese so i went to ancient spanish sites whose artifacts intrigued me priscillas eyes became misted with favorite memories merida pamplona pamplona isnt that where hemingway with apologies tess pretend youre in my husbands classroom be polite and dont interrupt im sorry mrs and dont make polite noises i told you im not mrs not when youre my guest priscilla concentrated how i loved those in ruins outside each village i found etchings engravings and in a small museum outside pamplona i found a statue like this weathered broken not clean with perfect engravings not distinct in its outline but it was the same as this photograph and later in my fascinating travels while i waited for richard to exhaust his compulsion for velazquez and goya apparently im like richard im so old i fail to get to the point but what did you find tess tried not to raise her voice more statues priscilla shrugged further engravings of the same image as this not frequent in situ they were always hidden always in caves or grottoes images of mithras tess jerked her head up what or who the hell is mithras priscilla mustered energy are you religious tess sort of i was raised a roman catholic in my youth i believed in college i lapsed but lately yes i suppose you could say im religious roman catholic ah priscilla bit her lip her tone despondent then im afraid your religion has what competition what are you talking about ancient competition stronger than you can imagine it comes from the start of everything the origins of civilization the roots of history what the hell yes hell priscillas face drooped at once haggard again heaven and hell thats what mithras is all about look i cant take much more of this tess said you dont know what ive been through my mothers dead people are dying all around me im supposed to be at national airport to meet someone in an hour and im scared no thats an understatement im terrified about mithras i sympathize priscilla clutched tesss hand if this photograph if this statues related to your problems you have reason to be terrified why mithras priscilla said is the oldest god i know of and his counterparts the most evil and unforgiving this is tess shuddered crazy what are you she clenched her fists her fingernails gouging her palms talking about priscilla stood with difficulty stop glancing at your watch theres a great deal to teach you and warn you about and prayers to be said a serpent a scorpion and a dog one western germany south of cologne the rhine headlights glimmered through fog along a seldom traveled lane years earlier between the great wars it had often been used by fishermen whod laid their bicycles behind bushes removed tackle kits from baskets on the front of their bikes assembled fishing rods and followed wellworn paths down the thickly treed slope to favorite spots on the river children once had scampered along the bank on warm summer days mothers had spread blankets on sweet lush grass and opened picnic baskets the aroma of sausage cheese and freshly baked bread drifting out bottles of wine had cooled in shallows but that had been long ago and in western germany while at the same time in washington tess listened with horror to what professor hardings wife explained to her this wasnt day and even if it had been no one came to fish here anymore few people came here for any reason and certainly not to picnic for the stench from the river would have fouled the aroma of freshly baked bread and the poison in the water had long since been absorbed into the soil blighting the grass and trees and the sludge that choked the current had long since killed the fish on this evening however the passengers in the car that jolted along the lane did think about picnics and fishing although their thoughts were bitter making the men frown with anger at glimpses of leafless trees and stunted bushes in the fog all except one passenger who frowned for another reason indeed he trembled you wont get away with this my guests are expecting me ill be missed youre referring to the reception at your estate the driver asked then shrugged well your guests will just have to do without you herr schmidt yes another man said too bad theyll simply have to wait and wait and wait a third man said what do you want from me the silverhaired leanfaced tuxedoclad man demanded ransom if thats what you want what are we doing here let me use a phone ill arrange my assistant will deliver any amount you demand no police of course not herr schmidt i can guarantee the driver said later maybe but not for now therell be no police what are you talking about justice a man with a pistol said the pistol was wedged against the silverhaired mans neck examples another man said here from the back seat he leaned forward telling the driver when i was a child this was my favorite path the river was so how i loved this place now look at it look at how ugly its become here yes stop right here why not the driver shrugged again its as good a place as any for what schmidt demanded voice trembling i already told you the man with the pistol said justice the driver stopped among skeletal bushes at the side of the lane dead branches snapping he turned off the headlights and stepped from the car while his companions opened other doors and dragged schmidt struggling into the fogshrouded wasteland the sleeve of his tuxedo tore on a barkless tree limb ah too bad the man with the gun said what a terrible shame yes a pity the driver said they reached a bluff and forced schmidt down the sterile slope at once the sickening fumes from the river enveloped them making them cough in terror schmidt resisted so fiercely that the men were forced to drag him downward his patentleather shoes scraping over rocks where the zigzagging barely detectable path became steep one of the men used a shielded flashlight to guide their way at the oppressive grassless bottom the light revealed the foam along the rivers edge the slime on the water and the sludge that thickened the current the area smelled like a cesspool for sewage too fouled the water what a damnable i used to be able to swim here the man with the gun said and the fish the fish tasted so pure and delicious their meat was so white so flaky at the same time solid the way my mother dipped them in milk she used to cover them with biscuit crumbs and fish schmidt whimpered what are you talking about fish why does that for gods sake if your purpose was to scare me youve succeeded i admit it im terrified his control collapsing the silverhaired prisoner began to sob how much do you want anything please i swear on my mothers grave ill pay you anything yes the driver said thats right anything youll pay name it just tell me how much its yours mein gott how much you still dont understand how much you must pay another man said you did this did what did i this with disgust the fourth man gestured toward the noxious desecration of the river you not alone but you share the responsibility with schmidt voided his bowels with the other greedy industrialists who demanded profits no matter the cost to nature billionaires who wouldnt miss the comparative few millions it would have taken to keep the river pure and the sky free of poison millions schmidt shook his head frenzied but my board of directors my shareholders would have millions yes but only at the start the man with the gun corrected a onetime only expense but that was years behind us now the cost would be greater much much greater and the rivers so poisoned so dead that it might take decades before its revived if ever if the dead can ever be brought back to life scowling the man with the flashlight stepped closer pay attention herr schmidt we didnt choose this place merely because we used to love to come here when we were children not at all we chose it because the grim man gestured even in the fog the lights that silhouetted the numerous huge factories upriver were gloomily visible indeed the fog was not completely natural smoke containing toxic pollutants added to it nearby a drainage pipe from one of the factories spewed nostrilflaring chemicals into the water the foam accumulated we chose this site because we wanted you to witness your crimes the driver said sins the man with the gun corrected sins schmidt cowered youre all lunatics youre and sins must be punished the man with the flashlight said as you indicated youre eager to pay and will pay the fourth man said schmidt pressed his hands together im begging you he sank to his knees i promise i swear my engineers will redesign the waste system in my factories the cost doesnt matter ill stop the chemicals from reaching the river ill speak to the other manufacturers in the area ill convince them to prevent the discharge from too late the man with the gun said from pouring into the river schmidt sobbed ill do anything if youll just too late the man with the gun repeated an example has to be made many examples the man with the flashlight said justice the driver said im thirsty the fourth man said the walk down that slope made my mouth dry mine too the man with the gun said and herr schmidt i imagine that your mouth feels especially dry from fear i believe you deserve a drink the fourth man removed a plastic container from a knapsack on his shoulder repelled but determined contracting his chest visibly holding his breath he stooped toward the noxious fumes that rose from the waters edge and scooped foam slime sludge and sewage into the container schmidt screamed no i cant drink from dont make me swallow that stuff ll kill the man with the flashlight nodded kill you indeed as it killed the fish as it killed the river as it killed the trees and the bushes and the grass as its slowly killing the people in the cities who depend on the river for water however much the cities try to purify that water regrettably an example has to be made the man with the gun said many examples if its any consolation take heart you wont be alone i promise soon many of your fellow sinners will join you many lessons need to be taught until the ultimate lesson is finally learned before its too late that is if its not too late already the man with the container of sludge pressed it against schmidts mouth schmidt wailed then clamped his lips tightly together jerking his face away now now the man with the container said you must take your medicine the other men held him firmly accept your fate the man with the flashlight said taste the product of your success schmidt struggled desperate yanking his arms straining to escape the rigid hands of his captors destiny mein herr we must all confront it the man with the container raised it again toward schmidts clamped jaws again schmidt jerked his face away well the man with the flashlight said disappointed that leaves us no choice with relentless strength he tugged schmidt downward the other men helped him using their knees along with their hands to force schmidt onto his back straining to keep their prisoners thrashing face pointed toward the murky fogandsmokeclogged sky the man with the container knelt and pressed a nerve behind schmidts ear schmidt screamed reflexively at once another man rammed a funnel into schmidts mouth clamped it firmly between his lips watched the container being raised toward the funnel and nodded as foam slime sludge and sewage were poured down schmidts throat perhaps in one of your future lives youll be more responsible the man said that is if were successful if anyone has a chance for a future life later after the corpse was discovered and the autopsy was performed the medical examiner debated about the primary cause of death in theory schmidt had drowned but the chemicals that filled his stomach and swelled his lungs were so toxic that before he drowned his vital organs might easily have failed from instant shock two craig you were with me you heard me talk about joseph you saw what was in his bedroom if the killers followed both of us to protect their secret they might come after you remembering tesss warning when shed phoned him at one police plaza craig squirmed against his seatbelt and directed his troubled eyes toward the smog beyond the window of the trump shuttle about to land at washington national airport come after me he thought until tess had mentioned it that possibility hadnt occurred to him he recalled and had meant what hed replied let the sons of bitches try the truth was he would welcome a confrontation anything to stop the madness anything to save keep running tess he thought be clever dont take chances soon ill be there soon prior to leaving one police plaza hed phoned the security personnel at laguardias trump shuttle terminal to alert them that he was a police officer whod be bringing credentials that hed be prepared to fill out all the forms and comply with all the complex procedures including an interview with the pilot that allowed him to carry his handgun aboard this plane on the way to the airport he and tony had done their best to make sure they werent being followed although in the chaos of noonhour traffic that was almost impossible now concealing his gesture from the passenger next to him craig kept his right hand beneath his suitcoat his fingers clutched around the caliber smith and wesson revolvers handle not that it mattered if there was trouble it certainly wouldnt happen during the flight certainly not shooting too dangerous the bullets would rupture the fuselage and depressurize the cabin at the risk of causing the jet to crash all the same the feel of the weapon gave him confidence as casually as his nerves would allow craig glanced around no passenger seemed to care about him good he thought just keep control he strained to reassure himself youve taken every precaution you could think of youre in the flow now youre committed youve got to go with whatever happens still he hadnt noticed the grayeyed man ten seats behind him who appeared to nap thus hiding the color of his eyes and who under various names had bought a ticket for every trump shuttle flight from laguardia to washington national airport since the woman had disappeared last night not that the grayeyed man had intended to use all the tickets instead hed waited unobtrusively watching the terminals entrance in case the womans detectivefriend arrived one of his counterparts had kept a similar watch at the pan am shuttle terminal about to give up hope abruptly seeing his target get out of a police car the grayeyed man pulse speeding had strolled inside the terminal passed through the security checkpoint presented the ticket for his flight and boarded the jet before the detective did in that way he followed the detective paradoxically from in front and almost surely prevented the target from suspecting he had company yes the woman had escaped last night but thanks to the onboard phone which the grayeyed man had asked a flight attendant to bring to him hed been able using guarded expressions to alert additional members of his team that the detective was en route to washington national airport presumably to rendezvous with the quarry the woman she was dangerous she knew too much so it had to be assumed did the determined detective who showed far too great an interest in the woman when the two came together they would both be silenced the photographs would be destroyed and the covenant would at last again be protected three evil priscilla harding said the stark word caught tesss attention she priscilla and professor harding had moved from the kitchen to a downstairs study in the victorian house near georgetown in washington now that priscillas insulin had taken effect and her blood sugar was stabilized by the lunch shed eaten the elderly woman seemed ten years younger her eyes looked vital she spoke with strength although her cadence was slow and deliberate as if by habit she used the lecture style shed perfected during her many years as a professor but tess didnt have time for a lecture she needed to know about the statue right now hurry she had to meet craig priscilla noticed her impatience and sighed stop looking at your watch sit down tess and listen carefully this isnt something i can condense and if youre in as much trouble as you described your life might very well depend on an absolute understanding of what im about to tell you tess hesitated suddenly tired she obeyed sinking toward a leather chair i apologize i know youre trying to help ill do my best to if this is complicated id better not in fact i dont dare try to rush you tell it your way nonetheless tess felt her muscles ache from tension as she watched priscilla take several thick books from a shelf and place them on a desk evil tess said you mentioned evil priscilla nodded evil is the central dilemma in christian theology im afraid i what does that have to do with think about it how do you reconcile the existence of evil with the traditional concept of a benign allloving christian god tess frowned in rigid confusion really i still dont understand priscilla raised an arthritisswollen wrinkled hand just listen we know that evil exists we encounter it every day we hear about it on the radio on tv we read about it in the newspapers moral evil in the form of crime cruelty and corruption physical evil in the form of disease cancer muscular dystrophy multiple sclerosis priscillas voice dropped diabetes she hesitated then sat despondently behind the desk brooding priscilla continued of course some deny the existence of even the concept of evil they claim that crime is merely the result of poverty inadequate parental guidance or lack of education et cetera they place both the causes and the blame on society or in the case of someone so repugnant as a serial killer they attribute the killers violence to insanity they also refuse to consider that diseases have theological implications to them cancer is a biological accident or the consequence of substances in the environment but theyre not wrong tess said i work for a magazine that tries to protect the environment carcinogenic substances are all around us absolutely professor harding said the poisons are evident my lilies struggle to blossom theyre not half as brilliant as they used to be richard if you wouldnt mind priscilla tapped her gnarled fingers on the desk im suddenly terribly thirsty id appreciate very much if you went to the kitchen and brewed us some tea why of course professor harding grasped his cane any special preference whatever you choose im sure will be fine in that case i think lemon lift dear excellent as professor harding hobbled from the study priscilla narrowed her wrinklerimmed eyes toward tess alone the two women faced each other carcinogenic substances and socalled biological accidents are exactly my point priscilla said physical evil theological evil tess shook her head but how can cancer have anything to do with theology pay attention according to christianity a generous loving god made the universe thats right tess said so what kind of god would add crime and cancer to that universe the existence of those evils makes the traditional christian god seem not at all benign in fact it makes him seem cruel perverse inconsistent thats why the devil was invented devil tess thought what the this is getting lucifer priscilla said the topmost angel in heaven the superstar of gods deputies but the lightbearer as hes sometimes called wasnt satisfied with being a deputy no that powerful angel wanted even more power he wanted gods power he thought he could compete but when he tried god pushed him down oh so far down to the depths to the newly created fires of hell and god changed his name from lucifer to satan and satan in his fury vowed to corrupt gods perfect universe to introduce evil into the world but that part of christianity always seemed to me a myth tess said to you however the majority of christians especially fundamentalists believe and base their lives on that conception god and the fallen angel satan is a convenient explanation for the spreading evil around us you sound like the nun who gave me catechism lessons every sunday after mass do i priscilla wrinkled her already wrinkled brow well im about to teach you a different catechism and it might undermine your faith as well i regret to say it might terrify you tess straightened her muscles cramping as she listened with greater tension the trouble with using satan as an explanation for the existence of evil priscilla said is that god can still be accused of perversity because god tolerates satans evil because he allows satan to oppress us with crime and disease tess shook her head once again the nun who taught me catechism used to say that god decided to condone satans evil rather than destroy him in order to test us if we overcome the temptation of evil and accept the hardship of disease we can gain a higher place in heaven now tess really do you honestly believe that well maybe not but at least its what i was taught and this is what i was taught priscillas tone became bitter richard and i had a son jeremy our only child when he was ten he died in excruciating pain from bone cancer thirty years later i still wake from nightmares of how much he suffered that sweet dear perfect boy never harmed anyone he didnt have the faintest idea of what sin was priscillas eyes misted nonetheless god allowed that vicious disease to torture my son if satan is responsible for evil god is responsible for satan and ultimately for what happened to jeremy i still blame god for what happened to my the mist in priscillas eyes faded replaced by a hard determination so i come back to the question i asked you earlier how can a benign allloving god permit evil the christian attempt to provide an answer by inventing a fallen angel is not at all satisfactory priscilla scowled then continued however there is another myth that provides a more logical explanation for the existence of evil thousands of years before christ our ancestors believed in two gods a good one and a bad one coequal both of them fighting for control of the universe that version of satan wasnt a fallen angel but rather a divinity the virtuous god was independent from and hence couldnt be held responsible for the evil god and the viciousness that the evil god inflicted on us the earliest evidence we have for this belief comes from the fourth millennium bc in ancient iraq specifically in the valley between the tigris and euphrates rivers thats where tradition tells us the garden of eden was supposed to have existed the serpent in the garden tess said exactly but that serpent wasnt a fallen angel he was a symbol of an evil god in combat with a virtuous one tess couldnt help staring toward a clock on the wall craig hed be landing at washington national airport soon he expected her to meet him dont look at the clock tess look at me keep paying attention priscilla braced her shoulders with professorial sternness the concept of opposite but equally powerful gods spread throughout the mideast by the time it showed up in ancient iran around one thousand bc the virtuous god had a name mithras tess jerked straighter mithras you mentioned him before yes the figure in the basrelief sculpture priscilla said now do you understand why i had to go into so much detail the figure killing the bull is not a man hes a god various later religions zoroastrianism and manichaeism also used the concept of equal competing good and evil gods but essentially those gods are versions of mithras and his evil counterpart were talking old tess very old thats what i meant when i said that mithras comes from the roots of history hes the most ancient notion of a god we have any specific knowledge of and its only by chance that professor harding interrupted supporting himself with his cane while he wheeled in a cart upon which a teapot cups and a plate of biscuits were arranged thank you richard im pleased to help dear its only by chance that what tess asked impatient for priscilla to continue milk dear professor harding asked just a little tess became more impatient barely able to restrain herself from telling priscilla to hurry while professor harding poured the tea priscilla pensively opened one of the books shed set on the desk leafed through it and found the page she wanted let me describe a religion to you when you enter its church you dip your hand in a holywater basin and make the sign of the cross on the altar you see a representation of the physical form of your god during the service you receive a communion of bread and wine you believe in baptism confirmation salvation through good works and life after death the physical form of your deity has his birthday on december twentyfifth and his rebirth occurs during the easter season professor harding wrapped each steaming teacup with a napkin and handed them to priscilla and tess catholicism he said yes that would be the logical assumption richard however with apologies youre wrong priscilla kept staring at tess its mithraism what tess set down the teacup and blinked in surprise but how can there be so many parallels you said that mithraism came long before christianity think about it priscilla lowered and peered over her glasses im sure the answer will occur to you the only explanation i can it doesnt seem possible christianity borrowed from mithraism so it appears priscilla said for the first three centuries after christ while christianity struggled to survive mithraism was a major force in the roman empire several roman emperors not only endorsed it but were members mithras is sometimes called the sun god and because of him sunday assumed sacred importance for the romans and eventually for western culture mithras is often pictured with a sun behind his head and that sun became the halo around the heads of major figures in christian art the cross by the way is an ancient symbol that represents the sun thus believers in mithras made the sign of the cross when they entered their church to worship the sun god priscilla turned the book and slid it toward tess heres a photograph of an ancient basrelief depicting a mithraic communion service notice that the pieces of communion bread have a cross etched into them before christianity tess felt offbalance but this is all my religious training everything i took for granted about catholicism i feel like im sinking i warned you priscilla raised her swollen fingers i told you that what i had to say might undermine your faith i tried to prepare you when i said it might be terrifying in more ways than one but ill get to that professor harding sipped from his teacup sighed in appreciation of the taste swallowed with pleasure and interrupted my dear yes richard when i came in you said it was only by chance that what was only by chance thats what i want to know tess said i meant priscilla narrowed her gaze it was only by chance that mithraism didnt assume the dominance in western culture that christianity now has as i mentioned in the first three centuries after christ several roman emperors pledged themselves to mithras but all of that changed with constantine in the year threetwelve just before constantine was about to send his army against his major enemy in the famous battle at the milvian bridge constantine had what he later described as a vision vision perhaps its another myth constantine peered toward the sky and claimed that he saw a cross of light imposed on the sun he interpreted this as a message from god and ordered his soldiers to paint similar crosses on their shields they entered and won the battle under the sign of the cross considering that the cross is an ancient symbol for the sun and that mithraism favored that symbol as a reference to its sun god historians arent clear why constantine seemed arbitrarily to decide that this cross referred to the crucifix the cross upon which christ had died priscilla settled back in any event constantine converted to christianity and eventually made it the primary roman religion christians who until then had been tolerated at best when not spurned or thrown to the lions were quick to take advantage of their sudden influence their urgent priority was to stamp out the sect that rivaled them mithraic chapels were sought out and destroyed mithraic priests were killed their corpses chained to their altars to so desecrate the mithraic chapels that theyd never be used again the balance of history tilted and mithraism abruptly declined persecuted as heretics its few remaining followers went into hiding in small groups they performed their rites in secret but no matter how stringently they were hunted they managed to survive in fact to this day mithraism is practised in india priscilla sipped her tea gaining strength but in europe the last vestige of mithraism was eradicated during the middle ages in the thirteenth century the concept of two opposing equal gods one good and one evil surfaced again in a town in southwestern france called albi the catholic church referred to the name of the town and declared that this unexpected reappearance of mithraism was the albigensian heresy after all there could only be one god the papally authorized crusaders thousands of them converged on southwestern france and massacred anyone multitudeswhom they suspected of being a heretic eventually they forced the supposed disbelievers onto a mountain fortress montsegur there the crusaders waited until the heretics surrendered due to starvation and thirst the crusaders then herded the heretics into a wooden stockade set fire to it and watched while the heretics burned that was the last time more than seven hundred years ago that a version of mithraism raised its head in the western world but you dont look convinced tess said well priscilla debated a rumor persists that the night before the massacre a small group of determined heretics used ropes to descend from the mountain fortress taking with them a mysterious treasure ive sometimes wondered if pockets of the heretics might have survived remaining in hiding to the present day and the photograph of that sculpture makes me suspect im right its not as if you can walk into an art gallery that specializes in ancient artifacts and simply buy one of these objects off the shelf if any were available the price would be outrageous because as i told you most of the basrelief statues were destroyed after constantine converted to christianity the few that survived are museum pieces the best two i know of are in the louvre and in the british national museum but you saw similar statues in spain in nineteen seventythree tess said yes weathered engravings in grottoes outside merida and a badly broken basrelief in a small museum outside pamplona then to my great surprise a few sculptures hidden in isolated caves in the area thats what made me wonder if the heresy continued to survive surely the local villagers had explored those caves and knew about the statues theyd been left there hidden for a reason i thought and i took care to leave them exactly where id found them out of respect not to mention fear after all i didnt want to anger the local villagers by stealing a sacred part of their tradition and i did have the sense i was being watched as i left the caves you never told me that dear professor harding said well i havent always told you everything richard i didnt want to concern you ive had many adventures on my determined solitary journeys and if youd known you might have tried to stop me from going on other journeys but thats a separate matter my point is tess your photograph doesnt show an ancient statue its a painstaking modern recreation in marble someone went to a great deal of trouble and expense to have it made the question is why and tess insisted what the hell does it mean why would the ancients have considered it religious why is mithras slicing the throat of the bull four washington national airport craig waited tensely for the jet to reach the docking platform he unsnapped his seatbelt and lunged to his feet the instant the seatbeltwarning light was extinguished in a rush he squirmed past other passengers in the aisle anxious to leave the plane past the exit gate he hurried through the crowded terminal checking warily around him apprehensive about anyone who might show an interest in him outside the terminal he fidgeted forced to stand in a line with other travelers wanting taxis finally it was craigs turn as an empty cab stopped at the curb he scrambled into the back telling the driver the marriott hotel in crystal city sweating craig glanced repeatedly at his watch the taxi arrived at the hotel slightly ahead of schedule twotwentyfive about when craig had predicted to tess that hed reach the rendezvous site a uniformed doorman approached craig while he paid the driver and the taxi pulled away the doorman seemed puzzled that craig had no luggage are you checking in sir no im expecting someone the doorman frowned and stepped backward yes very good sir craig nervously scanned the busy highway watching for a black porsche the car wouldnt be hard to recognize anytime now tess would steer off the highway and stop before him craig would dart into the passenger seat theyd speed away sure anytime now craig coughed from the smog and began to pace he glanced at his watch twothirty two thirtyfive twoforty she must be having problems with traffic any minute now ill see her as solemn men with rings in their pockets watched from a replica of a ups truck in a parking lot across the street as grayeyed men stared with vicious resolve from the window of a restaurant farther along the street craigs muscles hardened two fortyfive he breathed heavily tess for gods sake what happened where the hell are you five you said you saw the sculpture in a bedroom of a friend priscilla asked tess hesitated again unsure how much to reveal for fear that the hardings would be in danger if the people hunting her found out that shed come here yes the statue was on a bookshelf from the rigid expression on your face its obvious something else troubles you tess made her decision urgency compelled her she had to know the bedroom what about it looked strange priscilla leaned suddenly forward how there werent any lamps the overhead bulb didnt work the floor was covered with candles and next to the statue on each side there were other candles candles of course and one pointed upward the other downward priscilla asked at once tess jerked her head back in surprise yes how did you know the photograph of the sculpture the torch bearers flanking mithras one torch is raised the other inverted tess i very much suspect that what you saw was a makeshift version of a mithraic altar what else havent you told me with a shiver tess relented completely prepared to tell priscilla everything rapidly she explained from the start a week ago wednesday could it have been only that recentlythe first time shed met joseph the gold cross pen shed dropped in the elevator joseph had studied the pen and murmured its name almost with reverence gold cross tess now knew what those words had meant to joseph the symbol for the sun god six near washington national airport the smog became thicker in the replica of the ups truck that stood in a parking lot across from the marriott hotel a man with a ring in his pocket spoke to a phone equipped with a scrambler to prevent anyone from overhearing his conversation no he just keeps pacing in front of the hotel every thirty seconds he checks his watch its obvious hes waiting for someone this has to be the rendezvous site anytime now the woman ought to arrive a voice on the other end of the line said but youre sure he doesnt know you followed him from the airport as certain as i can be the man in the truck said the moment the target left the plane and got into a taxi one of my operatives used a portable phone to warn me we were parked at the exit from the airport when we saw the cab that the bait had hired we pulled out ahead of him he went directly to the hotel we parked across the street and the enemy the voice on the other end demanded have you seen any evidence of the vermin not yet but we have to assume that they followed the detective just as we did if the womans as great a danger to them as we suspect they fear hes the only way for them to locate her keep watching keep searching for them were trying ive got another team patrolling the highway but this areas extremely congested unless you get up close to the vermin and happen to notice the color of their eyes we wont know for certain until the enemy makes its move wait a hold it what the voice on the other end said fiercely somethings happening in front of the hotel i dont understand the bait just seven craig kept pacing with greater tension he suddenly noticed movement to his right and spun apprehensive his hand beneath his suitcoat grasping his revolver he relaxed only slightly when he saw that the movement was the hotels thinlipped doorman walking toward him frowning harder dont tell me hes going to insist i check in or stop loitering outside the hotel craig quickly removed his hand from his weapon and reached toward a pocket inside his suitcoat ready to pull out his police id anything to appease the doorman but what the doorman said was so unexpected that craig restrained his gesture paralyzed with bewilderment is your name craig sir craig felt a chill yes but how did you know that sir the clerk at the checkin desk just received a phone call from a woman who to say the least is upset she demanded that someone hurry outside and see if a man was waiting she said if the mans name was craig she had to talk to him at once tess craig thought it had to be what had happened what was wrong the phone craig said where is it is she still on the line he hurried toward the hotels entrance yes sir the doorman said following briskly troubled she insisted that we not hang up craig pushed open the hotels front door lunging in his eyes struggled to adjust to the shadows after the smoggy sunlight the checkin desk was directly across from him hurrying toward it craig fumbled into one of his trouser pockets pulled out a tendollar bill and handed it toward the doorman thank you sir i appreciate your dont go far i might need your help ive got more money craig reached the desk my name is craig theres a call for definitely a clerk straightened picking up a phone extending it across the counter tess craigs hand cramped around the phone as he pressed it against his ear where are you what happened thank god you waited she said craig exhaled at the sound of her voice i was worried she said that you might have left no way i promised id wait answer my question what happened dont worry im safe at least as safe as i can be until you get here where craig i think ive found out whats been happening and it makes me even more terrified i dont have time to explain and this isnt something we can talk about on the phone write down this address distraught craig glanced toward the counter grabbed a pen and a pad and frantically printed the information she gave him its important tess said get here as fast as you can count on it craig tore off the sheet of paper shoved the phone toward the clerk and blurted thank you in distress he spun toward the doorman thrusting twenty dollars at him get me a taxi now eight in the parking lot across the street from the hotel the solemn man with a ring in his pocket straightened behind the steering wheel in the replica of the ups truck again he spoke into the cellular phone the bait i see him the detective hes outside the hotel again hes getting into a taxi on the other end of the phone the chameleon responded with equal intensity follow him alert the other unit remain in contact a team of enforcers is en route from laguardia the man behind the steering wheel felt his stomach cramp as he set down the phone enforcers he hadnt been told that this mission was considered so desperate he had the unnerving sense that events were out of control that brutal forces were converging that a terrible ultimate battle was about to begin obeying instructions he used a twoway radio to alert his other team then twisted the ignition key heard the engine rumble and glanced toward the rear of the truck there five men waited their expressions strained ignoring him rechecking their handguns the driver breathing rapidly stomped the accelerator and sped from the parking lot in pursuit of the taxi nine in the marriotts lobby a wellbuilt tanned expensively dressed man in his thirties stepped through the entrance and approached the checkin desk carrying a briefcase excuse me his manner was deferential toward the clerk his voice smooth but sounding concerned i wonder if you could help me i had an appointment to meet a man here but traffic delayed me unfortunately i dont see him anywhere he must have become impatient and left i wonder if is it possible did he leave a message his name was craig as a matter of fact sir a man by that name was here and indeed he was waiting for someone the clerk said a minute ago he received a phone call and left the wellbuilt man looked disappointed my boss to put it mildly wont be happy my promotions at stake i had important contracts for mr craig to sign i dont suppose you know where he went i regret to say no sir mr craig wrote directions on that pad and tore off the sheet of paper but he didnt mention where he was going on that pad you say thats correct sir the wellbuilt man studied the indentations that craigs strong printing had made on the page beneath the one hed torn off did you happen to overhear the name of the person he spoke to a woman her name was tess sir of course well i thank you for your trouble the man said giving the clerk twenty dollars thats really not necessary sir ah but it is the wellbuilt man tore off the next sheet on the pad feeling the indentations of craigs printing if you dont mind not at all sir very good as the wellbuilt man walked briskly from the lobby the clerk glanced with satisfaction at the twentydollar bill and thought with interest that in all his years of greeting guests it was seldom that hed met anyone who had gray eyes ten in a rush tess reentered the study thanks for letting me use the phone no need to thank us professor harding said the main thing is did you manage to contact the man you were supposed to meet tess nodded forcefully hell be here as quickly as he can ill feel a lot better when he does in the meantime she spun toward priscilla the statue you were about to explain what it meant keep talking why is mithras slicing the neck of the bull priscilla shoved her glasses higher onto her nose and studied the photograph i can understand why youre mystified like most depictions of rites sacred to various religions this object appears incomprehensible imagine an aborigine whos spent all his life on a small pacific island totally isolated with no experience of western customs imagine if he were brought to america and taken to a catholic church then imagine his reaction when he saw what hung behind the altar the statue of christ on the cross hands and feet pierced by nails head crowned with thorns side slit open would be an absolute horrifying mystery wait tess said after everything weve discussed youre telling me you dont know what the statue means on the contrary i do know what it means priscilla said what im getting at is that without a knowledge of the traditions and symbols of an unfamiliar religion you cant appreciate why a particular image is important to that religion but the moment the symbols are given meaning the image becomes perfectly clear to me this statue is as easy to interpret as an image of christs crucifixion lean closer toward the photograph examine the details i point out i suspect that soon youll realize how simple they are to interpret simple tess shook her head i really have trouble believing that just try to be patient priscilla placed her right index finger on the photograph why dont we start with the bull notice that the marble of the statue is white the bull is white priscilla said after his death hell become the moon logically you might expect that the bull would become the sun given that mithras is the sun god but theres a deeper logic the moon is a version of the sun at night it illuminates the darkness and in this case it represents the god of light in conflict with the opposite god the evil god the god of darkness okay tess said i see that logic but what i dont is why does the bull have to die did you ever read joseph campbell the masks of god primitive mythology in college then you ought to know that in almost every religion theres a sacrificial victim sometimes the god is the victim in christianity for example jesus dies to redeem the world but often the victim is a substitute for the god among the aztecs and mayans they frequently chose a maiden who gave up her life as a surrogate for a sacrifice to the god the most common method was to cut out her heart tess winced priscilla continued in the case of mithras the bull dies not only to become the moon but to give life to the earth the ritual execution probably happened during the vernal equinox the arrival of spring to regenerate the world its a traditionally sanctified time of the year most christians dont know it but thats the reason easter is so important in their religion when christ leaves the tomb just as the earth comes back to life and mithras too came back to life in the spring tess struggled to concentrate her forehead aching with intense frustration regeneration priscilla said out of death comes life thats why mithras slices the throat of the bull there has to be blood a great deal of blood the blood cascades toward the ground it nourishes the soil you can see grain sprouting from the ground near the bulls front knee many ancient religions required blood sometimes human sometimes animal to be sprinkled on the fields before the crops were planted but thats repulsive not if you believed its no more repulsive than the implications of communion in the catholic church swallowing bread and wine that symbolize the body and blood of christ to regenerate your soul okay tess said point granted although i never thought about it that way before but what about the dog in the statue why is the dog lunging toward the blood and why is the serpent with a tingle that swept from her feet to her head tess abruptly realized dear lord priscilla had been right everything was suddenly vividly clear the dog and the serpent what about them can you tell me priscillas eyes gleamed they represent evil the dog is trying to stop the blood from reaching the ground and fertilizing the soil the serpent wants to destroy the wheat and the scorpions evil too its attacking the bulls testicles the source of the bulls virility excellent im proud of you tess keep going can you tell me about the torch bearers the flame pointing upward signifies mithras the flame pointing downward represents his evil competition you must have been a brilliant student not according to your husband tess said professor harding set down his teacup what i said was you werent my best student but you were bright enough and certainly enthusiastic right now enthusiastic doesnt describe what im feeling im grieving for my mother im desperate im scared the raven priscilla tell me about the raven yes priscilla sighed the raven on the left from above the upraised torch on the side of good he watches the sacrifice you have to understand mithraism had seven stages of membership from beginners to priests and the first stage was called the raven as it happens the raven was also the sacred bird in their religion it was a messenger sent from heaven ordered to witness the ritual sacrifice to observe the renewal of the world the death of the bull the blood cascading toward the earth the return of spring the fertilization of the soil now i understand too well tess quivered its what ive devoted my life to mithras wants to save the planet and his evil counterpart wants to destroy it eleven lima peru charles gordon a short frail importerexporter slumped behind his desk although his office window overlooked the impressive rimac river he ignored the dismal view and did his best to concentrate on a catalogue of the various american products that hed tried with little success to sell to local merchants his gaudy bow tie and illfitting suit had attracted smirks from the local population when hed rented this office a month ago but his clothes were now an accepted tired joke that made him in effect invisible bored his only consolation was that lima was only seven miles from the pacific this close to the sea the temperature was moderate the drab city far enough from the towering mountains to the east that the air was breathable no highaltitude wheezing for him in that respect this assignment wasnt bad except that the operative who called himself charles gordon got tired of the charade involved in pretending to conduct a profitearning business he had a business all right but it wasnt importexport no his business was death and profit in the normal sense of the word had never been his motive as the brochure in his hands drooped the trilling bell on his fax machine made him jerk upright he quickly stood crossed toward a table on his left and watched a page unroll from the fax machine the message was from the philadelphia office of his american supplier notifying him that a shipment of laptop computers would soon be arriving the message gave the quantity the price and the date of shipment well finally charles gordon thought it didnt trouble him that so sensitive a message had been sent via his easily accessed telephone line after all his american supplier was to all appearance a legitimate corporation and the laptop computers would arrive as promised even if someone suspected that the message was in code no one could decipher its true meaning because the code had been chosen arbitrarily kenneth madden the cias deputy director of covert operations had explained it to gordon the evening before the operative had flown to peru the date of the shipment had nothing to do with the date of the mission the quantity and the price of the laptop computers were irrelevant what the message referred to was president garths imminent trip to peru for a drugcontrol conference the presidents intention was to attempt to convince the peruvian government to pay subsidies to farmers who switched to less lucrative crops than the easytogrow coca plants that local drug lords among the worlds major suppliers needed to make cocaine but the president would never reach the conference twelve tess hesitated in the study in the victorian mansion near georgetown a memory nagged at her subconsciousness in a flash it surfaced but what about the treasure priscilla frowned puzzled by tesss abrupt change of topic before i used the phone you mentioned a mysterious treasure tess said in southwestern france in the thirteenth century ah priscilla nodded yes when the catholic crusaders killed tens of thousands of heretics to eradicate a new version of mithraism you called it albigensianism tess said the last stronghold of the heretics was a mountain fortress montsegur priscilla squinted and you said that the night before the final massacre tess trembled a small group of heretics used ropes to descend from the mountain taking with them a mysterious treasure a rumor a persistent legend although as i mentioned it could have some basis in fact since mithraism survives in india it might have survived in europe as well a small group conducting its rites in secret to avoid the inquisition if so tess raised her voice in frustration what would the treasure have been priscilla shrugged the obvious answer is wealth of some sort gold precious gems indeed as recently as the second world war the nazis believed that such a treasure existed and was hidden in the area near montsegur hitler sent an archaeologist a team of engineers and an ss unit to search for it in the numerous caves in the region evidence of their excavations can still be found however the treasure was not at least no one ever indicated that a treasure had been discovered and surely given something so dramatic word would have spread then too another theory is that the treasure was the holy grail the chalice from christs last supper and still another theory claims that the treasure was a person that christ contrary to tradition married and had a son a descendant of whom was the leader of the albigensians those latter theories were made popular in a book called holy blood holy grail but those latter theories are nonsense of course because the albigensians had only a superficial resemblance to catholics they descended from a tradition much older than christianity one that happened to use rituals similar to those of christianity but that in fact was based on the theology opposing good and evil gods of mithraism the heretics would have had no respect for the socalled holy grail and they wouldnt have cared if christ had a son who established a bloodline no priscilla said whatever the treasure assuming it even existed it more than likely was the obvious wealth tess breathed with excitement although her excitement was tinged with fear i disagree priscilla adjusted her glasses confused oh i think there was a treasure not wealth at least not in the ordinary sense although it definitely was mysterious professor harding leaned forward propping his hands on his cane i confess youve made me curious what are you suggesting tess rubbed her forehead if the heretics feared that their religion was about to be destroyed if a small group managed to escape she darted her eyes toward priscilla then professor harding whats the one thing those heretics would have considered so important that they wouldnt have dared to leave without it professor harding frowned i still dont follow priscillas eyes however gleamed with fascination the treasure without which the heretics had no meaning tess said something so valuable that they couldnt allow it to be destroyed and equally important desecrated something mysterious in the deepest sense of the word something so sacred priscilla blurted absolutely you understand yes priscilla gestured emphatically toward the photograph the image of mithras that stood on their altar when constantine converted to christianity the christians destroyed the mithraic chapels for all the heretics at montsegur knew the scuplture they possessed might have been the only one in existence if they left it behind when the crusaders found it tess anticipated the crusaders would have smashed it to pieces the heretics had to protect the statue in order to protect their religion in imitation of priscillas earlier gesture tess jabbed a finger at the photograph that statue theres no weathering on its marble no cracks its in perfect condition a pristine replication of an ancient model to borrow your words someone went to a great deal of trouble and expense to reproduce that statue why it makes no sense unless i think i know the answer it terrifies me god i think that statues a copy of the one from montsegur but i dont think its the only copy and i dont think tess stared at priscilla weve been talking around this possibility all afternoon so why dont i say it outright my friend believed in mithraism there are others who believe as he did theyre the ones who killed my mother who killed brian hamilton and who tried to kill me to stop anyone from knowing about their existence fire priscilla interrupted what about it tess struggled to control her shaking you said your friend was killed with fire and then his apartment was set on fire and my mothers house was set on fire and brian hamilton died in flames in a freeway accident why is fire so it purifies it symbolizes divine energy out of the ashes comes life rebirth fire was sacred to mithraism the sun god when the torch is held upward it signifies good but how can all of this killing be good priscilla suddenly looked aged again im afraid there are two things i havent told you about mithraism apprehensive tess waited trembling first priscilla said followers of mithras particularly those in the albigensian sect the ones at montsegur believed in reincarnation to them death was not an ultimate end but merely a beginning of another life until finally after many lives their being was perfected and they went to heaven in that respect they believed in the theories of plato tess remembered that the collected dialogues of plato was one of the books in josephs bedroom keep going the point is priscilla said a follower of mithras was able to kill without guilt because he believed that he wasnt ending someones life but merely transforming it tess was appalled you said there were two things whats the second followers of mithras were used to killing they were trained to kill dont forget the statue the knife the blood roman soldiers converted en masse mithraism was a warrior cult by definition in their souls they believed that they were engaged in a cosmic struggle of good against evil the bastards tess said to defeat what they thought was evil theyd do anything im afraid thats true theyd kill anyone including my mother tess raged the sons of when i get the chance and im sure i will because im sure theyll come for me again theyll learn the hard way about the difference between good and evil thirteen as the taxi rounded a corner and proceeded along a street of wellmaintained centuryold houses near georgetown craig stiffened in the back seat seeing a black porsche parked ahead at the curb abruptly he leaned forward pointing urgently there he told the driver where that sportscar yeah the driver scanned the numbers on houses thats the address you want all right craig glanced behind him checking yet again to make sure he hadnt been followed there wasnt much traffic a few cars passed through an intersection back there a ups truck turned at the corner but headed in the opposite direction from where the taxi had gone halfway down the other block the truck stopped a uniformed driver got out carrying a box toward a house craig had seen several ups trucks on his way here they were as commonplace as federal express and post office trucks he had no way to tell if that particular truck had been tailing him indeed contrary to popular misconception craig knew that unless you had a team using various cars to help you or unless your opponent was clumsy it was almost impossible to spot motorized surveillance especially if your enemy also had a team and alternated vehicles well craig thought with growing unease as the taxi stopped behind the porsche ive done what i could i cant keep cruising around the city ive got to make a choice ive got to commit tess is waiting for me she needs my help nervous craig paid the driver and left the taxi while it drove away he studied the victorian house saw colorful highstalked flowers along the sides and wondered what on earth tess was doing here in a rush he approached the front steps fourteen sorry wrong address the solemn man with a ring in his pocket told the woman whose doorbell hed just pressed my mistake this package belongs down the block the woman had curlers in her hair and looked annoyed that shed been interrupted inside the house a tv gameshow host announced outstanding prizes his audience applauding really my apologies the man said he wore the brown uniform of a ups delivery man when he turned to carry the package back to his truck he heard the woman slam the door behind him at the truck he climbed behind the steering wheel and turned to the five men in back they had their handguns ready and ignored him their concentration focused toward the rear window and the taxi pulling away from the porsche parked in front of a house in the middle of the next block the tall rugged detective stood on the sidewalk for a moment then disappeared past trees and bushes approaching the house well this might be another false rendezvous but its my guess that the bait led us to the quarry the solemn man said and closed his door now all we have to do is wait for the vermin assuming they followed him as well but we didnt see any sign of them one of the men in the back said just as we were careful and hope that they didnt see any sign of us the man in front said we know however that their only chance to find the woman is to follow the detective in back someone murmured ill feel more confident when our other unit shows up the man in front nodded and even more confident when the enforcers arrive i called our man at the airport hell instruct them where weve gone another man in back asked how long will they take to their plane lands in half an hour the man in front said figure another twenty minutes after that weve got a car waiting to bring the enforcers in which case we just have to hope that the vermin dont make their move before wait a moment i see a car the gunmen stared out the rear window it isnt our other unit one of them breathed the man in front concentrated through the rear window he saw a blue toyota round the corner approaching a thirtyish man drove an attractive woman beside him do you think it might be they probably live in the neighborhood but if they are the vermin theyve made a mistake the man in front drew his pistol six against two theyre outnumbered the car passed the trucks back window no longer in sight as the solemn man turned toward his sideview mirror to watch the car continue forward he flinched the woman hurled a canister through his open window the canister hissed the car kept driving down the street no the solemn man screamed at once he shuddered and slumped invisible nerve gas filled the truck the men behind him scrambled to open the back door too late as the gas touched their skin they convulsed voided their bowels vomited and lay still fifteen but what about the photograph of the books tess demanded do their titles mean anything to priscilla removed a magnifying glass from a drawer in the desk and held it over the photograph eleanor of aquitaine the art of courtly love the one in spanish means the doves neck ring tess said i know its another treatise on courtly love eleventh century as i recall tess blinked in surprise you cant imagine the trouble i went through to learn that and you just hey its my specialty remember priscillas wrinkled lips formed a modest smile these titles are all related its just like with the sculpture once you understand the background everythings clear eleanor was the queen of france during the century before the fall of montsegur aquitaine where eleanor came from was in southwestern france she established and her daughter marie de france continued to maintain a royal court in that region tess nodded having learned that much when shed read the introduction to the doves neck ring the previous night at her mothers home just before the fire had with a shudder grieving she forced herself not to interrupt southwestern france priscilla emphasized where mithraism resurfaced in the form of the albigensian heresy shortly after eleanors death eleanor encouraged the notion of courtly love a strict set of rules that idealized the relationship between men and women physical union wasnt permitted until after a stringent code of overly polite behavior was obeyed the albigensians adapted courtly love for their own purposes to them after all the good that mithras fought for was spiritual the evil of the opposing god was physical belonging to the world and the flesh for example albigensians were vegetarians allowing only the purest of foods to enter their bodies my friend was a vegetarian tess felt startled of course and i imagine he didnt drink alcohol right tess said and he exercised rigorously yes he needed to deny and control his flesh priscilla said its what id expect from someone who believed in mithras but the albigensians also believed that sex was impure that carnal desires were one of the ways that the evil god tempted them so they abstained except for rare occasions allowing intercourse only for the exclusive purpose of conceiving children a necessary grudging surrender to the flesh otherwise their community would have dwindled and died with that rare exception in the place of sexual relations they substituted highly formal immensely polite social relations that they borrowed from the concept of courtly love my friend insisted that we could never be lovers never have sex tess said he claimed he had certain obligations he had to follow the most we could ever have was what he called a platonic relationship of course priscilla shrugged plato another of the books on the shelf in this photograph according to plato the physical world is insubstantial a higher level should be our goal you see how it all comes together but what about the doorbell rang tess had become so absorbed by the conversation that the sudden disturbance made her flinch at once she realized it must be priscilla jerked up her head anticipating i imagine thats your other friend the one you phoned from here a while ago the man who expected you to meet him near the airport tess stared toward the exit from the study god i hope priscilla professor harding i have to explain my friends a no need to explain professor harding said any friend of yours is welcome here but you have to understand hes not just a friend hes again the doorbell rang a policeman a detective from new yorks missing persons tess reached inside her canvas purse but maybe im wrong maybe its someone else what if its she withdrew the handgun from the purse priscilla and professor harding blanched at the sight of it grasping the trigger tess ordered hide in that closet dont make a sound if its them and they kill me if they come in here and take the photographs they might be satisfied they might not search the house they might not find the doorbell rang a third time i shouldnt have come here i hope i havent tess couldnt wait any longer pray she lunged from the study assumed the stance her father had taught her aimed her handgun down the hallway toward the front door and said a silent prayer of thanks when she saw craigs tense confused face through the window in the door as he pressed the bell yet again tess hurried along the hallway yanked the door open and tugged him inside thrusting her arms around him ive never been so glad to see anyone in my life with her left hand she slammed the door shut behind them leaned past him to lock it and hugged him even harder ouch craig said i hope that pistol isnt cocked youre pressing its handle against my back oh tess lowered the pistol im sorry i didnt mean to wary craig glanced at the pistol good it isnt cocked where did you get that do you know how to use it yes a very long story craig ive learned so much ive got so much to tell you and i want to hear it believe me craig hugged her in return ive been so damned worried about you i tess felt craigs reassuring arms around her she felt her breasts against his chest her nipples unexpectedly tingling the warmth surging through her was equally unexpected responding to an irresistible impulse she kissed him in the midst of fear the pleasure she received from craigs embrace was like shed been meant to be in his arms craigs lips against hers hers against his from the moment theyd met for now for always abruptly tess felt suffocated pushing away sliding her hands from craigs back around his broad shoulders toward his firm chest she peered upward straining to catch her breath she studied his strongboned hardedged features which suddenly struck her as being handsome and told herself screw love at first sight second sight is better it gives you a chance to think to get your priorities straight passion is fine but devotion and understanding are better this man whatever mistakes he made in his marriage never mind what happened before i met him is decent and kind he cares for me hes willing to risk his life to help me he doesnt just love me he likes me someone discreetly cleared a throat behind them turning tess saw priscilla and professor harding standing selfconsciously in the hallway near the door from the study im sorry for interrupting professor harding said but no need to feel sorry tess smiled and we dont have to worry i gathered that priscilla said her wrinkled eyes crinkling with amusement from the way you greeted him tess blushed this is my friend lieutenant craig his first names you know she told craig you never mentioned it to me but on your answering machine i heard its bill craig walked down the hallway extending his hand bill craig if youre friends of tess oh definitely tess said then im very pleased to meet you craig shook hands with them mr and mrs harding tess said theyre both professors please tess i told you no formalities priscilla gave her first name to craig and this is richard my husband and dont you dare refer to either of us as professor craig chuckled i can already see that were going to get along his expression sobered but priscilla richard we have things to discuss important things and times against us so why dont you bring me up to speed what are you doing here tess whats going on priscilla gestured come into the study and perhaps youd like some tea professor harding said richard for heavens sake the lieutenant came here to help tess not to be offered tea actually i could use a cup craig said my mouths dry from being on the plane they entered the study for the next fifteen minutes while craig politely sipped tea he listened impatiently to what tess and then priscilla and on occasion richard told him when they finished craig set down his teacup if i told this to my captain hed think you were to put it politely letting your imaginations get carried away but never mind i believe because i saw the statue and joseph martins dead and tess your mothers dead he shook his head in commiseration and brian hamiltons dead and youre in danger all because of something that happened more than seven hundred years ago priscilla said what else havent you talked about craig asked the titles of the books on the shelf in joseph martins bedroom priscilla said before you rang the doorbell i was about to explain that the consolation of philosophy a sixthcentury treatise written by an imprisoned roman nobleman describes the wheel of fortune craig shook his head confused an image for the ups and downs of success and failure the book analyses and condemns the physical values wealth power and fame by which people addicted to worldly success are tempted and ultimately disappointed because physical values are temporary and insubstantial its exactly the type of book that someone who believed in the spiritual values of mithras would find appealing okay craig frowned but why did joseph martin keep a copy of the bible that doesnt fit from what youve told me mithraism doesnt believe in christianity true priscilla said their theologies are different but both religions share similar rites and both reject worldly goals for joseph to read the bible would be comparable to a christian reading about zen buddhism for example because its mystical basis was different from but could be applied to his own religion anyway joseph didnt read the entire bible tess said he ripped out most of the pages except for the editors introduction and the sections written by john i dont understand why the preference for john priscilla raised her shoulders because johns sections in the bible most closely approximate the teachings of mithraism here she held her magnifying glass over a photograph that showed a page and a passage that joseph martin had underlined in one of johns epistles love not the world if any man love the world the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of the world is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust of it but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever does that sound familiar tess nodded soberly take away the reference to the father substitute mithras and it matches everything youve told me but theres something i dont understand craig said why the scofield edition of the bible is that significant oh very much priscilla said when ronald reagan was president most of americas foreign policy was based on scofields interpretation of the bible she studied another photograph heres an underlined section from scofields introduction the bible documents the beginning of human history and its end priscilla glanced up the climax of the bible johns book of revelations describes the end of the world ronald reagan believed that the end the apocalypse was about to occur that a cosmic battle between good and evil god and satan was about to take place remember all that business about the soviets being the evil empire reagan also believed that in the cosmic battle goodness would triumph i suspect thats why he encouraged confrontation with the soviets to begin armageddon with the total confidence that the united states in his opinion the only good would triumph madness craig said but also very much like mithraism provided you think of satan as an evil god and not a fallen angel priscilla said in that respect its not at all surprising that joseph martin kept an abbreviated version of this bible near his bedside keep going craig said the other books i saw on joseph martins shelf the millennium the last days of the planet earth priscilla set down the magnifying glass obviously joseph martin was obsessed by the impending year two thousand each millennium is a traditional time of crisis every thousand years a time of fear an apprehension that the world will disintegrate and this time professor harding said given the poisons that wither my lilies the prediction might not be wrong the last days of the planet earth i thank the lord ill be dead before that happens richard if you die before me ill never forgive you priscilla said craig despite his distress couldnt help smiling i wish my former marriage had been as good as yours we survive priscilla said yes craig said survival he put his hand on tesss shoulder electricity jumped making her tingle craig stood id better phone the alexandria police chief he and i will get you to a safe house tess richard and priscilla youll be out of this in no danger i hope tess said the nearest phone is in the kitchen professor harding pointed to the left down the hallway with fondness tess watched craig start to leave but at once craig hesitated and swung back frowning theres one thing i still dont understand nothing youve said explains it im really bugged by tess if joseph martin believed in mithras and if the people trying to kill you believe in mithras why did they kill him the study became silent no one was able to answer craig frowned harder i mean it just doesnt make sense why did they turn against one of their own shaking his head in confusion he continued from the study yes tess thought why did they hunt joseph down and set fire to him troubled by the question she watched craig enter the hallway sixteen and abruptly she frowned even harder than craig had because craig didnt pivot to the left toward the phone in the kitchen as hed been told instead he paused glanced sharply to the right and dove to the floor at the same time drawing his revolver no tess thought with a cringe she heard two muffled spits then the earstunning roar of craigs revolver once twice priscilla screamed craig surged from the floor scrambling down the corridor to his right despite the ringing in her ears tess heard a man groaning paralysis seized her biting her lip she forced herself into action grabbed her pistol and lunged toward the hallway the stench of cordite assaulted her nostrils spinning using the doorjamb for cover aiming to the right she saw two men sprawled on the floor in the hallway craig kicked pistols from their hands leapt over their bodies and slammed the front door shut locking it crouching below the doors window but i shut and locked that door after craig arrived tess thought how did one of the men kept groaning with a sudden gagging sound he trembled and no longer moved a pool of blood widened on the hardwood floor around both men stunned tess gaped at the crimson stain on each mans chest where craigs bullets had struck them adrenaline scalded her stomach even so tess felt cold she stared past the corpses toward their pistols more appalled noting that the weapons were equipped with silencers get down craig ordered checking to make sure that the men were dead tess hurriedly obeyed how did they picked the lock craig said they must have listened outside the study window they knew where we were they decided to take the chance that we wouldnt hear them sneak inside staying low he risked furtive glances through the doors window tensely darting his gaze this way and that scanning the porch i dont see any other the back door tess said in a rush she turned charging down the hallway toward the kitchen be careful craig warned she barely heard him too preoccupied by an urgent fear the hallway became a blur but the moment tess entered the kitchen she saw with appalling clarity outside on the back porch a man smashed his gloved fist through the kitchen doors window tess heard shards of glass fall crashing into smaller pieces on the floor at the same instant the man thrust his hand through the jagged hole in the window groping for the lock tess raised her pistol and fired the mans right eye exploded tess didnt have time to react to the horror too much because behind the falling man another man raised a pistol with a silencer tess was far beyond conscious decisions automatically she pulled the trigger again her ears rang as she shot the man in the forehead in a spray of blood the man arched up then down disappearing his no longer visible body thumping heavily on the back porch tess craig yelled from the front of the house are you all right yes im all right tess ducked behind the kitchen table aiming toward the back door god help me i just shot two men dont think about it remember they want to shoot you hey im too scared to think all i want to do is stay alive keep telling yourself that where did you learn to shoot my father taught me good man hes dead i know craig yelled six years ago in beirut the bastards tortured him but he never talked i repeat a damned good man be as strong as he was grab the phone dial nineoneone tess scuttled backward aiming her pistol toward the back door she yanked the kitchen phone off the hook beside the refrigerator and urgently pressed numbers listening no craig the phones dead priscilla screamed again stay low priscilla dont go near the windows craig yelled my husband what about him i think hes having a heart attack get him down on the floor open his collar tess shouted another assassin appeared at the kitchen window tess aimed and shot the bullet plowed up his nostrils his face erupted oh my god tess bent over vomiting tess craig roared she fought to speak im all right keep watching the front priscilla screamed again richard isnt breathing tess craig ordered get back to the hallway watch the front and rear while i yes take care of richard tess retreated hunkering midway along the corridor jerking her eyes toward each door pistol clenched while she felt craig lunge past and into the study still sick wiping vomit from her lips she heard craig press richards chest and breathe forcefully into his mouth again then again administering cpr i can feel his heart beat craig said hes breathing he needs oxygen a doctor tess kept staring back and forth toward each door priscilla your face is gray lie down here beside your husband tess any sign of no maybe we got them all we dont dare count on that priscilla is there another entrance to the house priscilla murmured through the basement wheres the inside basement door the kitchen priscilla sounded weaker tess craig ordered but tess was already on her way darting toward the kitchen behind her she heard craig enter the hallway watching the front as she reached the kitchen tess heard something else however and the sound made her spine freeze footsteps beyond a door to her right she whirled to face it saw the doorknob turning and fired at the door wood splintered she fired again and heard a moan a body tumbling down the stairs she didnt know how many others might be in the basement if there were several and they rushed through the door in a group she might not be able to shoot all of them before one of them shot her the basement door was next to the stove with strength that came from years of daily workouts her energy intensified by fear she shoved against the side of the stove and propped it against the basement door the neighbors craig they must have heard the shots theyll call the police all we have to do is wait and hope the police can get here before craig didnt answer whats wrong you dont want to know craig said tell me these big old victorian houses were built so solidly the walls are so thick from outside the shots might be too muffled for anyone to hear from another house besides we cant take for granted that the neighbors are even home and the hedge on each side conceals the gunmen tess felt sick again youre right i wish i didnt know she kept her weapon aimed toward the back door in contrast with last night this time shed counted how many times shed pulled the trigger five that left twelve rounds in her pistol if the gunmen rushed the house she might have enough to kill them all but how many more could there be six were already dead surely just a few if any were left all the same she desperately wished that shed thought to dump extra rounds into her purse that she hadnt shoved the two boxes of ammunition under the front seat of the porsche craig you shot twice your revolver holds six have you got any other yet again craig didnt answer oh jesus tess thought hes got only four rounds left and my bullets dont fit his revolver i picked up the two pistols from the men on the floor at the front i still dont see any other men maybe youre right maybe we got them all craig said last night they burned my mothers house hoping the fire would get me and if it didnt they planned to shoot me when i hurried outside tess said this time why didnt they late afternoon the smoke would be so obvious that a neighbor or a passing driver would call the fire department besides since you got away from them last night i think this time they want to make sure they finish the job facetoface no doubts and they want to make sure they get the photographs i mailed your office the negatives good priscilla hows richard tess heard her murmur his eyes are open hes breathing but priscilla whimpered what he cant richard cant seem to talk tess cringed a stroke no please not i shouldnt have come here i shouldnt have put them in danger priscilla im sorry i you didnt do this the men who want to kill you did still no sign of them in front craig said nothing back here tess crouched behind the kitchen table im soon going to need my insulin priscilla said ill get it for you tess kept low watching the back door while she inched toward the refrigerator craig what if suppose we didnt get them all when she opened the refrigerator with a quick glance she saw a row of loaded syringes and grabbed one suppose a few of them are still outside she closed the refrigerator suppose theyre afraid that a neighbor did hear the shots they cant wait around but theyll want to make sure im she backed nervously toward the corridor her left hand cradling the syringe they might get desperate enough to try what they did last seventeen night she began to say but flinched as an object smashed through the big kitchen window glass flying the object was metal a canister it banged on the floor a grenade a gas bomb tess had no way of knowing all she did know was that the thing was rolling toward her she couldnt get away in time she had to she dropped the syringe barely hearing it shatter as she lunged toward the kitchen table and heaved it over so its top landed on the canister at the same time her heart pounding the canister blasted apart flames whooshing sideways from beneath the table top a fire bomb craig he didnt respond craig in the front of the hallway glass fractured craig theyre something exploded flames reflected down the corridor priscilla a fire extinguisher craig yelled have you got a in the pantry priscillas voice shook next to the refrigerator im getting it tess scrambled past the fridge and yanked open a door next to shelves of boxes and cans the fire extinguisher was mounted to a clamp on a wall she rammed her pistol under her belt grabbed the fire extinguisher with one hand released the clamp with the other then pulled out the pin that secured the extinguishers lever and spun toward the flames gushing from beneath and eating through the overturned table desperate she aimed the extinguishers nozzle pressed the lever down and spewed a thick white spray toward the blaze foam gushed over the table over the flames coughing from smoke tess inwardly shouted in triumph as the flames diminished but another canister crashed through the window as it landed before it erupted tess tried to smother it with a dense pile of foam whump the canister blew apart chunks of metal bursting through the foam tess kept aiming the nozzle spraying the flames which struggled dying tess craig yelled from the front i need that extinguisher trembling she glared at the kitchen window saw no one and darted into the hallway stunned unable to see the front door because of the spreading blaze in a frenzy she pressed the extinguishers lever again spraying foam toward the flames craig didnt try to take the extinguisher from her realizing she had control someone has to check the back he blurted ill trade places he was gone tess kept spraying the flames diminished then the foam diminished abruptly it stopped weve got to get out of here tess thought throwing down the empty extinguisher she ran toward the study on the floor professor harding blinked with a look of helplessness beside him priscilla quivered her face gray terrified tess tried not to show her own fear can you walk priscilla can you reach the hallway do i have a choice their next target might be this study tess kept thinking if they throw a fire bomb through the studys window she scooped up the photographs crammed them into her purse slung the purse across her shoulder and bent toward professor harding he lay on a carpet grabbing its end she tugged both it and the limp weight of professor harding across the floor into the hallway joining priscilla who sagged against a wall at the front of the hallway the flames spread their roar increasing crash a canister hurtled through the study window fire gushed over the desk the chairs the floor lets go priscilla tess gripped the carpet dragging professor harding toward the kitchen another canister must have landed there to the left of the refrigerator the room was ablaze craig wheezed enveloped with smoke his revolver aimed toward the kitchen door theyll be waiting for us he fought to breathe the paths in the garden tess said if we can get there the flowers are tall enough to hide us but what about priscilla and richard how are we going to tess whirled toward priscilla realizing that the aged woman wasnt strong enough to drag her husband to safety the flames became more powerful tess winced from the heat craig youll have to go ahead but i cant leave you well die if we stay here there isnt another go ill be right behind you reach the garden then cover me craig hesitated the flames roared toward them singeing open the door tess said craig stared then nodded with fierce resolve he jerked the door open and raced outside for a fraction of an instant tesss mind played a trick the afternoon changed to night this house became her mothers house it was happening again theyll kill us the same as they killed my no ive got to tess clutched the carpet rushing backward from the kitchen dragging professor harding through the door into the hazechoked sunlight priscilla did her best to hurry and follow tess heard a shot ignoring it she tugged professor harding across the back porch bump bump down the steps feeling the jolts to his body wincing in sympathy another shot tess released the carpet and spun her pistol drawn searching for a target craig had reached the paths in the garden he crouched behind a section of scarlet lilies hardly visible shooting toward the left of the house but behind craig rising from a path beyond a farther section of lilies a gunman appeared aiming toward craig tess fired the gunman jerked tess fired again the gunman toppled backward arms splayed crashing among the flowers lilystalks snapping priscilla lie down hug the grass tess ordered at once she whirled saw a target at the right corner of the house shot missed shot again and blood flew from his throat sweating breathing hard tess hunkered pivoting to the left then again to the right searching for other targets apart from the crackle of the blaze in the house the back yard became eerily silent hurry priscilla follow me again tess tugged at the carpet at professor harding hurrying backward toward craig toward the paths among the flowers she feared that any second a bullet would blow her head apart breathing harsher deeper she reached a path kept tugging yanked professor harding behind a section of flowers and gasped when she saw that priscilla was only halfway across the lawn a man appeared at the right of the house tess aimed the man ducked behind the corner craig tess yelled i see him cover me tess bolted forward reached priscilla picked her up grasping her shoulders the back of her knees and ran bent over collapsing behind the flowers their fragrance in contrast with the stench of her fear immediately she knelt risked exposing her face and aimed toward the left side of the house the lilies gave no protection from bullets she knew but at least they obscured her from a killers aim sweat rolled off her brow her eyes stung her chest heaved she hurriedly squinted behind her in case another gunman was hidden among the flowers the man at the side of the house where the hell had he gone craig do you see him no craig kept aiming tess noticed that hed dropped his revolver which he must have emptied and now held one of the pistols that hed picked up inside the house behind her flowers whispered again tess whirled squinting her weapon ready not quickly enough a mans arm thrust from the lilies the rest of him hidden his powerful thumb pressed a nerve at the back of her neck agony paralysis wanting to scream unable to helpless tess watched her gun fall equally helpless she felt the man squirm soundlessly from the flowers and press his weight over her onto the path his thumb kept pressing the nerve on her neck with his other hand he raised a silenced pistol and aimed toward craig in the next row among the flowers tess tried again to scream impossible lieutenant the man dove as craig whirled and fired lieutenant the man repeated im going to show my head im going to use your friend as a shield if youre foolish enough to think that you can kill me if you aim at me ill kill her then ill kill you craig said but your friend is more important pay attention lieutenant think the only noise was the crackle of flames from the house lieutenant the man commanded his grip still paralyzing tess his weight still upon her youre about to see the head of your friend furious tess felt the man twist his grip on her neck and force her to raise her head while he kept his own head behind hers craig made a tentative motion with his pistol lieutenant dont do it the man said calmly aiming his weapon youre compromised you cant possibly hit me i dont intend to kill either of you i assure you im a friend but if you persist and attack me ill do whats necessary listen to reason my team just saved your life what are you talking about we shot the remaining attackers there isnt time to explain i need your help in the distance sirens wailed the authorities are on their way the man said maintaining his calm although his tone was paradoxically emphatic we have to get out of here i could have killed you i didnt thats a sign of good faith heres another sign of good faith the man shoved his pistol beneath his belt he released his thumb from the nerve on tesss throat the sirens wailed closer abruptly tess found she could move angry she squirmed beneath the mans weight he stood she rolled away her throat in pain and fought to recontrol her muscles lurching clumsily to her knees i apologize the man said in the background flames roared in the house smoke spewed who are you tess rubbed her throat the man wore a dark sportcoat and slacks he was in his early forties solidly built his hair a neutral brown his face indistinctive not handsome not repulsive the sort of common face she would never notice in a crowd your savior be grateful and i repeat i dont have time to explain those sirens will you cooperate tess darted an uncertain glance toward craig sure craig stared provided you give me your weapon the stranger exhaled all right if thats what it takes he removed his pistol from his belt engaged its safety mechanism and extended it to craig who shoved it into a pocket of his suitcoat what the hell screw it craig lowered his own weapon good very good the stranger said hurry he gestured and almost by magic equally neutralfaced solidly built men emerged from the flowers and the side of the house holding weapons theres a van in front the stranger cocked his head assessing the intensity of the sirens lets go priscilla and professor harding tess said well take them with us of course again the stranger gestured two men raced from the flowers lifting priscilla and professor harding she needs insulin tess said and her husband may have had a stroke itll all be taken care of you have my word the stranger pressed a hand against tesss back move as the sirens wailed closer the group surged toward the right of the house smoke wafted out of the studys window obscuring tesss gaze then the smoke cleared and she saw two bodies she flinched and stared away the front yard before her trees and shrubs a van looming the porsche tess said i got it a from a friend she cant be involved give me the key tess groped in her purse and threw it the stranger caught the key tossed it to another man and ordered him follow us tess and craig scrambled into the van other men hurried inside with priscilla and richard slamming the vans side hatch shut a driver stomped the accelerator squealing away from the curb behind the van the porsche sped to follow the two vehicles rounded a corner disappearing from the street just as tess bewildered heard the approaching sirens wail toward the burning house nearing it from a different direction so all right craig said hoarse you claim you saved our lives so we got away so what do you want from us the stranger peered backward from the passenger seat very simple he scowled your help to eliminate the vermin what this isnt the time or place to discuss it the stranger said arrangements have to be made your friends need medical attention and several of our associates have been hold it tess said glancing toward the rear window were being followed behind the porsche that ups truck and the gray sedan the stranger nodded they belong or used to belong to several of our associates the vermin executed those two squads before attacking the house executed craig demanded the stranger ignored the interruption we found the vehicles the corpses inside them a block apart as we arrived the evidence indicates that nerve gas was used members of my own team now drive those vehicles security and honor insist we must not abandon our dead the corpses of our brave departed require the proper rites honorable burial in consecrated ground requiem aeternam dona eis domine et lux perpetua luceat eis the other men added somber reverential tess shook her head confused astonished at first she thought she was hearing gibberish then abruptly the realization startling her she blurted youre praying in latin the stranger squinted do you understand what it means no tess fought to speak im a catholic but the stranger sighed of course you wouldnt be able to translate youre too young to know what the mass sounded like before vatican two ordered it changed from latin into the vernacular grant them eternal rest lord and let perpetual light shine upon them its from the mass for the dead even more startled tess suddenly realized something else my god whatever you are youre also also what the stranger studied her priests well the stranger said that gives us something else to discuss eighteen the grimywindowed rectory behind a boardedup gothic church on the outskirts of washington had a weedgrown parking lot the ups truck and the gray sedan had long since veered away only the van and the porsche remained as the stranger stepped from the van joining tess and craig who left the side hatch he explained this is one of many churches that the vaticans dwindling finances have forced the curia to sell not to worry were safe here did you notice the sign in front f and s realty tess said youre very observant its our own corporation were negotiating the sale ourselves eliminating the middle man so to speak unless its a middle woman tess said by all means the stranger said i did not intend to be sexist for now however we still control this church and the rectory the neighbors will assume youre potential buyers no one who lives in this area will bother us except unless tess glanced around nervously you mean the vermin none of your attackers survived to follow the others dont know about this place i repeat were safe here you keep calling them vermin craig said a precise description where did the ups truck and the gray sedan go tess asked i assumed you understood from my earlier remarks our departed associates require a mass for the dead its being arranged and burial in consecrated ground tess said yes for the good of their souls the porsche where does it belong tess gave the address so much had happened she felt as if days instead of hours had passed since shed left the comfort of mrs caudills home id be grateful if the authorities couldnt trace the car to her i guarantee that the stranger said as long as you remember what you just promised promised that youll be grateful tess squirmed the stranger approached and spoke to the porsches driver with a nod the man backed the sportscar expertly from the lot and drove away and tess said my friends richard priscilla like you tess im concerned about them the stranger said you know my name more than that i know virtually everything about you including your relationship with lieutenant craig my briefing was thorough the men in the van have paramedical training theyre monitoring the heartbeat and respiration of your friends richard and priscilla are stable but they do need further help so my driver and a paramedic will deliver them to a doctor at a private clinic that we control the authorities wont be able to question your friends until the doctor who works for us has taught them how and what to answer in the meantime priscilla and richard will be well taken care of thank you tess breathed i dont need thanks what i insist on is what you promised gratitude the stranger said he motioned toward the driver in the van who steered from the lot and headed toward the clinic gratitude craig rested his hand on the strangers weapon which hed shoved in a pocket of his suitcoat three of the neutralfaced men gripped pistols and flanked him yes craig said of course by all means what am i thinking of gratitude so why dont we go inside the rectory the stranger said and discuss how glad you are to be alive and discuss our mutual problem and discuss the vermin the vermin tess jerked up her arms assaulted by insanity damn you bet the vermin we certainly have to discuss the youre verging on lack of control the stranger said i urge you dont lose it listen ive kept control through hell tess said ive seen my mother die ive been chased and shot at ive shot in return ive killed do you honestly think that you and these three men scare me im an expert in keeping control no matter how terrified i tess i say it again you dont need to be afraid were here to help you not threaten you as long as lieutenant craig keeps his hand away from the weapon i graciously surrendered to him well your generosity is obviously a problem craig said here watch my hand ill move it slowly carefully fingertips only no threat right here satisfied take it the way things are with these men beside and behind me its useless to me anyhow craig handed the weapon to him dramatic but unnecessary the stranger said especially since i can see the bulge of another weapon under your belt concealed by your suitcoat no problem you dont know it but were working together oh yes of course craig said i understand your skepticism all right then the stranger said well enter the rectory well exchange opinions ill tell you about the vermin and youll tell me if youre prepared to help what i need is help tess said wrong to save your life what you need to do is cooperate to help exterminate the vermin nineteen the rectory smelled of must in the gloomy vestibule crackedleather chairs were positioned at random a dustcovered desk the center of focus cobwebbed religious pictures hung on oakpaneled walls in need of polishing tess felt exhausted the aftereffect of adrenaline before we begin whatever you need the stranger said the bathroom of course to the right down that hallway the first door on the left im sure youll want to clean the traces of vomit from your chin and your blouse tess raised a hand embarrassed no need to be selfconscious on occasion during violence ive vomited as well how encouraging tess said grimly she proceeded toward the restroom entered weakly and locked the door only as she opened her belt did she notice that unaware she must have picked up her handgun after the stranger had released his paralyzing grip in the garden the weapon nearly fell from her loosened belt she grabbed it set it next to her on the sink pulled down her jeans and settled onto the seat her nostrils quivered her urine stank from fear disgusted she rose rebuckled her pants and rinsed her face doing her best to swab the stains from her blouse at once she grabbed the gun all along the stranger must have noticed it beneath her belt he could have taken it anytime but hed let her keep it why a sign a gesture of cooperation of reassurance all right she thought and zipped up her jeans returning the gun beneath her belt im getting the message feel safe but dont be aggressive she flushed the toilet unlocked the washroom door and walked with feigned confidence down the hallway toward the vestibule twenty in the dim light through the murky windows tess glanced at craig who sat on one of the crackedleather chairs he sipped from a glass of water so did the other men several bottles and glasses had been placed on the desk when the stranger handed her a glass tess suddenly realized how dry and thick her tongue felt she hurriedly drank barely tasting the cool pure liquid she couldnt remember when shed been this thirsty she grabbed a bottle refilled the glass and drained it drops of water clung to her lips when she reached to refill the glass yet again the stranger gently put a hand on her arm no too much at once might make you sick tess studied him then nodded sit the stranger added try to relax come on relax youve got to be kidding all the same tess moved a chair next to craig its brittle leather creaked when she slumped upon it so the stranger raised his eyebrows is there anything else you need are we ready now for our talk im definitely ready for answers craig straightened rigid who the hell are you whats this all about whats going on the stranger considered him his brooding silence lengthened at last he sighed i cant answer your questions until you answer mine then were not ready for a talk craig said i ran out of patience quite a while ago i please the stranger said indulge me he directed his eyes toward tess how much have you discovered about the vermin do you understand why they want to kill you tess frowned the way you say that your tone it doesnt sound as if youre puzzled its as if you already know the answers but wonder if i know the stranger cocked his head impressive to repeat my earlier compliment youre very observant but what i know isnt the issue tell me how much have you discovered tess pivoted toward craig who debated then shrugged its a standoff craig said go ahead tell him maybe hell answer our questions or maybe if i do theyll kill us no tess the stranger said whatever happens we are not your enemy on the contrary he reached inside a pocket of his jacket and placed a ring on his finger the other men followed his example their rings were dramatic each had a glinting golden band a shimmering ruby embossed with a golden intersecting cross and sword few outsiders have seen these rings the stranger said we show them as a sign of respect of trust of obligation a cross and a sword the stranger lowered his gaze toward the ring an appropriate symbol religion and retribution tell me tess and ill tell you why do the vermin want to kill you because of confused frightened tess opened her mouth hesitated then confessed unburdened revealed throughout she glanced at craig who pretended to listen his shoulders braced while he checked the exits never interrupting mithras montsegur the treasure josephs bedroom the basrelief statue a war between a good god and an evil one exhausted tess slumped back the crackedleather chair sagging beneath her they want to stop me from telling others what i know from showing the photographs yes the stranger caressed the cross and sword on his ring the photographs let me see them tess fumbled in her purse and handed them over the strangers face became rigid with hate when he examined them its what we suspected a damnable altar craig scowled so tess was right all of this was pointless you havent heard anything you didnt already know on the contrary ive learned a great deal the stranger passed the photographs to his companions who studied them with equal loathing ive learned that you know so much i cant as id hoped deceive you with halftruths i wont be able to use you without providing a fuller explanation than id planned he brooded it presents a problem how i need you but i cant trust you i cant depend on your silence just as the vermin are determined to protect their secrets so we guard ours how can i be sure that youll stay quiet about what i tell you yes its a problem craig said apparently youll just have to trust us anyhow lieutenant im not a fool the moment youre free youll report everything youve heard to your superiors it might be better if i released both of you right now true youve seen the rings however they tell you nothing let us go then you meant what you said craig shook his head puzzled you dont intend to harm us after saving your lives the stranger asked rhetorically ive already shown my commitment to your safety theres the door it isnt locked youre free to leave by all means do so but tess said if you let us go well be back where we started exactly the stranger said the vermin will continue to hunt you and without our help i fear that the next time theyll succeed in killing you a pity craigs voice became husky what kind of mind game are you playing i need reassurance do you love this woman craig answered without hesitation yes it made tess proud and are you willing to admit the stranger continued despite your best efforts theres a good chance shell die without our help at the very least that you and she will be forced to keep hiding constantly afraid that the vermin are about to attack again craig didnt respond answer me the stranger said are you willing to condemn the woman you love to an uncertain future cringing at the slightest sound always terrified damn it obviously i want to protect her then give me your word on the soul of the woman you love swear to me that youll never repeat a word i say to you so its that way craig glared yes lieutenant that way the only way do i need to add that if you break your vow and tell the authorities this woman will never trust you again craig kept glaring and do i need to add something else the stranger asked if you break your vow the vermin wont be the only group that hunts her we will i myself would kill her to punish you if you betrayed us you son of a bitch yes yes vulgarity vents emotion but it settles nothing youre avoiding my demand are you willing to swear for the woman you love are you prepared to make a solemn pledge of silence craigs cheek muscles rippled tess couldnt restrain herself craig tell him what he wants she swung toward the stranger you have my word i wont repeat anything you say but what about you lieutenant craig clenched his fists his shoulders seemed to broaden slowly he swallowed all right he exhaled forcefully youve got it nothing means more to me than keeping tess alive i dont want another group trying to kill her i give you my word i wont betray you but i have to tell you i hate like hell to be threatened well thats the point a vow means nothing unless a threat is attached to its violation actually two points oh whats the second one you already mentioned it what were here to discuss hell twentyone tess blinked a sharp pain attacked her forehead i dont understand hell the stranger emphasized where the vermin belong where weve devoted ourselves to send them i still dont abruptly tess dreaded what the stranger was going to tell her she braced herself for another assault on her sanity why do you keep calling them vermin no other word applies they breed like rats they infest like lice theyre vile contemptible destructive loathesome morally filthy worse than plagueridden fleas spreading their evil vicious repugnant heresy the litany of hate jolted tesss mind she lurched back in her chair as if shed been pushed its time you promised to explain keep your word who are you in the van i said i thought you were priests but yes priests but more than priests our mandate makes us unique were enforcers what the stranger nodded his eyes gleaming tess struggled to ask him for the inquisition tess had trouble making her throat work her consciousness swirled what are you talking about thats crazy the inquisition ended in the middle ages no the stranger said thats not correct the inquisition began in the middle ages but it persisted for several hundred years in fact it wasnt officially dissolved until eighteen thirtyfour tess winced she couldnt adjust to the realization that so cruel an institution the relentless widespread persecution of anyone who didnt follow strict doctrine had survived until so recently its victims had been tortured urged to recant their heresy and if they refused burned at the stake flames she thought everything led back to flames the stake of the inquisition the torch of mithras but there was more tess wasnt prepared as the neutralfaced stranger his eyes gleaming brighter continued youll note i used the word officially he said in truth the inquisition did not end unofficially amid the greatest secrecy it remained in action because its necessary work had not yet been completed because the vermin had not yet been eradicated youre telling us craig sounded appalled that a core of inquisitors followed secret instructions from the church and persisted in hunting down anyone who strayed from orthodox catholicism no lieutenant thats not what im telling you then the church was firm in its order to disband the inquisition no secret instructions were given but secrecy was followed nonetheless on the part of inquisitors who felt that their crucial mission could not in conscience be interrupted before they died they trained others to take up the mission and they in turn trained others an unbroken chain until we now train others but more important fight the enemy tess slumped too much she fought to retain her sanity too damned much just because your victims dont go to mass on sunday dont trivialize it makes no difference to me who goes to mass on sunday anyone who worships god the one god in his or her own way is not my concern but those who believe in an evil god in combat with the true good lord are by definition as evil as the god they hate mithraism the stranger almost spat albigensians dualists the survivors of montsegur they are my enemy they managed to escape they took their statue with them they hid they festered they spread and now theyre out of control or to be exact about to assume control they killed your friend they killed your mother they want to kill you i wont rest until i destroy them okay just a minute calm down craig said back up what do you mean theyre about to assume control after they escaped from montsegur the small group of heretics fled from southwestern france trying to put as much distance as possible between them and their hunters they headed farther south into spain where they sought refuge in an isolated mountain valley the range that we now call the picos de europa there they determined to replenish their cult to learn spains language and customs to try to blend which they did successfully practising their contemptible rites in secret for more than two hundred years they flourished eventually sending contingents to other sections of spain after all in case their central nest was discovered the other nests would still have a chance to preserve their repulsive beliefs pamplona and merida tess said the strangers gaze intensified why do you mention those areas priscilla the woman your men took to the clinic she told me tess said in fact almost everything i know about mithraism comes from her she used to be a professor shes an expert in answer my question what do you know about those areas on a research trip priscilla saw mithraic statues in caves near those cities truly i never expected youve told me something i didnt know weve been trying to find the central nest now youve pointed me toward possible other nests answer my question craig said what do you mean theyre about to assume control after two hundred years the heretics felt secure but then in fourteen seventyeight the spanish inquisition began earlier thered been purges throughout various other countries in europe but the spanish inquisition was by far the most extreme enforcers hunted heretics everywhere no village was too small to avoid a purifiers attention but the vermin resourceful resilient fled again to northern africa specifically morocco taking utmost precautions they came together for a critical secret meeting in which they decided that in order to protect their religion they needed to counterattack to rely on every devious means possible to guarantee their survival the final decision was to train representatives to leave the nest conceal their true identity and seek power to imbed themselves within society and gain sufficient political influence to stop the persecution to infest as you might expect their initial efforts were minor but since the fourteen hundreds the heretics have spread multiplied and infiltrated every important institution in europe and america theyve risen to the highest levels of government it was due to their influence that the inquisition was finally dissolved and now the crisis is universal theyre about to assume complete control to impose their vicious errors upon the world obviously youre exaggerating craig said hardly its impossible to exaggerate the extremes to which theyve gone the vermin are convinced that the evil god is destroying the planet they feel an urgency as the year two thousand looms the millennium and all it implies crisis apocalypse not satisfied with manipulating governments theyve organized their own inquisition theyve sent assassins to eliminate anyone they feel is dominated by the evil god you must have noticed the pattern the killings everywhere in australia hong kong brazil germany kenya the north atlantic america industrialists developers corporate managers driftnet fisherman ivory hunters the captain of the oil tanker that polluted and nearly destroyed the great barrier reef the vermin are executing anyone they blame for the greed negligence and poisons that threaten the planet my god tess said youre talking about the article ive been working on radical environmentalists attacking no not environmentalists and when you speak of god which god do you mean i hope not a good god at war with an evil god the stranger said i dont care about that the fact is the planet is in danger it has to be saved a commendable notion the stranger said however if you believe in the one true god as do then you have to trust that god he knows better than we do if the planet dies its his will its part of his grand design a punishment because of our sins if we dont correct our ways well be destroyed but the vermin the heretics believe they obey a different god a god that is nonexistent their heresy challenges the true gods plan and for that theyll suffer in hell dont you realize what youre as fanatical as they are the strangers calm reaction surprised her the situation demands fanaticism after all a determined enemy requires an even more determined opponent thats not what i meant one god two gods you think youre right they believe theyre right the worlds collapsing and youre fighting each other about theology if anything i empathize with the other side at least theyre working to save the planet but theyre also trying to kill you the stranger said and theyve succeeded in killing many others do you condone political assassination do you approve of the murders of industrialists financiers and your goal is to execute the heretics nothing would please you more killing thats what youre about how can you blame them for doing the same thing you do theres a difference the stranger said im engaged in a war but i kill combatants not civilians in contrast they kill without discrimination they destroy the innocent as well as the guilty your mother her only fault was that she happened to be present when they tried to kill you for your mothers sake i would have expected you to want revenge yes i do want someone to pay but oh lord help me im so confused youre not alone the stranger said to kill contradicts my very purpose as a priest and yethe lowered his gaze i pledged myself to protect the faith the vestibule became silent craig took advantage of the pause ive got a lot more questions yes by all means the stranger slowly raised his head you said that the heretics hurried from spain when the inquisition came too close correct then they went to morocco yes which explains joseph martins fascination with the doves neck ring a treatise on courtly love written by a moor who immigrated to spain the stranger nodded that also explains why joseph martin looked vaguely spanish swarthy darkhaired with latin features as opposed to french does that mean the heretics not only blended with but bred with the local population yes the stranger said at the start the group was so small that the vermin needed to replenish their gene pool they converted their spouses to mithraism and swore them to secrecy the stranger gestured but you didnt mention one more detail about their features in some descendants of the vermin theres an unusual gene that makes their eyes gray its one of the few means we have to identify them gray with a pang of grief tess vividly remembered the compelling color of josephs eyes their intensity their charisma but if the inquisition came so dangerously close that the heretics abandoned spain craig asked why do you think that the central nest is still in spain although the heretics came from france they eventually considered spain their homeland we believe they returned weve searched but we havent been able to find that nest another question and this one really bothers me craig said the stranger motioned for craig to continue if joseph martin believed in mithras why did his fellow believers turn against him craig asked why did they hunt him down and set fire to him in carl schurz park it doesnt make sense for them to turn against one of their own ah yes joseph martin interesting hed have made an excellent informant the stranger said tess felt a tremor of confusion informant what do you as my associates continued searching they discovered something totally unexpected the stranger said one of the heretics had bolted from the ranks the deserter was appalled that his group was engaged in massive killing he fled determined to practise his religion in private cautious he assumed many false identities moving from city to city aware that his former brethren would now consider him a security risk after all he knew too much and if he revealed what he knew he might have directed us toward his brethren obviously from the heretics viewpoint the man who eventually called himself joseph martin had to be killed so while we tried to find him his brethren did the same los angeles chicago new york we followed his trail we found him but my associates waited too long they hoped that the vermin who tracked him would also arrive my associates wanted many targets unfortunately their plan didnt work and joseph martin was killed not just killed he was burned tess said of course why does that surprise you remember the torch of mithras the god of the sun of fire thats why the vermin are so devoted to killing with flames dont sound so righteous theyre not alone in that didnt the inquisition also kill with flames tess demanded true there is however a distinction tell me about it their fire like the phoenix rising sends their victims to another life or so they believe to them death doesnt always lead to heaven or hell but rather to another stage in existence a rebirth a further chance for salvation reincarnation one of the reasons they want the world to survive so they can be reborn the stranger said but our fire punishes nullifies and purifies reducing sin to ashes more it gives the vermin a foretaste of the ravaging flames of hell yes thats what this conversation keeps coming back to hell tess grimaced not only that what we have to go back to something else what tess repeated just as im confident that you intend to keep your promise of silence so i kept my promise ive told you what i know now i repeat i ask what i did at the start will you cooperate to save your life are you prepared to help us exterminate the vermin save my life exterminate the i dont see how the two are related its really quite simple not to me it isnt to prevent you from revealing information about them the vermin will continue to hunt you the only way to stop them is for you to help us complete our mission and how am i supposed to do that the strangers gaze intensified by presenting yourself as bait twentytwo again tess finched the pain in her forehead sharper but that means nothings changed ill still be in danger i guarantee well protect you the stranger said thats bullshit craig said you know you cant possibly guarantee that the minute tess shows herself the minute the killers find out where she is theyll organize an attack theyve proven how determined they are the only defense i can think of is to get tess to a safe house and surround it with policemen but how long will they stay there the stranger shook his head they cant keep guard forever its too expensive eventually theyll be needed elsewhere for that matter how long will they manage to remain alert after a few days if nothing happens its human nature for a sentry to lose his edge to start to get bored and thats when wait i know how to save myself tess interrupted oh the stranger sounded skeptical theres an easy solution really now the stranger sounded perplexed if so i havent thought of it all i have to do is tell everyone i meet the police reporters tv crews whoever i mean everyone about whats happened about joseph about my mother about the heretics and why they want to kill me if their motive is to shut me up after ive finished blabbing they wont have a reason to shut me up because ill have already told what they didnt want me to say dont worry i promised ill leave you out of this but your enemy and yours the stranger said right tess agreed and mine the bastards who killed my mother wont have a reason to keep hunting me theyll be exposed theyll be hunted theyll have to go into hiding tess the stranger bowed his head in despair you still havent understood but the logics so convincing no the stranger said in the first place the vermin would want to get even theyd do their best to kill you on principle to punish you for the trouble you caused in the second place do you realize how outrageous youd sound the police the reporters the tv crews theyd think you were deluded in the third place the information youd reveal wouldnt make a difference suppose against all odds that the authorities managed to repress their doubts and actually amazingly believed you what then if we with centuries of experience in hunting the vermin still havent tracked down and killed every one of them what chance do you think the police would have youve missed the point oh yes indeed im very much afraid that youve missed the essential point which is tess demanded furious you whats so special about you tess think about who you are think about your background think about your dead father what does he have to do with influence tess im talking about influence suppose you did tell policemen reporters and no matter whoever when they didnt believe you what would you do give up say i did my best and hide in fear that youd still be attacked of course not i ask you again what would you do keep trying keep struggling to avenge my mothers death and josephs death exactly the stranger said youd use your influence youd demand that the friends of your dead martyred father pay their debts of gratitude youd insist at the highest levels of government that those friends of your father cooperate and they would tess i believe they would to satisfy you to ease their guilty consciences for having sent your father to his death in beirut for the sake of an illegal arms deal that would have tilted the balance in the lebanese civil war and given the christians power over the moslems but i told you and i remind you that the vermin have risen to the highest levels of government we dont know who they are we havent been able to identify them but believe this count on it your survival depends on it as you keep insisting youll eventually encounter your enemy you wont know it you wont be able to identify them but theyll know you and theyll do their best to have you executed before you accidentally expose their network and possibly them tess shuddered it never occurred to me i never thought i hate to say this craig murmured hes right of course the stranger said so now you have your choices leave keep your pledge of silence except for what you already knew about the vermin or cooperate with us follow my directions help us discover the vermin at the highest level then permit us to do our duty and killing im so sick of killing i guarantee you wouldnt like the alternative the stranger said the options are before you think carefully consider your future then make your choice there isnt a choice be specific the stranger said the way you put it im forced to do what you want exactly but are you certain ill be protected on my honor the stranger said i certainly hope you value your honor more than the vermin tess and remember we have an advantage what the one true lord is on our side i wish i shared your confidence tess spun an abrupt sound jolting her nerves the rectorys door being opened but a man whod been standing guard didnt seem concerned another enforcer entered the man whod driven the porsche back to mrs caudill nice old lady he said she even told her butler to drive me back to washington i got out fifteen blocks from here so he wouldnt know about the rectory he handed a paper bag to tess before i returned the car i searched it in case you left anything that might attract suspicion i found these under the porsches front seat despondent tess peered inside the bag although she knew what shed find the two boxes of ammunition thanks her shoulders sagged the way things are going her voice cracked in despair it looks like ill be needing these judgment day one two cars pulled up outside the engines stopped doors were opened then shut on edge tess warily studied the guard at the entrance to the rectory who peered through its window held his weapon at his side and didnt seem concerned footsteps approached a moment later four neutralfaced trim lithe men came into the vestibule two of the men tess recognized the driver and the paramedic whod taken priscilla and professor harding to the clinic the other two men she hadnt seen before presumably one had driven the ups truck the other the gray sedan following then veering from the row of vehicles as the group neared the rectory you disposed of the truck and the car the stranger asked the latter two men nodded in a parking lot at a shopping mall one of them said counterfeit license plates fake registration no fingerprints we even left the keys with luck both vehicles will soon be stolen good and surveillance i take for granted we detected none our substitute car hadnt been tampered with a clean exchange and what about the funeral of our associates its being arranged i regret however that we wont be able to attend as do i but our prayers go with them the stranger lowered his head after a solemn brief silence he made the sign of the cross exhaled then turned to the driver and paramedic from the van im sure tess will want to know you bet i want to know the clinic what did the doctor say about priscilla and professor harding the first man made a reassuring gesture the woman was given insulin after she ate she became alert and professor harding the second man frowned the diagnosis is a minor stroke hes been given medication before we left he managed to speak what did he three words to his wife with effort and what were i love you tess felt her throat cramp my fault its all my no the stranger said its the vermins fault you cant know how much i want to believe that but if i hadnt gone to them for information professor harding wouldnt have tess glared thats what it keeps coming down to doesnt it fewer and fewer choices then only one to cooperate the force of circumstance the stranger said and now im afraid its time he gestured toward a phone on the dustcovered desk begin call your fathers contacts demand their assistance tell them how helpless you are make them feel guilty because of their responsibility for your fathers death among those who respond at least one of them will be the man whod driven priscilla to the clinic interrupted this might be important in the van coming back we monitored the news on the radio the fire and the corpses at the house in washington are being linked to last nights fire the identical tactics the similar massacre in alexandria the police are the stranger bristled i dont care about the police the phone tess pick up the phone call your not just yet craig said i promised the police chief in alexandria that id keep in touch that promise will have to wait wrong if i dont phone to reassure him my career is finished i could go to prison for failing to cooperate in a felony investigation thats assuming i manage to stay alive of course i mean why be optimistic but i like my work id like to keep doing it however theres one thing i dont like not knowing the name of someone i talk to my name a mere formality it isnt important to me it is then call me the stranger hesitated yes call me father baldwin are you sure you dont want to make it father smith or father jones i believe father baldwin will do but its not quite appropriate am i wrong or do i sense a vague european accent french perhaps lieutenant you finally asked one question too many pick up the phone reassure the alexandria police chief if thats what you feel is necessary for tess to conduct her mission simply tell him you havent been able to contact her yet theres no need to worry about the call being traced a black box routes the transmission through london and johannesburg thorough im impressed we try but then after all weve had hundreds of years of practise it shows craig pulled a slip of paper from a pocket of his rumpled suitcoat he studied a number hed written on the paper picked up the phone and dialed at the same time father baldwin pressed a button that activated a microphone allowing everyone to monitor the call tess listened to static to the click of longdistance relay switches then a buzz as the call arrived in alexandria another buzz a mans voice answered chief farleys office this is lieutenant craig from missing persons at nypd i believe hes expecting my call damned right he is hang on click more static craig had been put on hold he glanced at the man who called himself father baldwin then he reached to put his arm around tess i know its tough babe just stay calm if anyone else had called me that tess said its what my father called my mother in that case it sounds wonderful click chief farley here where the hell have you been i expected you to phone i know a couple of hours ago the trouble is i havent been able to find theresa drake shes not my problem anymore my men are still trying to make sense of what happened at her mothers house last night the washington police had a similar attack in their jurisdiction this afternoon they want to know if the two are connected but what i want to know is how the hell did the fbi get involved what they werent invited and i cant think of a reason why melinda drakes murder should be their business at the mention of her mother tess winced the fbi craig said eric chatham the bureaus director himself got in touch with me shortly after noon he wants to talk to theresa drake national security top priority confidential blah blah blah hey im good at my job and when an outsider tries to tell me how to never mind i explained my arrangement with you now its out of my hands i have orders high level government orders to instruct you to forget about banging theresa drake to me and instead to phone chatham three times this afternoon he called to find out if id heard from you to remind me to tell you to contact him at once immediately craig what in christs name is going on chief i swear i wish i knew then youd damned well better find out as chatham says now the last thing i need is trouble from the fbi i hear you well while youre at it hear this craig some day you and i will meet and youd better be prepared to explain take my word you dont want me pissed off at you because im a vindictive son of a bitch and ill make sure your captains pissed off at you as well i repeat i hear you what a holy hell surprise someones actually taking orders from me instead of giving them to me phone chatham heres his private number craig wrote it down get that bureaucrat off my tail farley said so i can do my job so i can find out who murdered melinda drake i promise itll be taken care of troubled craig set down the phone so father baldwin said its already started tess frowned in amazement you think eric chathams part of the group thats trying to kill me possibly i told you theyd risen to top positions but this might be coincidental father baldwin said did chatham know your father very well then he might be acting out of loyalty to try to protect you tess raised her hands intensely frustrated theres just one problem with that logic oh father baldwin waited only the enemy knew i was at my mothers house last night not true there was brian hamilton and of course my associates but brian hamiltons dead tess said my point hasnt changed the alexandria police chief learned i was being hunted because craig told him but how did chatham find out father baldwins eyes blazed youre suggesting he received his information from the men who attacked your mothers house and failed to capture you it certainly makes sense to me craig said perhaps father baldwin shook his head but what troubles me is that the connections so obvious since twelve fortyfour and the vermins escape from montsegur the heretics have survived because of their talent for hiding over the centuries theyve greatly improved their ability to deceive if chatham is an enemy would he take the risk would he violate his training and draw suspicion to himself by acting so directly if he and his group felt desperate enough tess pivoted toward a religious painting then whirled back toward father baldwin by calling chief farley and insisting that the fbi take over chatham has already accomplished part of their goal they want to kill me because of the photographs and what i know but this way i still havent been able to tell the authorities father baldwin didnt answer for a moment you may be right but theres only one way to learn tess breathed yes to call him apprehensive she reached for the sheet of paper upon which craig had written chatham s phone number wait father baldwin said a minute ago you were urging me to the situations changed now that weve isolated a possible target i need to teach you how to react to what chatham tells you meanwhile other arrangements have to be made theyre mundane but necessary what do you mean its after seven so what you have to eat forget it foods the last thing im interested in i probably couldnt keep it down but youre useless to me if youre exhausted my informants tell me you dont eat meat would fish be acceptable tess felt intimidated by father baldwins intimate knowledge of her habits at the same time she felt indignant but the priests forceful tone had its effect if youre that determined tess said go ahead although i dont know why my permission matters youll do it anyhow sure yeah fish will be fine and lieutenant what about you a week ago id have ordered steak and fries craig said but now after having met tess whatever she recommends to eat is good enough for me ill also need your clothing sizes father baldwin said what youre wearing is torn and reeks of smoke since youll soon be out in public to avoid attracting attention youll have to put on fresh clothes for the second time today tess murmured and discovered she was trembling two eric chatham stood at the bottom of the steps that led to the lincoln memorial its massive statue and white marble columns glowing eerily in the darkness this section of the circular street around the memorial was closed to traffic but to his right headlights of vehicles approached along daniel french drive to stop at a parking lot visitors getting out to stroll around and enter the memorial chatham studied those cars and visitors waiting for a man to walk toward him and mention that hed come from tess drake the night was warm all the same chatham s stomach felt crammed with jagged chunks of ice he brooded unable to subdue his misgivings it wasnt just that hed agreed against all his instincts to meet in this unorthodox potentially dangerous way it was also that this was the second such unorthodox meeting hed had today the first during noon hour at arlington national cemetery with kenneth madden the cias deputy director of covert operations the meetings were related and chatham was more convinced that something disastrous was about to happen he thought of melinda drakes murder and corrected himself no not about to happen now his years of experience as the bureaus director told him that whatever was wrong had already begun and might even be out of control tess was frightened that much was certain when shed called him two hours ago hed been alarmed by her trembling voice her desperate tone before he had a chance to explain why he needed to talk to her shed interrupted claiming that she knew whod killed her mother that she had important information about the murder but that she couldnt reveal it over the phone she had to tell him about to let him see the evidence in person then come to my office no chatham had said its more private at my home but i cant trust either place forgive me tess but dont you think youre taking precautions to an extreme after everything ive been through eric you have no idea in my position youd be okay calm down if you believe youre in that much danger ill arrange for special agents to guard my house no the meeting has to be on my conditions if you were truly a friend of my father youll do your best to help me stay alive chatham had hesitated yes for your father anything some friends of mine will pick you up and bring you to where i feel safe agreed youll come alone tess had said i dont like that but again all right chatham s forehead had suddenly throbbed it has to be that way so my friends can make sure youre not followed the people who want to kill me might be watching you again youre being extreme no eric practical if im not careful theyll use you to find me it doesnt matter who you are the heretics have proven how determined they are to stop me heretics the word had frozen chatham s spine what are you talking about you mean you pretend youre claiming you really dont know if i did would i be there im begging you please tess had named the specifics of the rendezvous ill be waiting for my friends to bring you to where im hiding now in the darkness chatham glanced nervously at the luminous dial on his watch eleventen amid tourists at the base of the dramatically lit columns and statue of the lincoln memorial he felt chilled in his shortsleeved cotton sweater despite the nights warmth after all the rendezvous was supposed to have occurred ten minutes ago and although the man whod been sent to take him to tess was probably scouting the area to make sure that chatham had come alone and hadnt been followed by tesss enemies the fbi director couldnt help feeling exposed among the numerous passing tourists any one of whom might be a threat keep control he told himself youll soon be as paranoid as tess sounded soon be i already am i wish i hadnt a man stopped beside him and took a photograph of the memorial he had an average build nondescript face and neutral clothes it probably wont turn out the man shook his head i brought the wrong speed of film you never know you might get lucky chatham said tensing completing the identification code tess drake the man said taking another picture up the stairs toward lincoln s statue beyond the spotlit looming pillars you came alone as i promised not to doubt your word but i checked to make sure chatham shrugged i assumed in that case are you ready to take a ride anything to find out whats going on lets do it chathamurned impatiently to the right toward the murky treeenclosed parkmg lot at the end of daniel french drive no we go this way the neutralfaced man with the camera jerked his head in the opposite direction on your left chatham scowled left but turning his nervous eyes in that direction he saw a waisthigh metal barricade that prevented cars from driving completely around the memorial beyond the barricade numerous headlights flashed by chatham heard the din of speeding cars swarming loudly across arlington memorial bridge to veer farther left away from the lincoln memorial onto twentythird street yeah i know the man with the camera said theres no parking lot over there not to worry everythings been taken care of he reached inside a leather camera case strapped to his waist and removed a cellular telephone quickly tapping numbers he listened then spoke as quickly all clear were ready two minutes good thats about how long itll take us the man placed the telephone back in his camera case would you care for a stroll mr chatham not waiting for an answer the man touched chatham s arm and guided him toward the left toward the metal barricade they skirted it passing trees whose lush boughs obscured the stars and whose thick trunks flanked an unused weedgrown section of road if youre wondering the man said im not alone my companions are watching in case anyones foolish enough to try to come after us nervous chatham managed to say the bureaus training team at quantico might benefit by taking lessons from you the man with the camera which wasnt a camera at all but somehow a weapon perhaps a hidden gun chatham suspected merely gestured with his free hand wed never agree to do it but a compliment is always appreciated what id appreciate is to know what on earth is soon mr chatham soon they approached the lights and the noise of the offbridge traffic on the busy thoroughfare beyond the trees on the gravel shoulder the average looking man paused blocking chathams way and in the glare of passing headlights chatham realized that the mans ordinaryseeming build was actually sinewy and lithe feeling the exhaustladen wind from the rushing traffic chatham concluded that this man was probably more in condition than even the best of his bodyguards so now chatham asked we wait but not for long you heard me say two minutes i misjudged however were ahead of schedule the escort pointed a van sped off the arlington memorial bridge veered from the myriad glinting headlights and stopped at the gravel shoulder a side hatch slid quickly open after you the neutralfaced man indicated chatham clambered in uneasy other neutralfaced men nodded in greeting their attempt at reassurance negated by their weapons as chatham sat between two of them no choice the only place available his escort followed hunkered on the floor and slammed the hatch shut the vans engine roared the vehicle skidded from the shoulder gaining traction squealing back into traffic in the passenger seat in front a man spoke into a cellular phone he wasnt followed good you know where to meet us he set down the phone and turned welcome mr chatham thanks for cooperating but was all of this really necessary the stranger merely stared at him as if the answer was selfevident who are you chatham asked tess explained that earlier were friends ill believe that when i see her how soon will it be until we get to where she is the man in front looked amused sooner than you think chatham frowned not understanding at once surprised he did understand when he heard a familiar voice im right behind you eric chatham spun his surprise increasing tess whod been crouched out of sight in the rear compartment rose to sit on a wooden crate a burly ruggedfaced man in a dark blue sportshirt its cuffs folded up appeared beside her tess grinned although to chatham the expression seemed forced and that made him nervous its been a long time good to see you eric chatham scowled ignoring the pleasantry but i thought on the phone you said that these men would take me to where you were hiding im sorry i had to mislead you in case your phone was tapped and you were under surveillance at the memorial the way we arranged your pickup we dont think this van can be followed but if it is the enemy will think its leading them to me they wont suspect im inside they wont attack it attack it and you thought my phone might be tapped chatham shook his head baffled my phones checked every morning who could possibly tap it or for that matter whod dare to take the risk of attacking this van while i was in it the heretics again that disturbing word they didnt hesitate to kill brian hamilton tess said chatham was too shocked to answer he was important so why would they hesitate to kill the director of the fbi to get at me tess said to achieve their goal to stop me from revealing their secret theyll do anything what are you talking about secrets heretics tess handed him several photographs and a penlight more baffled chatham used the light to examine the photographs all the while conscious that the neutralfaced men watched him intensely one of the images made chatham grimace a man on a bull slicing its throat a sculpture where did youve never seen anything like it before tess asked no of course not my god id certainly remember something this grotesque the neutralfaced men kept staring at him tess i showed good faith i came alone i did everything you asked now for heavens sake tell me what this is all about the man in front interrupted how did you know that tess and lieutenant craig were supposed to contact the alexandria police i didnt chatham said that doesnt make sense chatham heard behind him chatham whirled reflexively to face the ruggedlooking man next to tess you phoned chief farley the man said why chatham felt disoriented having glanced forward then back from the neutralfaced man in front to the ruggedfaced man in the rear are you lieutenant craig answer my question the burly mans voice was gravelly if you didnt know that tess and i were supposed to contact chief farley why did you phone him because i promised i would tess leaned suddenly near her strong fingers clutching chatham s arm promised who kenneth madden maddenthe man in front spoke abruptly from the cia chatham spun in the forward direction his mind reeling even more disoriented yes the deputy director of covert operations whats he got to do with why would madden ask you to phone the alexandria police because the cia doesnt have domestic jurisdiction it was easier and it raised less questions if the bureau got in touch with the local police why the rugged man next to tess demanded it comes down to pride the local police dont like us to get involved if the crimes not the kind that automatically makes it our business but the alexandria police would have liked it even less if the cia tried to get involved that for sure would have caused hard feelings not to mention a lot of angry phone calls the point is chatham jerked his gaze from the rugged man in back toward tess beside him you dont understand how much your fathers friends are concerned about you theyre shocked about your mothers death theyre afraid that youre in danger so they used the system they asked me to contact the alexandria police the logical lawenforcement officials youd ask for protection but your fathers friends want to give you greater protection by friends you mean the cia and kenneth madden from the front seat the neutralfaced mans stern voice made chatham whirl again thats right chatham said for tess for the sake of her fathers memory but what you still dont understand is that the urge to protect her goes far beyond the bureau and the agency much much higher where to the white house tess spoke and chatham whirled yet again youre telling me tess squeezed chatham s arm moreseverely that the president himself knows im in danger and wants to protect me no the vice president alan gerrard the burly man next to tess looked puzzled hey i know what the columnists write about him chatham said but at least he cares he told madden to get in touch with me and madden in turn asked me to phone chief farley im never happy working with the agency their mandate is foreign ours is here at home and its important to keep those jurisdictions separate but when i get an order from the vice president as long as im not being asked to break the law i do my best to comply the basic message is im supposed to have tess call madden and madden claims hell protect her the man in front asked no maddens just a relay its the vice president who wants to protect her and that means i assume that he intends to use the secret service tess shook her head why would he take such an interest in me i told you because of your father like so many government officials gerrard felt close to your father and gerrard wants the government to pay back its debt to your father for his bravery and his refusal to talk under torture by making sure youre protected as the van crossed back toward virginia its occupants silently considered what chatham had just explained headlights flashed past in the opposite lanes chatham broke the silence who are these heretics you keep mentioning tess glanced toward the man in front her eyebrows raised as if asking permission the man nodded you know the limitations tess sighed eric i hope youve got an open mind after several years as the bureaus director not much surprises me anymore go ahead try me in twelve fortyfour it took a half hour chatham listened astonished never interrupting in the end he once more used the penlight to study the photograph of the basrelief statue and thats all of it theres nothing more not quite the man in the front said but its all you need to know i assume the rest of it concerns you and your involvement in this chatham said dont assume anything what you already know is enough to put you in danger further knowledge would put you at an even greater risk what do you intend to do to be honest if i hadnt seen these photographs if tess herself hadnt been the one who told me about this its true eric every word of it tess stared emphatically into his eyes but something this outrageous obviously i have to verify it then youll begin an investigation absolutely i hope discreetly the man in front said do it yourself trust no one the vermin hide where you least suspect them remember what happened to brian hamilton if youre not cautious youll be their next victim give me credit i wasnt always a bureaucrat chatham said proudly for thirteen years before i became an executive i was a damned fine agent i havent forgotten how to conduct an investigation without drawing attention to myself then do it the man in front said prove how skilled you are how can i get in touch with you how do i report what ive learned no problem well get in touch with you and expertly im sure but i dont know why i should trust you chatham said because of remington drake melinda drake brian hamilton and tess by all means because of tess because of the living well need maddens phone number here this card has his private number chatham frowned but i still cant adjust to the implications if youre right if this isnt a delusion then madden and gerrard the cias covertop deputy director and the presidents nextinline might be part of this as i told you the vermin hide where you least suspect them the man in front glanced through the windshield ah i see that our timing is perfect the minute we complete our business we arrive outside your home by the way your car has been moved from the parking lot at the lincoln memorial youll find it outside your garage and ill take a guess that the man who delivered it resembled me precisely he strolled toward the back of your house and disappeared i wish you worked for me chatham said be satisfied were working with you as the van stopped the man whod escorted chatham from the lincoln memorial slid open the side hatch got out and gestured for the bureaus director to leave well i cant say ive enjoyed the ride chatham said but it certainly has been informative no matter how disturbing it was what we hoped youd feel is not so much disturbed as the man in front hesitated frightened yes then chatham said youve definitely achieved your intention three as the van pulled away from the shadowy curb as tess craig and the members of father baldwins team watched chatham walk past his car in the driveway and enter his large attractive house father baldwin asked is he one of them thats hard to know craig said i looked at him closely he doesnt have gray eyes that means nothing father baldwin said only some of the vermin retain that characteristic whats more they sometimes use tinted contact lenses to disguise the color of their irises i watched chatham closely as well tess said he responded the way he should have to what i told him he was believable of course father baldwin said a true professional is always believable i take that for granted so i dont know whether to trust him thats why in his absence his phone has been tapped his home has been bugged and so has his office he brags that his security measures are checked every morning but his precautions are hardly adequate against our own techniques from this moment every word that he says will be monitored hell be followed by the finest surveillance and if he makes the wrong phone call if he sees the wrong person if he says the wrong words well know that hes one of the vermin but i dont think he is tess said that remains to be determined father baldwin said what also remains to be determined is the status of kenneth madden and alan gerrard we keep moving upward perhaps those nexttothe highest officials in the cia and the white house are as wellintentioned as you want to believe that chatham is but the vermin give off an odor and my nostrils feel assaulted the odor is very strong make the call to madden yes follow the the schedule you were given proceed up the bureaucratic level well find the vermin eventually all i want is to stay alive tess said im not sure i want to keep taking the risk of remember theyll kill you unless you give us the chance to exterminate them but if i make the call and i go through the cia through madden and then to the executive branch to gerrard ill still be in danger tess said craig and i will be with you though father baldwin said and keep in mind the shoes that both of you were given have homing devices in the heels along with microphones my operatives will always know where you are and whether youre in danger small comfort if im being killed while your men try to get to me tess without us your death is certain with us you and lieutenant craig will have a chance to enjoy the rest of your lives together thats good enough for me craig said come on tess we cant give up as long as were being hunted lets fight the bastards and if we fail at least well have done our best theres no other choice but im so scared i know for what its worth so am i craig hugged her make that phone call father baldwin said to madden and after that to four andrews air force base maryland one am nearly blinded by spotlights tess and craig stopped their hastily rented car at the heavily guarded entrance to the tall chainlink barbed wiretopped fence of the military airport a broadshouldered wary sentry responded immediately not needing to check the list of names on his clipboard when tess and craig identified themselves by all means youre expected id he demanded adding with stern courtesy please tess and craig showed their drivers licenses the sentry examined the documents compared their faces with the photographs on the licenses and gave them directions toward the bases vip wing while tess drove beneath the entrances rising barrier she and craig heard the roar of a jet taking off beyond rows of institutionallooking buildings from which other spotlights blazed father baldwin lied tess said he promised hed be with us what option did he have craig spread his hands baldwin couldnt come with us not when madden told you to meet the vice president here at andrews you and i have worked together long enough that i wont attract suspicion but if we bring a stranger an unexpected third party itll look like a setup we couldnt explain father baldwins presence hed never survive a background check and if gerrard is your enemy wed make him realize we suspected him wed be placing ourselves in a trap youre telling me were not in a trap tess drove nervously toward the impressive floodlit vip building father baldwins men cant possibly get inside this base if we need help with so many sentries around nothings going to happen not here at least not now you trust those sentries they work for the air force not for gerrard himself they cant all be enemies but what about later tess shuddered what are we doing here why did madden tell us to come to this airport suppose gerrard tells us to get on a jet craig thought about it we dont know for sure that gerrard wants to kill you or madden either all were doing is following the sequence we were given chatham to madden to gerrard they sound like a fucking baseball team just keep control craig said hey im not used to risking my life the way you are used to risking my life when i started out in a squad car patrolling the bronx i never got used to it and even in missing persons i still havent every day i wake up knowing that any door i knock on might have a maniac with a gun behind it well we have plenty of guns around us now tess stopped the rented plymouth before palmraised sentries next to the vip building names please one of them said tess and craig repeated the ritual identification again they obeyed get out of the car please the sentries used portable metal detectors to scan them when one of the detectors wailed a sentry stared aggressively toward craig im a new york city police officer craig said im carrying my service revolver not anymore the sentry tugged the revolver from the holster on craigs belt tess who didnt have a permit to carry a handgun had reluctantly left her pistol with father baldwin she felt helpless vulnerable distracted by the search she hadnt noticed a man in an expensive welltailored suit walk toward her appearing as if from nowhere he was tall pleasantly featured in his thirties with short brown hair cheery eyes and an engaging smile ms drake lieutenant craig welcome he shook hands with them im hugh kelly the vice presidents assistant you arrived just in time the vice presidents looking forward to seeing you kellys reassuring manner made tess feel somewhat at ease after the chaos shed been through he seemed so normal so sane that she began to wonder if she was wrong to suspect that gerrard was a threat at the same time kellys remark about just in time puzzled her please come with me he said tess expected that hed lead them into the vip building instead he guided them onto the tarmac and after a brief walk tess peered ahead toward floodlights and something that abruptly made her falter my god she said impressive isnt it kelly said its been on order since nineteen eightysix the delays have been a headache the costoverruns a political embarrassment from two hundred and sixtyfive million to six hundred and fifty million but finally here she is and i have to say in spite of everything the wait was worth it what tess stared at overwhelmed was an aircraft six stories high and so long it would have dwarfed a football field the hughest shed ever seen its lines including the bulge above its nose incredibly sleek exuding power a large american flag painted on its rudder the words united states of america stencilled boldly along its side its color predominantly white with highlights of blue ive never seen tess felt so awestruck that she couldnt speak for a moment even when my father was alive i never saw on tv yes in newspapers and magazines but never in person up close like this its hard to believe it takes my breath away she spoke with reverence air force one actually air force two kelly said but you really cant tell them apart of course the pictures you saw were of the old one the sevenohseven it had to be retired because that model was being phased out and spare parts were hard to find it was an awfully fine aircraft i was sorry to see it go but that plane cant possibly compare to this new one and its counterpart boeing outdid itself this is truly one of the finest passenger jets in the world perhaps the finest youll see what i mean when you board her board craig asked in surprise you mean you werent told kelly sounded equally surprised our only instructions were to come to andrews air force base as soon as possible i wondered why you hadnt brought luggage dont worry you wont have to rough it weve got plenty of overnight kits tooth brushes shampoo razors kelly glanced politely toward tess more personal items and a bathtubshower whatever you need but tess hesitated aware of the miniature radio transmitter built into her shoe conscious that father baldwin would be listening that hed be as anxious to know the answer to her question as she was where are we going spain the word made tess feel lightheaded spain where father baldwin had said that the heretics fleeing france had found a new home after the attack on montsegur in spain did that mean gerrard was her enemy or was her destination merely a coincidence tess felt frozen at once regaining control of her muscles she braced herself all of her instincts made her want to turn and run but to where and howl the sentries would stop her shed never be able to get off the base she fidgeted is something wrong kelly asked no tess tried to recover to seem natural im just surprised is all everythings happening so fast two hours ago i didnt expect to be coming here and now you tell me im flying to spain i understand what you mean about feeling surprised kelly said until just after midnight i wasnt aware wed be having visitors he checked his gold rolex watch wed better hurry in ten minutes were scheduled to be airborne tess pivoted toward craig keeping her face calm but knowing that her eyes revealed her panic craig squeezed her hand his eyes communicating were stuck weve got to go through with this kelly gestured leading them onward toward the brightly lit jet they reached a tall boarding ramp on wheels tess climbed counting twentysix steps and entered an open hatch behind a massive sweptback wing once inside sickened by her speeding pulse she realized that there was no turning back behind below her on the tarmac airforce personnel pulled away the boarding platform inside the jet a uniformed flight attendant shut the hatch and secured it she was trapped on air force two five as she studied her surroundings tess noticed that the cabins width was emphasized by its reduced length ahead and behind bulkheads with doors restricted the space the seats she counted seventy resembled firstclass airline accommodations except that they were even larger more comfortable looking and the aisles seemed wider than usual numerous phones were attached to the fore and aft bulkheads this must be where the press and the presidents in this case the vice presidents team stayed tess thought although she was puzzled that the cabin was empty except for the uniformed flight attendant well be taking off soon the attendant said but i think you have time to enjoy a glass of champagne mineral water will be fine tess said same for me craig said what are you serving kelly asked the attendant dom perignon ill have some very good sir in the meantime kelly said id better tell the vice president that his guests have arrived he walked toward the front of the cabin knocked on the door and waited a discreet pause later he knocked again the door opened sir theyre here kelly said excellent a sonorous voice said the door swung quickly farther open alan gerrard stepped through although tess had seen gerrard often at receptions at her parents home and sometimes at less formal gettogethers she hadnt met him since hed become vice president as he approached her smiling he looked the same moviestar handsome with a perfect tan glinting teeth photogenic features and magnificent hair the only difference was that six years had made him look more responsible more wise more seasoned despite his reputation for caring more about tennis than he did about politics no matter regardless of her suspicions about him tess couldnt help responding to his aura of achievement the vice president in her mind the words had magic she almost surrendered to his influence but didnt she had to keep reminding herself that he was very possibly her enemy gerrard wore casual but impressive clothes handsewn loafers finely pressed linen slacks a custommade sea island cotton shirt greens and browns coming nearer he held out his arms tess he embraced her kissing her cheek with affection reassurance and sorrow your mother he shook his head shes a great loss to everyone to every politician including me who ever enjoyed her gracious hospitality but most of all shes a loss to you shell be a legend of strength of generosity in this jaded community that needs every example of excellence they can possibly find to show them the proper way tess stepped back rubbing her tearstinging eyes she resolved that the best least suspicious most natural thing to do was to treat him the way she had before her father had died thanks alan but dont you think the rhetorics a little extreme youre not campaigning after all your sympathy is appreciated really but a simple straightforward im sorry will do gerrard studied her evidently not used to irreverence at once his eyes twinkled blue tess noticed although the one on the right looked irritated streaked with red good im glad to see youre keeping up your spirits he said still as feisty as the last time i saw you i guess i cant help it i got it from my parents and god bless both of them theyre sorely missed lieutenant craig i understand youve been a tremendous help to tess in her danger and her grief youre welcome here thank you the uniformed attendant brought glasses of mineral water to tess and craig dom perignon for kelly gerrard seemed slightly selfconscious while they sipped well he rubbed his hands together before i explain before we strap on our seatbelts for takeoff why dont i show you the rest of the plane im very proud of it tess desperately didnt care but she acquiesced lead the way alan she hoped that her voice didnt tremble itll be a pleasure and a privilege with gracious movements gerrard proceeded toward the forward bulkhead and revealed his quarters tess in spite of her fear was amazed by the luxurious accommodations electric window curtains a lavatory a showertub a vanity closets twin beds a tv system capable of receiving eight channels simultaneously including images from onboard remotecontrol cameras so gerrard could assess waiting crowds before he left the aircraft and two unusual hooks on the bedroom ceiling tess pointed toward them confused those yes those they sometimes keep me awake at night gerrard said their implication i dont like to think about them theyre hooks for intravenous lines in case im to put it delicately injured this jet also has a minihospital he paused somber and a place for a coffin but his expression brightened lets not be morbid theres a great deal more for you to see he escorted them back through the central cabin toward the rear bulkheads door and beyond it tess became even more impressed shed wondered why the seats in the central cabin werent occupied now she understood in a conference room that looked as if it belonged in a fortune corporations headquarters a dozen men sat in highbacked upholstered chairs along a large rectangular table secret service agents gerrard explained they were doublechecking their tactics to protect him when he arrived in spain phones and computers allowed them to coordinate their plans with the spanish equivalent of the secret service spain again the word sent tremors through tess she struggled urgently not to show her fear in a farther room she saw another dozen men vicepresidential aides using more phones and computers as well as printers and copying machines to polish speeches verify itineraries and prepare news releases tv monitors flanked one bulkhead leaving his aides to their work gerrard took tess craig and kelly back to the central cabin theres more much more he said a press room although on this trip im not allowing reporters two galleys with gourmet cooks who can serve us trout almandine or anything else we want enough food for a week a missile avoidance system special shielding to protect the jets controls from electromagnetic bursts from nuclear explosions eightyfive telephones fiftyseven antennas a sixchannel stereo system two hundred and thirtyeight miles of wiring a crew of twentythree their quarters are above us here i know that tess doesnt smoke and lieutenant craig my researchers tell me you wisely gave it up although i can still hear the congestion in your lungs but as souvenirs why dont you take these tess gasped and stared down at a packet of matches they were labelled aboard air force two as well she received napkins memo pads and playing cards with the same inscription i dont know what to say craig shook his head with apparent gratitude im honored ive never been much for collecting souvenirs but ill treasure these he pocketed the objects the next instant he abruptly swung his attention toward the increasing shriek of the jets four engines it seems that were about ready gerrard said a servant took their glasses your attention please a voice said through the intercom were cleared for takeoff all passengers be seated ten seconds later the secret service agents as well as gerrards aides came through the aft door chose seats and buckled themselves securely tess and craig did the same i usually stay in my cabin during takeoff but with the two of you on board its a special occasion if youll allow me gerrard took a seat beside them as a flight attendant explained the exits and the escape procedures for this boeing the vice president leaned toward tess obviously youre curious he said why did i send for you you must be wondering why are you here en route to spain tess resisted the drop in her stomach as air force two moved smoothly across the tarmac toward the takeoff strip she knew that the jets special shielding prevented father baldwin from hearing the transmission from the miniature radio built into the heel of one of her shoes all the same she had to know thats right alan what are we doing here the jet reached the runway its four engines gaining power roaring now instead of shrieking propelling the aircraft with such force that tess was shoved back against her seat at once the nose tilted toward the sky now the pressure tess felt was downward again as the gained altitude at the same time from beneath the fuselage she heard a whir and thump as the wheels retracted into the wings and undercarriage craig had the window seat but tess was able by leaning across him to peer out amazingly soon the lights of andrews air force base became glowing specks far below cities blazed to the right and left then the night enveloped the aircraft the reason im here gerrard said the reason im flying to spain is that the spanish president died this morning a heart attack a tragic loss not only to spain but the european economic community im being sent as americas official representative at the funeral but you and lieutenant craig are here because i cant think of any place safer for you than aboard this plane if air force two can survive a nuclear war the two of you certainly dont need to worry about being attacked while youre with me all these secret service agents ive instructed them to make sure youre not harmed until we sort out this mess your protection is guaranteed the logic was attractive if tess hadnt felt ambivalent toward gerrard if she hadnt been worried that he was an enemy her fears would have been subdued in theory in the present circumstances she was absolutely protected as safe as possible since your mothers home was attacked last night gerrard said ive had my investigators working overtime ive learned about the death of your friend in manhattan last saturday night burned he shook his head appalled ive also learned that you and lieutenant craig have been trying to determine why he was killed tess debated then nodded in agreement gerrard continued you flew to washington to see your mother in alexandria yesterday evening which makes me suspect that you planned to use your fathers contacts to help you investigate and which in turn also makes me suspect that the attack on your mothers house and the attack on your friend are related that youre the common denominator more i believe that brian hamiltons death has something to do with this my investigators found out from his secretary that you called brian at his office yesterday and that he missed a reception for the soviet ambassador last night so he could visit your mother translation to visit you after you spoke with brian he was killed in a freeway accident while en route to see the fbi director i know that brian phoned from his car and asked for that appointment because the fbi director told kenneth madden at arlington cemetery this afternoon and madden later told me finally an attack similar to the one at your mothers house occurred in washington this afternoon the owners of the house are missing but one of them professor richard harding taught you art history at georgetown university again youre the common denominator the coincidence troubles me were you there tess no dont look away this is too important tell me be honest were you at professor hardings home this afternoon tess slowly reluctantly nodded again inwardly flinching at the memory of the nightmare the pattern is obvious tess to be blunt whos so desperate to kill you and in the process to kill the people youve recently contacted why it almost makes me nervous to be in touch with you myself gerrards latter remark was obviously somewhat exaggerated given the presence of the secret service no matter the vice president continued to look intense your investigators are very thorough alan thats why they work for me theyre the best then maybe theyve figured out why im in danger no otherwise i wouldnt be asking you is it the heretics do they want to kill you tess felt her cheeks turn pale the heretics she hadnt expected she couldnt believe straining to keep her breathing steady she managed only to stare your friend who was burned in manhattan my investigators conducted an indepth background check he was a heretic gerrard said weve known about them for some time at first there were merely rumors international gossip but then a pattern began to be evident unusual diplomatic decisions puzzling changes in the policy of foreign nations especially in europe assassinations unexpected deaths of foreign diplomats perhaps even the death of the spanish president something we dont know what is happening blackmail extortion votes are controlled politicians are subjected to irresistible pressure major industries are afraid because several top executives have been murdered its not the soviets that systems collapsing its something else a new threat looms now that the cold war seems to be over all because of a group of fanatics who somehow survived from the middle ages and decided to preserve their religious theories by disguising themselves and burrowing into the mainstream of international corporations and major governments we have trouble identifying the heretics theyve had centuries of practise in hiding but we recognize their trail and we know that theyre determined to destroy both democracy and capitalism they might be a greater threat than the soviets whom i still think are raising a smoke screen and trying to conceal their true aggressive intentions ever were the evil empire tess said the reagan administration was obsessed with that idea dont tell me this administration also believes that the soviets to hell with the soviets for all i know im wrong to think theyre trying to deceive us it could be that the heretics have taken charge over there and are responsible for the downfall of the communist party what im talking about is with a mighty thrust then a slight change of tone from the engines air force two stopped rising settled and maintained a level altitude the seatbelt light was extinguished from a microphone a voice said all passengers are free to move throughout the aircraft in case of turbulence of which youll have ample warning return to your seats and refasten your belts in an instant the secret service agents followed by the vice presidents aides exited hastily through the rear door to continue their duties gerrard leaned sideways tess what im asking is do you believe that the heretics are the people who want to kill you because of your friendship with one of them because theyre afraid youve learned too much about them tess fought to conceal her shock she hadnt known what to expect when gerrard brought craig and her aboard air force two for certain shed never expected that gerrard himself would raise the subject of the heretics what the vice president had just told her about them the extent of their conspiracy was more than she already knew maybe she was wrong about him did it make sense for him to be so open to reveal so much if he was one of them or was he using candor to gain her confidence to mute her suspicions in a quandary tess decided that she couldnt pretend to be ignorant she had to follow his lead as near as i can figure alan the answer is yes but the truth is although i stumbled across them i hardly know anything about them she reached in her purse and showed him the photograph of the statue this is the only evidence i have i found the statue in my friends bedroom but later it was stolen the reason i went to see professor harding was that i hoped he could tell me what it meant and did he his wife did the man on the bull is a god named mithras the serpent the dog and the scorpion represent his evil counterpart theyre trying to stop the blood from reaching the ground the wheat from growing the bull from being fertile that information and the fact that the heretics survived a purge in the middle ages and then infiltrated various governments to stop the purge is all i know gerrard squinted then its who you are not what you know that they believe threatens them theyre afraid youll use your influence with your fathers friends including me to expose them the terrible irony is that their killings have been needless that their desperate efforts are wasted since we already know a great deal more than you do about them your mother and brian hamilton didnt have to die what a waste im so sorry tess tesss throat ached again from grief at the same time she retained sufficient presence of mind to wonder why if the inner circle of the government knew about the heretics eric chatham had claimed to be ignorant about them surely the director of the fbi would have a major role in investigating them had chatham been so suspicious of father baldwins group that hed decided to pretend he knew nothing about the heretics as she considered the possibilities uncertainty made her dizzy what appeared to be sincerity might be deception and apparent deception might very well be sincerity her consciousness felt clouded her sense of reality was threatened gerrard distracted her by clasping her hand i promise you this ill use all my power to make them pay for what they did to your mother thank you alan if only this nightmare would end thats another promise ill do my best to see that it does end the cabin became still except for the slight vibration caused by the engines gerrard glanced beyond tess his attention devoted to craig lieutenant my investigators tell me that youre fond of opera true craig frowned no need to be puzzled my staff is thorough as i explained but what does opera have to do with if youll reach in the seat pocket before you craig searched and found a set of earphones put them on gerrard said insert their extension into the console beside you turn the dial to channel five youll hear what is the greatest opera of all verdis otello verdis good but ive always preferred puccini i wasnt told that im sorry on this flight all the operas we have are by verdi mozart and wagner verdi will do just fine craig coughed the thing is while i listen tess and i will take other seats we havent seen each other in too many years we have memories to share private matters to discuss craig straightened nervously executive privilege gerrard said enjoy the opera tess he stood its late she stood as well madrids a long way youll be exhausted if you dont get some sleep alan and im already exhausted no offense ill want to lean against craigs shoulder soon and doze off ill be waiting craig said we wont be long gerrard said its just a little story i want to tell her i hope its as fascinating as the opera craig said more so gerrard said well she cant ask for better than that craig put on his earphones knowing the tension that craig fought not to reveal tess allowed gerrard to guide her toward one of many empty seats in the rear of the cabin and now actually i have two stories gerrard said ones about vinegar the others about frogs vinegar frogs youre confusing me alan youll understand when i finish six to begin gerrard said as they buckled their seatbelts im told that since i last saw you since you graduated from college youve become an environmentalist not just in your attitudes but as your profession youre a staff writer for earth mother magazine thats right tess said i confess i havent read the magazine but my investigators searched through several back issues they tell me your articles are very informative the writing quite accomplished they particularly mentioned how impressed they were with an essay youd written on the alarmingly rapid disappearance of wetlands and the rare species that inhabit them what struck my investigators was that it wasnt a topic they would have expected to find interesting but you made it so and indeed convinced them of how important those wetlands were the photographs that accompanied the article taken by you were exceptional they said and made them realize how beautiful the rare insects birds and fish that inhabit those wetlands are what a loss to the planet theyd be to the worlds ecology thank them for the compliment tess said now if theyd just follow through and donate to organizations devoted to preserving those wetlands as a matter of fact they did tess felt gratified please thank them twice i will now heres the point even though i havent read mother earth magazine im an environmentalist as well you may have read about the controversy i caused when i voted against the president to break the tie on the senates rigid cleanair bill i did tess said and i have to say i was impressed you did the right thing the president has a different opinion you wouldnt want to have been in the oval office when he chewed me out for being disloyal what he doesnt know is that in matters about the environment ill continue to be disloyal even if it means he chooses someone else as a running mate in the next election there comes a time when you have to take a stand no matter the personal cost tess felt her suspicions dwindling despite her fear gerrard had begun to win her respect hed be making a mistake if he dumped you write him a letter tell him so gerrard chuckled a few moments later he sobered because youre an expert in these matters maybe you know this story but ill tell it to you anyhow he was interrupted a voice asked sir would you care for a drink gerrard glanced up a flight attendant stood beside him the usual orange juice sounds good to me tess said as the flight attendant departed gerrard said theres a man i beard about who lives in iowa a farmer his names ben gould hes a member of the national audubon society hes also an amateur climatologist near his barn hes got a shed with a raingauge barometer wind indicator and various other weatheranalysis instruments two summers ago after an extended period of drought that just about killed his corn and soybeans his farm was blessed with several days of heavy rain or at least gould thought his farm had been blessed he put on rubber boots and slogged through mud to his weather shack his rain gauge was almost full he poured its contents into a sterile container carried the container into his shack and dumped the liquid into an instrument that analyses the chemical contents of water this instrument was computerized red numbers glowed on a console two point five the flight attendant handed tess and gerrard glasses of orange juice along with napkins they nodded their thanks two point five gerrard repeated what those numbers represented was the ph of the rain the level of acid the rule is the lower the number the higher the acid pure rainwater registers at five point three but two point five gould was shocked he told himself that there had to be a mistake so he doublechecked his readings using rain from another gauge but the instruments console showed the same numbers two point five thats the acidic level of vinegar gould suddenly realized why his crops looked stunted vinegar thats what you put on a salad not on your crops it could rain every week and goulds crops would still look stunted in a panic he examined his wind charts global warming and its erratic effects had caused the jet stream to veer unusually southward into new mexico then across iowa new mexicos copper smelters are notorious for spewing outrageous amounts of sulphur fumes into the atmosphere those sulphur fumes as you know produce acid rain and acid rain in never before such intense concentration was poisoning goulds land pausing gerrard sipped his orange juice anyway thats my story about vinegar i wish i could say it had a climax a happy ending but the fact is goulds crops are still being poisoned and there wont be a happy ending until we have legislation that forces those copper smelters and other heavy industries to clean up their act not just legislation in america but worldwide in germany and czechoslovakia for example there are thousands of square kilometers of woodland that have been totally destroyed and blackened by acid rain tess nodded i know about those sections of germany and czechoslovakia but your story about iowa is new to me then write an article on it maybe itll do some good get people thinking motivated enough to write to their congressional representative demanding controls i will tess said poisoned forests dont seem to bother people unless they see the devastation but a personal story like goulds might make the crisis vivid and while youre at it write the other story im about to tell you the one about the frogs gerrard drained his glass of orange juice and set it down the main character in this one is a biologist named ralph mcqueen his specialty is amphibians and each year he likes to make a field trip into the sierra nevadas a decade ago he checked thirtyeight lakes and found them teeming with yellowlegged frogs last summer when he went back he couldnt believe what he found or rather didnt find the frogs had vanished from all but one of those lakes in shock he tried to discover why theyd vanished his best guess was that some kind of deadly virus had wiped out almost the entire local population but when he went to a herpetology convention in brussels last fall his shock became greater it turns out that the sierra nevadas arent the only area where frogs are disappearing from colleagues he learned that the same thing was happening all over the united states and indeed all over the world in costa rica japan europe australia africa indonesia malaysia south america everywhere the frogs are dying and no ones quite sure why acid rain pesticides water pollution air pollution global warming too many ultraviolet rays caused by the hole in the ozone layer maybe all of those its hard to say but the interesting thing about frogs is that they dont have scales to protect them and they breathe through their skin which is very sensitive that makes them extremely vulnerable to damaging changes in the environment it used to be that coal miners took a caged canary into the shaft they were working on if odorless poisonous gases built up theyd know because the canary so small would die first the miners would have a chance to run from the shaft gerrard furrowed his brow possibly the frogs are canaries for the planet their massive extinction might be a warning that somethings very wrong whats more their extinction could have disastrous effects on the worlds ecology the frogs eat huge amounts of insects without them flies and mosquitoes to name just a few will breed out of control at the same time larger life forms such as birds and animals depend on the frogs for food without the frogs those other life forms will die frogs gerrard shook his head so seemingly trivial so formerly common so much a part of nature that we hardly noticed them i suppose a lot of people could care less if theyre dying but what those people dont realize is that the frogs are an environmental cornerstone and without them gerrards voice dropped his tone despondent write it tess an epitaph for the frogs for the songs they no longer sing a warning to everyone who still hasnt realized how endangered the world has become i will i promise gerrard clasped her hand once more i told you those stories not just because we share the same concerns or because the stories relate to your work i had another motive one that involves the heretics startled by the mention of the word tess came to greater attention what i didnt indicate earlier gerrard said is that as much as we can determine the heretics conspiracy to terrorize corporations and infiltrate governments to assassinate politicians and replace them with the heretics own representatives to blackmail other politicians in order to control their votes on environmental legislation is due to the heretics fear about the safety of the world the photograph you showed me symbolizes their motive gerrard gestured as if tracing an invisible image a good god trying to fertilize the earth an evil god trying to stop it the heretics believe that the evil god has assumed control and is using every effort to destroy the planet again gerrard frowned im sure you can understand the heretics point of view the evidence of the planets destruction is all around us their intentions are the same as yours and mine although their methods of course are repugnant but a part of me i confess sympathizes if a person gets frightened enough if legitimate methods dont work sometimes desperate measures are required i dont approve but i do identify with their desperation the same desperation that forced me to vote against the president and for the senates cleanair bill what im getting at is that good and evil arent always as easily distinguishable as they might seem if the heretics manage to save the planet perhaps in the long run their methods are justified i really dont know im a politician not an expert in ethics but ill tell you this there are times when i hesitate when i question how much force we should use to hunt them if my children live to have grandchildren and those grandchildren breathe clean air drink pure water eat uncontaminated food and flourish maybe the heretics will have been right i just dont know he studied tess waiting for her reaction tess took a while to answer mustering organizing her thoughts i understand what you mean alan like you a part of me identifies with the heretics or at least with their motives irresponsible corporations ought to be made accountable indifferent politicians ought to be removed from government theres a global crisis and it has to be faced to be dealt with and solved but murder alan extortion lives ruined families in grief ive never supported capital punishment although i did feel the urge to strangle the captain of the pacificrim oil tanker who allowed his alcoholism to impair his judgement and capsize his tanker so its cargo polluted the great barrier reef but ive never met that captain i dont know him i dont know his virtues and his strengths so its easy enough for me to hate him from a distance this much i do know my friend who was burned in new york he didnt agree with extortion and murder and brian hamilton never did anything to endanger the environment and my mother god bless her soul was just a simpleminded heartsick pampered pathetic socialite who never did anything to harm anyone in spite of her failings i loved her deeply when the heretics murdered her i can still see the blood flying out of her back just so they could try to get at me when they did that they made this very personal capital punishment no i dont believe in it but revenge alan after what ive been through after the horror of the past few days id like nothing better than to hunt them down and pay them back didnt you promise me that earlier to help me pay them back gerrard nodded so what it comes down to alan is that i dont care if the heretics share my commitment to save the world theyre bastards theyre evil in fact more evil than the evil god they believe theyre fighting theyre twisted sons of bitches and ill do everything i can to put them in hell which is where they belong and less than what they deserve maybe this planet isnt worth protecting if good gets confused with murder and my mother dies because of that gerrard stared then sighed of course thats exactly what i anticipated you to say by all means i agree i was just pointing out the moral complexities he glanced at his watch its late he stood im pleased that we had this talk but tomorrow i have obligations to face if youll excuse me yes were both exhausted but before you leave tess said your personal assistant mentioned something about tooth brushes an overnight kit a showertub a place to im afraid i have to pee gerrard blushed our flight attendant will take care of everything you need thanks alan and it is good to see you again youre the most welcome guest ive had on air force two tess waited until gerrard disappeared through the forward door into his private cabin then she spoke to the flight attendant who escorted her toward a bathroom in the rear of the plane ten minutes later she reentered the central cabin buckled her seatbelt and nestled next to craig he was still awake removing his earphones from which tess heard muted opera craig asked how did it go confusing complicated disturbing but im too tired to ill tell you later with her head against craigs shoulder tess closed her eyes and quickly fell asleep only to waken several times shuddering from premonitions seven the flight to spain took five hours but with the added five hours in timezone changes it was just before eleven am when the jet reached madrid peering down at the airport tess was struck by how hazy the air looked for a moment she didnt understand why the smog should be worse here than in new york then she remembered that in europe most cars werent equipped with emission controls and that spain like the rest of the continent still hadnt converted to the widespread use of unleaded gas the dirtier leaded gas was fouling the sky she instantly remembered something else gerrards insistence last night on the need for international standards to protect the environment as the massive touched down with remarkable smoothness he noticed the airports terminal to her right but air force two did not approach it instead proceeded to a remote section of the tarmac and came to a stop the shriek of its engines dying several cars rapidly flanked it armed men scrambling out to position themselves with their backs to the jet their assault rifles aimed outward to guard it at the same time a black limousine with a diplomatic flag mounted and fluttering on the side of its hood cruised toward a boarding platform that an airport crew rolled against one of the planes forward hatches the occupants of the central cabin burst into motion unbuckling their seatbelts secret service agents hurried to enter the forward compartment while the vice presidents aides speedily returned to their office in the rear tess and craig crossed to the left of the plane curious they peered out a window from which they saw a uniformed chauffeur open a back door on the limousine two distinguishedlooking grayhaired diplomatically dressed men got out shook hands with gerrards assistant hugh kelly exchanged remarks with him braced their shoulders and climbed the boarding steps to enter the vice presidents quarters and now what craig wondered earlier after a breakfast of fresh fruit and then smoked salmon on a wholewheat bagel that tess had recommended hed brushed his teeth washed his face and shaved even so although hed slept a few hours the long flight in combination with jet lag had wearied him he glanced down at his rumpled clothes not exactly presentable i hope we have a chance to buy something a little more formal so we dont look conspicuous given the company were keeping tess squinted down at her own rumpled blouse and jeans nodding in agreement mostly what she wished she had was a change of underclothes ive got a suspicion that when you travel with the vice president what you ask for someone delivers she flinched an unexpected noise making her turn toward the forward bulkhead the door to the vice presidents cabin swung open alan gerrard appeared wearing an immaculate gray suit striped tie and white shirt his black shoes had been polished to a gleam so gerard said i hope you slept well he rubbed his hands together with enthusiasm are we ready to do what tess asked to get on another plane tess couldnt help feeling surprised the funeral isnt here in madrid the president of spain she frowned in confusion i assumed hed be buried with full state honors in the nations capital well youre right the funeral will be in madrid but it isnt scheduled until two days from now gerrard said i have several important diplomats to see before then but i told the spanish government not to tell the press that id be arriving today theres something i need to do before i begin my duties in fact one of the diplomats i need to see a friend from my former trips here isnt in town theres a strong chance that spains congress of deputies will soon elect him as the countrys new president so were going to board a smaller less conspicuous plane and visit his estate dont look so hesitant his home is a showplace his hospitality is lavish youll enjoy yourselves really with my friends guards as well as my secret service agents youll still be well protected it sounded reasonable tess tried to assure herself but her heart cramped as if ice surrounded it bewildered uneasy she overcame her hesitation and followed gerrard into his cabin craig put an arm around her while they waited for the vice president and the two diplomats descend the stairs to the tarmac below guards surrounded the group as the three men stood near the limousine and shook hands gerrard turned and motioned for tess and craig to come down the planes just over there at the bottom tess stared toward her right she didnt know about planes certainly not enough to be able to identify a model or its manufacturer all she understood was that this one was smaller than she expected streamlined a twoengine executive jet but isnt it dangerous for you to travel in something so unprotected gerrard said you mean because it doesnt have special shielding and all kinds of sophisticated communication equipment he shook his head his blue eyes twinkling with amusement the one on the right looked less irritated im sure youre aware of what the political columnists say about me im so inconsequential in their opinion whod want to kill me but a terrorist might not care about what the columnists say you are the vice president of the united states not to worry gerrard said ive made this side trip before and as far as securitys concerned only a very few trusted officials know that i arrived one day earlier than i was expected i guarantee were safe unable to resist gerrards hand on her arm especially in the crowded presence of the numerous sterneyed guards tess allowed herself to be escorted toward the few steps that led upward through the open hatch into the plane she felt assaulted by claustrophobia seeing only a narrow aisle with a row of single seats on each side seized by alarm she realized that with the pilot the copilot gerrard hugh kelly craig and herself there was room for only five secret service agents to join them her premonition increased as the security around her began to decrease inwardly she winced from the clunking sound the hatch made when the copilot shut and locked it again as she had when shed entered air force two she felt trapped but more so it took all her discipline to keep her fingers from trembling when she fastened her seatbelt opposite gerrard she snuck a nervous glance back to her right toward craig who sat behind gerrard craig winked and that made all the difference tess smiled in return and realized how much shed become attracted to him whatever was going to happen no matter the risk regardless of the possible imminent danger she and craig were in this together and what they felt for each other was great enough that they could survive and defeat any enemy they had to please god help us she prayed please help father baldwin did he manage to follow us to madrid will he be able to receive the signals from the microphone and the homing device built into my shoes and follow us to wherever were being taken the pilot was given clearance for takeoff two minutes later the jet streaked through the smog toward the sky tess felt more helpless trying to seem relaxed she made herself peer out the window as the jet reached its cruising altitude she saw a vast arid plain below her and occasional slopes that rose to low flat plateaus the soil of which had the tint of copper where are we headed she hoped she sounded casual toward spains northern coast gerrard said a district called vizcaya well land in bilbao bilbao she strained to make conversation hoping that father baldwin was listening wasnt there a song about that old bilbao moon yes but that goes back quite a while im surprised you know it im not sure that this bilbao is the one in the song is it far just an hour or so gerrard shrugged time enough for a nap craig leaned forward why didnt the president himself come for the funeral normally he would have gerrard turned therell be many european heads of state here a chance for an unofficial summit but his schedules too complicated hell soon be leaving on a trip that he planned long ago and he cant postpone to peru for a major drugcontrol conference similar to the one he went to in columbia last year you feel nervous so imagine how he feels with all those drug lords determined to assassinate him thats why he cant postpone the trip the president refuses to make it seem as if the drug lords scared him off his braverys remarkable no matter how much he and i dont get along i hope to heaven that nothing happens to him they settled back as the jet sped onward tess closed her eyes and despite her uneasiness tried to follow gerrards advice and nap if her premonitions were justified she knew shed be needing all her strength eight the bump of the wheels touching down awakened her tess rubbed her sleepswollen eyes and peered outside compared to the airport in madrid bilbaos was small its air less hazy perhaps a breeze from the nearby ocean dispersed the exhaust fumes of cars she thought again they avoided the terminal and stopped at a remote section of the tarmac outside gerrard spoke as enthusiastically as he had when theyd left madrid are you ready for another flight another but i thought our destination was bilbao tess continued to hope that father baldwin was listening just so we could change to another aircraft well be heading east now past pamplona tess repressed a cringe remembering that pamplona was close to where priscilla harding had said that shed found images of mithras hidden in caves less sweated wanting to run but again secret service agents flanked her my friends estate doesnt have a landing strip gerrard explained so now well be using this he pointed the sight of the helicopter made tess feel lightheaded powerless weakkneed disturbed by her lack of control she was led aboard and now with increasing panic she discovered that there was space enough only for a pilot gerrard hugh kelly craig herself and two secret service agents her protection kept dwindling her isolation increasing no matter the confidence that her attraction to craig had earlier inspired in her she suddenly felt doomed the helicopters blades whined turning spinning increasing speed until their sound was a whumpwhumpwhumping roar with a mighty surge the helicopter lifted straight up and tess who directed a despairing glance toward craig noticed that his expression was equally intense he didnt wink this time and she didnt smile in return what she did was swallow something hot and bitter she forced herself to pay attention to her surroundings knowing that every detail was important and that she had to regain her discipline study the landscape her mind insisted if you get in trouble youd better know where you are in contrast with the arid flat middle portion of spain this area along the countrys northern coast was lush and hilly the valleys below her were occupied by farms in which stoopshouldered men and women wielded scythes to cut tall grass the men wore trousers longsleeved shirts and wide brimmed hats the women had long dresses and handkerchiefs tied around their heads the absence of motorized farm machinery combined with the slate roofs and stone walls of the buildings made tess feel as if she was experiencing a time warp that she was witnessing a scene from a previous century but those impressions were fleeting brief ineffectual attempts to distract herself from her terror thats pamplona past those hills on the right gerrard said matteroffactly you can just make out a few tops of buildings northeast of us is the frenchspanish border were now in a district called navarra and those mountains ahead are the spanish pyrenees tess wondered fearfully how close the helicopter was to the pyrenees in france to the burnedout ruins of the heretic stronghold on montsegur to the site of the slaughter that the european crusaders had inflicted and from where more than seven hundred years ago after a group of determined heretics had escaped with their precious statue this insanity had begun the mountains were spectacular high rugged limestone cliffs their deep gorges churning with narrow swift rivers their slopes thick with pines and beeches the helicopter thundered nearer the peaks seemed to grow their outcrops more jagged their steep drops more wild how high must they be tess wondered at least seven thousand feet she concluded not as tall as the ranges she was familiar with those in switzerland and colorado where her father had sometimes taken her to ski but these had sharper inclines that made them seem taller and their ravines were more forbidding rugged shed thought earlier wild the words gained emphasis as she stared at a rapidly looming gorge feeling dizzy as she lowered her gaze below amid tangled woods a narrow dirt road wound past random gigantic boulders entering the gorge abruptly she glanced up and stiffened as the helicopter also entered the gorge the whumpwhumpwhump of the rotors intensified by their deafening echo off the craggy wall of rock on each side the passage so seemingly narrow that she feared the blades would collide with an outcrop at once the gorge ended she exhaled relieved then exhaled again when the helicopter began to descend a small valley appeared dense forest encircled grassland and at the center surrounded by a maze of fenced enclosures small buildings flanked a commanding structure toward which the helicopter quickly dipped the structure had stone walls and a slate roof the same as the farmhouses that tess had seen in the fields near pamplona but that was the only similarity because those farmhouses had been small and modest but what she stared at now her uneasiness aggravated by the increasing downward tilt and thrust of the helicopter was so wide and tall so impressive its a castle gerrard explained not the kind you see in england or in france or for that matter anywhere else in europe this is spanish castle in the south they used a moorish design but this type thats common in the north it doesnt have the turrets the parapets the moat and the drawbridge that youd expect its more like a cross between a manor house and a fortress the stone and the slate are barriers against an attack by fire the only exterior wood is at the windows tess strained to make herself heard above the roar of the sharply descending helicopter shutters even from here they look thick gerrard nodded and inside each room theres a set of doors equally thick a farther barrier to keep flames from reaching inside but in theory no one could torch the shutters because as we get closer youll see narrow slits in the fivefootthick stone walls the slits are so narrow that an outside archer couldnt cross the open area around the castle to shoot flaming arrows without being hit by archers within the castle and those defending archers concealed behind those narrow slits were impossible targets as the helicopter slanted lower approaching a landing pad tess noticed animals in the fields horses in some while in others there were your friends a rancher she asked gerrard looked puzzled then the wrinkles in his forehead relaxed ah i understand you think those are cattle theyre not theyre bulls my friend breeds them as a hobby some of them will be used next month in the famous bullfight festival of san fermin in pamplona im sure youve read descriptions of it the skyrocket each morning the frantic bulls being forced to run through the streets the villagers testing their bravery by trying to race ahead of the frightened herd some of the young men falling being trampled and often gored eight days and nights of parties eight afternoons of ritualized death tess indeed had read about it and now that she was close enough she was able to distinguish the characteristics of the animals their muscular flanks their broad humped backs their long curved horns projecting from thickly boned foreheads bulls they were so much a part of spains culture that tess didnt make further connection right away but then she suddenly noticed one particular bull that had been separated from the others magnificent it grazed alone in a field and any doubts tess had about whether gerrard could be trusted any lingering hopes that gerrard was not her enemy were instantly dispelled her mind envisioned the photograph in her purse the image of mithras slicing the throat of a bull a white bull just like the bull that grazed alone in the field a bull that was white the last of her ambivalence about gerrard was resolved terror possessed her made all the worse because as her heart pounded and her breathing quickened she didnt dare let gerrard notice her abrupt panicked understanding it was clear now absolutely certain except for craig everyone in this helicopter was a threat including the two secret service agents she had to assume because gerrard must have had a reason to choose these two agents from all the others she cursed herself for having allowed herself to be swayed last night by gerrards charisma and the environmental concerns that they shared she shouldnt have permitted herself to be tempted to believe that he meant her no harm she should never have spoken so vehemently against the heretics when he tried to convince her that the heretics motives possibly justified desperate measures that the moral issues were complicated gerrard had been trying to make a bargain with her to test and perhaps convert her but shed been so emotionally involved in the conversation that she hadnt grasped its true purpose his attempt to appeal to her logic having failed he now had only one remaining course of action to kill her her terror increasing tess felt her stomach heave as the helicopter set down the wind from its rotors bending grass the roar of the engines diminished to a whine and finally silence gerrard escorted tess outside hugh kelly and the two secret service agents stayed near craig what do they think were going to do tess thought run to where wed never reach the trees the time to run or at least to back off was when we were still at andrews air force base but the plan to determine if gerrard was one of the heretics had seemed so necessary that shed obeyed father baldwins instructions and now it was too late to try to get away from gerrard she and craig were stuck here and their single chance was to try to make a deal tess mentally shook her head no there was another chance that father baldwin and his men would manage to follow the signal from the homing device in her shoe and find her again she prayed pay attention she told herself concentrate be aware of everything the air smelled sweet she savored the fragrance of meadow grass and mountain flowers as well the air was amazingly clear the sky an impressive pure blue she couldnt remember the last time she hadnt breathed smog but these impressions were fleeting what she noticed most was that this circular valley was enclosed by peaks with only one entrance the gorge through which the helicopter had approached were trapped she thought in dismay all the same she refused to give up hope damn it there must be something that craig and i can do to protect ourselves at once gerrard spoke my friend has been waiting hes eager to meet you tess swung a halfdozen laborers had been leaning against a wooden fence examining a group of bulls now one of them stepped away and quickly reached the helicopter he wore dusty boots and sweatstained work clothes a red bandanna around his neck but no matter his common outfit his bearing was unmistakably aristocratic a tall man heavy but in no way fat his arms legs shoulders and chest looked solid wellexercised his face was rectangular tawny with the texture of leather strong more than handsome his broad forehead reminding tess of the bulls she judged him to be in his late forties and shifted her gaze to his thick dark sheeny hair his eyes they were brown tess made a point of noticing glinted when he reached his visitors his smile gleamed señor gerrard buenas tardes mucho gusto cómo está usted muy bien gracias gerrard said y usted excelente the two men embraced slapping each others back when they separated the stranger abruptly changed to english his voice deep and resonant a politicians voice youve stayed away much too long you know youre always welcome here ill try to visit more often gerrard said i look forward to it the stranger ignored the two secret service agents and faced hugh kelly smiling warmly he shook his hand its a pleasure to see you again señor kelly the pleasure is mine bueno bueno and alan these are your friends forgive me for being rude gerrard said tess lieutenant craig this is josé fulano he has a title and a formal version of name thats extremely long but when were not at the conference table we like to keep things unofficial i phoned josé while we flew to madrid and told him youd be coming here with me fulano shook their hands with delight to borrow your american expression any friends of alan are friends of mine youre very welcome my home is at your disposal mi casa su casa whatever you need please dont hesitate to ask sure tess thought what do i need like how the hell do i get out of here but she pretended not to be terrified and gave him her most pleasant smile we appreciate your hospitality señor fulano please im josé your home is magnificent craig said ive never seen a more beautiful setting fulano turned and joined them in their admiration of his property i spend too much time in madrid if i were sane id never leave here he sighed but as alan understands too well the pressures of responsibility dont give us much time to enjoy the truly important things the beauties of life fulano glanced at tess when alan phoned me from air force two he explained that youre an environmentalist youll be pleased to learn that there isnt any pollution here i realized that when we got off the helicopter i feel like im breathing pure oxygen fulano smiled you must be exhausted from your journey youll want to rest to bathe ill show you to your rooms im sure youd also appreciate a change of clothes thank you tess said de nada fulano guided them proudly past an outbuilding toward the castle a cobblestone road bordered by grass led toward it close the building looked less tall than from the air perhaps six stories but its width and depth remained considerable the rocks that made up its walls were huge most of the shutters were open revealing tall spacious windows on the upper floors each window had a balcony with pots of colorful blooming flowers and a wroughtiron railing the bars of which were bent into ornate shapes two thick stone slabs formed steps toward a huge arched double door made of rich dark wood fulano pushed one heavy side open and gestured for tess and craig to enter ahead of him more fearful tess complied but not before she noticed armed sentries at each corner of the building although they pretended to study the road and the fields what they really cared about with surreptitious glances were she and craig the moment tess crossed the threshhold her first impression was of sweat cooling on her brow evidently the temperature outside had been warmer than shed realized the stone of both the walls and the floor made the interior at least ten degrees lower her second impression was of shadows after the bright sun she needed several moments for her eyes to adjust a long sturdy antique wooden table occupied the middle of the entry room complex tapestries depicting woodlands and mountains hung on two walls another tapestry portrayed a bullfight the matador thrusting his sword an ancient suit of armor stood in the far left corner the ceiling amazed her dark polished footsquare beams joined perfectly anchored into the stone walls supported by pillars and occasional transverse beams shed never been in a building that felt more solid this way fulano said graciously he led them across the room up three more slabs of cool stone turned left in a muffled corridor and walked with them up a staircase that was made from the same thick beams that formed the ceiling the echo of their footsteps was absorbed by the substantial wood and stone below and around them the second level was equally amazing a high large open area with a floor and ceiling of massive beams and another long sturdy antique table more tapestries wooden thronelike chairs along the walls between each chair a door this is your room fulano told tess and this is yours he said to craig the doors were widely separated fine craig said but not to be indelicate tess and i are yes fulano asked puzzled together youre telling me that youve fulano raised his eyebrows reached an arrangement yes fulano said by all means forgive my manners this room he told craig and tess is yours youve had a long journey youll no doubt want to rest but at eight oclock please join us in the dining room its down the staircase then left along the corridor we have a surprise for you im eager to see it well clean up and join you at eight craig said bueno nine tess and craig entered the room which was lofty and wide with antique spanish cabinets open doors at the window and an oversized bed its tall headboard matched the rich dark beams of the floor and ceiling craig locked the door tess gripped his arms thank god you craig forcefully put a finger on her lips i bet the view from this room is magnificent those flowers did you notice them on the balcony why dont we take a look it wasnt as if she had a choice craigs hand pressed against her back and urged her toward the balcony past the open doors leaning against the wroughtiron railing they had a view of the cobblestone road and the outbuildings beyond which there were fields bulls in some horses in others then the forest then the towering mountains a scented breeze widened tesss nostrils but that pleasure was irrelevant im sure the room is bugged craig murmured but i dont think the microphones can hear us on the balcony did you notice the sentries yes the white bull especially were screwed craig said father baldwins plan is a disaster maybe not he could still youre dreaming craig said were on our own i dont understand why gerrard and fulano havent killed us yet but from now on we forget about father baldwin and depend on ourselves gerrard and fulano must have a reason for letting us live so far with a tremble tess agreed so far something else is going on maybe the surprise fulano mentioned whatever it is its not in our favor so what do we do tess asked try to run with those sentries god damn that father baldwin craig said he didnt want to help us he used us wed have been safer if wed never listened to him that was yesterday we have to deal with now all right craig said for the moment we have to go with the flow when its dark maybe well find a chance to escape through the woods into the mountains at night when everyones asleep i think we can climb down from this balcony if anyone tries to stop us ill do my best to distract them in that case you go on without me no way tess said its both of us or none tess craig gently gripped her cheeks lowered his mouth and kissed her theyll hunt us theres no point in both of us dying if it comes to a choice id rather that you escaped instead of me she kissed him gently in return you werent exaggerating when you told fulano that wed reached an arrangement weve just never really discussed it i want to spend the rest of my life with you she tugged his arm craig resisted what are you going back inside and from now on we talk like lovers or else the people listening to the microphones will be suspicious in washington you called me babe you said that was what your father called your mother well babe lets complete what we planned to start if were going to die lets she suddenly hugged him sobbing this is all the time we have gerrard and fulano expect us at eight lets use that time i very much want a bath and i very much want you to join me she began to unbutton his shirt she kissed his nipples her warm tears trickling down his chest youre sure craig asked i dont plan to die without making love to you touch my breasts oh jesus craig im so scared i know im frightened too i dont want to die i yes that feels so good im so scared craig lower touch me lower tess had mentioned taking a bath together now they headed in that direction pausing frequently to kiss to remove each others top but they never got past the bed unsteady lightheaded from passion tess tumbled with craig across it pressing her body onto him their kisses became more urgent their hands more insistent moaning squirming they continued to undress each other tess pulling down his zipper craig undoing her belt she reached through the open zipper finding craigs swollen penis as she pulled it free craig arched his back shuddered and cupped her breasts their nipples rising hardening she kicked off her jeans craig licking her breasts then her stomach shifting lower pulling down her underwear kissing her thighs she yanked off the last of his own clothes and twisted turning craig now on top of her both of them pressing against each other exploring every portion of each others skin their tongues met thrusting she tasted him her vagina tingling warm and wet with greater arousal she thrust her tongue deeper into his mouth wanting to enter him to be one with him and when craig finally entered her tess didnt care about the microphones the strangers listening she wailed in hot flooding ecstasy it went on and on one climax after another and as craigs penis lengthened unbelievably his semen erupting within her she wailed again this time in unison with him they lay back their bodies filmed with sweat she struggled to catch her breath her heartbeat thundered then gradually stopped racing neither spoke for several minutes they kissed again this time slowly tenderly craig gently stroked her breasts fifteen minutes later they amazed each other by making love a second time at last in exhaustion their apprehension returning they did what theyd planned at the start in a tub that was unexpectedly large they shared a warm soothing bath ten the time theyd been given was gone are you ready craig asked no but if you can think of an alternative id like to hear it im sorry i cant then lets do this with style i love you and i love kiss me yes thats so much better when tess and craig unlocked and opened the door they found the two secret service agents seated across from them watching waiting without a word the agents followed them downstairs to the left along the muffled corridor and into a spacious dining room there gerrard and fulano sat at another antique table when they smiled and stood in greeting tess noticed that fulano had changed from his work clothes into slacks and a sport coat she and craig had received fresh clothes as well a servant having arrived ten minutes before they were expected to leave their room craigs outfit was similar to fulanos her own however had not been to her liking granted the garments were attractive a blue scarf a matching silk blouse a red cotton skirt and soft leather sandals that fit as comfortably as slippers but tess had never liked wearing skirts especially this one which came down to her ankles interfering with her stride and the sandals meant that shed been forced to take off her sneakers and more important the homing device in one of the heels shed put the sneakers into her ample burlap purse but she couldnt help suspecting that the outfit fulano had chosen for her was intended to make it difficult for her to take the opportunity when night came of running with craig toward the forest and attempting to escape across the mountains again she felt vulnerable helpless you look lovely tess fulano said gracias she told him trying to look modest fulano laughed youre learning spanish im afraid its the only word i know but really thank you these clothes fit me perfectly theyre gorgeous my pleasure the doors to the windows of the dining room had been opened the lowering sun tinted the room with crimson im sure youre curious about the surprise i mentioned fulano said it sounds like a birthday party ive always been fond of surprises as she smoothed her skirt and sat at the table controlling her fear tess noticed that the two secret service agents positioned themselves near the door through which she and craig had entered she also noticed that outside the windows armed guards patrolled a stone patio gerrard and fulano sat when craig did a brief explanation gerrard said i get the impression that neither of you has been to spain before regrettably now that ive seen it craig said one of the first things you have to understand gerrard said is that the spanish have a daily schedule thats pleasantly different from what were used to in america they work from nine till one then they take a long break for lunch and what im sure you know is called a siesta he shrugged they relax nap make love whatever then they come back to work at four and stop around seven after which they greet their neighbors eat drink and discuss the days activities what they eat is really a snack because their main meal occurs very late compared to american customs around ten the snacks they eat earlier are called tapas and those snacks are one of the many glories of spanish culture the surprise we referred to is that youre about to experience tapas confused because she expected a confrontation tess watched fulano tap his knuckles on the table at once three servants appeared carrying trays from which they set down numerous dishes not having eaten in a while tess couldnt help salivating from the aroma of the food on the ornate plates it wasnt just that she was hungry she knew she had to eat as much as she could in order to muster her strength in case she and craig managed to find a chance to escape first gerrard said calamari are you familiar with theyre deepfried squid delicious good fulano said and these are olives and these are sardines not what youre used to in america theyre fresh and beyond compare and these gerrard said are delicate pieces of deepfried chicken and these are shrimp and of course theres bread and deepfried potatoes with mayonnaise and enough craig chuckled although tess knew that his enthusiasm was forced if this is what you call a snack i cant imagine what the main meal could possibly be youll be amazed fulano said i bet beyond the windows tess continued to notice the sentries patrolling she quickly pretended to pay attention to the row of various foods that stack of plates how do we one type of food to each plate gerrard said its important to separate each taste then lets get to it im starved there wasnt any red meat she noticed a significant omission given the dietary beliefs of the heretics with pretended delight she nooned olives calamari and whatever else appealed to her onto various plates spreading them in a row before her the tapas indeed were delicious perfectly prepared each complementing the other would you like some vintage wine fulano asked spanish wine is superb or perhaps some excellent cerveza excuse me tess looked confused the spanish word for beer thanks craig swallowed hungrily but id prefer water the same with me tess said alcohol and i dont get along it makes me groggy i have the same reaction interesting fulano said he filled her ceramic cup from a pitcher tess didnt drink until fulano filled his own cup and drank the same water my god i think im full craig said exactly when to stop fulano chewed and swallowed an olive placing its pit at the side of his plate remember the main course is later and now we have another surprise gerrard touched a napkin to his mouth here it comes tess thought the condemned have had their final meal oh craig lowered his fork another this valley this castle these tapas weve been surprised several times already and now youre telling us theres more something truly special extremely unusual it happens only one time each year fulano said but it does require another helicopter ride to see what i mean im sure youre still tired from your trip but i promise you wont be disappointed indeed youll find it remarkable in that case being tired doesnt matter lets go craig stood uncertain about craigs strategy tess followed his example the secret service agents stood as well with another rap of his knuckles on the table fulano summoned his servants while they gathered the remnants of the tapas fulano pointed tess and craig toward the corridor that led outside five minutes later as the sun touched the rim of the mountains its glow more crimson they reached the helicopter when tess climbed inside carefully watched she felt troubled that she hadnt seen gerrards assistant hugh kelly since theyd arrived where was he why hadnt he joined them she had almost no time to analyze the possibilities a minute later as if on an urgent schedule the helicopter lifted off veered upward and sped toward the northern mountains the sun was now behind the peaks its bloodred glow reflecting off a purple sky her stomach already tense despite the energyrenewing meal tess clutched her tight crisscrossing shoulder belt and expected that at any time the two secret service agents would grab her unbuckle her restraints and throw her twisting and turning into the valley instead everyone stayed in position the helicopter rising higher nearing the shadowy mountains alan tells me that youve been threatened in america fulano said if it helps i want to encourage you that what youre about to see will help take your mind off your troubles the helicopter crested the northern mountains beyond the sun had almost completely set behind farther ridges a murky valley lay below them were approaching the spanishfrench border gerrard said we wont cross it of course without advance diplomatic clearance even i dont have the authority to violate french air space but the surprise we want you to see is a custom in southern france that centuries ago drifted down to this area of spain its quite remarkable the helicopter sped over more jagged ridges crossing another dark valley but something was different as tess peered down she realized puzzled that this valley wasnt completely dark hundreds of isolated lights flickered throughout the murky basin what are those she shook her head they cant be from villages not with the lights so small and so widely separated i cant see anything else but its almost as if im sure of it the lights are coming from fields thats correct fulano said what you see are bonfires the local farmers and villagers are conducting a festival gerrard pressed against his shoulder harness leaning toward her do you know what day this is i dont mean the day of the week i mean the date tess had to think a moment june twentysecond very good and some time between today and yesterday the summer solstice occurred the beginning of summer what youre seing are flames in honor of the new precious season the growth of the crops the fulfillment of the fertile promise of spring the ritual is extremely ancient fulano added its much older than christianity although of course like easter the true meaning of which is the resurrection of nature christian elements have been layered onto it those villagers are praying to saint john tess felt an inward jolt in turmoil she didnt know if the saint fulano referred to was john the baptist or john the disciple of christ but she was betting on the latter the same john whod written the final gospel in the bible numerous epistles and the book of revelations her mind focused on the photographs in her purse particularly the photograph of the bible shed found in josephs bedroom a bible from which joseph had cut out everything except the works of john and the theories that so matched those of the heretics especially the war between good and evil at the end of the world the farmers and villagers are praying around those flames gerrard said theyre holding crosses made from wild flowers and wheat yet again tess felt jolted flames wheat she recalled the grotesque statue the torch bearers mithras slicing the throat of the bull its blood cascading to fertilize the earth the dog straining to intercept the blood the serpent lunging to destroy the wheat that the blood caused to sprout from the soil a war between good and evil and depending on which side won nature would live or die with shock she understood that the sacred festival in this valley was a remnant of mithraism that the heresy was more deeply rooted more widely spread than shed ever anticipated nests father baldwin had said hed been searching for nests particularly in spain although his attention was directed toward the picos de europa to the west not the pyrenees to the east what he didnt know was that the nests existed not just in the picos but all along southern france and northern spain and that the villagers had so absorbed mithraism into catholic traditions that they perhaps didnt even know the true origin and meaning of the fertility ritual they now performed or perhaps they did know its true origin and meaning and that made the ritual all the more awesome as well as terrifying like the villagers and farmers around the bonfires in the valley tess had devoted herself to nature but gerrard and fulano whod devoted themselves to mithras the god of nature controlled her and maybe she and craig would be the next sacrifices to the god the helicopter began to descend approaching the isolated flames in the valley were not going back craig asked not just yet fulano said why craigs voice deepened we have a further surprise gerrard said this evening is full of them im tired i dont know if tess and i can take any more craig said believe me this surprise is worth it gerrard said the helicopter kept descending into the murky valley and immediately tess realized that some of the flickering bonfires had been arranged in a special pattern they form a landing pad she thought in the darkness the helicopters pilot used the squaredoff section of flames to guide him toward a level section in the valley as the bonfires flickered the pilot eased the helicopter onto the grass then shut off the engines and now craig asked something so sacred that very few have ever seen it gerrard said you worry me im from new york mountains valleys bonfires to me theyre like mars then we invite you to look at mars fulano said i guarantee youll be impressed i correct myself youll be astonished open your mind prepare yourself for what will be the greatest memory of your life since youre my host craig said i take for granted that i can trust you i also assume that as a host you feel an obligation to your guests that goes without saying all right then as long as weve agreed lets see the surprise thatll be my greatest memory follow they stepped from the helicopter eleven tess felt cloaked with oppressive darkness while in a square that enclosed the helicopter brilliant bonfires blazed their drifting acrid smoke conflicted with the fragrance of the grass and flowers in the nightshrouded valley numerous villagers and farmers all wearing festive garments stood next to the flames holding impressive crosses woven from flowers and stalks of wheat as the light flickered over those crosses tess faltered stunned by the memory of what priscilla harding had told her before christianity before the tradition that the cross represented the execution of christ a prior tradition had associated the symbol of the cross with the glory of the sun and now with chilling certainty tess watched the flames reflect off the wheat of the crosses and knew absolutely that those crosses composed from nature were devoted to the sun and to mithras the god of the sun fulano took a torch from one of the villagers and gestured for tess and craig to walk to his right across the field gerrard took another torch and accompanied them as did the two secret service agents but unexpectedly the group became larger other men joining them from beyond the fires these newcomers did not wear festive garments they didnt carry crosses woven from flowers and wheat what they wore instead was rugged outdoor clothing and what they carried were automatic weapons beyond the bonfires the field became disturbingly black illuminated in patches only by the torches that fulano and gerrard held before them tess fearfully recalled the torchbearers in the statue that shed seen in josephs bedroom her feet and ankles felt cold the dew on the kneehigh grass soaking her sandles and the lower portion of her long skirt panic made her want to tug at craig and run they might be able to escape in the darkness she hoped but despair took charge making her realize that the guards would hunt them that the villagers would join in the search and the odds were that she and craig would lose their sense of direction running in circles in this unfamiliar valley trying to avoid the bonfires until they were captured the field began to slope upward guided by the torches she and the rest of the group passed beech trees veered around boulders and continued climbing the dampness making tess colder the hill angled higher and now she smelled the resin of pine trees at once the slope leveled off grass became rocks she peered ahead toward where the torches revealed a narrow gap concealed by bushes at the base of a cliff stepping closer she saw that the gap was the entrance to a cave but a few feet into the cave a rusted iron door formed a barrier fulano handed his torch to a guard removed a key from his pocket and released a padlock on the door with effort leaning his shoulder against the door he shoved it open its hinges creaking the night became eerily silent the only sound the crackling torches and fulanos footsteps as he disappeared beyond the door five seconds later the silence was broken by the sound of something being cranked then the sputter of an engine then a roar as the engine came to life the interior of the cave was abruptly illuminated by a dim bulb attached to the ceiling and tess saw that the engine was a kerosenepowered generator someone nudged her back turning tess blinked in surprise at hugh kelly who must have joined them during the trek up the slope where had he been what had he been doing like the guards he too wore outdoor clothing go in he said youll find shoes and a jacket the cave can be slippery its also cold i brought my sneakers tess said she took them from her purse and pulled them on her feet at last secure no matter she trembled the torches were set on the ground twisted among the rocks and extinguished when she and craig entered the cave followed by gerrard kelly and the guards she noticed woolen coats opposite the generator and put one on buttoning it despite its insulation she continued to tremble the narrow passage was barely headtall proceeding she stopped ten yards ahead just beyond a curve frowning at another iron door while fulano unlocked it hugh kelly shut and locked the first door thats it she thought were finished dont look so nervous despite the roar of the generator fulanos voice reverberated off the damp limestone walls that locked door is strictly for security precautions after all were here at night and remember youre not the only ones at risk alan and i are attractive targets for assassins i trust the villagers but the darkness could very well hide enemies who may have kept track of our movements and would like nothing better than to catch us alone in this isolated area three guards have stayed outside to make sure that no one attacks us when we leave as you may have noticed alans secret service agents dont look happy about this trip i did notice tess remained convinced that the guards cared more about craig and herself than they did about gerrard and fulano all the same she pretended to follow his logic but what if something goes wrong outside what if your guards are overpowered we try to contact them with walkietalkies if they dont respond gerrard explained and gestured offhandedly we use a different exit youve thought of everything craig said we try to fulano nudged the farther door forcing it open its hinges screeching its iron bottom scraping against rock and now the surprise one of the greatest wonders in the world gerrard said few people have seen it only those who deserve to who have the capacity to appreciate it who care about the planet about its soul and you tess have the right because you do care with a passion youve proven that in your articles so now fulano shoved the door completely open youre about to see a mystery perhaps the greatest mystery something so sacred that after you see it youll never be the same i cant imagine what no gerrard said dont imagine dont anticipate just witness it just stand back and appreciate youre about to be changed the way my life has been going im due for a change for the better i hope for the better fulano said no question you have my word absolutely tess followed them through the door clutched craigs hand and felt the guards behind her fulano paused to lock the second entrance its getting worse tess thought crude steps carved into the limestone led down to a deep wide towering cavern dim lightbulbs next to the primitive stairway sustened off moist rock and guided the way tess reached the bottom overwhelmed by the vastness of the amber in awe she stared this way and that at intricate rock formations stalactites hung from the ceiling water dripping down from them forming pools which she avoided stalagmites projected upward from the pools their contours vaguely resembling the snouts of animals her rapid breathing appeared as vapor this cave has a constant temperature of fiftyfive degrees fulano said winter or summer thousands of years ago a rockfall buried the original entrance preserving the interior in all that time the secret of the cave was hidden but during the eighteen hundreds another rockslide opened a gap in the cliff a local farmer searching for missing lambs wandered up the slope discovered the gap and decided to investigate less out of curiosity about the cave after all such places can be dangerous than out of concern that his lambs might have wandered inside he soon reached a farther gap so narrow that his lambs could never have gotten past it dim sunlight from the entrance showed him that the cave was much larger beyond the narrow passageway and he mentioned it to his family then to other farmers after hed found his lambs in a meadow later that day word gradually spread and eventually reached my valley where my greatgreatgrandfather had an interest in caves he decided to mount an expedition came to this valley and ordered his workmen to use picks and sledgehammers to widen the passageway the limestone was brittle enough to allow them to accomplish his orders he then used torches to investigate farther and when he found what were about to show you he swore his workers to secrecy as quickly as possible he had an iron door secured into the rock walls at the entrance and he alone carried the key to its padlock later a second door was added farther along those doors are not the ones through which we passed years ago the originals rusted and disintegrated replaced by others in recent times improvements were made steps chiseled into slopes lightbulbs strung their wires attached to the kerosene generator but what did he find craig asked and why did he want to hide it not so much to hide it as protect it fulano said in a moment youll understand he led the group across the chamber entering a dimly illuminated corridor that twisted to the right then the left and took them lower tess felt smothered by the dampness and the sense that the confines of the cave created a pressure making the air around her heavy she stepped over pools of water sometimes hearing water trickle from the ceiling on occasion cold drops pelted her head one passage led to another mazelike she rounded a bend another huge chamber opened before her fulano and gerrard waited ahead smiling with joy their eyes glinting so intensely that reflection from the dim bulbs along the floor couldnt have caused the radiance in their expressions craig stopped beside her in back hugh kelly and the guards emerged from the corridor joining them and now craig sounded apprehensive why are we stopping because weve reached what we came to show you dont you see gerrard asked laughing dont you see look around his laughter swelled echoing throughout the cavern his gleeful outburst magnified look confused tess obeyed slowly turning directing her gaze in the direction of gerrards outspread arms abruptly she did see and the vision that awaited her caused her to clutch her chest then to step back in astonishment awestruck oh my god at once she said it again louder overwhelmed my god her knees became weak she struggled to keep her balance stunned to the core by what she was witnessing theyre magnificent she blurted theyre ive never seen anything like its almost impossible to believe theyre so beautiful i want to cry craig shook his head in astonishment so overpowered with surprise and rapture that he was speechless all around and above them on the walls and across the ceiling animals seemed to race or graze to swim or leap or simply pose to be admired paintings on the rock so many that tess couldnt count them or comprehend their complex flowing pattern the animals frequently overlapping their images static yet somehow in motion a huge eternal rampant herd yes gerrard said his voice sounding choked so magnificent so awesomely beautiful that they make me want to cry ive been here innumerable times and their effect on me is always the same their splendor makes me ache you realize now that i wasnt exaggerating theyre one of the greatest wonders in the world to me they represent the soul of the planet deer elk bison horses ibex bears lions mammoths more many more including species that tess could not identify presumably because they were extinct some were engraved in the rock the figures outlined with charcoal others were silhouetted in red the lines either solid or composed of large dots the animals were lifesize on the ceiling an eightfootlong deer had racks of spreading manypronged antlers that were almost equally long the contours of the ceiling had been used to indicate bulging muscles in the deers back and legs the style of the paintings was eerily realistic as if the animals were alive and any moment could leap off the walls at the same time the style was surreal causing the magnificent creatures to look oddly distorted some foreshortened others elongated a distortion that added paradoxically to the powerful effect the animals curved gracefully around projections in the rock they rippled dramatically in and out of cracks and fissues an elk appeared to be swimming a horse appeared to be falling moisture in the limestone made them shimmer breathtaking who painted these craig managed to ask when you said this cave was discovered in the eighteen hundreds but before then rocks had barricaded the entrance how old are twenty thousand years what these paintings come from a time when human beings had only recently appeared fulano said who painted them our immediate evolutionary ancestors a type of human called cromagnon obviously their sense of beauty their admiration for nature was immense in that respect compared to our own disrespect for nature perhaps our species hasnt evolved but regressed sometimes you hear these people referred to as cave men an absurd expression because the cromagnons never lived in caves how could they have tolerated the chill and the dampness fulano shook his head no they lived outside the caves but for reasons that anthropologists havent been able to determine they sometimes went into the caves deep within and in chambers similar to this one they painted the glory of the animals its my opinion that these chambers were their churches that they came here on special occasions perhaps at the vernal equinox and the summer solstice to worship the miracle of rebirth and growth to initiate children about to become adults and show them the mysteries of the tribe the greatest mystery life a place of adoration of sublime appreciation for what this planet is all about gerrard added to fulanos explanation this wasnt the only such sanctuary to be discovered during the eighteen hundreds tess nodded ive heard about although ive never seen the paintings at lascaux in france and many others including those at altamira here in spain but lascaux was discovered in the nineteen forties fulano said as far as historians believe altamira three hundred kilometers west of here was the first to be explored in eighteen seventynine but my ancestor discovered these paintings ten years before he knew instinctively that no expert in prehistory would believe in their authenticity how could primitive human beings have produced such exquisite beauty scholars would conclude that these brilliant paintings were recent cleverly forged to prevent his discovery from being ridiculed he kept it to himself placing a door across the cave preserving it for himself his family and special friends his instincts served him well for when altamira was discovered the experts scoffed only when other caves with paintings were discovered in france did anthropologists admit their mistake and accept the images at altamira as authentic lascaux and altamira are so impressive that theyre often referred to as the sistine chapels of paleolithic art but ive seen lascaux and ive seen altamira and i tell you that they cant compare to what youve been privileged to witness this is the true sistine chapel of paleolithic art my ancestor was wise in another respect as well he understood that this cave after tens of thousands of years of not being disturbed was so delicate that if people flocked to see these images the warmth from their bodies would affect its ecology the soil on their shoes would leave contaminants the breath from their mouths would add to the humidity on the walls these paintings preserved by a blessed accident of nature would be destroyed by fungus and the soot from torches only a few special witnesses could ever be allowed inside the twentieth century proves that he was correct so many tourists entered lascaux that the paintings became covered with destructive green mold the cave had to be sealed again only experts allowed to enter and even then only after special precautions were taken for example a disinfecting pool through which the limited observers had to step in order to kill the contaminants on their shoes at altamira only a few can enter each day and only then by appointment but here in this isolated cave in this isolated valley even fewer are allowed to enter the double doors provide an extra buffer a way of keeping the outside air filled with pollen and seeds from entering the inner chamber you were told that this would be the greatest memory of your lives i assure you that after a hundred years and more your memories are shared by a precious minority and you havent even seen the best part gerrard said there are other paintings craig raised his eyebrows in amazement yes one more chamber fulano said his dark eyes gleaming the best for last come appreciate worship believe me i already have worshipped not completely not yet its just around this bend fulano said prepare yourselves the nexttoultimate revelation will stun your well why should i tell you what to expect see for yourselves he led they followed and as tess rounded the bend she gasped not only in awe but fear so did craig the chamber like the previous one was filled with paintings images lifelike portrayals of animals but here the animals were exclusively bulls everywhere and unlike the paintings in the previous chamber the bulls werent outlined in charcoal or red these were multicolored not merely silhouetted but completely detailed totally realistic their hoofs were black their haunches brown their humped backs red their tails curved as if in a photograph their slanted pointed horns too were black and their eyes were so vivid that they seemed about to blink in rigid anger furious that theyd been captured eternally on the walls and the ceiling their legs thrusting their muscles straining their bodies arching an example of a celebration of the strength of nature the strikingly beautiful surge and power of the universe which twenty thousand years later was on the verge of being destroyed the colors come from powdered carbon ochre and iron oxide mixed with animal fat and blood the technique is known as polychrome gerrard said and there are only two other sites lascaux and altamira where it was used to such a degree immensely sophisticated superbly executed the greatest artwork that human beings have ever created because the message is the greatest the enormous vitality of nature but as the green mold on the paintings at lascaux makes clear our interference with nature has caused its vitality to be weakened to the point of extinction we have a sacred responsibility at any cost the sickness of the planet must be reversed tess felt increasingly overpowered by what she was seeing and increasingly fearful bulls like flames and crosses so much of this nightmare had to do with bulls and while her gaze pivoted along a wall across the brilliant multi colored bulls she suddenly froze at the sight of one bull that was larger than all the others instead of having been portrayed in red black and brown it was monochrome the white of chalk like the bull in the statue and its head was raised in agony a spearlike barbed line projecting through its neck tess followed the direction of the white bulls anguished expression and whimpered when she saw another locked iron door what had gerrard just said we have a sacred responsibility at any cost the sickness of the planet must be reversed and earlier fulano had said that this chamber was the nexttoultimate revelation what was behind the door this is the only example of a violent image in the cave fulano interrupted her urgent panicked thoughts but my ancestor wasnt puzzled he understood the necessity for the violence in the painting and he also understood that the color of the bull its whiteness was a sign he knew precisely what he had to do tess gripped craigs hand watching fulano unlock the door then shove it open the shriek of its hinges making her spine quiver somehow i dont think were going to see more paintings craig said you assume correctly fulano said what youre going to see is the truth tess gripped craigs hand much harder in dismay she hesitated but hugh kelly and the guards urged her onward with dread her stomach cramping she had to step through the door twelve the cavern was dim illuminated sparsely not by lightbulbs but by torches the cavern became darker when fulano shut and locked the door blocking the light from the bulbs in the chamber of the bulls the floor is damp but level you shouldnt have trouble maintaining your balance gerrard said reassuringly their footsteps echoed as tess approached the first of the torches she saw that it was made of stone and anchored into the caverns floor at the top a basin was filled with flaming oil the tongues of fire wavered as if her approach had caused a subtle breeze she stepped toward a second torch and beyond in the darkness she heard gerrard and fulano walking something scraped a match flickered she saw gerrard lower it toward another torch from which flames soon rose fulano did the same lighting a farther torch the two men moved around the chamber continuing to light more torches until the darkness was almost completely dispelled even so when they passed the torches their shadows wavered eerily fulano had described the cave paintings as the sistine chapel of paleolithic art but now in shock tess found herself staring at a true chapel she tried to retain her presence of mind to analyze what she was seeing the chapels design its columns and vaulted ceiling looked roman but given what fulano had said about the cave having been discovered in the eighteen hundreds tess suspected that no matter the chapels design it wasnt ancient but instead had been built within the past hundred years it was chiseled from limestone and divided into three sections to the right three steps led up to an arched entrance and then an aisle with a bench carved out of the wall on the left three other steps led up to an identical aisle and bench in the middle a more lofty arched entrance provided access to a long open area lower than the aisles and visible from the benches the design was intended to focus attention toward a prominent object on a large square altar at the rear of the central area and that object tesss heart faltered was a basrelief statue of mithras straddling a white bull slicing its throat she wanted to scream her mind swirled she feared that shed go insane the statue was twice as large as the one shed seen in josephs bedroom its white marble was weathered cracked and chipped and she knew in her soul that this wasnt a copy as josephs had been no this was the original this was the statue that the small determined group of heretics had managed to take with them when they used ropes to escape down the mountain the night before the massacre at montsegur as i promised fulano said the truth come look closer gerrard said he shifted between tess and craig spread out his arms and conducted them toward the chapels central area before he entered he stopped at a basin mounted on a pedestal and dipped his right hand within it water glistened on his fingers as he touched them to his forehead his chest then his left and right shoulder making the sign of the cross but not the cross of christianity tess knew this cross was that of the sun god a holywater basin her fear gave way to bewilderment no doubt it reminds you of catholicism gerrard said but the ritual predates catholicism like so many of our rituals this one was borrowed stolen from us after constantine converted from mithraism to christianity during the fourth century after they persecuted us the hypocrites then pretended that theyd also invented communion the consecration of bread and wine the sharing of the sacred meal but unlike their false religions bread and wine which supposedly represents the body and blood of christ our bread and wine represents the fertility of the bounty of the earth similarly this water which doesnt need to be blessed because simply by being water its already holy represents the glory of the rains and rivers that satisfy natures thirst or used to fulano said before poisons in the atmosphere turned the rain into acid that water comes from a stream in this valley that hasnt yet been polluted they neared the altar tess shuddered at the sight of the dog the serpent and the scorpion trying to stop the sacrifice that would bring life back to nature on the left of the dying bull the blood of which was supposed to fertilize the soil a torchbearers flame pointed upward while that of the torchbearer on the right pointed down good and evil in conflict so now its time gerrard said fulano joined them the vice president continued im sure that despite the carefully constructed sequence of our revelation the revelation itself is not a surprise it was obvious to me that when you boarded air force two you suspected i was one of the heretics to use the term you prefer although for us christianity is the heresy it was also obvious to me that you suspected that i knew you suspected so we engaged in wordgames clever dialogues in which each tried to fool the other but neither of us was convincing even so the things you said affected me tess your profound environmental concerns your obvious commitment to the planet in washington when i heard that you threatened us i agreed with a plan to have you guided toward me so i could personally arrange your death at josés estate your execution could easily have been accomplished however im no longer convinced that you ought to be killed i see possibilities in your attitude i think that your passionate skills as a journalist could be a help to us you feel justifiably furious about your mothers death as do i that murder was senseless clumsy needless but it happened it cant be undone so the question i need to ask is to preserve your life are you prepared to subdue your grief and work with us think carefully its the most important question youve ever been asked murder blackmail terrorism your methods are wrong tess said but theyre necessary since no other methods have been successful gerrard said however i appreciate your honest response for the first time youre not deceptive you were tempted to lie given the weapons aimed behind you but you didnt remarkable perhaps theres hope and i really would hate to order your death youre a vital healthy athletic wellintentioned young woman a perfect example of the life force were trying to save id sincerely regret destroying you craig coughed you have something to add lieutenant remember that the only reason youve been tolerated is your romantic association with tess if you were killed shed never cooperate exactly craig said because we love each other tess and i very much want to stay alive but suppose i manage to forget that i work for nypd suppose tess manages to forget that you bastards killed her mother gerrard stiffened proceed if we agree to your terms how would you know we werent lying how would you know you could trust us youve already answered part of your question gerrard said you and tess love each other enough that you wouldnt jeopardize your future over something you cant control the plan that our ancestors formulated hundreds of years ago has been achieved weve infiltrated every major government and corporation not to mention every important communication network and financial institution you and tess could never escape our attention our operatives would watch you constantly youd be killed the moment you tried to reveal our existence and urge nonbelievers to move against us tess couldnt surmount her fear remembering in turmoil that the night before father baldwin had made the same threat if you attempt to reveal the secret that the inquisition never ended our operatives constantly watching you will guarantee your silence she felt trapped between one side and the other good and evil but which side was good and which side was evil both used similar vicious lethal tactics all right craig said that makes sense but according to you i answered only part of the question whats the rest of it if tess and i promise to cooperate how would you know you could trust us how could we be confident that wed be safe yes gerrard said how indeed at this point i have to defer to josés judgment my power is limited even though im americas vice president but josé is the direct descendant of the leader of the heretics who escaped from the massacre at montsegur he makes the final lifeanddeath decisions tess and craig spun toward fulano the spaniard narrowed his eyes you appreciated the paintings the chapels of the animals despite my terror yes they were unbelievably awesome tess said and you understand their significance i do tess said they represent the soul of nature fulano assessed her then despite our differences we may be more alike than you realize perhaps an accommodation can be reached he frowned but in order to gain our trust you need to make a sign of good faith how do we manage that what do you mean what kind of sign you have to be baptized what you need to convert to mithraism its the only way fulano said if you become one of us if you experience the mystery if you respond to the powerful rite youd never dream of betraying us baptism fulano nodded tess thought quickly anything to get out of here having my forehead splashed with water a few prayers being said thats nothing compared to what ive been through she forced herself to appear to hesitate to ponder and finally said all right dont think you can fool us gerrard said this baptism isnt the type youre familiar with its not the same as christianitys i warn you its primordial much more profound than you can imagine what could it possibly be tess thought how different from the baptism of christianity total immersion in an icecold underground spring her fear of dying from hyperthermia or of being suffocated was certainly profound but baptism by total immersion was practised by several christian fundamentalist groups she knew and gerrard had insisted that this baptism was totally different from christianitys and by definition from fundamentalist versions of it at once however tess remembered that total immersion wasnt limited to fundamentalist christians various sects in india also practised total immersion and priscilla harding had explained that isolated groups devoted to mithraism were known to have survived and to practise their rites in presentday india total immersion tess grimly decided as bad as that would be the cold the tug of the water the feeling of helplessness it still cant compare to what ive already been through i appreciate your warning she said but ive thought about it and i agree ill do my best ill be baptized ill join you if thats what it takes for craig and me to be left alone to live without fear without fear yes but youll still have to help us gerrard said but only in nonviolent ways of course gerrard said as a journalist committed to protecting the planet nothing could stop me from doing that lieutenant do you agree as well gerrard asked im with tess craig said we share the same decisions then please step through that archway fulano pointed toward the rear of the chapel toward an exit on the right beside the statue of mithras on the altar tess tried to demonstrate total resolve as she walked muscles quivering toward the right of the altar abruptly she faltered hearing what at first was an inexplicable sound in the darkness beyond the archway with a clomping echo something stomped tess jerked toward fulano her face contorted with fright and confusion what was that immediately the stomp was followed by a violent snort what is it craigs husky voice became guttural it sounds like an animal tess breathed you were warned fulano said this baptism is more unusual than you expect primordial yes depending on your reaction youll live or die fulano said well know at once if youre converted because itll be obvious whether youve accepted the baptisms power the mysterious unseen animal stomped what sounded like a massive hoof a second time and scraped it over the caverns floor the powerful echo reverberating from the archway into the chapel then the animal snorted again a gruff moist angry outburst tess became paralyzed with terror but hugh kelly and the guards broke her paralysis crowding relentlessly against her and craig pressing the two of them onward forcing them through the archway gerrard and fulano had quickly entered before them striking matches lighting more torches and as the flames rose shimmering they revealed what the cavern behind the chapel held tess barely managed not to scream thirteen trapped in a narrow pen carved from gray stone but with an iron gate at one end stood the huge white bull that tess had seen isolated in a field this afternoon as the helicopter descended toward fulanos estate tess suddenly knew where hugh kelly had been and what hed been doing since the helicopter had landed and why hed gotten here ahead of them mysteriously joining them on the slope outside the cave hed been ordered to arrange this as the torches flared wavering from a breeze apparently created y the groups approach the majestic white bull swung its angry head in tesss direction its bloodred gaze revealing its fury at having been imprisoned here for so long in the dark its nostrils widened spewing moisture as it snorted once more in outrage the animal strained its neck and thrust with one horn as if despite the distance it believed with proud desperation that it could reach and impale its captors dear god tess moaned yes gerrard said dear god thats the meaning of the statue this white bull represents the moon and because the moon brings light to the darkness it symbolizes the triumph of good over evil obviously the moon is a counterpart to the sun and so too this bull is a counterpart to a substitute for mithras the god of the sun tess couldnt stop moaning your fear is understandable gerrard said but i hope that you also moan in reverence after all sacred rites have no effect if they dont induce profound emotion obviously this is a test the two of you are about to be changed i guarantee it by all means one way or another life opposed to death agreement opposed to defiance youre about to be changed tess trembled step closer fulano said over here facing the bull tess and craig didnt move your hesitation doesnt encourage me fulano said you have to prove yourselves hugh kelly and the guards crowded tess and craig closer to the pen compelling them to obey fulanos orders ten feet from the face of the bull tess stared at its wrathful eyes but this time when the animal snorted in outrage hot mucus from its widened nostrils struck her face in horror tess rubbed at her cheeks frantic to remove the burn of the acidlike specks but something else horrified her even more her bladder muscles threatened to fail peering down she saw that a narrow stairwell had been carved within the caverns floor and that murky steps descended toward a dark enclosure beneath the bull gerrard rubbed his right eye which was weeping again the irritation having returned he pulled a small plastic container from his pocket bent his head and propped open his eyelids dropping contact lenses onto one palm after placing the lenses into the plastic container he raised his head his formerly blue eyes now were gray glinting from the reflection of the torches tess shuddered another secret an inheritance from our ancestors gerrard said recessive genes i know then youve learned a great deal more than i expected but now youll learn even more much more its time step into the pit gerrard instructed fulano had also removed contact lenses revealing that his brown eyes actually were as gray as gerrards they gleamed as brightly tess shuddered with greater force take off your clothes fulano said what craig scowled now just a minute i assure you the request isnt prurient gerrard said we have no interest in sex its an impure impulse that contaminates the spirit we indulge in it reluctantly only for the sake of producing children to us your nakedness would be no more arousing than seeing the natural nakedness of animals but we do respect modesty theres no need for you to undress before us take off your clothes away from our sight in the darkness of the pit then throw your clothes up the steps otherwise theyll be sullied when you put them back on sullied why craig glowered what are you talking about because of your baptism fulano said your reluctance continues to disturb me prove yourselves prove that youre worthy do what youre told step into the pit remove your clothes hugh kelly and the guards continued to crowd against tess and craig we dont need your men to force us tess said we agreed we told you we want to stay alive but only if you respond to the power of the baptism and whether you do will soon be obvious fulano said either youll understand and appreciate the significance of the ritual or else well be killed tess said mustering her courage tess descended leaving the wavering light of the torches too soon pressed against craig she reached the bottom the pit was black damp and cold narrow constricting their arms bumped against each other as they reluctantly took off their clothes and tossed them up the steps her eyes adjusting to the darkness tess raised her head seeing reflecting light from the torches tnrough gaps in the top of the pit thick bars in an iron grate wide enough so that the bulls hoofs couldnt drop through them were braced securely in the limestone rim craig murmured whats supposed to happen what kind of baptism youve seen the statue tess strained to keep her voice low dont you realize abruptly craig did she felt him tremble with horrified understanding one of her breasts bumped against his arm as she stared apprehensively upward despite her effort at a muted whisper gerrard must have heard the blood of the lamb gerrard said above her according to christianity you have to be washed in the blood of the lamb thats something else they stole from us their version of baptism then they substituted water for blood but the blood of the lamb was originally the blood of the sacred bull the white bull regardless of christianitys changes our tradition is pure we still retain the sanctity of the ageold rite it goes back to ancient iraq it reappeared in greece particularly in crete where legend has it that a purewhite bull arose from the sea and was eventually sacrificed by theseus to the sun god they called him apollo on the mainland at athens later in roman times converts were initiated into mithraism through this baptism here in spain the bullfight is a latterday version of the sacrifice in fact at merida a bullfight ring was constructed above an ancient roman chapel devoted to mithras and in the bowels of that chapel there existed a pit similar to this one called a taurobolium in which roman centurions disrobed and were rebaptized before each battle to give them strength in their fight with their enemy the rite persisted in secret beyond the fourth century despite constantines conversion to christianity it persisted in the middle ages despite the efforts of the inquisitors it still persists as long as nature endures the rite will endure because of the rites eternal majesty and power then do it tess screamed get it over with fulanos voice echoed interrupting as the direct descendant of the man who guided his small group of survivors from montsegur i take the place of my ancestor i take the place of mithras i sacrifice the counterpart of mithras his voice became a chant above tess heard the white bull rear and stomp in fury she couldnt see but knew what was happening fulano at the risk of his life had mounted the imprisoned bull gerrards voice intruded so calm that it was dismaying at the vernal equinox this sacrifice represents the return of life to the planet at the summer solstice however the sacrifice intitiates youths from our sect into its mysteries and on occasion rare converts they experience the power of baptism and if theyre worthy they understand the necessity of the baptismal sacrifice the frightened bull continued to snort stomp and rear in outraged protest tess imagined fulano straddling the bull struggling to avoid its thrashing horns to grab its twisting snout and thrust its head upward exposing the neck to plunge his blade in and slice it across severing arteries spewing a shower of blood cascaded hot repulsive thick and heavy steaming pungent salty bitter it flooded in an unbelievable quantity through the bars of the grate it plummeted viscous scalding drenching drowning suffocating the bull roared even though its throat had been slit it bellowed in a final outburst of pride and bravery its knees buckled in terrified awe tess heard its legs thunk onto the metal grate its huge majestic body topple sinking thunking even harder onto the grate more blood gushed soaking her hair filling her ears drenching her face slicking her naked body her bare feet immersed in a horrifying ankledeep steaming pool she lost control she sank to the floor craig tried to stop her but he too was powerless sinking from the force of the deluge oh my god he said now do you understand fulano demanded his footsteps clattering as he rose from the corpse of the bull and clambered over the side of the limestone pen assaulted by insanity her body immersed in blood no longer shivering because the sacred bulls steaming life force warmed her tess blinked upward through sticky crimson fluid and struggled to focus her desperate thoughts she couldnt speak tell me fulano shouted the sacrifice her throat didnt want to work is supposed to teach us that life is precious her voice became hoarse her words an extended groan the blood of the bull is so shocking that forever afterward well remember how truly final death is and that nothing in nature should ever be killed unless its absolutely necessary thats why you dont eat red meat thats why youre mostly vegetarians because the crops come back in the spring but an animal each and every animal is one of a kind and if its killed it wont come back in the spring if we kill enough of them entire species wont come back in the spring the planet is finite its bounty can be exhausted if we dont take care the chamber became terribly silent blood dripped down tesss body you do understand fulano said welcome youre one of us tess wiped at her bloodstreaked mouth tasting the salty crimson fluid nearly gagging when she inhaled blood spewed up her nostrils she fought to breathe furious she remembered the painting of the white bull with the spear through its throat after the glory of existence comes death and because that glory can never be replaced death must always be respected that was the message but death she thought you bastards had no regard for death when you killed my mother youre hypocrites youre goddamned a faraway echoing whump interrupted her furious vengeful thoughts the whump although distant had sufficient force to waver the rock floor beneath her although at first tess thought it was just her knees that were shaking what happened she heard gerrard ask above the pit what was whump a second jolt closer sent shock waves through the cavern somewhere a rock fell clattering it sounds like fulano gasped a cavein no explosions gerrard sounded frightened find out fulano ordered the guards heres the key unlock the door tell me whats happening numerous footsteps raced toward the chapel at once craig grabbed tesss arm and lunged toward the steps she charged after him slipped on blood and fell her gymnastic training made her tuck in her arms and twist her body to absorb the impact even so she banged her shoulder wincing immediately she scrambled to her feet and continued charging upward joining craig at the top the blood cooled on their bodies naked they shivered and hurriedly dressed shivering worse as the blood soaked their clothing ignoring the pathetic corpse of the white bull in the pen they spun toward the entrance to the chapel fulano gerrard and hugh kelly were grouped at the archway a gap allowed tess and craig to see the guards race across the chapel to unlock the caverns door but the moment a guard used all his might to tug it open he turned in dismay the lights are out two outside doors two explosions fulano clenched his fists the first explosion must have blown the generator whoever did it gerrard started to say you know who did it inquisitors fulano said but if the entrance isnt blocked if theyre coming for us they wont be able to find us without the lights in the tunnels gerrard said theyll be prepared theyll carry flashlights fulano said all they have to do is follow the trail of bulbs he straightened and shouted to the guards get into the tunnel close the door so the glow from the torches wont show where youre hiding shoot when you see their flashlights theyll be easy targets the guards snapped into motion lunged through the door and pulled it shut inquisitors fulano said as if cursing how did they find us how did they know where gerrard spun toward tess and craig you somehow you brought them here how craig demanded you know we couldnt have you kept us prisoners from the time we left andrews air force base if we used a phone on the plane youd have known about it then we boarded the other plane then we used the helicopter theres no way we could have passed a message weve done everything you asked even to the point of being baptized weve gone to the limit to prove we want to cooperate no somehow fulano stalked toward them his gray eyes bulging you were searched for weapons you were scanned with metal detectors how did look at her feet shes wearing the sneakers she had when she boarded air force two gerrard said she brought them with her she carried them in her purse and put them on when she entered the cave thats how they tracked us thats how they found us the sneakers must contain a homing device take them off fulano said i want to see them tess stepped backward im right fulano shouted tess stepped farther backward kelly gerrard told his assistant yes sir shoot them we gave them our trust they didnt deserve it dont just shoot them blow them apart yes sir hugh kelly pulled back a bolt on the side of his automatic weapon then raised it aiming in a frenzy craig dove toward tess shoving her into a pool behind a stalagmite stunned by cold water they crouched protectively behind the rock but the shots they heard didnt come from hugh kellys weapon instead the shots came from other automatic weapons rattling muffled distant behind the door that led into the chapel beyond it men screamed in agony abruptly the door scraped open guards surging through firing behind them leaning their combined weight against the door shutting it locking it they didnt use flashlights a guard yelled fulano rushed toward the rear entrance to the chapel then how could they have followed us here how could they have seen the trail of bulbs in the dark theyre wearing nightvision goggles it didnt matter where we hid they could see us but we couldnt see them take cover fulano ordered the guards retreated lunging toward the protection of torches and pillars some left a trail of blood tess heard their strident breathing something banged on the opposite side of the metal door theyre trying to get through gerrard said something banged again the lock held firm theyll use explosives fulano said get down hugh kelly had turned to view the commotion taking advantage craig surged from the pool of water behind the stalagmite kelly heard him and whirled but not in time craig reached him before he could raise his weapon and fire slamming kelly twisting him craig grabbed kellys chin from behind and jerked it upward at the same time craig dropped to one knee propped up the other knee and banged kellys spine across it sickened tess heard two brutal snaps from kellys neck and spine as kellys lifeless body sank to the caverns floor craig grabbed the weapon and aimed toward gerrard and fulano too late the sound of the struggle having warned them they ducked through the entrance into the chapel before craig had a chance to fire he cursed and started after them but instantly he stumbled back the force of an explosion making him fall the blast was deafening the metal door flying off its hinges banging onto the floor more rocks dropped from the ceiling tesss ears rang nonetheless she heard guards shoot toward the entrance to the tunnel from the darkness beyond the entrance from the chamber of the painted bulls other weapons returned fire tess heard another explosion then another in the cold pool behind the stalagmite she winced and pressed her hands against her ears grenades the inquisitors were throwing grenades the chapel filled with smoke and flames although her hands were pressed against her ears the screams of dying men assaulted her the gunshots persisted gaining in volume more explosions rocked the cavern more rocks falling through the entrance to the chapel tess saw a torch break toppling spewing its fiery oil across the floor bullets chipped pillars ricocheting rockshards flying as the shooting intensified darkclothed figures charged from the cavern of the painted bulls through the smoke tess saw that the figures wore goggles and that their faces were smeared with black camouflage grease they held automatic weapons and fired in every direction pausing only long enough to throw more grenades the explosions shattered pillars guards dropped blood bursting from their heads and backs others were crushed by cascading rocks in a rush the survivors gerrard and fulano among them scrambled into the cavern behind the chapel a few returned fire but most fled in panic tess tripped a man as he raced past the stalagmite his chin banged hard against the floor too terrified to resist the impulse of adrenaline she lunged from cover and grabbed his weapon her father had never taught her how to use this type of gun but she remembered that hugh kelly had pulled back a bolt on the side of his before he prepared to snoot evidently the bolt was a cocking mechanism and assuming that the guard had already cocked his weapon she responded defensively aimed at the guard when he stuggled to rise and shot him slamming him flat the spray of blood combined with the weapons stuttering recoil unnerved her the force of the volley yanked the barrel upward she urgently told herself remember to hold it down to keep it level spinning determined she looked for other targets craig where was craig in the chaos of the shots the smoke and the flames she didnt dare pull the trigger for fear of hitting him then she saw him flat on his stomach shooting guards jolted backward slamming into others knocking them off balance coating them with blood tess fired above craig hitting other guards meanwhile in the chapel the smoke and flames grew stronger the gunshots came closer craig and tess kept firing to her right tess noticed sudden motion there fulano rose from beside the pen in which hed slaughtered the sacred bull he reached beneath his sport coat pulled out a pistol and aimed toward craig tess fired sooner stitching fulanos chest with bullets the direct descendant of the leader of the heretics jerked repeatedly staggered and toppled over the side of the pen lying on the corpse of the great white bull but again tess hadnt been able to control her weapons recoil its barrel heaved upward her finger still on the trigger reflexively kept squeezing propelled she twisted and suddenly gerrard was in her line of fire the vice president wailed holding up his arms as if to shield his chest but the bullets struck higher blasting holes across his handsome face blowing apart his gray eyes viscous matter spurted his head appeared to explode then actual explosions threw tess on the rocky floor grenades detonating fiercely at the rear of the chapel she fought to stand knowing that thered be more explosions and that they wouldnt be in the chapel theyd be closer theyd she saw a grenade arc through the entrance to the cavern abruptly she felt the breath knocked out of her a figure hurtling against her craig who tackled her and dropped with her and the next thing tess struck the steps to the pit and tumbled down them craig twisting over her she walloped her knees her back her skull and hit the dark bottom stunned splashing into thick pungent blood that heaved and splattered over her immediately as she regained sufficient presence of mind to clamp her bloodsmeared hands against her ears feeling craig raise his arms and do the same the grenade erupted with a stunning roar its shrapnel splintering off the caverns walls a few fragments striking the upper steps of the pit the thunderous echo swelling against the walls of the cave more rocks cascading immersed in blood tess raised her dripping head and listened to the burp of automatic weapons strafe the cavern above there was only darkness the grenades rush of air having extinguished the torches i think we finished them a husky voice said make sure another voice said tess recognized its deepthroated resonance father baldwin were safe she thought she raised her face higher about to shout to him when craig clamped a hand across her mouth and pressed her head down her instincts made her want to scream but her love for craig made her comply she understood he was trying to tell her something more important he was trying to protect her she acquiesced slackened her muscles quit struggling and nodded for whatever reason his motives however puzzling were in her best interests heavy footsteps entered the cavern no sign of survivors a taut voice said those that werent shot or killed by grenades were crushed by rubble keep checking father baldwin ordered the inquisitors voice was so muffled that tess realized her arms around craig that slabs of rock had fallen over the bull and fulanos corpse and had fallen as well over the entrance to the steps that led to the pit complete kill the taut voice said a rock toppled but this ceilings about to collapse rig the charges father baldwin said everywhere ive already started the statues my priority ill set a bomb and blow it to hell thank god at last we found the central nest therell be other nests but this ones the most important what about the woman and the detective i still havent found them probably buried beneath the rubble they might even still be breathing five minutes from now it wont matter father baldwin said if theyre somehow still alive theyll die when the explosions bring down the ceiling we owe them a debt but they cant be allowed to know our secrets their reward for their service will be in heaven the charges i just finished and i just finished planting a bomb at the foot of the statue like it the bodies of the vermin will be blown to hell lets go the tautvoiced man lunged from the cavern into the chapel other footsteps scurried the rest of the charges father baldwin demanded his voice receding ready well need five minutes to get out of the cave thats how long ive set the timers hurry father baldwin again demanded his voice even farther away set more charges as we leave i want these caverns completely destroyed no problem well be able to see the fireworks from the bottom of the outside slope a final faraway scurry of footsteps craig removed his hand from tesss mouth their clothing soaked with blood they squirmed up the steps and reached a slab of rock that lay across the exit groping craig found a gap and squeezed through followed by tess who scraped her back on the rock although the chamber was dark flames from burning oil in the chapel provided sufficient reflected light for them to be able to make their way through the rubble their wet clothes caused them to shiver we have to get out of here craig said how tess hugged her goredrenched chest even if we reach the exit before the bombs go off father baldwins men will shoot us we can try to dismantle the bombs no wed never find them all but we cant just stay here and wait to die craig said there has to be a way to i just thought of something tess gripped his arm remember when we entered the cave and fulano locked the doors he left three guards outside craig nodded and if the guards were overpowered if they didnt respond to a message from a walkietalkie his voice quickened fulano said we could use another exit theres another way out of here and it has to be close tess said heart pounding craig sank against a rock whats wrong in the dark well never find the exit he suddenly straightened just a minute i think i can get us some light stay here desperate confused tess watched him climb over rubble searching what are you looking for a body my clothes are too soakedwith blood my jacket wont burn i dont understand you will here i found a yanking a jacket off a corpse craig left the cavern and reached the flames in the chapel there he touched one of the jackets sleeves to a blaze igniting it hurrying he returned the fire spreading up the sleeve of the jacket the grenades knocked over the torches back here and extinguished the flames but there has to be oil all over the floor i can smell it he dragged the burning sleeve across the floor trying various places among the rubble and suddenly flames grew oil igniting among the fallen rocks the flames spread tess and craig backed away the chamber became illuminated over there on the left craig pointed a tunnel as the ceiling groaned and more rocks fell tess scrambled over the rubble frantic to reach the tunnel go slower craig said if you break an ankle im more worried about the bombs a section of roof collapsed its impact thunderous and being crushed they came to the tunnel this is probably where kelly and his men brought the bull in craig said the entrance from the chapel is too narrow for the animal to have gotten through and the bull would have been so difficult to handle that whoever designed this tunnel would have made the passageway as straight and short as possible craig was right the fire from the oil in the cavern reflected into the tunnel and showed an exit twenty yards ahead but tess moaned when she saw that the exit was blocked by a metal door she moaned ever worse when she and craig strained to open the door but couldnt the damned things locked angry exhausted craig leaned against a wall blood dripping from his clothes we wasted our time theres so little left maybe theres another exit jesss voice shook dont count on it and even if there is those bombs will go off before we find it weve got to try craig studied her with resolve yes they rushed back along the tunnel reaching the cavern another section of roof crashed the force of its impact jolted them and made the flames from the oil waver over there in back tess said another tunnel any minute now those bombs will the flames craig look at the flames what about them theyre still wavering theyre leaning toward that tunnel when we first entered the chapel i noticed the torches waver but i thought that was just because our movement created a breeze airs flowing into that tunnel it has to be going outside craig nodded but what if the holes too small for us to its our only choice the roof groaned again lets go before they scrambled toward the tunnel at the rear the moment they entered another huge slab of rock fell barely missing them they stumbled forward the light diminishing if this tunnel branches out into other tunnels we dont have a chance craig breathed hard the light from the flames in the cavern became so weak that tess had to grope along the walls do you feel a breeze does it seem to be getting stronger yes but what am i hearing ahead something roared constant louder as they approached the tunnel curved and slanted down blocking the light from the flames in total darkness they kept groping along the walls the roar gained volume so loud that tess could hardly hear what craig shouted what she yelled i think its a the blackness was absolute she couldnt see him grabbed for his hand took another step and abruptly lurched forward the shock waves of repeated explosions shoving at her the ceiling cracked about to collapse propelled she stepped into nothingness with air instead of rock beneath her she plummeted the ceiling gave way slamming down behind her she screamed her stomach rose as she dropped clutching craigs hand she swooped toward the black louder closer continuous roar the roar she discovered was an underground stream its icy current stunned her drowning her scream she went under panicked powerless unable to see or breathe dimly she understood that concussions behind her were slabs of rock hitting the stream but the currents force sucked her away before the rocks could crush her she tumbled beneaththe rushing surface straining to raise her head hoping frantically that the breeze she and craig had followed meant that the stream had an open space above it but no matter how hard she fought she couldnt reach the surface the stream gained speed she banged against a polished curve in the channel twisted slammed against another curve lost her grip on craigs hand struggled again to reach the surface and suddenly felt herself dropping oh jesus she prayed unable to hold her breath about to inhale reflexively the stream kept falling at once she burst through an opening was hurled from the water and flipped through air the pressure of dropping made her chest heave she gasped uncontrollably her lungs expanded air rushing down her throat the next thing she struck a pool propelled beneath it by the thunderous thrust of a waterfall when she clawed to the surface her arms thrashing weakly she breathed in desperation and gradually realized that there were stars above her that she was outside in the sweet spacious night that she was close to the rim of the pool a moment later in a frenzy she pivoted to search for craig his body floated toward her urgent she swam and grabbed him he raised his head coughing spitting out water while she tugged him toward the rim of the pool they lay on a grassy bank but craig kept coughing choking he vomited water in a rush she turned him onto his chest moved his head sideways checked to make sure that there were no obstructions in his mouth and pressed her hands on his back squeezing his lungs sensing water escape from his mouth he coughed repeatedly then gradually his spasms diminished he began to breathe freely only then did she slump back exhausted the air smelled fresh and clear the moon and the stars were glorious despite the thunder of the waterfall she heard a nearby stream flowing from the pool trickling over rocks toward the valley craig moved his head to study her he coughed again and clutched her hand thanks he managed to smile hey it took two of us to get out of there she returned his smile her heart swelling with relief that he was alive then she too coughed up water she shivered so bad that her teeth chattered side by side they held each other trying to regain their strength five minutes later craig roused himself that water was so icy he shook uncontrollably hyperthermia tess frowned hats right he continued shaking worried in these wet clothes even on a warm night in june were both so chilled we could die from exposure we have to get warm and dry soon realizing the danger tess hurriedly glanced behind her toward the valley no she thought we cant have survived what we did only to freeze to death at once she mentally thanked god everythings fine no problem what the nearest village is probably miles away wed get delirious fall asleep and die before we managed to walk there assuming we could even find it i still say no problem painfully cold tess trembled from her head to her feet you think all we have to do is rub two sticks together and build a fire no someone already did that for us in fact a lot of people puzzled craig turned to follow her gaze and let out his breath in wonder below them across the fields in the valley dozens and dozens of bonfires glittered in the darkness their glow was splendorous the feast of saint john id forgotten craig said like tiny pieces of the sun for once flames are going to help us tess managed to stand trembled and reached for his hand bright flames not dark come on babe it took all her strength to raise him arm in arm huddled against each other clinging for warmth they staggered down a grassy slope toward the fires at least the stream washed the blood from our clothes tess said i guess in a way it was like a baptism except that the second baptism canceled the first the second was truly purifying the thing is our problems arent over craig said i know father baldwin what made you realize that he didnt want us to escape just a hunch but in my line of work you learn the hard way to respond to hunches i figured we ought to wait and see how much he wanted to find us in the rubble obviously he thinks were a threat because of the secrets he told us right now i dont care about his damned inquisition all i want to do is keep holding you it feels so wonderful to be alive good fighting evil craig shivered in this case its hard to tell the difference between them both are evil im sure of this as soon as the inquisitors learn were still alive theyll come after us tess hesitated maybe not youve got a plan sort of im still thinking it through but if they do decide to come after us im ready to fight them as far as im concerned they committed an unforgivable sin because they turned against us no because they blew up the paintings ill always remember them the deer the bison the horses the ibex the bulls so awesome so magnificent so irreplaceable at the bottom of the slope tess noticed shadowy figures and realized that they were villagers huddled around a fire holding their crosses woven from flowers and stalks of wheat the villagers frowned at tess and craig suspicious but she raised her right hand still wet from the stream and touched it to her forehead her chest her left and right shoulder the villagers nodded and motioned for tess and craig to sit the fire quickly warmed them drying their clothes tess and craig continued to hold each other lovingly and remained there throughout the night sometimes dozing only to waken and stare again as if hypnotized toward the power and magic of the flames fourteen alexandria virginia with craigs comforting presence beside her tess stood in a cemetery near the citys outskirts and stared at her mothers grave tears misted her vision the funeral had been yesterday six days after she and craig had escaped from the caverns and two days after theyd returned from spain much had happened following the night at the bonfire their spanish companions had escorted them across the valley to the nearest village there with great difficulty because of her unfamiliarity with the language tess had managed to use a phone and eventually contact the american embassy in madrid her report had caused a halfdozen helicopters to arrive by midafternoon american and spanish officials accompanied by armed guards hurrying out from then on she and craig had been questioned repeatedly theyd shown the investigators the obliterated former entrance to the caverns theyd taken the investigators to the waterfall that had saved them soon other helicopters had arrived bringing more investigators and guards the interrogation had continued well into the night after a few hours sleep and a meager breakfast tess and craig had wearily answered further questions continuing to repeat the story that theyd agreed on before tess had phoned madrid the story was the core of tesss plan to protect themselves from both the inquisitors and the heretics more than anything she wanted to tell it to reporters to make sure it was publicized but when reporters did arrive she and craig were taken under guard via helicopter to bilbao and then to madrid where the questioning continued at the headquarters of spains intelligence service distraught american cia officials joining in reporters managed to learn enough from unnamed sources to publish and broadcast the story it spread quickly around the world under pressure from numerous governments spanish and american officials finally admitted the truth of what theyd dismissed as rumors america s vice president and the presumed future president of spain indeed had been assassinated by terrorists while showing two american guests various cultural and geographical features in the province of navarra in northern spain the terrorists remained unidentified what the accounts did not include of course was the increasing frustration with which the grim investigators questioned tess and craig why the hell did you come to spain how did you enter the country you dont have any passports my mother was recently murdered tess continued to repeat what shed answered so often alan gerrard is was a longtime close family friend he invited my fiance and me to accompany him on air force two to spain in the hopes that the trip would take my mind off my sorrow his invitation was sudden we didnt have time to get our passports and i was too stunned by grief to think clearly to refuse a request not just from a friend but from the vice president of the united states would you have turned him down but what were you doing in how did you get to northern spain before alan began his official duties he wanted to visit josé fulano at his estate near pamplona the two were friends but i suspect that they might also have had some business to discuss at any rate we were taken along alan was quite enthusiastic still trying to distract me from my grief he claimed that hed never forgive himself if we didnt have a chance to see that dramatically beautiful area of the country a cave at midnight because of the feast of saint john both alan and josé insisted on showing us the bonfires in the valleys then they ordered the helicopter to land so they could also show us the cave it was special they said because it had iceage paintings that very few people had ever seen iceage paintings yes they were beautiful and thats when the terrorists struck the attack was sudden i dont know how the assassins knew we were in the cave but all at once there was gunfire explosions i saw alan and josé shot several times my fiance and i raced down a tunnel the explosions weakened the caverns ceiling it collapsed but not before we managed to find that stream and escape seems awfully damned convenient we were lucky what would you prefer that wed been killed as well thered be no one to tell you what happened the assassins who were they i have no idea they wore masks i could barely see them in the dim light in the cave and on and on although the interrogators tried to find inconsistencies tess and craig stuck to their story much of it was true and the vice presidents aides along with the secret service agents hed left in madrid verified those parts what couldnt be verified and what the investigators had to take on faith was that tess and craig werent able to provide information that could help identify the assassins meanwhile efforts to retrieve the bodies proved useless the interior of the mountain had completely collapsed leveling the mountain was out of the question the corpses would have to stay entombed there forever with the massive peak as their gravestone unidentified assassins no hint of anything except the iceage paintings in the cave those two pieces of disinformation a term shed learned from her father were the key to tesss plan to protect her and craig and that disinformation was what she read in a newspaper as she and craig were flown in air force two back to america the interrogation would continue in washington shed been told but she had no doubt that the investigators would soon release them that she and craig would be dismissed presumably with lingering suspicions about them as two innocent bystanders the newspaper she read on the flight to america was the international edition of usa today and in the economic section she noticed an article that roused her spirits public outrage against the slaughter of elephants for their tusks had resulted in an international trade ban on ivory with the consequence that the price of ivory had plummeted from per kilogram to less than poachers no longer considered elephants valuable enough to massacre them the species had a chance to be saved at the same time the article noted other species were disappearing at the alarming speed of per year nonetheless the salvation of the elephants gave tess hope just as the brilliant sky unusually free of smog also gave her hope as she now wiped her tears at her mothers graveside she turned to craig her voice deep with mourning theres something i never told you the night we sat at the fire in the valley craig put his arms around her she leaned her head against his chest and managed the strength to continue i began to understand why the followers of mithras worship flames the blaze rises from things that are dead old branches dry leaves like the phoenix craig nodded out of death comes life she raised her head the trouble is the flames arent immortal anymore than the branches and leaves were eventually the blaze has to die as well turning into becoming with a sob she stared again at her mothers grave ashes to ashes dust to dust craig didnt respond for a moment sprinkle ashes on a garden though and the earth becomes more fertile the cycle of death turning into life continues her voice sounded choked the miracle of nature except that my mothers gone forever but youre still here and youre the life she created ill try to do what i hope would have made her proud of me tess said so many years i avoided her and now i wish so much that she and i could spend time together do you think shed have minded being buried here instead of next to your father in arlington national cemetery no tess had trouble speaking my mother was a diplomats wife she knew the bitter rules my fathers career came first she always had to stay in the background but she didnt object because she loved him craig kissed her tearswollen eyes and i love you and i promise youll always be first the most important part of my life holding each other they walked from the grave i wanted revenge so bad tess said but when i killed gerrard and fulano i didnt do it to get even i didnt enjoy it it didnt give me satisfaction i hated it i only did it to save us that makes me feel clean somehow or at least as clean as im able to feel under the circumstances all the men i shot all the blood the ugliness i keep having nightmares ill be there to share them with you they passed other graves approaching their rented car at least no one knows who really killed gerrard and fulano tess said the inquisitors think they did the heretics will think so too we wont be blamed but you still believe they wont come after us craig asked its a calculated risk but yes thats what i believe when we were questioned we never mentioned father baldwin and the

terrorism to try to save the planet or the inquisitors using vigilante tactics to stop what they think is theological evil let the bastards fight it out with luck maybe theyll destroy each other and
