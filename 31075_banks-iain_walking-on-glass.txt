walking on glass iain banks part one theobalds road he walked through the white corridors past the noticeboards with their offers of small rooms and old cars past the coffee bar where people sat at tables past a hole in the white floor where an old chair stood sentry over an opened conduit in which a torch shone and a man crawled and as he left he looked at his watch tu pm he stood on the steps for a second smiling at the figures on the face of the watch three three three a good omen today was a day things would come together a day events would coalesce it was bright outside even after the painted lightness of the marbleflaked corridor the air was warm slightly humid but not sultry the walk would be a pleasure today that was good too because he didnt want to arrive at her place hot and flustered not today not with her at the end of the walk not with that subtle but unequivocal promise there waiting ready graham park stepped out on to the broad grey pavement outside the school and during a break in the traffic jogged across theobalds road to its north side he relaxed to a walk on the pavement outside the white hart pub his large black portfolio held easily at his side by its single handle drawings of her he looked up at the sky above the blocks and squat towers of the mediumrise office blocks and smiled at its blue citygrimed segmentings everything seemed fresher brighter more real today as though all his quite normal perfectly standard surroundings had until this point been actors fumbling behind some thin stage curtain struggling to get out but now stood triumphant expression frozen on face hands spread going taraah on the boards at last he found this younglove rapture almost embarrassing in its intensity it was something he was delighted to have determined to hide and wary of examining it was enough to know it was there and the very commonness of it was reassuring in a way let others have felt this way let them feel it now it would never be exactly like this never be identical revel in it he thought why not a worn and grubby old man stood with his back against the wall of another tall greyandbrickred building he wore a heavy greygreen coat even in that heat and one of his shoes was open at the toe baring skin inside he held two huge boxes of mushrooms it was the sort of sight the poor the strange which usually alarmed graham so many strange people in london so many of the poor and the decrepit the still spinning shrapnel walking wounded of society usually they oppressed and threatened him these people with little threat to offer and much to fear but not today today the old man hot in his thick coat blinking from his grey face clammy hands round his two twopound boxes of mushrooms was merely interesting just a possible subject for a drawing he passed the post office where a young black man tall and well dressed stood talking quietly to himself again no fear he realised that maybe he really was after all just a little the country hick he had tried so hard to avoid being he had been so determined to be ungullible citywise that perhaps he had gone too far in the other direction and so read a threat in everything the big city had to offer only now with the promise of the strength she might give him could he afford the luxury of thinking so closely about himself you had to have armour in the city you had to know where you stood he had opted for the cynical guarded approach and now he could see that for all the safety it had brought him here he was in his second year still solvent heart intact unmugged and even succeeding in his studies despite all his mothers fears every defence had its price and he had paid in a separating distance incomprehension perhaps the young black man was not mad people did talk to themselves perhaps the old man with the torn shoe was not some desperate downandout with fists full of stolen mushrooms maybe he was just an ordinary person whose shoes had split that lunchtime while shopping he looked at the traffic roaring by and over it through railings at the leafy greenness of grays inn edging into view on his right he would remember this day this walk even if she did not even if all his dreams his hopes did not ah but they would he could feel it put that fantasy down park you dont know where its been he turned quickly to the voice and there was slater bounding down the steps of holborn library wearing a pair of oneandahalflegged jeans with a shiny black shoe on one foot and a kneelength boot on the other the jeans were cut to suit so that one leg ended normally in a stitched hem over the shoe while the other leg came to a frayed stop just above the top of the boot above slater sported a wellworn hacking jacket over a black shirt and a black bow tie which appeared to have lots of small dull red stones set in it on his head sat a tartan cap predominantly red graham looked at his friend and laughed slater responded with a look of pretended chilliness i see nothing to cause such hilarity you look like graham shook his head and waved one hand at slaters jeans and footwear and spared a glance for his cap what i look like slater said coming forward and taking graham by the elbow to continue walking is somebody who has discovered an old pair of raf pilots boots at a market stall in camden and taken a knife to them graham said looking down at slaters legs and shrugging his arm free of the light grip which held it slater smiled put his hands in the pockets of his mutilated jeans there you show your ignorance young man if you had looked carefully or if you knew enough you would appreciate that these are in fact specially designed pilots boots which with the aid of a couple of zips convert into what was doubtless in the forties a pretty neatlooking pair of shoes the whole point is that if the intrepid aviator got shot down while blasting gerry out of the skies above enemy territory he could simply unzip his bootlegs and have a pair of civilianlooking shoes on his feet and thus pass for a native and so escape those dreadful ss men in their tight little black uniforms i have merely adapted you look silly graham interrupted why you straight old straight slater said they were walking slowly now slater never liked to rush graham was only a little impatient and he knew better than to try to hurry slater up he had left in plenty of time there was no hurry more time to savour i just dont know why you turn me on at all slater said then peered closely at the other young mans face and said pointedly are you listening to me park graham shook his head grinning slightly but said yes im listening you dont have to camp it up with me oh my god pardon me slater said melodramatically one hand fanned over his upper chest im offending the poor hetero boy under twentyone as well oh say it aint so youre a fraud richard graham said turning to look at his friend i sometimes think you arent even gay at all anyway he went on attempting to increase their pace a little what have you been up to i havent seen you around for a couple of days ah the changeofsubject slater laughed staring ahead he grimaced and scratched his short curly black hair where it stuck out from under his tartan cap his thin pale face contorted as he said well i shant go into the seamy details the more basic facets of life but on a cleaner if more frustrating theme i have been trying to seduce that lovely dickson boy over the last week you know the one with the shoulders what graham said contemptuously annoyed that tall bloke with the bleached hair in first year hes thick hmm well slater said bobbing his head in an arc a gesture somewhere between a nod and a shake thick set certainly and not awfully bright but god those shoulders that waist those hips i dont care about his head from the neck down hes a genius idiot said graham trouble is slater mused he either doesnt realise what im up to or he doesnt care and he has this awful friend called claude i keep telling him how earthy i think he is but he hasnt got it yet now he really is thick i asked him what he thought of magritte the other day and he thought i was talking about some girl in first year and i cant get him away from roger i shall die if hes gay i mean if he got there first im sure roger isnt really stupid its just his friend whos infectious ha ha graham said he always felt slightly uncomfortable when slater talked about being gay though his friend was rarely specific and graham was hardly ever directly involved he had for example only ever met one of slaters supposedly many lovers at least as far as he knew do you know slater said suddenly brightening as they crossed john street ive had this really good idea graham gritted his teeth well what is it this time another new religion or just a way of making lots of money or both this is a literary idea if its the sands of love ive already heard it that was a great plot no it isnt romantic fiction this time they stopped at the corner of grays inn road waiting for the lights to change a couple of punks on the far side also waiting to cross were pointing at the oblivious slater and laughing graham looked up at the skies and sighed imagine if you will slater said dramatically sweeping his arms out wide a keep it short graham told him slater looked hurt its a sort of byzantine future a degenerate technocratic empire with oh not science fiction again well no its not really smartass slater said its a fable i could make it a fairytale instead if i wanted to anyway its the capital of the empire a courtier starts a liaison with one of the princesses the demands she and the emperor make on his time get to be too much so he secretly has an android made to impersonate him at the endless court rituals and boring receptions nobody notices later he has the androids brain upgraded so it can cope with hunting expeditions and personal meetings even cabinet discussions with the emperor present all so that he can spend more time dallying with the princess but he gets killed in some overenergetic loveplay the android continues to fulfil all its courtly duties and even becomes a trusted confidant of the emperor and the princess discovers it actually makes a better lover than the original the android can fit in all its commitments because it never has to sleep but it develops a conscience and has to tell the emperor the truth the emperor smiles opens up an inspection panel in his chest and says well by a funny coincidence end of story pretty good eh what do you think graham took a deep breath thought then said these pilots so they could disguise their boots what about their uniforms he frowned seriously slater stopped a look of horror and confusion on his face what he said aghast suddenly graham realised with a small disquieting feeling in his stomach that they were standing right outside a place which always made him feel apprehensive it was only a small pictureframing shop which sold prints and posters and moretastefulthanaverage lampshades but it was the name which held unpleasant associations for graham stocks that name chilled him stock was his rival the great threat the cloud hanging over him and sara stock the biker the macho blackleathered neverproperlyseen image of nemesis he had looked up the name in the london telephone directory there were oneandahalf columns of them enough for quite a few coincidences even in a city of sixandahalf million people slater was saying to do with it it just occurred to me graham said defensively he wished now he hadnt decided to tease slater you havent listened to a word ive said slater gasped graham nodded to indicate they should keep on walking of course i have he said they passed terrys fruitstall next with its smell of fresh strawberries then a chemists they were at the junction of clerkenwell road and rosebery avenue by the side of grays inn buildings which led on up the avenue some tall green wooden hoardings jutted out over part of the street and pavement shielding some roadworks graham and slater walked down the narrow alley formed by the seedy decaying stonework and the painted wood graham saw the grimy glass of cracked windows fading political posters flapped in a slight breeze but dont you think its a laugh slater said trying to edge round graham to peer into his face graham avoided his friends eyes he wondered if slater intended to walk the whole way with him or whether he was only going as far as the air gallery now only just across the street where he sometimes went in the afternoons graham didnt mind slater knowing about sara he had introduced them to each other after all but he wanted to keep this day private besides he got embarrassed at the stares people gave slater even if slater himself didnt seem to notice the least he could do graham thought was take off that ridiculous tartan cap its all right he conceded as they came out from between the decaying buildings and the green hoardings but he smiled and looked at slater dont give up your day job and dont you quote my own lines back at me you young pup okay graham said looking at slater again stick to ceramics you make me sound like a glaze thats your expression ohho slater said well touche or toushe anyway he stopped by the pedestrian crossing which led over rosebery avenue to the square redbrick building of the air gallery graham turned to face him but dont you like the latest scenario well graham said slowly deciding he had better say something nice its good but perhaps it needs a little work huh slater said stepping back and rolling his eyes he came forward again eyes narrowed pushing his face close to grahams so that the younger man shrank back just a little a little work eh well bang goes your commission from the national portrait gallery when im famous are you going over there graham indicated the far side of the road slater slouched a little and nodded looking over the road to the gallery i suppose so youre trying to get rid of me arent you no im not yes you are youve been hurrying me all the way no i wasnt graham protested its just that you walk slowly i was talking to you well i can walk and listen at the same time oh wow the gerry ford of the art school anyway not to worry i bet i know where youre off to hmm oh graham said trying to look innocent yes i can tell slater said stop trying to look so damn nonchalant a smile appeared on his face like oil surfacing on still water youve got the hots for our sara havent you oh intensely graham said trying to overplay it but he could see slater wasnt taken in but it wasnt like that it wasnt that crude or even if it was it shouldnt be talked of in such a way not now not yet they arent worth it kid slater said shaking his head sadly and wisely shell let you down later if not now they always do graham felt happier with this direct assault this was just gay misogyny not even genuine at that but another of slaters roles he laughed and shook his head slater shrugged and said well when it does go wrong at least you know you can come running to me he patted his right shoulder with his other hand i have very good shoulders for crying on not graham laughed while youre wearing that cap chum slater narrowed his eyes and straightened the tartan cap on his head well graham went on hurriedly i really have to go now and took a couple of steps backwards all right then slater sighed wistfully do all the things i wouldnt dream of doing but dont forget what your uncle richard told you he grinned blew graham a kiss waved one hand then stepped on to the crossing during a lull in the traffic graham waved back then walked away graham slater called suddenly from the other side of the road he turned to look sighing slater stood outside the gallery in front of one of its large windows he put one hand in his jacket pocket and as he did so his bow tie lit up the small red stones were really lights they flicked on and off slater started laughing as graham shook his head and walked away up rosebery avenue a quick flash slater bellowed in the distance graham laughed to himself then had to break his stride as a longhaired biker in dirty denims bumped a large moto guzzi across the pavement in front of him and into the courtyard entrance of the buildings called rosebery square graham looked darkly at the man pushing the bike then shook his head telling himself not to be so stupid the man looked nothing like stock the bike was quite different from the big black bmw stock rode and anyway omens were nonsense stocks time was over he could tell that from what sara had said over the phone that morning he breathed deeply and put his shoulders back shifted the large black portfolio from one hand to the other what a blue sky what a great day he thrilled to everything around him no matter what the brightness of the june day the smell of cheap cooking and exhaust fumes birds singing people talking nothing would nothing could go wrong today he ought to find a betting shop and put some money on a horse he felt so lucky so good so in tune mr smith sacked lips tight fists clenched eyes narrow breath held back straight stomach in chest out shoulders back steven grout stamped away from the depot he had just been fired from away from their stupid job and those awful people he came to a car parked by the kerb stopped took a deep breath then walked on never mind the name of the road he thought they would only change it he watched the cars and buses and vans and trucks pass by him and calculated how far he had to go to get to the next parked car which would shield him from them the pavement had been much repaired and it was difficult to synchronise his steps so that the middle of each foot fell exactly on the cracks between the paving stones but with some concentration and a few judicious halfsteps he managed it then he came to a long bluegrey line of asphalt where a pipe had obviously been repaired and walked along that instead free from the worry of the paving stones between the cracks he still felt hot and sticky from the attack by the microwave gun he thought back again to the confrontation in mr smiths office of course he had known they would use the microwave gun on him they always did when he was up in front of somebody whenever he was at a disadvantage anyway and needed all the help he could get whenever he was going for an interview for a job or being asked things by the social security people or even clerks in the post office that was when they used it on him sometimes they used it on him when he was waiting to be served by a barman or even when he was just standing waiting to cross a busy street but mostly it was when he was talking to somebody official he had recognised the symptoms as he was standing in mr smiths office his palms were sweating his forehead was wet and itching he felt shivery his voice was shaky and his heart was beating fast they were cooking him with the microwave gun bathing him in its evil radiations heating him up so that he broke out in a lathering sweat and looked like a nervous kid bastards hed never found the gun of course they were very clever very clever and cunning indeed he had given up dashing through to adjoining rooms running to look downstairs or above craning his head out of windows to look for hovering helicopters but he knew they were there somewhere all right he knew what they were up to so he had to stand there in the office of the roadworking operatives supervisor in the islington council seven sisters road highways department depot sweating like a pig and wondering why they didnt just get on with it and sack him as he listened to mr smith and his eyes hurt and he could smell his own bodyodour again were all hoping that this would not be a continuing situation steve mr smith said droning nasally from behind the chipboard desk in his lowceilinged office on the depots first floor and that you would be able to consolidate your position here by forming a positive working relationship with the remainder of the road gang who in all fairness im sure youd be the first to agree have done their very best to well mr smith a man of about forty with large soft bags under his eyes leant over his paperstrewn desk and looked down at the nononsense pen he was fiddling with steven watched the pen mesmerised for a second i really do think ah steve oh and please dont hesitate to interject if you feel you have anything you wish to articulate this isnt a star chamber here i want you to play a full and meaningful part in this discussion if you feel that thereby we can ah resolve what was that he wasnt sure hed heard that right something about a star chamber what was that what did it mean it didnt sound like it fitted in with this period this setting this age or whatever you wanted to call it could mr smith be another warrior or even further up the hierarchy of tormentors than hed thought god those bastards and that gun he could feel sweat start to gather in the lines of his forehead and in his eyebrows soon it would roll down his nose and then what they might think he was crying it was unbearable why didnt they just throw him out he knew it was what they wanted to do what they had planned to do so why didnt they just do it then resolve this apparent impasse in some viable way conducive with the efficient operation of the department i dont think im running a particularly tight ship here steve we like to think that people will appreciate steven stood smartly to attention in the middle of the office his hard hat held tightly under his right arm close to his side out of the corner of his eye he could just see dan ashton the roadgang foreman and union representative ashton was leaning thick bronzed arms folded against the edge of the doorway he was about fifty but the fittest as well as the oldest man in the gang he stood there grinning unpleasantly his cap pushed back on his head a damp unlit rollup hanging from his mouth grout could detect its soggy odour even over the smell of mr smiths aramis ashton had never liked him either none of them did even the one or two who didnt continually make fun of him and tease him and play jokes on him over backwards to accommodate you but it really does look im afraid as though this incident with the canal and the cat has to be just about the last straw ah steve i understand from mr ashton here smith nodded at the older man who pursed his lips and nodded back that mr ah mr smith looked at some of the papers on his desk for a moment ah yes mr partridge had to go to hospital for a tetanus injection and stitches after you struck him with a shovel now we dont think hes going to press charges but you must realise that if he did you would in fact be facing a charge of assault and coming as this does on top of your other verbal and written warnings all within im afraid to say steve mr smith sat back in his seat with a sigh and flicked through a few more of the papers on his desk shaking his head at them a very short interval of time considering the length of your employment with us and all regarding previous lapses in partridge he wished hed knocked his head right off calling him those names bastard was he mad was he simple eh that fat cockney with his stupid tattoos and his jocular manner and his dirty jokes he should have dumped him in the canal the sweat was gathering in his brows getting ready to slide down his nose and make a dewdrop at the end which would either stay there wobbling about very obviously and making him want to sneeze or force him to draw attention to it by wiping it away to wipe his brow would be a sign of weakness too though he wouldnt do it let them see his proud contempt they wouldnt break him oh no he wouldnt give them the satisfaction appreciated what you have said about not really meaning to offend anybody i just cant square this version of accounts with that of your workmates steve who insist im afraid that you seemed quite serious about backfilling the canal with the tarmac allocated for laying on colebrook ah colebrook row in fact as for mrs morgans cat all we can do is they were talking about cats to him one of the mightiest warlords in the history of existence and they were talking about bloody cats oh how the mighty were fallen right enough the sweat left his right eyebrow it didnt roll down his nose it went straight into his eye instead a terrible furious impotent anger filled him making him want to strike out to shout and scream he couldnt do that though he had to keep cool despite the microwave gun and only answer back if even that discipline that was important but i take it you have nothing else to say mr smith said and stopped talking grout sucked in his breath was he supposed to say something why didnt people make things clear what was the point though might as well get the whole thing over with as fast as possible i was only kidding he heard himself say it had just leaped out but it was true it was only a sign of their stupidity or their fear that they were taking him so seriously of course he hadnt been going to fill the bloody canal in it would have taken him all day even if theyd had enough tarmac in the back of the pickup it was all just a sort of angry joke because the rest of the gang and ashton in particular wouldnt agree with him about the best way to fill holes in but they would see those holes theyd patched in upper street at the start of the morning shift would soon show who was right of course he knew speaking out would do no good but he couldnt help it sometimes he had to tell people when they were doing things the wrong way it was more than he could bear to see the stupidity around him and just suffer it in silence that would drive him to madness to the place they most wanted him the place in which it would be even more difficult to find the key an institution a hospital where they filled you up with all sons of disgusting drugs and deliberately kept you as stupid as the rest that was part of their game of course leave him to search for the way to escape but alone if he started trying to find any others like him other warriors they would have an excuse for locking him away it was fiendishly clever really excuse your actions steve lets be fair now i dont expect it makes much difference to mrs morgan or her cat mr smith said and a small smile played over his lips as he glanced at dan ashton who grunted and looked down at his feet while smith continued whether you were joking or in deadly seriousness the other eyebrow discharged its sweat rolling it down into grouts other eye he blinked furiously almost blinded eyes red and stinging intolerable typing your final written warning now but really steve without wishing to sound patronising in any way or form i really do think youre going to have to mend your ways very considerably indeed if youre to right steven shouted hoarsely shaking his head sniffing hard and blinking all at the same time my contempt for all all of you is just it i resign i wont give you the satisfaction i quit i resign i throw in the towel there ive said it before you did dont tell me i couldnt im stronger than you know he could feel his lips trembling he fought to control them mr smith sighed and leaned forward over his desk now steve he began tiredly dont you now steve me grout shouted standing there and quivering its mr grout to you im resigning give me my papers i demand my papers where are my papers he stepped forward towards mr smiths desk smith sat back surprised grout saw him exchange looks with dan ashton and thought he could see the older man nod or give some sort of sign or signal to mr smith certainly the foreman was no longer leaning against the doorjamb he was standing properly now arms unfolded maybe he thought steven was going to offer some violence to mr smith well let them fear hed show them he wasnt frightened of any of them i really do think youre being a little rash in this mr smith began but steven interrupted i believe i asked for my papers please i shant leave without my papers and my money where are they i know my rights steve i think youre allowing your understandable mr smith began pushing his chair back from his desk slightly the sunlight glinted on his discreet sdp lapelbadge enough steven shouted he took another step forward and with his right hand made as though to hit mr smiths desk his hard hat held in the crook of his right arm fell out from between his arm and his side and hit the floor rolling briefly steven stooped quickly and retrieved it banging his head sharply on the front edge of mr smiths desk as he straightened he rubbed his head rapidly feeling his face turning red damn that gun mr smith was on his feet now dan ashton had come forward and was leaning over from the side of smiths desk whispering something into his bosss ear grout glared at them both as he rubbed his smarting head oh it was easy to see what they were both up to well mr smith began a pained expression on his face as he turned to look at grout again if thats the way you really feel steve dan ashton had smiled thinly so hed won in the end he hadnt given them the satisfaction of firing him there and then hed shown them the contempt he felt for them let them suffer a strange fierce joy had filled him after that and he hadnt really heard anything ashton or smith had said to him theyd given him some papers and somebody had gone to the cashier for his money it made a nice fat bulge in his hip pocket he patted it now and again as he walked just to make sure it was still there and eventually hed signed some papers he hadnt wanted to sign anything but they had said they wouldnt give him any money unless he did so hed pretended to read the papers carefully and then signed them ashton had tried to see him out after that and even wanted to shake hands with him but steven had spat at his feet and made a rude sign at him you bad little fucker ashton had said which was typical of him steven had told him he was a foulmouthed ignoramus and stuffed his various papers and forms quickly into his trouser pockets and walked off here ashton had shouted after him as he strode down seven sisters road head held high your p you dropped it at least that was what steven thought he had shouted it might have been a different number but it was something like that he had glanced back to see ashton standing at the depot gates waving a piece of paper at him grout turned away straightened his back and brought his head up ignoring ashton pointedly as he walked proudly away ashton had started after him steven heard his trotting steps behind him so he ran ignoring the older mans shouts until eventually he outdistanced him ashton had shouted one last thing at him but steven had been too far away breathing deeply an expression of triumph on his face hed got away from them it was a small escape a little rehearsal but it was something so now he walked still angry with them but glad to be away glad to have salvaged something from yet another of their attempts to grind him down make him feel small drive him into despair they wouldnt succeed that easily they had surrounded him with horror and stupidity with all the paraphernalia of this socalledhuman excess and they expected it to bring him down to reduce him still further from the once proud state he had fallen from but they would not succeed they were trying to wear him down but they would fail he would find the key he would find the way out and escape from this joke this awful solitary confinement for heroes lie would leave them all behind and take his rightful place in the greater reality again he had fallen but he would rise there was a war somewhere he didnt know where not a place you could necessarily get to by travelling anywhere from here late twentieth century london earth but somewhere sometime it was the ultimate war the final confrontation between good and evil and he had played a major part in the war but something had gone wrong he had been betrayed lost a battle with the forces of chaos and been ejected from the real battleground to languish here in this cesspit they called life it was part punishment part test he could fail entirely of course and be demoted still further with no hope of escape that was what they wanted the ones who controlled the whole seedy show the tormentors they seemed to want him to try and call their bluff to stand up and say right i know what its all about you can drop the pretence come out wherever you are and lets get it over with but he knew better than that he had learned that lesson as a child when the others had laughed at him and they sent him to see the school shrink he wasnt going to try that again he wondered how many people in all the mental hospitals in the country or the world come to that were really fallen warriors who had either cracked up from the strain of trying to live in this hellhole or simply made the wrong choice and thought that the test was just seeing through the whole thing and then having the courage to stand out and make that challenge well he wasnt going to end up like one of those poor bastards he would see it through he would find the way out and he might not even stop at simply escaping he might just smash up the whole foul contraption of their testing and imprisonment apparatus this life while he was about it he was starting to feel faint he had about another ten paces to go to the next parked car within the wheelbase of which he would be safe from the laseraxles of the passing traffic all the traffic every single vehicle which passed him was equipped with lasers in its axles they could register a hit on his legs unless he was above them or shielded by a wall or between the wheels of a parked car or holding his breath of course he knew that the lasers didnt hurt you couldnt see them and they did no harm by themselves but he knew that they were another of the ways that they the tormentors took points off him he knew all this from dreams and from having worked it out as a child he had done the same thing as a game something to make life more interesting give it some purpose then he had begun to have dreams about it to come to realise that it was real that he had had an insight when he started to play the game he had to do it now it felt horrible and uncomfortable when he tried to stop even just to see what it was like walking down a street breathing normally it was like the feeling he used to get when he played another game from his childhood that of closing his eyes and walking for a certain number of steps along say a wide path in a park no matter how certain he might be immediately before he closed his eyes that there was plenty of space in front of him no matter how positive he was as he walked with eyes closed that he wasnt veering off to one side and there was tarmac under his feet rather than grass he still found it very hard almost impossible to walk more than about twenty paces with his eyes closed he would be certain positive that he was about to walk into a tree or a post or sign he hadnt noticed even that somebody had been watching from behind a tree and was about to leap out and punch him hard on the nose better to keep your eyes open better to trust your instincts and take deep breaths between the parked cars you couldnt be too careful he got to the car and stopped opposite it breathing deeply he took off his hard hat and wiped his brow after checking for scaffolding the safety helmet was another of his discoveries his good ideas he knew how vulnerable peoples heads were and how important his own was he knew they would just love to arrange a little accident with some spanner or brick falling from a building or more plausibly still from some scaffolding so he had worn that hard hat since even before he left the home no matter what the job was or what else he might be doing he wore the hat when he was outside they had laughed at him in the road gang who did he think he was they said poncy engineers wore hard hats everywhere not your labourers or was he frightened of pigeons then going a bit thin on top as well as inside eh ha ha let them laugh they wouldnt get the hat off him he had two spare hats in his room just in case he ever lost his usual one or somebody stole it people had done that before now too he started walking again treading carefully on the cracks between the paving stones a careful steady stride was very important anyway good for the breathing and the heart rate people stared at him sometimes jumping from one paving stone border to another then taking some mincing little halfsteps over others his face going strange colours as he ran out of stored air in his lungs sweating under a hard hat with no construction sites anywhere in evidence but he didnt care theyd be sorry one day as he walked he wondered what he would do today with his newfound freedom he had lots of money perhaps he would get drunk the pubs would be open soon he supposed he ought to go and sign on let the unemployment people know he was out of a job again he wished he could remember what you were supposed to do when you wanted to register as unemployed but he always forgot obviously the whole unemployment social security system had been set up to confuse anger and demoralise him he kept meaning to take notes write down all the separate moves you were meant to make forms fill out offices visit people see but he always forgot anyway he always told himself that this would be the last time this time he would find some really good job in which he would get on really well and his talents would be appreciated and people would like him and he would surprise all his tormentors so there would be no reason to go through the whole fraught and sapping business of signing on again he wondered vaguely about going back to mrs shorts boarding house and getting a pen and paper he would go back to his room he always felt better there and he still felt like a good wash he needed to get rid of all this sweat and clamminess wash all the dust and the lead off his face and hands he could do that back at mrs shorts he would gain strength from being back with his books his bed and his little bits and pieces he could have a look at the evidence again that would be good he could start rereading a book he had a lot of books most of them were science fiction or fantasy he had long ago realised that if he was going to find any clues to the whereabouts of the way out the location or identity of the key there was a good chance he might get some ideas from that type of writing he knew this from the way he felt attracted to it it was a contemptuous sop of a clue something they thought they could afford but it might be useful obviously they thought that by letting this sort of thing out they would have an excuse for putting him away if he ever attempted to call their bluff ha they would be able to say crazy read too much sf bonkers let us put him away and keep him under sedation and have done with him that was the way their minds worked that realisation was supposed to put him off but he was too clever for them he bought all the most fantastic unrealistic fiction he could find and afford by the rules they must have hidden a clue away in it somewhere one day he would open up a book some new swordandsorcery trilogy probably and something he would read there would trigger what he knew was locked away in his own brain somewhere it might be the name of a character there was one already he was sure sounded familiar it was one of his bits of evidence it might be the description of a place or a sequence of events all he needed was that key escapism they called it oh they were clever all right his room was full of books thick dogeared brokenspined gaudycovered paperbacks they lay on the floor stacked on their sides because he didnt have any proper shelves the floor of his room was like a maze with towerblocks of books whole walls of them set out on the thin carpet and holed linoleum so that only small corridors for him to walk in remained between them he could go from bed to window and table to cupboard and door and fire and washhandbasin but only by certain routes making the bed was difficult pulling the drawers in the cupboard out properly needed great care coming back to the place drunk especially when he couldnt find the light switch was horrendous he would wake to a sight like manhattan after a severe earthquake in paperback but it was worth it he needed both those avenues of escape drink because it felt like escape a way out of their fetid reality for a while and the books because they soothed they offered hope he might lose himself in the books sometimes but he might find the key there too a car he was heading for to draw his next breath suddenly drove off steven cursed inwardly and had to step up on to a low wall above the height of the laseraxles to empty and fill his lungs again he got down from the wall and walked on hed show them all one day all the people who had taunted him and hurt him and confused him and denied him even the ones whose names he had forgotten when he found the key hed get them people like mr smith dan ashton and partridge hed find that way out but he wouldnt leave until hed found them again and sorted them out theyd pay all right couldnt even take a joke throw a shovelful of tarmac into the canal and they went to pieces it hadnt been his fault hed tripped over the cat he knew he shouldnt have hit the animal but hed been angry then partridge had tried to wrestle with him claiming later that he was only trying to restrain him partridge had got all angry and upset soon too because as he was struggling with steven a magazine fell out of his trousers on to the towpath of the canal and the other men had picked it up and it had been a spanking magazine so all the other men who werent laughing and shouting already started teasing partridge partridge started trying to wrestle steven to the ground but steven had got free and clouted the other man with the shovel which was still bloody from hacking the cat to bits and after that with the magazine coming apart as the other men grabbed at it and partridge rolling about dazed on the towpath in the cats blood and almost falling into the canal dan ashton had said soberly that enough was enough and theyd better go and see mr smith the supervisor because they just couldnt go on like this they werent getting the work done it was all horribly sordid but the more he thought about it the more he became certain that far from being a disaster leaving the highways department was in fact a real step forward it hadnt been much of a job after all he had thought at first from the sound of it that it might mean travel but it didnt he would definitely go to the pub later he decided it was a day to celebrate for two reasons he reminded himself not that it meant very much because when you thought about it it wasnt something really to celebrate but today june th was his birthday he stopped opposite a car of course and looked at his reflection in a shop window he was tall and thin he had longish lank dark hair he didnt wash often enough it stuck out from under his red hard hat in scrappy curls his trousers were slightly too short and showed off his purple nylon socks and his tarstained desert boots his paisley pattern shirt didnt go too well with the greying marks spencer pullover he wore instead of a jacket and he knew his fingernails were dirty but it was a good disguise he told himself great warriors didnt want to attract too much attention to themselves when they were trying to think their way out of their penalty period in the ultimate war a young woman who was dressing the female dummies in the lingerie department window steven was looking at frowned at him and gave him a suspicious disapproving look which he noticed her just in time to see he saw the halfdressed models then and quickly walked away only just taking a deep breath in time as he walked out from the cover of the parked car many happy returns he said to himself then suddenly gulped as he put his hand to his mouth and looked around what was he saying onedimensional chess quiss paused near the topmost window in the windingstair his old body for all its girth thick size and seeming weight of muscle was less than fit and not so warm either the cold air of the castle fumed from his mouth as he rested gathering breath it was dark in the turret stair the only light coming from a small open window just round the twist in the rising steps the steamy clouds of his breath were first caught in the light from above then pulled slowly away in a draught from the same source he wondered if ajayi had finished the game yet probably not prevaricating woman he sighed and set off up the stairs again pulling himself up by his hands on the thick frozen rope fixed to the outside of the staircase the castles concession to their earlier request for a handhold on the often iceslicked steps ajayi was in the games room still hunkered over the small table in her furs huge as a bear perched on a small stool all but hidden beneath the furs and cloths which smothered her old frame she didnt look up as quiss panting heavily appeared at the top of the stairs and made his way down the length of the dimly lit room she seemed to notice him only as he came closer up to his chair facing her across the small fourlegged table with the dully glowing red jewel in its centre ajayi smiled and nodded perhaps at the man perhaps at the thin wavering line of squares which seemed to hang in the air over the small circular table the thin line of squares alternately black and white like tiny isolated tiles of shadow and mist stretched over the table through the air on either side of it and disappeared into the distant side walls of the broad games room over fallen slates and past rusting columns of wrought iron the flat string of squares flickered slightly just sufficiently to show it was a projection nothing real but although it was apparent the line of squares itself was merely an image on its surface sat seemingly real and solid wooden chess pieces made from black and white wood and set on that strange line like tiny isolated guard towers on a chequered frontier wall ajayi looked slowly up at her companion her old lined face gradually contorting into a smile quiss looked down at her maybe theres something of the reptile in her he thought maybe she slows down in the cold as though i didnt have enough problems well the old woman said well what quiss said still breathing hard from his walk up the stairs from the castles lower levels what was she asking him questions for he was the one who should be doing the asking why hadnt she finished the game yet why was she still just sitting looking at it what did they say ajayi asked patiently smiling a little oh quiss said shaking his great bearded head quickly as though the whole subject was of too little consequence to be worth discussing they said theyd see what they could do i told them if we didnt get more light and heat up here soon id tear a few more of them apart but after that they only started acting all stupid and anyway theyll soon forget they always do you didnt see the seneschal himself then ajayi said she sounded disappointed and a small frown creased her forehead no he was busy they said just saw the little bastards quiss sat down heavily on his small chair wrapping some more furs around himself to keep warm he stared mournfully at the bright strip which appeared to float in the cold air over the small table in the centre of the tables delicately carved surface the jewel which was the colour of blood shone like something warm ajayi pointed at one of the wooden chess pieces a black queen and said well i think youre too hard on them thats not the way to get results by the way i think thats checkmate you dont know quiss began then gave a start as the last part of what his adversary had said sank in he frowned deeply and peered at the narrow line of black and white spaces hanging in the air in front of him what he said checkmate ajayi said her old voice slightly cracked and uneven i think where quiss said indignantly sitting back with a smile somewhere between annoyance and relief thats only check i can get out of it there he leaned forward quickly and took hold of a white bishop placing it one black square further forward in front of his king ajayi smiled and shook her head she put her hand just to one side of the glittering projected line of squares and seemed to fumble with something invisible in the air a black knight appeared as though out of profound shadow on the surface of the ultimately narrow board quiss took in his breath to say something then held it sorry ajayi said thats mate she said it quietly but then wished she hadnt spoken at all she frowned to herself but quiss was too absorbed glaring at the board looking desperately up and down its length for useful pieces that were not there to notice what shed said ajayi sat back in her little stool and stretched she put her arms out from her sides and back arching her spine and wondering vaguely as she did so why it had been thought necessary or relevant to give them such old bodies perhaps to keep the idea of the passing of time simple mortality to the forefront of their minds if so it was a redundant measure even in this strange and singular place even given their odd frozen state as the castle was frozen so were they as the castle was slowly crumbling but they stayed in their stasis so their hopes their chances decayed she got up stiffly from the table with one last look at the scowling form of the man trying to work a way out of his hopeless situation then walked slowly limping a little over the scratched glass floor of the room to the bright chill of the balcony she leaned slackly against the square pillar in the middle of the row of columns which divided room from terrace and looked into the snowy distance an unbroken plain of white stretched to the far horizon only the faintest shadings of light indicating any variation in the almost dead flat land to the right ajayi knew if she leaned out from the balcony which she did not like to do as she was a little afraid of heights she would be able to see the quarries and the start of the thin also snowcovered and treeless line of stunted hills she didnt bother to lean out she had no particular desire to see either the hills or the quarries aaah quiss roared behind her and she turned in time to see him sweep his arm over the surface of the thin artificial board in a gesture of fury and frustration chess pieces scattered from the board but blinked out the instant they dropped below the level it was on as though falling beneath some invisible beam all except a couple of knights which vanished as soon as they left the board itself the board flickered for a second or two then slowly faded until it was gone and quiss was left sitting looking angrily at the small wooden table the faint glow from the jewel in the middle of its filigreed surface dimmed went out ajayi raised her eyebrows waiting for the man to look at her but he did not he simply sat torso perched forward one elbow on his knee hairy chin in one hand fucking stupid knights he said at last he scowled at the table well ajayi said leaving the open entrance to the balcony as a light wind picked up and blew a small flurry of snow around her booted feet at least the games over i thought we had a stalemate quiss seemed to be addressing the table not his opponent we had an agreement it was quicker this way ajayi sat down on the small stool on the other side of the table light from the ceiling moved uncertainly over the carved wood quiss was still staring at ajayi looked at her companions face in the dimness quiss had a broad dark grey face covered with mottled black and white hair his eyes looked small and yellow set in a tracery of deepening lines which seemed to radiate from his eyes like waves in a small still pool he still did not look at her so she shook her head slowly resignedly and looked about the room it was long and wide and very dark with many pillars most of the light came from the openings onto the balcony there should have been light from above and below but in fact there was almost none and it was partly because of that and because it was also rather colder than it had to be that quiss had set off something like an hour before to find some of the castles attendants he was supposed to have asked politely for more heat up on their level but from what hed said ajayi suspected he had been his usual brusque and threatening self she would have gone herself but her leg was stiff and sore again and she wasnt sure she would have been able to manage the stairs she looked up at the ceiling where one of the rooms many odd columns flared into the flat thick pale green glass a single sinuous shape shedding milky light moved in the cold murky water overhead it was one of the castles many peculiarities that the interior lighting was produced by several species of luminescent fish wheres the bell quiss said suddenly sitting upright and looking about the room he got up from his seat as quickly as his thick furs and old muscles would allow kicked some slates and books out of his way across the glass floor and started inspecting a pillar a few metres away theyve moved it again he muttered he started looking at some of the nearby pillars and columns his boots scraping on the glass slabs of the floor as he moved ah he said when almost out of sight back in the depths of the room not far from the small windingstair he had entered the room by a few minutes earlier ajayi heard a distant scraping noise as quiss pulled on the bellchain ajayi picked up a small thin slate from the floor at the base of the pillar behind her she turned the slate this way and that trying to understand the curious markings scratched on its blackgreen surface wondering idly which part of the walls the slate had fallen from she rubbed her back at the same time bending to the floor had hurt her quiss came back to the table by way of another small though taller table over on the far side of the room where a few dirty cups and cracked glasses stood in a small tin basin under a dripping tap the tap was joined to a slightly bent length of pipe which appeared from a wall seemingly composed of tightly compressed paper quiss poured himself a glass of water drank it back at the games table he sat down in his straightbacked chair and stared across at ajayi who put down the slate she was studying of course the damn things probably not working quiss said gruffly ajayi shrugged she pulled the furs more closely around her the wind moaned through the balcony window the castle had two names as befitted its dual ownership the side quiss belonged to called it castle doors ajayis side named it the castle of bequest neither name seemed to mean anything as far as they could tell it was the only thing which existed here wherever here was everything else was snow the white plain they had been there they did not know how long quiss had found himself there first and after a little while when he realised that there was no night and day just the one flat monotone light always there beyond the windows he had started to keep a tally of the number of times he slept the record was scratched on the floor of a small cell in a corridor off the games room his bedroom there were nearly five hundred scratches on the glass floor now ajayi arrived seemingly deposited on one of the castles high flat rubblestrewn roofs one night when quiss had made eightythree scratches they had bumped into each other that day and were delighted to find each other quiss had been lonely with only the castles shy and dwarfish attendants for company and ajayi was pleased to find somebody who already knew their way round the cold forbidding stump of rock iron glass slate and paper which was the castle it had taken them only a short time to realise they were from opposite sides in the therapeutic wars but it had caused little friction they had both heard of this place they both knew why they were here they both knew what they had to do and how hard it was going to be to escape they knew they needed each other they had been promotionaries on their respective sides of the wars which were not of course between good and evil at all as noncombatants of every species always assumed but between banality and interest with great things expected of them once their training and indoctrination was completed but they had each done something silly something which called into question their very suitability for exalted rank and now they were here in the castle with a problem to solve and games to play being given one last chance a long shot an unlikely appeal procedure and an unlikely setting what strange architect had designed this place ajayi found herself wondering every so often the castle rising on a single outcrop of rock from the plain was built very largely of books the walls were mostly slate apparently quite normal grained rock produced by a perfectly standard physical process of alluvial deposition but when you loosened one of the slate blocks from the castle walls an easy job as the castle was slowly crumbling away and split it open on every surface so exposed a series of cut or engraved figures was revealed arranged in lines and columns complete with word and line breaks and what looked like punctuation quiss had demolished a significant part of the castle when he first discovered this unwilling to believe that the stones every one of them all the tens of thousands of cubic metres the castle must be composed of all those kilotonnes of rock really were saturated filled full of hidden indecipherable lettering the castles stunted squad of masons and builders were still working to repair the damage the old man had done by tearing down walls in his attempt to prove these hidden glyphs were isolated aberrations not as they indeed were ubiquitous this caused much grumbling and complaining as the masons considered they were anyway fighting a losing battle against the castles accelerating decay without its guests adding to their workload you called a small cracked voice said ajayi looked up at the door to the windingstair expecting to see an attendant but the voice had come from behind her and she could see quisss face starting to turn red his eyes widening the lines around them spreading out further fuck off he shouted over ajayis shoulder towards the balcony the woman turned round and saw that the red crow was perched on the balustrade flapping its wings like a man trying to keep warm and looking in at them its head cocked to one side an eye like a small black button glittered fastening on them given up on the game then the red crow croaked could have told you the silesian defence wouldnt work in onedimensional chess whered you learn to quiss stumbled out of his seat almost falling scooped a flat piece of slate from the floor and threw it at the red crow which screamed and jumped out of the way spreading its wings and dropping away flying into the cold clear space below the balcony its final call echoing briefly like laughter the slate quiss had thrown sailed out through the balcony doorway after the bird a stony imitation of its flight pest quiss spat and sat down again the rooks and crows which lived in the decaying stumps of the castles high towers could talk they had been given the voices of quiss and ajayis respective rivals unfaithful lovers and hated superiors they would appear from time to time and taunt the old couple reminding them of their past lives and the failures or mistakes which had brought them to the castle though never detailing them neither quiss nor ajayi knew what the other had done to justify sending them here ajayi had suggested they swap stories but quiss demurred the red crow was the most malicious and cutting and was equally proficient at taunting either of the elderly pair quiss was the more easily riled so he tended to suffer more than his fair share of the birds abuse he shook with fury sometimes as much as cold it was cold because something had gone wrong down in the castles boiler room the heating system was breaking down needing repair hot water was supposed to circulate beneath and above every floor in the games room supported by slate and iron pillars a tracery of iron girders held the low glass ceiling inside the glass was water about a halfmetre or so of slightly cloudy and salty water the boilers were supposed to keep warm the same went for the glass underfoot another halfmetre of water lay underneath the transparent slabs which made up the floor gurgling under the scratched surface and around the slaty pedestals supporting the columns above long gelatinouslooking bubbles of air moved like pale amoebae under the false ice of the glass luminous fish lived in the salt water they swam like long rubbery striplights through the waters gentle currents and kept the rooms corridors and towers of the castle bathed in a silky pervasive light which sometimes made distances hard to measure and gave the air a thick sort of look when ajayi had first arrived the games room had been just right held at a pleasant temperature by the warm fluid circulating above and below and enjoyably light as well thanks to the fish the odd system had seemed to work but now there was something wrong and most of the fish had retreated to the castles still warm lower levels the castles blackcloaked seneschal had scowled darkly on the previous occasions when quiss had tracked him down in the kitchens and asked him what was going on and what he intended to do about it he made dour excuses and talked of the corrosive effects of salt water and what a mess it made of his pipes and anyway materials were very hard to come by these days what days quiss had exploded there was only one day wasnt there or did they have days here but they were just very long the seneschal had gone quiet at that and sunk his thin grey face back into his hooded cape while the huge human stood glaring at him quivering with impotent rage time was another problem in the castle doors it went quicker the closer you were to a clock the further away from a timepiece you were the more it not only seemed to but did drag the clocks in the castle were immovable and erratic too going sometimes faster sometimes slower there was one great clock mechanism buried deep in the warmer depths of the place some vast assemblage of gears and creaking cogs which powered all the clock faces in the ramshackle shell of the castle rotating shafts buried in the walls transmitted the energy from the central machinery to the faces and rumbled in some places squeaked in others and leaked oil ubiquitously the oil mingled with the warm salty water which leaked from places in the ceilings and that was one of the reasons they had asked for some sort of banister rail to hold on to in the narrow windingstair the smell of oil and brine permeated the castle making ajayi think of old harbours and ships why time should go faster the closer you were to a clock they didnt know and none of the castles waiters and attendants had any explanation either quiss and ajayi had carried out experiments using identical candles lit at the same time one hard by the face of a clock the other in the middle of the room with them the candle by the clock burned nearly twice as fast they had formulated some vague ideas which would let them use this effect to shorten the perceived time it took to play the games they had to play but the castle clocks or perhaps the castle itself seemed unwilling to cooperate taken near a clock the table stopped working the red jewel in the middle stopped glowing the projection of the board and the pieces disappeared added to this was the fact that the clocks themselves were so erratic every so often they slowed down so that time went more slowly the closer you were to them whatever was affecting the rate time passed at seemed to obey the inverse square law the phenomenon apparently radiating from each clock face while at the same time there was a more generalised sort of effect emanating from the huge central mechanism buried somewhere in the castles many lower levels making everything down there happen more quickly the chaotic kitchens where the seneschal had his office and where vast quantities of food were continually being prepared in conditions of the utmost confusion noise and heat seemed to be the worst affected place of all ajayi could smell the cooking odours from quisss ragged furs as they sat waiting ah here you are then said a small voice ajayi looked quiss turned and there at the head of the windingstair stood an attendant the attendant was short about half the height of either of the two humans it was dressed in a sort of grubby grey cassock knotted with red string at the waist the cassock had a thin hood held in place over the attendants head and face by what looked like the brim from an old and worn red hat it was squeezed down over the attendants head the top of the hood showing through where the hats crown should have been the attendants face was hidden by a papier mache mask as worn by all the attendants and waiters the mask was set in an expression of abject sadness well better late than never quiss snarled dreadful sorry the attendant squeaked shuffling closer little red boots quite shiny flickered under the hem of its cassock as it moved it stopped near the table and bowed putting its small gloved hands into the opposing cuffs of its robe youve finished the game then oh good who won never mind who won quiss barked you know why weve sent for you do you yes yes i think so the attendant nodded its high voice not altogether as certain as the words youve got an answer no it lifted its shoulders slightly or dropped its head a little as though frightened of being struck if its supposition was wrong weve got an answer yes quiss said sarcastically he glanced at ajayi who smiled back and motioned towards the small attendant quiss cleared his throat and leaned forward towards the small figure which shrank away without actually stepping back right quiss said the answer to the question is you cant have both in the same universe got it yes nodded the attendant yes i think ive got it you cant have both in the same universe very good very logical that sounds like it to me i thought that that sounds we dont care what you thought quiss interrupted baring his teeth and leaning closer towards the small attendant who shrunk back so much further ajayi felt sure it was about to overbalance and fall backwards just do whatever you have to do and lets see if we can get out of this filthy place as you say right yes will do will do the small figure said backing off halfnodding halfbowing as it made its way back wards to the windingstair it tripped on a book and almost went flying but it just succeeded in remaining upright it turned and hurried away into the darkness they heard its steps clattering and fading in the distance hmm ajayi said i wonder what it does where it goes who cares as long as its the right answer quiss said shaking his head and then scratching his chin he turned to look back at where the doorway to the stairs stood in the gloom i bet the little idiot forgets oh i shouldnt think so ajayi said well i do maybe we ought to follow it find out where it goes we might be able to shortcircuit this whole ridiculous process he turned and looked speculatively at ajayi who frowned at him and said i dont think that would be a good idea itll probably turn out to be something really simple would you care to bet on that ajayi said quiss opened his mouth to speak but then thought the better of it he cleared his throat instead and traced some of the pattern on the top of the small wooden table between them with one stubby yellowgrey finger ajayi said perhaps we could just ask one of them ask that one when it comes back see what it says it might tell us we shouldnt need to ask it anything not if thats the right answer quiss said looking at the old woman this was your answer remember i remember ajayi said the next one can be yours if this one isnt right but we did agree to do it this way it was just luck its my answer first we agreed to do it this way do you remember that was your idea too quiss said not looking at her but lowering his eyes to watch his finger moving over the tables cut patterns just dont start any recriminations thats all ajayi said i wont quiss widened his eyes held his hands up and out his voice suddenly high in protest so that he reminded ajayi of a very large young child its going to be a long time before we get another chance though isnt it though thats just the way things have been set up ajayi said that isnt my fault i didnt say it was your fault did i quiss said ajayi sat back putting her gloves back on she looked doubtfully at the man on the far side of the table all right then she said it had taken them almost two hundred and fifty of quisss days to discover what the way out was they had to answer a single question but first they had to play a series of odd games working out the rules for each one in turn playing each one to a conclusion without cheating or colluding at the end of each game they had one chance and one chance only to answer the riddle they had been set this was their first game their first attempt to answer the question onedimensional chess hadnt been all that difficult once they worked out the rules and now their first answer was being carried or transmitted or processed whatever by the small attendant with the little red boots the question they had to answer was quite simple and they had been told by the seneschal that he had been told that it was an empirical question not a purely theoretical one though he had also said he found this difficult to believe as even the mysterious powers and forces which moved the wars themselves could not control such absolutes the question was what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object simple as that nothing more complicated or obtuse just that ajayi thought it was a joke but so far all the castles inhabitants all the attendants and waiters one or two other subsidiary characters they had discovered the seneschal himself and even the everfacetious rooks and crows which infested the decaying upper storeys had treated the question with extreme seriousness that really was the riddle and if they got the answer right they would escape from the castle be taken from this limbo and resume their duties and positions in the therapeutic wars again debt paid or they could kill themselves that was the unspoken alternative or at least unspoken by all except the red crow who cheerily brought the subject up on every third or fourth visit that was the easy way out it was a long drop from the balcony of the games room the castle apothecary carried a line of lethal poisons and draughts there were ways out of the castle a postern or two and a narrow winding path through the fractured rocks and fallen masonry all tumbled round the castles plinthed base like scree then a long cold walk into the snowy silence there were times when ajayi considered that way out not as attractive then and there but for when if there ever seemed to be no hope at some time in the future even so she found it hard to imagine ever becoming so desperate time would have to drag on a lot longer than it had she would have to get a lot more fed up and tired with this old timefrozen body before suicide became a serious alternative besides if she went quiss would be abandoned the selfdestruction of one partner meant that the games could not go on the other one could not play on alone or find somebody else to play and if the games could not be played and ended the riddle could not be answered ah excuse me they both turned to look at the windingstair door where the small attendant was peeking round the side most of its body hidden in the twisted darkness beyond what quiss said ah sorry the attendant said in a small voice eh quiss shouted his voice altering in pitch ajayi took a deep breath and sat back on the stool shed heard she thought quiss had too but he didnt want to admit it to himself speak up you wretch quiss roared that wasnt it the attendant said staying in the doorway its voice was still small ajayi found herself straining to catch its hesitant words that wasnt the right answer i really am liar quiss rose off his seat shaking with rage the attendant yelped and disappeared ajayi sighed she looked up at quiss who stood fists clenched glaring at the distant empty doorway he turned whirled round to look down at her the scraps of fur around him flying out your answer lady he shouted at her your answer remember that quiss she began quietly he shook his head kicked the small chair he had been sitting on and marched off across the squeaking grating glass floor heading for his own apartments before he left the games room for the short corridor which led to his rooms he stopped by the side wall of the room where more conventional paper and cardboard books lined the slate fabric of the castle the masons lame attempt at insulation quiss clawed at the wall tearing the faded yellowing books away from it throwing them behind him like a dog digging a hole in the sand bellowing incoherently and tearing and swiping at the wall baring the greenblack slate beneath as the torn ripped pages fluttered away behind him falling to the grimy glass floor like some flat grubby snow quiss stormed off slamming a door somewhere and ajayi was left alone she walked over to where the justsavaged books lay strewn across the floor and stirred them with the toe of her boot some of the languages she knew she thought it was hard to tell in the uncertain light and she was too stiff to be bothered bending down and some she did not recognise she left the pages where they lay onedimensional flakes littering the murky floor and she went to stand by the balcony window again against the unending unaltering whiteness of the plain a flight of dark birds flew the same sky looked down blank and forgettable and grey itself unchanging and what next she asked herself in a low voice she shivered and hugged herself tighter her short hair refused to grow any longer and her furs had no hood her ears were cold what was next they knew already from the castle seneschal was something called openplan go goodness knew how long that would take them to work out and play assuming quiss came back from his sulk the seneschal had muttered something about this next game being the closest analogue of the wars themselves which worried ajayi for a start that sounded awfully complex and long she had asked the seneschal where the ideas for these odd games came from he said from a place which was the castles chosen subject and had hinted she thought that there was another way to get to this place but refused to be more specific ajayi was trying to cultivate the seneschals acquaintance when her sore leg and stiff back let her get down to the basement levels where he was usually to be found whereas quiss had started out trying to intimidate him when the man had first arrived he had tried to torture information on how to escape from one of the waiters it hadnt worked of course just made the others frightened ajayis belly rumbled it must be mealtime soon waiters would appear shortly if they werent too frightened of quiss being in a bad mood damn the man openplan go she thought and shivered again youll be sawree croaked a passing rook cruising past on black wings and using the voice of an old bitterly remembered lover oh shut up she muttered and went back inside part two rosebery avenue on the bridge which carried rosebery avenue over warner street there was a smell of paint black dust lay on the pavement collecting in the spaces of the bridges primed balustrade graham hoped they would paint the bridge tastefully he looked into the cradle the painters were using to paint the outside of the balustrade from and saw an old radio so spotted with paint it could have been an exhibit the man in the cradle was whistling to himself and coiling a length of rope graham felt oddly satisfied at seeing life go on around him like this he felt almost smug at walking past people and them not giving him a second glance at least not now hed got rid of slater he was like some vital cell in the bloodstream of the city tiny but important a message bearer a point of growth and change she would be waiting for him now getting ready perhaps only now getting dressed or still in the bath or shower now at last it was coming out right the bad times were over stock deposed it was his time his turn he wondered what she thought of him now when they had first met she thought he was funny he guessed though kind too now she had had time to get to know him better see other sides of him as well perhaps she loved him he thought he loved her he could imagine them living together even marrying he would make a living as an artist probably just a commercial artist at first until his name became known and she could do whatever she wanted on his left were more buildings light industrial and office premises topped by flats outside an open door of something called the wells workshop at the kerb stood a large american sports car it was a trans am graham frowned as he passed it partly at its loud whitelettered tyres and obtrusive styling but partly because it reminded him of something something to do with slater with sara even then he remembered appropriately enough it had been at the party when slater had first introduced graham and sara to each other the coincidence amused graham a smell of new shoes from another workshop wafted around him as he looked up at the old stopped clock jutting out twofaced over the pavement from the first floor of the workshop hands frozen at twentypasttwo he glanced at his watch it was actually graham smiled to himself and recalled that night another of slaters nevertobewritten plots right its science fiction theres this oh no graham said they were standing by the mantelpiece in the front room of martin hunters large house in gospel oak mr hunter martin to his students was one of the lecturers at the art school and was giving his customary late christmas party in january slater had been invited and had persuaded graham he would not be gatecrashing if he came along too they took along a box of wine they bought between them and were drinking the red vin de table from plastic halfpint glasses apart from some salty garlic bread neither of them had had anything to eat for some hours beforehand so despite the fact that the party was hardly properly underway yet they were both feeling the effects of the drink music played loudly from the diningroom next door where the carpets had been rolled back so that people could dance most of the people in the front room were sitting on couches or beanbags martin hunters own paintings large gaudy canvases which looked like closeups of minestrone soup seen under the effects of a powerful hallucinatory drug adorned the walls just listen theres this lot of weird aliens called the sproati and they decide to invade earth i think this has been done before graham said taking a drink slater looked exasperated you wont let me finish he said he wore a pair of grey shoes baggy white trousers and what appeared to be a red tuxedo he took a drink and went on okay so theyre invading earth but theyre doing it as a tax dodge so that a tax dodge graham said leaning forward and looking slater in the eye slater giggled yeah they have to spend so much of the galactic year out of the milky way or the galactic tax federation hammers them for gigacredits but instead of paying for expensive intergalactic travel they camp out on some backwater planet still in the galaxy and just hide see but something goes wrong theyre coming in on a starship disguised as a boeing so that the locals wont suspect until its too late but when they land at london heathrow their baggage gets lost all their heavy weaponry ends up in miami and gets mixed up with the luggage of some psychiatrists attending an international symposium on analfixation after death and freudians take over the world with the captured hightech arms the sproati all get interned by the british immigration authorities thanks to a false reading on a spectograph when they were planning the operation theyve all taken too many tannin pills and theyre almost black usually theyre light blue one what do they look like graham interrupted slater looked confused then waved his free hand dismissively i dont know vaguely humanoid i suppose anyway one of them escapes and sets up home in an abandoned but working carwash in hayes middlesex while the rest die of starvation in the internment cells doesnt sound like theres all that many of them for an entire species graham grumbled into his glass theyre very shy slater hissed now will you be quiet this one sproati well call him gloppo a couple of girls entered the room from the hall graham recognised them from the art school they were talking and laughing he watched to see if they would look over at him and slater but they didnt he had on his new black cords for the first time they were a christmas present from his mother hed told her what to get shed been going to get him flared jeans and he thought he looked pretty good in his snowwhite shirt black jacket white trainers and lightly blonded dark hair look stop looking at those females and pay attention you are following all this arent you slater put his face towards grahams leaning forward along the mantelpiece graham shrugged looked at the red wine in his glass and said dont know about following feels more like im being pursued oh tres droll slater smiled artificially anyway gloppo installs a brain in the carwash so he can have sex with it all those brushes and rollers and foam and stuff you know while in florida the freudians are tightening their grip they ban all phallic symbols including gear sticks jumbo jets submarines and rockets and missiles ah motorbikes have to be ridden sidesaddle and bondage is right out rolled umbrellas stretch jeans and fishnet stockings are banned on pain of having a sony walkman taped permanently to your skull playing a looped tape of barry manilows greatest hits except for barry manilow fans who get john cage instead what about graham said pointing one finger at slater who pursed his lips and tapped his foot impatiently on the firesurround those people who like barry manilow and john cage slater rolled his eyes this is science fiction graham not monty python anyway gloppo discovers the carwash has been unfaithful in his absence with a metallicblue trans am i thought that was an airline its a car now be quiet gloppo finds the trans am has been screwing the carwash and the carwashs been riding the car graham sniggered shut up gloppo disconnects the lowfidelity carwash now then there were more people in the room now groups of men and women most of them young about his age stood and talked and drank and laughed the two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls graham hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to slater that didnt mean he was gay too he looked back nodding appreciatively as slater talking quickly waving his arms about eyes glittering seemed to approach the end of the story shitscared because hes about to be blasted into particles even smaller and more radioactive than ronald reagans brain goes to the loo by sheer coincidence the crap he does solidifies in the intense cold of outer space and the pursuing spaceship runs into it at about half the speed of light and is totally destroyed gloppo and his pal discover the joys of oral sex the freudians blow up the world but that was going to happen anyway and our two heroes live comparatively happily ever after slater grinned widely took a deep panting breath then a drink what do you think good isnt it well graham said looking at the ceiling dont tease you young blaggard its terrific admit it youve been reading that book graham said you know that book by that guy specific as ever graham what an incisive mind straight for the capillary i stand in awe you know the one i mean graham said looking down at the blockedoff fireplace and snapping his fingers that one that was on the telly well were narrowing it down slater said with a thoughtful nod he took another drink earth got blown up in that one too ah graham kept snapping his fingers slater was silent for a second gazing disdainfully at grahams snapping fingers then he said tiredly graham either concentrate on searching for the title of the book youre talking about or devote your full energies to practising calling for a waiter im not convinced you possess the ram for doing both at the same time the hitchhikers guide to the universe graham exclaimed galaxy slater corrected dourly well it sounds like it nothing like it you just dont recognise real talent when you meet it oh i dont know graham grinned looking over at the two art school girls who were now sitting on the floor on the other side of the room talking to each other slater slapped his forehead thinking with your gonads again its pathetic here i am yours for the asking talented handsome lovable and affectionate and all you can do is gawk at a couple of brainless broads not so loud you idiot graham feeling somewhat drunk scolded slater theyll hear you he took a drink and looked at the other young man and stop going on about how wonderful you are you can be very boring you know i keep telling you im not gay my god slater breathed shaking his head have you no ambition now on this june day graham smiled at the memory it would have been a good party anyway even if he hadnt met sara he thought the people were friendly there was plenty to eat if theyd wanted it and from what hed seen there were quite a few unattached girls around hed been thinking of asking one of the two who had entered the front room during slaters monologue the more attractive of them for a dance even as slater was telling him how desirable richard slater was it was funny graham thought the party seemed so long ago but the memory was more fresh and real for him than things that had happened even just last week he breathed deeply as he thought about it passing postal workers from the mount pleasant sorting office standing talking just outside a small cafe a big red italian car was parked at the kerb slater would have liked it graham smiled and crossed the road to the sorting office smelling its new coat of paint slater saw sara standing at the door of the room his face lit up he put his plastic tumbler down on the mantelpiece sara darling he called and went over to her through a couple of groups of other people and put his arms round her she didnt respond but when slater drew back her face held a slight smile graham was staring and saw the womans eyes flicker his way for a moment slater led her past the other people over towards the mantelpiece and him graham felt frozen people were still talking chattering away hadnt anybody else in the room seen her she was slim quite tall her hair was black and thick and looked tangled as though she had just got out of bed and not brushed it her face all her exposed skin was white she wore a black dress an old thing with slightly tattered lace which filmed about her like some black froth on top of the thin dress she wore a brightly coloured predominantly red chinese padded jacket it seemed to sparkle in the rooms dim lights black tights black low heels she was taking off her gloves as she approached her upper chest exposed for the breadth of a hand by the black dress showed a strange white mark like a sort of ragged and wide necklace settled loosely over her shoulders as she came closer he saw it was a scar the scar tissue even more white than the skin around it her eyes were black wide as though with some sustained surprise the skin from their outer corners to her small ears taut her lips were pale and nearly too full for her small mouth like something bled but bruised he had never seen anyone or anything quite so beautiful in his life instantly in less than the time it took her to walk from one side of the room to the other he knew he loved her this is the little ingenu i keep trying to seduce sara slater said presenting graham with one delicate roll of the hand mr graham park this is mrs sara ffitch quite the most gorgeous and elegant thing to come out of shropshire since well me she stopped in front of him her head lowered just a little his heart was beating too hard he must be shaking she was looking at slater through the black web of her hair now her head tilted she turned to face him put her small hand out a mrs she was married he couldnt believe it for the merest instant some final irreducible unit of desire he had glimpsed a feeling an urge within himself he had not imagined himself capable of but now this tiny standard piece of information these few letters had switched his hopes off like some cheap lightbulb two summers ago on holiday in greece with a school pal he had since lost touch with hed been on a small crowded ramshackle train heading out of athens over a scrubby plain in blistering heat parched ochre land and scrappy shrubs moved monotonously by the rattling carriage was full of rucksacks and hikers and blackdressed greek ladies with chickens then his friend dave shouted look and when he turned for a few moments only he glimpsed the corinth canal a sudden gulf sliced in the landscape blue space sparkling a ship in the deep distance fathomless light and air then the barren plain resumed hello she said and from his own eyes hers flickered down to where her hand was held out to him he was aware of slater drawing in a breath and putting his head back the way he always did when he was rolling his eyes but before slater could say anything graham quickly nodded switched his glass to the other hand and took the womans small hand in his shaking it formally ah hello her hand was cold how old was she midtwenties he let her hand go she was still looking at him her figure even looked good he wanted to weep or throw her over his shoulder and just run what was she how could she do this to him she was still looking at him such calm steady eyes the iris and the pupil almost one arches of deep dark brows like some perfect mathematical line he could smell her a cold sharp distant sort of musk like a window on to a forest of winter pine you mustnt worry she was saying smiling at him richard hasnt said very much about you she looked at the other young man who had retrieved his glass and was watching sara and graham with a smile on his face almost a smirk he shrugged hes never even graham swallowed tried to stop himself sounding too amazed mentioned you she smiled at that first at him then slater she stuffed her black gloves into a pocket in the padded jacket well she said looking at them in turn again lifting her face to gaze directly at graham if i may make so bold chaps how about a drink i was bringing my own but i put it in the wrong pocket of my coat and it fell through the lining and smashed her eyebrows arched suddenly slater laughed what a wonderful story sara im sure none of us would mind if you just didnt bring any at all he turned to graham mind you sara does dress in the early oxfam style so she might be telling the truth he looked at the woman patting her shoulder and putting his glass on the mantelpiece again allow me mam he walked off through the press of people now all but blocking the way to the door graham suddenly noticed the room was crowded and getting hot he was alone with her though slater gone she stooped brought one foot up fiddling with strap on her shoe then started to overbalance tipping towards him he put one hand out she put out hers and gripped his forearm looked up briefly and made a noise which might have been thanks and went on working at the strap of her shoe he could not believe this was happening to him he actually tingled where she touched him his heart seemed to be beating in some huge dry place an echoing cavern his mouth had gone dry she let go of his arm lifting the shoe she had taken off showing it to him and smiling she laughed look she said see wine he gave a small dry laugh of his own all he could manage and looked at the small black shoe the hourglass shape of white leather inside it raked from toes to low heel was stained pale red and still looked damp she pushed it closer laughing again and lowering her head as though shy here smell if you can stand it her voice was deep slightly hoarse he did his best to laugh said heartily nodding his head bobbing it from side to side achingly conscious of how stupid he must look yup looks like wine to me a terror seized him he couldnt think what to say to her he found himself looking round for slater as she put one hand on the mantelpiece and slipped her shoe back on fastening the strap again a wine box appeared above the crowd of heads by the door he watched it come closer relieved ah here comes your drink i think he said nodding to where slater was pushing through the crowd lowering the wine box and a glass he was carrying smiling at them when he saw sara and graham ive been proving to graham i really did have some wine and it smashed sara said as slater turning briefly to greet somebody he had just passed came over to them he set the wine box on the white mantelpiece held the fresh glass beneath the little tap and filled the container almost to the brim indeed i trust he was suitably impressed bowled over graham said nervously then wished he could gulp the words back somehow neither of the others seemed to think anything of it though but he felt bowled over and could hardly believe it wasnt obvious to every single person in the room he took his plastic tumbler up again and sipped at the wine watching sara over the lip of the tumbler well then sara slater said leaning oneelbowed on the shoulderhigh wood of the mantelpiece smiling at the paleskinned woman how are we then hows the old home town slater meant shrewsbury if graham recalled correctly slater glanced at graham sara and i were nextdoor neighbours for a while i do believe our parents may even have intended us for each other at one time without actually saying anything about it of course slater sighed looked sara up and down grahams heart or his guts something deep inside him ached as slater went on not for me of course though looking at sara i almost wish i was a lesbian sometimes graham laughed biting the sound off the instant he thought he was laughing too long he hid behind the wine glass again putting his lips to the liquid but not drinking despite his dry throat he would get too drunk he couldnt disgrace himself in front of this woman was she as old as hed thought was slater serious about them being some sort of childhood sweethearts or even just close enough in age for their parents to think he shook his head for a second trying to clear it the room seemed suddenly stuffy and close he felt claustrophobic there was a scream from somewhere in the house the chatter of voices quietened briefly and he could sense heads turning to the open door leading from the room that i suspect is hunter slater said unconcernedly waving one hand his idea of a party trick is to tickle his wife until she wets her knickers sorry sara i interrupted you nothing she said i was just going to say its dull and horrible i hate the winter there so youre here slater said the woman nodded im staying in veronicas place for now while shes in the states he heard something strange in her voice oh god that awful place in islington slater looked sympathetic you poor thing its better than where i was she said quietly she was mostly turned away from him he could just see the curve of her cheek the line of her nose and as he watched she put her head down very slightly and her voice altered again slater tuttutted to himself looking into his glass finally left him then slater said and graham felt his eyes widening that pulling back of the skin towards the ears he thought he had seen frozen on her face left separated he stared at her anxiously then at slater and tried hard not to look as interested as he felt she was looking down into her glass she hadnt drunk very much finally she said bringing her head up shaking her head not in negation but a sort of defiance so that the tangled black hair bobbed once and the other one slater said his voice was cold now expression deliberately blank something about his eyes was hooded making his eyes briefly resemble hers graham felt himself leaning forward wanting to catch her reply had she started talking both their voices were low they didnt really mean to include him in the conversation and it was noisy in the room people laughed and shouted the music next door had been turned up i dont want to talk about it okay richard she said and to graham her voice sounded hurt she turned fractionally away from slater and drank deeply from her glass she looked at graham not smiling then her lips trembled and a small smile did appear park you idiot graham told himself youre looking at this woman as if she was et get a grip of yourself he smiled back slater giggled briefly then said to graham poor sara married a cad who had the ill taste to become manager of a sewage works as ive told her now that shes left him and his personal lifes in such a mess perhaps hell do what these managerial types usually do in such circumstances and throw himself into his work graham started to smile though he thought the joke itself might be in rather poor taste but then he was aware of sara turning quickly putting her glass on the mantelpiece and looking straight at him coming closer her face set in strange hard lines eyes bright taking him by the elbow and turning her head as if to emphasise that she was talking to graham ignoring slater saying you do dance dont you oopsiedoopsie me and my big mouth slater said quietly to himself as sara took grahams plastic tumbler and put it on the mantelpiece beside her own glass then led him stunned unprotesting through the crowd towards the room where the music was and so they danced he couldnt remember a single record track or tape played her body was warm through the layers of clothing they wore when they danced slow dances they talked but he couldnt remember what about they danced and danced he was hot sweating his feet hurt after a while and his muscles ached as though they were not dancing but running pounding through a strange noisy jostling forest of soft moving trees in darkness just the two of them she kept looking at him and he kept trying to hide what he felt but when they danced together holding each other he kept wanting to stop and just stand there mouth hanging open express through sheer immobility something he possessed no dynamic for to touch her hold her smell her they went back to the other room eventually slater had gone so had the wine box and saras glass they shared grahams glass taking turns he tried not to stare at her her skin was still white though a sort of heat seemed to radiate from her now something which he caught and felt became infected by the room seemed darker now and smaller than it had people moved and pushed and laughed and shouted he was vaguely aware of them around her neck the whiteonwhite semicircle of scar tissue seemed to glow in the dim light like something itself luminous you dance well she said i dont he began cleared his throat i dont usually dance all that much i mean his voice trailed off she smiled you said you draw youre at the school yeah second year he said then bit his lip was he trying to prove how old he was people sometimes said he had a baby face hed been questioned about his age in pubs several times what age was she what age did she think he was what sort of things do you draw she said he shrugged relaxing a little he had dealt with this sort of question before what they tell me to they give us exercises what i really graham who is this lovely young thing graham looked round in despair at the sound of mr hunters voice their host was a huge lugubrious man who reminded graham of demis roussos he was wearing some son of brown caftan graham closed his eyes mr hunter was what he resembled a refugee from the sixties his fat hand squeezed grahams shoulder you are a dark horse young man he swept forward towards sara almost hiding her from graham grahams obviously so speechless with you he wont introduce you to me im many hunter marty thought graham and i just wondered if youd ever thought of doing any mod at that point the lights went out the music groaned in a deepening bassy slide and people made appreciative animal noises oh fucking hell graham heard mr hunter say and then something huge squeezed past him in the darkness saying thats woodall he always finds the mains switch at parties matches flared lighters grazed sparks just as with a hiss sara came forward hugged him the lights flickered on before graham could do more than put his arms round her she pushed herself away again as soon as the lights came on shook her head looking down her perfume still spiralling away between them the music started again people went aww sorry he heard her say im silly i get frightened at thunder too she looked around distracted for the glass but he was holding it and handed it to her thanks she said and drank dont be sorry he said i quite enjoyed it she looked up briefly then smiling uncertainly as though she didnt believe him he licked his lips moved forward put one hand out and touched hers where it gripped the glass she kept looking at the empty glass avoiding his face sara i can we she began then looked quickly at him put the glass on the mantelpiece shook her head saying i dont feel all that well what he said concernedly taking her by one hand and a shoulder im sorry can i she motioned towards the door and he helped her through the packed people using his elbow to get them out of the way in the hall they found mr hunter again holding a slack boredlooking black cat he frowned when he saw them you look rather pale he said to sara then to graham your friend isnt going to throw up is she no im not sara said loudly raising her face dont mind me ill just go and lie down in the snow or something she started as though to make for the front door but mr hunter held up a hand to stop her not at all i do beg your pardon ill find you here come with me he put the cat on top of an old sofa which had been shoved against the hallway wall and led graham and sara towards the stairs on the far side of farringdon road graham passed easton street where another painters or windowcleaners cradle lay on the pavement upended for some reason neat coils of rope around it summer the season for painting and scaffolding getting things done after the winter coverup he found himself smiling recalling yet again that first meeting that strange almost hallucinogenic evening he stepped past an old lady standing still in the middle of the pavement seemingly looking across the road at a man in elbowcrutches waiting to cross the street graham almost automatically tried to imagine drawing the scene i saw slater heading out the door with some rugchested young romeo mr hunter said as they got to the secondfloor landing in the big house i hope you werent depending on him for a lift were you he asked graham graham shook his head slater didnt even drive as far as graham knew mr hunter unlocked a door and opened it switching the room light on this is our little girls room you lie down young lady and take good care of her graham ill send my wife up to make sure youre all right he smiled at sara then graham then closed the door behind them well graham said awkwardly as sara sat down on the small bed thats us told he bit his lip wondered what he was supposed to do now sara put her head in her hands he stared at the sootylooking ball of black chaos that was her hair wanting her terrified of her she looked up at him he said are you all right whats wrong i mean do you are you hurting ill be okay she said im sorry graham you go back to the party if you want ill be fine he felt himself tense he went forward sat on the end of the bed with her ill go if you want but i dont mind just sitting i dont want you sitting here by yourself all alone unless you want to be i wouldnt enjoy myself anyway i expect id be thinking of you i he had been going to touch her shoulders with his arm but she came towards him anyway her head on his shoulders so that the perfume of her hair enveloped him made his head feel light she seemed to slump it was not an embrace and her arms seemed heavy and slack her hands stayed in her lap limp as puppet limbs he held her felt her shiver he swallowed hard looked round the room at snoopy posters posters of horses in sunlit meadows posters of adam ant and duran duran a small white dressing table in one corner looked like something from a dolls house gleaming and bright with tidy arrangements of bottles and jars she shook again in his arms and he realised she might be crying he lowered his head to her hair instinctively she brought her head up and her eyes were dry she put her hands on the bedspread looked into his eyes an anxious searching as her gaze shifted about his face first focusing on his right eye then his left then slipping to his mouth he felt inspected plumbed and like a moth in front of some antilighthouse casting a shadowbeam making him want to pull back fly away from the intensity of those black searching eyes im sorry graham i dont want to be a tease she said lowering her head again i just need somebody to hold right now thats all im going through oh she shook her head dismissing whatever she had been about to explain he put his hand on hers hold me he told her i know what you mean i dont mind without looking at him she slowly came closer again then leant against him finally her arms went gently round his waist and for a long time they sat there while he listened to the sounds of the party and felt against his side and within the perimeter his arm made around her the gentle ebb and flow of her breath please please dont come now mrs hunter not now not in this perfect fragile moment steps thudded on the stairs and his heart seemed to try to echo them but the steps and some laughing voices went away he held her wrapped in her smell warmed by her nearness he felt drugged by her perfume and her presence he felt like he had never felt in his life before this is absurd he told himself what is going on here what is happening to me right now i feel more happy more satisfied than in any postcoital daze those somerset nights in friends cars other peoples houses once in a moonlit field my carefully scored and compared encounters to date they all mean nothing only this matters god you fool in a rambling old house in gospel oak in london in january i lose my heart what are the chances shell ever love me christ to be like this for ever to live to be together to hold her like this in bed some night when shes afraid of the thunder when im there to hold her to be held by her she stirred against him and he mistook it for something like the small movements of a child asleep and smiled down at her through the slow current of perfume rising from her black turmoiled hair but she was awake and brought her head up drawing away from him a little looking at him so that he had to hide his smile quickly because it wasnt something he had meant her to see what are you thinking she asked him he took a deep breath i was thinking he said slowly conscious of her arms still round his waist no one hand went to her brow smoothed her hair away from her eyes there though it went back again clasped lightly behind him about whether you could tell from the wine on the inside of a shoe what type it was the wine i mean the vineyard and vintage um whether it was south slope or the soil had been especially acidic that year a broad smile slackening her tensedup vulnerable face filled the white space in the dark mass of hair his heart seemed to leap inside him at the sheer beauty of her now and the realisation he had produced this change he felt his mouth open involuntarily and closed it again speechless or you could have champagnetasting competitions from ladies slippers she said laughing he grinned nodded she sighed her expression changed again and she took her arms away from him bent over as though hugging herself round the middle i think id better go to the loo she said then looked at him will you wait ill wait he said too solemnly he thought he smiled touched her hand again you sure youre okay just nerves she shook her head looking down at his hand thanks for well thanks ill be back she got up quickly went to the door and out he collapsed back on the bed eyes wide and staring at the white ceiling all his life he had not believed anything could be like this you stopped believing in father christmas tooth fairies paternal omniscience and in the sort of overthetop crazy heartthudding happyeverafter love they told you was the ideal life was sex infidelity divorces infatuation yes but love at first sight smell touch for him where was that carefully nurtured fine cynicism now he lay on the bed like that waiting for her he got up after a while and paced round the highceilinged room looking at the layered posters and the soft toys the two old wardrobes the small ringtree on the window ledge hung with little cheap colourful rings he touched the long dark green curtains looked out into the garden and over it at the house beyond tall and dark a dim sodiumyellow glow filled the sky patchy snow blemished the garden the door opened he smiled and turned a tall drunklooking woman in a red jumpsuit swayed in the doorway holding on to the outside of the jamb her face was thin hair yellow you all right dear she asked graham looking round the room graham made a small smile im fine mrs hunter mrs ffitch is ah in the loo oh the woman said he didnt think she remembered him he had seen her he recalled at the endofterm dance right then well dont mess up the bed she withdrew closing the door graham was left frowning at the door wondering exactly what she meant it opened again and mrs hunter reappeared you havent seen my husband have you im mrs hunter martys wife he shook his head he felt unfairly urbane almost contemptuous of the drunk woman no mrs hunter he said not for a while hmm she said and was gone he watched the door for a bit but nothing more happened the party sounded loud behind it he thought he could smell dope grass or resin fumes he went back to looking out the window sometimes watching the reflection of the room in it he looked at his watch wondering how long shed been away it seemed like ages should he go and check would she want him to what if something had happened shed fainted he didnt even know where the toilet was up here hed been once to the one on the ground floor that was all should he go looking for her it might look like nosiness he might open the wrong door embarrass people he paced the room then lay down for a while hands clasped behind his head he got up and went back to the window willing the doors reflection to move it moved he turned just in time to see it start to close as a male face disappeared after a brief inspection oh sorry a voice said a girl giggled outside steps sounded he faced the window once more finally a sick feeling in his belly as though something there was twisted pulsing pain he left the room he found the toilet a floor down he thought ill try the handle the door will be open and the room will be empty shes gone i mean nothing to her he tested the handle the door was locked itll be a mans voice he told himself it was a womans wont be long sorry sara he said uncertain his voice shaking there was silence and his eyes smarted it isnt her it wouldnt be her it wouldnt be her at all graham look im really sorry ill be out soon god im sorry no no he said almost shouting he had to lower his voice thats okay thats fine ill wait in the room all right yes yes please five minutes she was there he went bounding up the stairs three or four at a time praying to himself the room hadnt been taken over by some amorous couple while hed been away cursing himself for doubting her now shed think he didnt trust her the room was empty as hed left it he sat down on the bed his hands in his lap his heart thumping in his chest he stared at the bottom of the door i go into ecstasies because a woman is in the loo he thought this is enough to make me feel like i own the world can i tell anybody about this can i tell slater can i tell mum did she and dad ever feel like this she came back she looked whiter than ever her breath was ragged and faint pulsing she lay down on the bed not speaking to him she made him feel frightened but as she lay down eyes closed on her side and facing him something else in her some frail scavenging eroticism made him shake with desire oh my god i feel like a rapist shes ill are you he choked on the dry words began again are you really poorly should we get an ambulance poorly she said and smiled her eyes still closed thats a nice word she opened her eyes looking at him she blinked in the light im fine really really i am just nerves im a weepy female and i should probably be on valium but fuck it im riding it out you know ive things to get over sorry to be a bother its no bother he said and was at last pleased with the way he had said something warm strong not patronising but caring did she hear it that way though she nodded at him eyes closing she sniffed at the top of her dress over her breasts im sorry she said suddenly eyes open again i stink of some horrible aftershave graham realised that indeed there was a strong smell of cologne from her she smiled wanly at him and shrugged i threw up this was all i could find to cover the smell ive brushed my teeth too but i still taste it god this is awful graham im using you like a nursemaid i didnt mean to dont worry about it he said weakly her eyes closed again you wouldnt get the wrong idea if i asked you to put that light out would you she asked my eyes hurt sure he said softly and went to the door with the light off cold yellow bands of light spread from the window she was a black pool of shadow on the bed a space of darkness he sat down by her and she raised one of her arms he sat down beside her muscles trembling her arm pulled him gently down her face was opposite his close indistinct this is terrible graham she said almost too softly for him to catch youve been lovely and im leading you on but i cant deliver at the moment youll hate me i he began but gulped that precipitous too instinctive and glib statement back too soon no he insisted not at all he put one of his hands out and took both of hers in his they were warm just this is he shook his head not knowing if she could see or maybe feel the bed bounce slightly its really nice he gave a tiny selfdepreciating laugh on the last word acknowledging its inadequacy she squeezed his hands thanks she whispered they lay like that for a long time his thoughts were in a strangely distant turmoil as though they were no more the workings of his own mind than the farbelow hubbub of the party was his own voice in the end he gave up trying to analyse his own feelings or even totally understand them and lay there relaxed listening for the slow regular breathing of sleep and wasnt sure if he detected it or not the door opened briefly at one point and a young mans voice said shit but graham didnt even turn to look he knew it could be nothing which would disturb them he held her in his arms still and warm and after a while in that darkness he felt as though he held nothing at all it was like when a limb having been left in the same position for too long a time somehow loses all reference to the body and for those instants before some willed movement the very location and attitude of that arm or leg is quite unknown he held her but he felt nothing she was there and in his consciousness distinctly other and different but she was also like some relaxed part of himself a silent mix of identities cancelled out like the pale skin white scar dark clothes and black hair being equated and combined and the resulting coalescence being clear invisible nothing eventually she stirred kissed him quickly on the forehead and levered herself up sitting on the side of the bed i feel better now she said she turned to look at him in the darkness he stayed looking at her id better go home she continued could you ring for a taxi come well go back down yeah he smiled the light was very bright when he switched it back on she yawned and scratched her head messing her hair still further in the hallway he called for a cab for her going to islington where are you going she asked him can you come as far as islington do you want to take the cab after that the party was slightly quieter but there were still plenty of people about a man and woman in punk gear lay asleep in each others arms on the couch in the hall graham shrugged islingtons a bit closer i think he said was she inviting him back probably not she looked pained i cant invite you in or anything im sorry he hadnt thought so but his insides still ached briefly thats all right he said brightly yeah islingtons a bit closer ill pay half she didnt let him pay half he didnt protest too much they got to the place where she was staying a quiet culdesac the taxi drove off he couldnt afford taxis she looked at a big bmw bike parked by the kerb then up at a darkened row of tall houses in the yellow light her face was like a ghosts i keep saying im sorry this evening she said coming closer to him he shrugged would they kiss it seemed impossible i wish i could invite you in not to worry he said grinning his breath made a cloud between them thanks graham for staying with me i mean im such a bore do you forgive me im not always like this nothing to forgive its been great she laughed quietly when he said it he shrugged again smiling hopelessly she came to him put her gloved hand behind his neck youre lovely she said and brought her face to his kissing him putting her lips to his just like that soft and warm and wet better than any kiss better than his first real kiss making him dizzy with the feel of it he hardly knew what he was doing his mouth opened slightly her tongue touched his upper lip once then slipped away again she kissed him quickly on the cheek and turned walked to a doorway fumbling for a key in a small purse she took from her old fur coat can i see you again he croaked of course she said as though it was a silly question the key slipped in she opened the door i cant remember the telephone number here yet slaters got it ciao she blew him a kiss her last few words with the door open had been whispered the door closed quietly he watched a light go on above go out again it took him five hours to walk back to leyton where he had a bedsit it was cold it rained once lightly then turned to sleet but he didnt care that kiss that of course the walk had been an epic something he would never ever forget one day or night he would do that walk again retrace his steps for the sake of nostalgia one day when they were together and he had a good career when he had his own house and a car and didnt need to walk and could afford taxis if he wanted them hed take that same route just for old times sake try to recapture the uncertain ecstasies of that dark early morning trek nearly half a year later in the summer heat he could still recall the feeling of the cold air on his skin the way his ears became numb with the freezing cold the way he kept bursting out laughing holding up his arms to the cloudy dark orange sky he could smile at it now hed had more time to think to get used to this slightly absurd rapture he could accept it now he still couldnt entirely believe it in the sense that he could not believe that it was happening to him that he was so vulnerable to such a common almost hackneyed feeling but it was there he could not in any sense deny it graham passed an abandoned workshop on rosebery avenue posters advertised bands and their singles and albums the traffic roared and the sun beat but he remembered january and shivered with the memory of that long walk half moon crescent he had repeated and repeated to himself as hed walked that night she lived in half moon crescent he had checked the number and the street before hed started out on his trek so that even if slater had lost or forgotten her number she would not be lost to him it became like a chant a mantra for him half moon crescent halfmooncrescent halfmooncrescent a chant a litany clerk starke unemployed he sat in a plastic chair in a job centre the chairs were all the same in these places in every social security office and job centre hed ever been in not exactly the same as each other hed seen different types but they were all the same types he wondered if any of the chairs provided protection against microwaves a woman had been talking to him but she had gone away she didnt seem to be able to cope with him probably they hadnt expected this they hadnt prepared properly he had decided not to go straight home or to go to the pub yet that was what they would expect him to do just sacked or rather resigned with all that money of course the obvious thing to do would be go home to his room or to have a drink they wouldnt expect him to go to a job centre and sign on so when he had seen the sign ahead of him in the street hed walked right in and sat down and demanded to be attended to mr a man said to him light suit short hair spotty face but looking in charge he sat down opposite grout and clasped his hands on the large white blotter which almost covered the top of the small desk what grout said suspiciously he hadnt been listening your name is the young man said steven grout said ah thats your first name grout leaned forward put one fist on the table and stared into the mans eyes his own narrowed and glinting as he said how many do you think ive had the young man looked confused and concerned steven folded his arms and leant back feeling triumphant that had floored him steven put his safety helmet further back on his head this was quite good really he felt he had the upper hand for once and they hadnt been able to set up the microwave gun yet either he felt cool and relaxed of the two of them the young job centre man looked the more hot and worried can we start again the young man said taking out a pen and tapping the end of it on his lower teeth he smiled impatiently oh yes steven said cunningly im an expert at starting again lets fine the young man said he drew a breath whats your name grout said suddenly leaning forward again the young man looked at him for a while starke he said are you staring or look sir the young man called starke said seriously putting his pen down im trying to do my job here now are we going to approach this in a sensible manner or not because if not there are plenty of people and you look clerk starke grout said and tapped one finger on the small desk starke looked at the finger so he withdrew it when he remembered how dirty his fingernails were im unemployed you know dont have some nice safe little civil service job with pensions and and things im a victim of the recession you may think its all a joke i assure you but i know whats going on and i know why im here and why youre here oh yes im not stupid you cant pull the wool over my eyes like that i know what the score is like they say i may be thirtysev thirtyeight but im switched on all right and i know everything isnt hunkydory the way people think it is you may think its easy for you and it might be but im not so easily fooled oh no he sat back again nodding emphatically he didnt always express himself perfectly he would be the first to admit that but it wasnt what you said it was the way you said it somebody famous had said that well sir im not going to be able to help you unless you let me ask you some questions well then said grout throwing his arms wide and opening his eyes wide get on with it on you go im ready ask away starke sighed right he said whats your name grout steven said thats your surname starke said grout thought about this carefully he always got confused with this which was surname and which was christian name it was like nett and gross he always got them mixed up why didnt people just say first and second just to confuse him no doubt there was a way of working it out though if you were a sir then the name just after that was your first name so that must be the surname and christian name was easy because christ had been jesus christ so obviously therefore the christian name was the second name and that was how you could tell that seemed logical but now he thought about it he wasnt sure that that wasnt the way to remember the way it wasnt not the way it was he decided to play safe my name is mister steven grout fine starke said writing grout as in that stuff you put between tiles and bricks and things right he looked up stevens eyes narrowed what are you trying to insinuate im im not i will not be insinuated against steven said and tapped the front of the desk what business is it of yours to make insinuations against me id like to know eh answer me that i no you cant can you and ill tell you why because im not here because i want to be thats why there im not one of your scroungers ive never taken the easy way out ill have you know it hasnt always been easy but ive always kept my selfrespect and i havent let anybody take that away im my own man and thats very important in these times even if you havent had the problems ive had and you havent because thats perfectly obvious youre sitting there and asking me the questions youve got to realise clerk starke im not that were on opposite sides of the desk as it were he tapped the desk to show what he was talking about this is a symbol you know he sat back to let this sink in starke looked at the desk its a desk mr grout its a symbolic desk grout said jabbing his finger at it its a symbolic desk because were sat on opposite sides of it and thats the way thingsll always be like that you cant tell me any different i know the score like they say mr grout starke sighed laying the pen down again im afraid this interview isnt really getting us very far you talked to my colleague ms phillips when you first came in i didnt find out her name grout waved one hand dismissively well you didnt get very far with her either did you and now i didnt get very far grout said i didnt get very far its not my job to get very far its yours youre supposed to get far with me youre the people who get trained in this sort of thing not me steven said indignantly and tapped the desk once more for emphasis how often do you think i do this eh answer me that do you think i make a habit of this sort of thing is that it are you making insinuations again im not trying to insinuate anything mr grout starke said as he sat back in his chair resigned he shook his head im trying i was trying to conduct an interview and now im trying to explain to you that youre not making it at all easy first you made my colleague distressed i could tell she didnt like me she was contemptuous i wont have that grout explained starke shrugged whatever now youve made it impossible for me to carry out an interview despite the fact ive been extremely patient im not stopping you from carrying on your interview grout said shaking his head im not you ask your questions ill answer on you go just ask what you want im very cooperative im just not prepared to be contemptuated against or be the object of insinuations thats all the young man sat looking at him for a moment then raised his eyebrows sat forward and took up his pen once more very well well try one more time your name is mr steven grout correct steven nodded youve just left your previous employment is that right yes and you wish to not steven said sitting forward and tapping the desk as mrstarke sat back slumping down with a sigh in his seat and shaking his head smiling slightly because i wanted to either they were out to get me from the start they wanted rid of me all the time i was hounded out they forced me to leave but i left of my own free will i wouldnt give them the satisfaction i resigned i have my pride you know they cant kick me around ah mr starke said sitting forward in his seat and looking more interested you resigned i certainly did i wasnt going to let them well you do realise mr grout that by resigning you have made yourself ineligible for unemployment benefit for a period of what steven said sitting forward whats this i did the only decent thing i could do if you think i was going to stand there and im sorry mr grout but i thought i ought to mention it you still have to register as unemployed but for the first oh no steven said im sorry thats just not good enough ive paid my stamps ive paid as ive earned im not a scrounger or one of these social misfits im a working man not just now perhaps but i am i certainly am i just wasnt going to let them sack me i was not he tapped the desk going to give them the satisfaction you see i appreciate that you would rather terminate your employment yourself mr grout but the rules are that if you do then you have to well thats just not good enough im sorry grout said theyd found him he was starting to heat up his collar felt itchy and he could smell some strange tense bodysmell coming from his armpits mr starke was shaking his head nevertheless dont you nevertheless me young man grout said raising his voice people were looking at him the sunlit job centre was quite crowded he saw now the sun was slanting in through the windows and heating the place up but there was ordinary heat and there was microwave heat he knew the difference well by now ordinary heat didnt itch the way microwave heat did ordinary heat didnt come from inside the way microwave seemed to affecting you all at once he decided to try ignoring it and said dont you nevertheless me oh no im not having it starke gave a small laugh a laugh just like that im sorry mr grout but what youre not having is unemployment benefit you get supplementary benefit instead for the first six youre sorry grout said well you dont suit your sorrow like they say i want to know why im being victimised against youre not being victimised mr grout starke said the rules are that if you leave your employment voluntarily you have to wait six weeks before you can claim unemployment benefit if you are eligible which i imagine you will be you may claim supplementary benefit during the interim and what about my dignity steven said loudly what about that i ask you eh supplementary benefit indeed ive paid my stamps ive paid my taxes this isnt good enough i appreciate your position mr grout but im afraid that is the way things are set up you probably will be eligible for supplementary benefit first you have to register well its not good enough grout said sitting straight up in his chair and fixing starke with one eye trying to turn the tables again so that he would stop feeling uncomfortable and starke would go back on the defensive im being victimised against and thats all there is to it as though i havent got enough crisises to have to put up with but this wont be the last straw they wont get rid of me that easy im just not well if you feel youve been unfairly dismissed starke said you can go to the ha grout said im unfairly everything employed unemployed housed treated everything but you wont catch me complaining ive learned better doesnt get you anywhere id rather keep my dignity he was trying to explain but he got the impression he was losing out now clerk starke had the upper hand it was so unfair those devils they hadnt said anything to him at the depot they hadnt told him anything about not getting unemployment money theyd let him resign just when theyd been on the point of sacking him maybe just a few more seconds and they would have fired him and he wouldnt be in this position now just a few more seconds the swines well starke began and started talking about what steven should do about registering as unemployed grout wasnt listening he watched the young mans face now set in the sort of bored practised professional expression grout had seen a hundred times before he heard the words p in starkes speech and his heart sank that was what hed dropped wasnt it or was it ashton had shouted something which sounded like that when he was running away from the depot ohoh a new salvo of microwaves hit him he felt a rush of uncomfortable warmth slide all over his body and he felt his face going red his skin prickled and itched damn hed felt so pleased victorious even after leaving the depot that hed quite forgotten about dropping the form but of course dan ashton had chased after him with it or at least that was what they wanted him to think he suddenly realised he didnt remember being given that form they had probably not even given it to him in the first place if it was all that important then they almost certainly hadnt it was like when his giro cheques from the unemployment people hadnt turned up the last time hed been out of work it was all done to wear him down they could talk all they wanted about incorrectly filledout forms wrong addresses and the like he knew what was really going on they were slowly trying to destroy him they probably didnt have to refer back to their superiors those mysterious controllers be they human or not for instructions they probably had their contingency plans all ready and prepared so even when hed got the drop on them they could still count on messing him around somehow devious bastards sometimes he had to admit he wished they would just leave him alone and let him live out this petty pointless insignificant life in peace it might not be all that much but it might be almost bearable if they didnt keep tormenting him it was an ignoble unworthy thought he knew but he was now anyway only human and therefore prey to human weaknesses whatever sort of superhuman hed been during the war it was a measure of how well they had done that he even considered such an awful thing they had so oppressed his higher thoughts his own belief in himself that he would almost trade the chance to return to his previous glorious existence for some peace but he wouldnt give in they wouldnt win all the same he wished hed paid a little more attention to what had gone on when hed been leaving the depot so that he could have spotted when they carried out that trick with the form he was supposed to have dropped he wondered if they had some other sort of beam they could train on him which would make him forget things or make his attention wander the trouble was he thought as starke talked on that it would be very difficult to spot when they were using such a subtly fiendish device this needed more thought but what to do now there was always revenge he could get back at them in some commandostyle way ever since he had been at high school hed found some enjoyment and relief by getting back at them in ways they obviously didnt expect hed thrown rocks at windows of offices and works theyd sacked him from hed defaced buildings scratched officials cars and mutilated bonnet mascots though that was largely for his own safety and hed made bombhoax telephone calls it wasnt much and they would take it in their stride no doubt but apart from the fact these revenge raids certainly did upset his tormentors a little making life and their cruel purpose just that little bit less easy for them the greatest effect was on him he relieved his frustration he vented his anger and hatred if hed tried to bottle it up he would have exploded one way or the other long before now theyd have been able to certify him insane or hed have done something so terrible and criminal they could have put him in prison where hed be sodomised and knifed quietly disposed of without any fuss because the rules were different in there at least out here they had to play according to some sort of standard of fairness even if it was a standard they could change as they went along according to how it suited them like doubling the bus fares just after hed found that job way out in brentford but in prison even more so than in a mental hospital there were no real limits to what they could do to him starke was still talking taking bits of paper out of the drawers in the desk and showing them to grout but steven wasnt looking or listening his eyes were glinting as he thought about the revenge he could have on the islington people he could go and dig up the roadworks during the night and get some cement made up in a small container and cement up the holes in manhole covers you used to lift the things up by if he filled those in theyd have a devil of a job lifting them and he could attack the filledin holes theyd done in upper street earlier this morning hed leave the ones hed done so theyd eat their words about his way being inferior that would be satisfying he stood up and pulled his hard hat down firmly over his head starke was looking up at him mr grout what steven said looking down and seeing the young man again he frowned and shook his head never mind sort it out later ive got things to do he turned and walked away starke was saying something behind him hed show them hed get back at them he bumped into some people waiting to join the queue for the seats in the reception area ha ha hed got in just before the rush and went out through the doors back to the street and the bright sunlight hed sort this unemployment stuff out later he should have gone to his local job centre anyway where they knew him never mind he at least had some ideas for revenge hed go back to his room and change and wash then then hed have a drink and think further about how to get back at them all maybe he would even mount a punitive expedition tonight striking while the iron was hot and all that it was risky especially considering hed been out just that previous evening putting sugar in car and motorbike petrol tanks but it might be a good idea anyway hed have to think about it he drew a deep breath and headed for the nearest parked car openplan go it took quiss longer than he had expected to get to the castle kitchens theyd changed some of the corridors and stairways en route from the games room to the lower levels and quiss taking what he thought was the usual way had found himself making an unexpected left turn and coming to a windy deserted echoing chamber which looked out over the white landscape to the tall wooden towers of the slate mines he had scratched his head and retraced his steps then followed his nose to the chaotic kitchens of the castle doors you he said and grabbed one of the kitchen helpers who was passing by carrying a heavy bucket full of some steaming liquid the tiny scullion squealed and the bucket clattered to the floor staying upright but letting some of its glutinous contents slop over the side quiss heaved the small attendant up by the scruff of its neck until its face was level with his its maskface stared back at him with empty eyes the green brim round its stained spotted hood was like a giant washer or a ring round a rather grubby planet put me down it yelped and struggled the green cord round its waist waggling to and fro help help quiss shook it shut up you spirochaete he said tell me where i can find the seneschal in all this racket he jerked the attendants whole body and his own head to indicate the kitchen around them quiss was standing at the foot of a flight of steps on the outer edge of the pandemonium that was the castles kitchens the kitchens were buried deep in the structure far from any outside wall they were huge there was a high ceiling vaulted with cut slate on iron pillars and standing where quiss was all the walls save for that immediately behind him were invisible concealed by the rising steams smokes and vapours from hundreds of pots pans vats stoves kettles skillets grills tubs and cauldrons light came from prisms hung in the roof great cut slabs of crystal reflected light from the outside walls through long empty light corridors and then down into the tumultuous kitchens also strewn across the complicated ceiling with the prism ports obscuring whole sections of the barrelled structure fume ducts writhed like immense squareflanked metal snakes their grilled barred mouths sucking the kitchens vapours away to be vented high in some converted turret the seneschal had told quiss that the air circulation system was powered by one of the lowest ranks of the castles diminutive attendants they walked round inside treadmills linked to big watermilllike fans quiss felt his eyes start to smart in the fumeladen atmosphere and as he peered through the grey yellow and brown clouds of rising steam and smoke thought of suggesting to the seneschal if he ever found him that he somehow persuade the scullions powering these airwheels that they should run rather than walk it was also rather warm quiss could feel himself starting to sweat already despite having left most of his furs lying at the top of the steps he had just descended i dont know the way ive never heard of him the squirming attendant said its little greenbooted feet made running motions though they were about a metre off the kitchens slatetiled floor what quiss roared spraying spittle into the scullions maskface he shook the thing roughly what you excretory wretch i dont know the way to the seneschals office ive never even heard of him then how quiss said bringing the blank sorrowful face closer to his own do you know he has an office i dont came the yelped reply you told me no i didnt yes you did no quiss said shaking the attendant roughly so that the crownless brim round its cowl fell off i he shook it again sending the things hood flying off its head and revealing the smooth continuation of the mask over the creatures skull so that its little arms waggled trying to put the hood back on again as quiss finished didnt are you sure the scullion said groggily positive oh heck so where is he i cant tell you it isnt allowed i oh dont shake me again please then tell me where i can find the seneschal waaah the small attendant said you scrofulous tapeworm quiss bellowed he turned the attendant upside down and plonked its head into the bucket it had been carrying the steamy yellow gruel in the bucket splashed out on to the kitchen floor he let the minion struggle and kick for a little while then hoisted it back out shook it and turned it the right way up again his hands were getting messy he wiped them on the creatures cloak now then quiss said that was horrible the attendant wailed ill do it again and leave you there unless you tell me where the seneschal is the who no dont i right quiss said and dumped the scullions head back into the now halffull bucket he dragged it back out the small creatures head lolled slightly on its shoulders and its arms flopped by its side tell you what it said breathing with some difficulty lets both find somebody we can ask no quiss shouted he held the weakly struggling thing by one leg this time he considered surely things werent so utterly disorganised in the kitchens that the scullions no longer knew who was in charge of them or where his office was had things come to such a pass it was a bad show quiss thought shaking his head the attendant had stopped struggling he looked down remembered what he was doing said oh and yanked the limp scullion out dripping gruel he shook it for a while until it gurgled and moved its head weakly are you willing to talk yet oh shit all right the attendant said weakly good quiss walked over to a large range of working surfaces hotplates sinks and racks he sat the scullion down on a flat surface only for steam to issue suddenly from its rear it squawked and jumped up quiss apologised for setting it down on a hotplate put it on a draining board instead and splashed some water over its maskface its like this you see the scullion said wiping its mask weve started this new regime to make things more interesting down here when people ask us a question some of us always tell the truth and some of us always tell the opposite some of us give correct answers and some of us give incorrect answers but were always consistent you see no i dont see quiss said looking into the face mask sitting on the tall range its small legs sticking out over the bright brass rail which acted both as a safety barrier round the hotplates and as a place to hang grubby kitchen towels the small attendants face was almost at the same level as the humans quiss waited for the scullion to draw breath and looked round the kitchens again as it did so there were very few attendants visible he was sure there had been more when he first arrived they had been scuttling about all over the place carrying implements standing on stools stirring steaming mixtures chopping things and throwing bits and pieces into cauldrons some of them had been mopping the floor some washing plates and cups some just running not carrying anything but speedy and purposeful all the same now he could see only a few shadowy figures halfglimpsed through the mists of the cooking fumes he wrinkled his nose at the smells thinking that the cowardly little wretches were trying to keep out of his way he hoped their cooking burned the scullion on the draining board started talking again well it means that youve got to approach the problem in a logical manner you understand its another sort of game you have to work out the right questions to find out what you want to know see oh quiss said sweetly smiling pleasantly yes i see you do the scullion said brightly sitting up oh good quiss picked up the small attendant by the front of its cloak and brought its blank face up to his own scraping the creatures green boots over the surface of the draining board with a rattling noise you tell me how to get to the seneschals office quiss said evenly or i shall boil you alive understand strictly speaking that isnt a wellformed question the scullion croaked choking as quisss fist tightened the material round its throat strictly speaking youre going to be dead very soon unless you give me the right instructions quiss grabbed the scullion from the range tucked it under his arm and walked away from the entrance straight ahead towards the centre of the kitchen the noises of the place went on around him muffled only slightly by the mists and vapours he could hear shouted instructions and curses the clanking of ladles and giant spatulas the hiss and splutter of frying the sloshing of water and soups the grating of giant pans being moved the machinegun chatter of chopping knives overhead apart from the whispering air ducts he heard a creaking noise interspersed with a light clinking and clanking quiss looked up to see an overhead cablecar system of what looked like lengths of knotted string and bits of chain running through little metal wheels set in the ceiling and carrying on small hooks cups and mugs and plates so that was why they had a hole at the edge forks and spoons and knives of every description they sailed overhead and swayed with the slightly erratic action of the cableway holding them bumping into each other now and again and so producing the clinking noise just audible over the din quiss heard rapid footsteps approaching through the racket and ahead of him he saw two small scullions running towards him out of the mist the hindmost attendant was holding what looked like a large loaf of bread and was using it to hit the minion in front which was running almost doubled up its little gloved hands held over its head where the pursuing scullion was raining blows with the loaf three metres in front of quiss they saw the tall human and skidded to a stop in unison they looked intently at him then at each other then executed a smart aboutface the scullion with the loaf threw it at the other who caught it and started to hit the other minion over the head with it as they ran back into the mist the way they had come their figures one crouched almost double one striking out with the loaf of bread and their running footsteps quickly absorbed by the rolling mists quiss shook his head and marched on the scullion tucked under his arm not struggling he caught sight of a few others but they turned tail and vanished when they saw him through the mist he called out to them but they didnt come back there must he thought be thousands of these small attendants waiters scullions masons miners mechanics and general helpers and dogsbodies in the place and around it he knew something about provisioning and logistics and the castles kitchens could have provided tencourse meals every few hours for an army of tens of thousands it all seemed too large too overprovidedfor to feed them and the stunted attendants even if there were a few more of them than theyd seen until now and they were always complaining about being shortstaffed anyway even the scale looked wrong the kitchens appeared to have been designed for human use judging from the height of the working surfaces and the sheer size of the ladles pots and pans and other pieces of equipment hence the scullions having to use small stools to stand on when they wanted to do anything like wash up dishes stir soups or work controls they seemed to have their own stools quiss had observed they carried them on their backs as they made their way from one range to another and quiss had seen quite violent fights and rows breaking out over the disputed ownership of one of the small threelegged platforms they came to a sort of crossroads in the kitchens they were well out of sight of the broad flight of steps quiss had entered the kitchens from at a point where he could continue ahead into the mist or turn either right or left past huge fat stoves holding great rotund cauldrons of some bubbling frothing liquid the sootblack metal of the stoves was carved with grotesque faces from which a dark heat beat out at quiss a yellowred light jetted out from the eyeholes of the distorted faces like a bright beam shining through a keyhole in a door leaking wisps of smoke wormed their way out from the sides of the stoves doors adding a pungent aroma of something like burning coal to the medley of smells produced by the manhigh vats bubbling away on top of the bulging flattenedlooking stoves quiss looked around he could see a few of the other scullions nearby standing on their stools stirring pots wiping stoves polishing stovefronts they were all studiously avoiding meeting his gaze though he thought they were watching him out of the sides of their eyes he brought the minion he had under his arm out lifted it up to look into its blank face which way he asked it it looked about pointed left that way he stuffed it back under his arm marched off to the left past the heavy black stoves through their radiated heat the scullions ahead of him got down off their stools and waddled away disappearing in the kitchens foggy wastes are you sure you wouldnt like to ask more complicated questions the small attendant said muffledly from his side he ignored it i mean which way is a bit basic wouldnt you agree now which way he brought it up let it look about as they came to another junction the cauldrons at their backs great stone tubs set in the floor and covered with some sort of green scum on either side the attendant shrugged left quiss went that way the attendant under his arm said that wasnt exactly what i meant just adding a now on to the start doesnt really make much difference with respect i dont think youve got the idea of the sort of questions you have to ask its quite easy once you get the hang of it really im surprised you havent encountered puzzles like this before think carefully which way here that way the scullion sighed and pointed with its arm it said im probably saying more than i should but as im giving you the information without you asking for it i dont think its covered by the rules all id say is that what you have to do is to ask questions which although are apparently about what you want to do where you want to get to should really be telling you about the person youre where now left again do you see what i mean what youre really finding out is the truthtelling status of the person youre getting the information from so that quiss half listened to all this as he watched suspiciously the same cableway of cutlery and cups squeak and rattle its way overhead you can find out two things no wait a minute come to think of it youre finding hmm let me think about this quiss looked at the black stoves the strange faces cast in hot metal the giant vats of liquid he made a rising growling noise at the back of his throat and brought the scullion out from under his arm looking into its maskface again were back where we started you licebrained dwarf well i did warn you cretin quiss screamed into its face he saw a cauldron to one side with its lid hanging above it suspended on a pulley he hoisted the scullion up and threw the creature into the huge vat the scullions whines and yelps disappeared in a series of gruelly splashes which spurted from the top of the big tub quiss slapped his hands together and turned almost immediately he was surrounded by what seemed like hundreds of the small attendants they flowed from every avenue of the kitchen a waisthigh tide of grubby greycowled figures rushing in towards him their coloured boots sashes and hatbrims swirling out of the mist quiss experienced the tiniest moment of fear then savage anger and was about to go down fighting take as many of the little bastards with him as he could when he realised that they were bowing and wringing their hands and making apologetic noises not howling angry ones he relaxed i tell the truth i tell the truth honest i do one was shouting and it and a few others tugged at the lower edges of the few furs he still had on and pulling on his underbreeches where they appeared out of the top of his boots he let them lead him away straight ahead between the rows of cauldrons other scullions were running in with ladders and lengths of rope climbing up on to the big stove and scrambling up to the messy lip of the vat in which judging by the amount of splashing and screaming the small attendant still survived quiss was led by the dwarfish scullions through the banked ranges past gleaming tubs boiling vats open fires and grills past rows of massive wingnutted pressure cookers guarded by blast screens under huge nshaped pipes bubbling and gurgling and leaking steam and over the dainty countersunk tracks of a narrowgauge railway until eventually he saw a wall ahead and was led up a rickety wooden staircase to a narrow gantry then stopped at a small wooden door set into the wall one of the attendants rapped on the door then they all scampered off a display of multicoloured boots flashing along the wooden gantry until they vanished into the mist the door was thrown open the castle seneschal glared out at quiss he was a tall thin man of indeterminate age with hairless grey skin and dressed in a long black robe without ornament save for a small silver fork with twisted tines which hung on a piece of string round his neck and rested on the black breast of the robe the seneschals eyes were long seemingly stretched out at either side as though the eyeballs within were the size of clenched fists his right eye had two pupils in it side by side in the grey whites now what he barked when he saw quiss standing there guess quiss said putting his hands on his hips and leaning forward glaring back at the seneschal who stood blocking the doorway into his office there still isnt any heat up there were freezing to death and we cant see to play this absurd game if you cant get more heat up there let us move the games room down a few floors not possible the boilers are being repaired full power soon be patient its difficult to be patient when youre dying of hypothermia the engineers are working as fast as they can so they can reheat our corpses ill order more furs we can hardly walk for the weight of the ones weve got what good will those do havent you got any thermal underwear or even heaters couldnt you build a fireplace we could burn books there are plenty up there shouldnt do that the seneschal said shaking his head arent two the same all unique dont have two copies of any of em well they still burn they would still burn well quiss had to be careful hed already burned quite a few wallfuls and had come down under protest as much to keep ajayi happy as anything else she had complained about the waste and said they shouldnt have to burn books to keep warm it offended her besides she had said perhaps they would take more time repairing the heating system if they knew the two of them were able to keep warm without it it was a bad precedent to set he had grumbled but agreed the seneschal said shouldnt be too long ill have some hot bricks sent up what big hot bricks glow red hot in the stoves ill have some sent up every mealtime should last until next one you can warm hands on them surprising amount of heat thrown out when theyve cooled down a bit you can put them in your bed warm it up nice youll be as warm as toast hot bricks is that all you can offer exactly how long until the boilers are fixed the seneschal shrugged studied the carving on the edge of the door he was holding then said not long youd best get back to your game now the seneschal came out of his room shutting the door quickly and taking quiss by the upper arm he led him back along the wooden gantry to the steps ill show you out good quiss said theres a few questions i want answered first of all where does all this food go you must make about a hundred times more than you need what do you do with it recycled the seneschal said as they came to the steps and went down them why bother making it all then never know who might drop in the seneschal said quiss looked at him to see if he was serious one of the seneschals two right pupils seemed to be looking at him keeps them in practice anyway he continued suddenly grinning at the tall old man as they walked between the levels of stoves and cookers and fires scullions ran about the place carrying brooms and buckets and baskets full of hidden ingredients they were all very careful no matter how fast they were going and how urgent their task seemed to be to avoid getting under the feet of quiss or the seneschal yes keeps them occupied out of mischief the greyskinned man said quiss hmmd to himself well he could understand that but he still thought it was a wasteful way of keeping the lower ranks occupied and it didnt square at all with the continual excuses the seneschal and his minions kept making about being understaffed he would let it pass for now where does it come from ive yet to see anything except weeds grow in this place the seneschal shrugged where did you come from he said darkly quiss narrowed his eyes at the pupil which seemed to be looking at him indeed out of the corner of its eye he thought the better of pressing on that one too they came to the place where quiss had seen the inset tracks of the narrowgauge railway a small train hauled by a tiny steam engine and comprising doublebogied cars carrying three sealed hissing cauldrons each trundled slowly by wheels screeching and clattering over a set of points quiss and the seneschal stopped watching the train pass in front of them disappearing into the steam and smoke of the kitchens with a cacophony of rattles hisses and clanks and a single strangled whistleblast then they walked on quiss swallowing a question concerning the trains destination there was a muffled explosion somewhere on their right and a thick orange glow spread through the mist like a setting sun there was a clattering noise and some howls the orange glow to their right faded but did not disappear the seneschal glanced at it briefly but did not appear excessively worried even when after a few moments the scullions running past and round them were all carrying pails of water and sand fire blankets cutting gear and stretchers thats another thing quiss said as they came closer to where he had dumped the mendacious scullion in the cauldron with all this equipment for moving things about the place he gestured up towards the moving line of clinking cutlery above their heads looping under the assorted ducting and swivelled prisms of the kitchens ceiling not to mention the clock mechanism and transmission setup and the complicated plumbing for the floors and ceilings yes said the seneschal quiss scowled and said why cant you get the food to us while its still hot they were passing the vat quiss had thrown the small attendant into the scullion appeared to have survived the ordeal and was sitting quivering and bedraggled being wiped down by some of its colleagues an undercook was supervising the cleaning of the stove around the cauldron and the preparation of fresh ingredients to replace those lost the seneschal stopped looking at the work being done with a critical eye the scullions worked even faster the one quiss had dumped in the gruel saw the huge furclad figure of the human and started shaking so hard that little flecks of soupy stuff flew off it like water from a dog well the seneschal said its a long way from here to there so construct a dumbwaiter that would be the seneschal paused watching one of the apprentice chefs dipping a long ladle into the cauldron the unfortunate attendant had just vacated the apprentice put the ladle to its mouth then nodded appreciatively and started back down the ladder as the seneschal continued going against tradition it is a great honour for our waiters to take our guests their meals i certainly could not deprive them of that a dumbwaiter would be the apprentice chef with the ladle was talking to the undercook now who also tasted the ladles contents and nodded while the seneschal said impersonal who cares if its impersonal these arent necessarily the sort of persons i want to have anything to do with anyway quiss said indicating the various attendants waiters and scullions around them as the undercook respectfully approached the seneschal bowing to him the seneschal stooped slightly as the undercook borrowed a stool and stood on it to whisper something into his masters ear the seneschal looked briefly at the quivering attendant being looked after by the others then he shrugged and said something to the undercook who quickly got back down off the stool and turned to the others the seneschal looked at quiss and said unfortunately there are not only your feelings to be taken into account i have the welfare of my staff to think of such is life i must go now he turned and left ignoring the shouts and screams of the small wet attendant as after the undercook had gathered the other scullions round pointed to the cauldron the ladle and its own belly before nodding at the wet attendant the kicking howling creature was grabbed by the same scullions who had recently been comforting it hoisted up the ladder still resting against the side of the great vat and thrown back in the lid clanged down rattling on its pulleys quiss stamped his foot in frustration then marched back up the steps to retrieve the rest of his furs and make his way back to the castles upper reaches openplan go had turned out to be a game of placing black and white stones on a grid to claim territory on an infinite board it had taken him and the woman two hundred days as they measured them to work out and play the game again they were nearly finished now and here he was yet again trying to get the heating improved since their last game the heat and light had deteriorated and now i suppose itll be my fault the heating hasnt got better immediately he muttered to himself as he walked along the narrow passageway she would blame him well let her he wasnt bothered just so long as they could finish this stupid game and get on to his answer she might be better at thinking up things as stupid as their games infinite pieces which were only infinite in one direction from a point you could hold one end but it was still infinite insane but he was certain he had the right answer and a more direct and obvious one than hers had been he should never have let her talk him into letting her give hers first when they had been deciding how to handle this whole situation her and her smoothtalking logical arguments what a fool hed been well get it right now though he said to himself as he ascended through the castles twisted interior and the light faded and the cold grew more sharp and he gathered his furs more closely around him yes well ill get it right this time definitely muttering and talking to himself the old massive motleyhaired man shuffled through the darkening levels of the castle wrapped in his furs and hopes and fears quisss solution to the problem his answer to the riddle what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object was the immovable object loses force always wins the red crow sitting on the balustrade of the balcony had cackled with laughter ajayi had sighed the attendant came back after a few minutes its little red boots ruffling the hem of its robe much as i dislike being the bearer of bad news it began part three amwell street a succession of heavy trucks rumbled down amwell street as graham turned onto it from rosebery avenue they were big grey lorries stone or chippings carriers with great corrugated sides and a plume of dust trailing after them in the nearstill air graham was heading slightly uphill now and slowed his pace accordingly he listened to the traffic felt the warm air slip by moved his portfolio from one hand to the other and thought of her he hadnt been able to see slater for two days after the party and that time had passed in a daze for him on the monday though slater had been in the small steamy cafe and sandwich bar on red lion street which he usually spent most of his term days in and graham had supplied him with cups of tea and expensive rounds of smoked salmon on granary bread while slater slowly teasingly told him about sara yes they had been neighbours in shrewsbury but of course they had only seen each other during the school holidays and of course they hadnt made friends over some grotty little terracehouse garden fence hed first noticed her from the tree house in his parents garden while she was learning to ride her new pony in her parents ten acres of mature woodland and wellkept pasture a tree house graham teased back wasnt that a bit butch slater replied tartly i was being jane sweetie not tarzan saras best years slater continued had been just after leaving school she had been a scamp in those days he said sighing with exaggerated wistfulness she drank guinness smoked gauloises and would eat anything as long as it was loaded with garlic odourfree she wasnt she carried a large handbag whenever she went out it contained potatoes to stuff up the exhaust pipes of expensive cars and a very large sharp knife for tearing holes in the hoods of convertibles if it could be arranged she threw up into the cars through the holes so created she got drunk a lot and once did a strip on top of the piano in a local pub graham asked sara about this on one of their canal walks she smiled looked down at her feet as she walked finally admitted a little ashamedly that it was all true i was wild she agreed in her slow low voice nodding graham felt a sort of ache then as he had when slater first told him he wanted to have known her then to have been a part of her life during that time he was jealous he realised of time itself she was three years older than slater twentythree now she had been married for the last two years to a man who really was a sewage plant manager slater was quite hurt that graham thought hed invented this detail for the sake of a joke she had married against the wishes of her parents they hadnt talked since the marriage she didnt get on well with them anyway probably she married as much to get at them as anything else it was a pity because her parents werent bad sorts like his own they just believed everything they read in the daily telegraph sara had only one real skill or talent not having done very well at school not even allowed to sit the oxbridge exams she had nevertheless been diligent about her piano lessons and was in fact quite good on the instrument the horrible hubby had not encouraged this however and indeed had sold her piano one weekend when she was away staying with friends that hadnt been the last straw far from it selling the piano was only a few months into the marriage she ought to have got out then but she the stubborn one persisted hubby wasnt happy when no kiddies appeared blamed her sara had tried to be the good wife but failed the other wifies she was supposed to socialise with to further hubbys career were dreadful brainless bores social ostracism followed outbursts of silliness hubby drank a lot didnt hit her often but did badmouth her excessively and took up fishing went away for weekends with male friends shed never heard of claimed to be tackling rivers but kept bringing home filleted sea fish on the sunday night and was always suspiciously careful to empty his pockets when he gave her his clothes to wash she began to suspect she had her own weekends here in london staying with veronica whose flat she was now looking after while its owner worked a years exchange course at ucla on one of those weekends she had met stock a photographer who did a lot of work for one of the newspaper colour supplements though always under assumed names for tax purposes slater had seen him on his bmw bike or just getting off it never seen him without his crash helmet on could be an albino or a rastafarian for all he knew looked a bit like darth vader without the cloak jealous moody type apparently married too but separated no idea why he appealed to the lovely sara anyway he thought they would be drifting apart a bit now perversely but predictably because they were seeing more of each other not just weekends stock stayed the night at the horrible little place in islington quite often but slater thought sara might be getting bored with the blackleather macho man the thing round her neck scar tissue all right a birthmark shed had removed in early teens in case it turned malignant yes he found it perversely beautifultoo la cicatrice had been his pet name for her finally slater divulged the flats telephone number and graham noted the seven numbers down carefully doublechecking them and ignoring slaters snide remarks about quirky sara with her terrible taste in men and the unfaithful untrustworthy nature of women in general hed offered to swap stories about what had happened once they had each paired off at the party but graham wasnt going to tell and told slater so as he carefully wrote her name by the side of the numbers sarah fitch slater laughed pointing and guffawing at what graham had written not one big f two little ones like british industry our saras undercapitalised and no h on the end of sara he said graham called her from the school that day found her in she said she was delighted to hear from him he thrilled at the sound of her voice she was free the following thursday evening shed meet him in a pub called the camden head at nine looking forward to it he whooped for joy as he left the phone cubicle she was late as she always was and they only had about an hour and a half to talk before she had to go and he was nervous and she looked tired though still beautiful in bright red cords arran jumper and tattily magnificent fur coat i think i might be falling for you you know he said as they were drinking up at eleven she smiled at him shook her head changed the subject seemed distracted looking about as though for somebody she expected to see he wished hed kept quiet she walked with him to the busstop would not let him walk her back to the flat said not to follow her shed watch be angry she kissed him again quickly daintily sorry i havent been great company call me soon ill be on time next time graham smiled to himself at the thought of that her sense of time didnt seem to be like everybodys elses she kept her own time some inner erratic clock regulated her like some conventional caricature of female punctuality she always arrived late but she usually did turn up almost always they met on weekdays not weekends at first in pubs never very far away from the flat small talk mostly a slow process of discovery he wanted to find out all shed done and been everything she thought but she was reticent she preferred to talk about films and books and records and though she seemed interested in him asking him about his life he felt cheated as well as flattered he loved her but his love the love he wanted to be their love seemed stalled stuck at some early stage as though hibernating until the winter had passed she wouldnt talk about stock at all graham walked up amwell street how are you he asked himself oh i am well he looked at his fingernails it had taken him half an hour to get his hands and nails clean using white spirit and a nailbrush as well as soap and water a couple of specks of paint on his shirt had surrendered besides he had used a friends nivea to restore some moisture to the scrubbed parched skin on his fingers the only stains left on his hands were a few stubborn traces of india ink left from the drawings of sara hed finished the previous day graham smiled she was ingrained in him he passed the entrance to a courtyard there was a banner slung slackly over it advertising a fete he gave the banner a second glance fixing its curves and lines in his mind storing the sight so that he could draw it some time tricks could be played points made by drawing a drooping banner so that certain letters and words were obscured and altered by the folded fabric he remembered one time hed walked up here in may after she had started seeing him in the afternoons and going for long walks along the canalside it had poured with rain a total cloudburst thunder cracking and grumbling in the skies above the city hed been soaked and hoped that at least this might finally gain him entry to the flat shed never invited him in when he got there he pressed the button on the entryphone waiting for the crackle of her distorted voice but there was nothing he pressed and pressed he stood back in the street the rain stinging his eyes wetting him to the skin getting in his mouth and eyes warm rain huge hard drops slicking and sticking the clothes to his body erotic making his heart beat faster in a sudden squally sexual fantasy she would invite him in no better yet she would turn up in the street having been out also wet to the skin she would look at him they would go in nothing he walked all the way to upper street near the busstops before he found a free phonebox he stood in it his clothes and skin steaming dripping water into the urinescented callbox called her number listened to it ring called again saying the numbers to himself like a chant making sure his finger was in the right hole on the dial each time the double ring trrtrr trrtrr trrtrr he listened to it trying to will her to the phone imagining her coming back to the flat after being out she might hear the phone from the street now she would put the key in the lock now running up the stairs now dashing in dripping short of breath to grab the receiver now now trrtrr trrtrr trrtrr please his hand hurt his mouth ached with the expression of tense anguish he knew he wore water ran from his hair over his face down his back water dripped from his elbow where it bent holding the phone up to his ear be there be there be there trrtrr trrtrr trrtrr there were people outside the callbox it was still raining though more lightly now a girl outside tapped on the glass he turned away ignored her please be there trrtrr trrtrr trrtrr the door of the callbox opened eventually a wetlooking blonde in a raindarkened coat stood there glaring at him ere wots your game eh ive only been standin ere tweny minutes aven i you aint even put your bleedin money in yet he said nothing he put the phone down and walked away to get a bus he forgot to take his ten pence out of the slot where hed had it ready and hed left a pile of tens and fives sitting on top of the directories he felt sick she apologised over the phone the next day shed been hiding under the bedclothes playing her favourite david bowie cassette at maximum volume on her sony walkman trying to drown the noise of the thunder he laughed loving her for it graham passed a small hall in its courtyard was a little stall selling cakes he considered buying a cake to eat but while he was thinking about it he kept on walking and thought it would look stupid to turn back so far up the street so he didnt though at the thought his stomach suddenly rumbled hed last eaten about four hours earlier in the same small cafe where hed got slater to tell him about sara that january graham crossed the road he was approaching clairmont square at the summit of the hill where tall houses once genteel then decaying now undergoing gentrification faced over tall trees to the bustle of traffic on pentonville road graham shifted his plastic portfolio from one hand to the other inside were drawings of sara ffitch and graham was proud of them the drawings were in a new style he had been experimenting with recently and now he felt he had got it just right it was perhaps a little early to be certain but he thought they were probably the best things he had ever done this made him feel good it was another sort of omen a confirmation once theyd had a conversation on two levels from street to firstfloor window it had been in april on the second occasion hed visited her in the afternoon for a walk along the canal she came to the window when he pressed the button on the entryphone poking her head out of the lower half of the opened sash window through dark brown curtains hello shed called he went out into the middle of the street coming out to play he said smiling up at her in the sunlight just then the window had slipped the lower half falling down on her she laughed and turned her head round ouch she said you all right he asked she nodded didnt hurt she wriggled he shielded his eyes to see better i think i can get back in hope so or im stuck here he gave a small concerned laugh he thought suddenly of how she must look seen from inside the kitchen she was leaning out of an ugly sexual idea occurred to him and he looked about for the big black bmw bike but it wasnt there it never was when she invited him to meet her at the flat she was keeping him and stock out of each others way sara was giggling things like this are always happening to me she said and shrugged put her elbows on the sill of the window and smiled down at him she wore a loose heavy tartan shirt like some fake lumberjack so he said are you coming for a walk where shall we go she said tempt me i dont know you fed up with the canal maybe she shrugged her eyes seemed to wander away from him scanning the horizon ah she said the post office tower he turned round looking south and west though he knew he couldnt see the tall building from the street you want to go there we could go to the revolving restaurant she laughed i thought theyd closed it he said she shrugged stretched her arms out arching her back have they how boring of them bit out of my price range anyway he laughed ill buy you a wimpy and chips if youre hungry there hows that for an offer the zoo she said and looked down at him aardvark and chips chimpy and chips he said she laughed making him feel good she said we could go to the zoo today you really want to he said hed heard it was quite expensive to get in but hed go if she wanted i dont know she shrugged again i think so the canal goes by the zoo might be a long walk but it would be nice through camden lock his neck was getting sore from looking up at her she gripped the edge of the window sill seemed to strain up on the window across the small of her back shes stuck he thought but she doesnt want to admit it proud embarrassed like me he smiled perhaps he would have to go and get a ladder rescue her the idea amused him did you know the canal goes right under this house she said he shook his head no does it straight underneath she nodded right below i looked it up on the map isnt that amazing maybe theres a secret passage we could build one tunnel her voice sounded scratchy he wanted to laugh at her but didnt she was getting annoyed embarrassed at being stuck out of the window making conversation while she secretly strained trying to heave the trapping window back up you having problems up there he said trying to keep a straight face what she said then no no of course not she cleared her throat so what have you been doing with yourself nothing much he grinned just looking forward to seeing you she made a funny face gave a snorting sort of laugh he continued ive done some more drawings of you oh yes theyre still not good enough though im going to tear them up really youre difficult to draw he looked up and down the street will you pose for me properly some time you mean improperly she said he laughed better still but id settle for you sitting still for a while maybe one day well all right yes definitely i promise ill hold you to it do so are you going to come down he said she really was stuck she turned her head round he saw her shoulders tense and her back arch again she muttered something which sounded like a curse she turned to him again nodded yes yes just a second he grinned as she pushed up on the window sill her head down hair hanging blackly he could just see her face as he walked over to the pavement beneath she grunted the window squeaked he looked up into her triumphant face she smiled broadly and then pushed herself back waving once saying ah thats better see you in a second they walked to the lock at camden she didnt feel like walking very far they spent most of the afternoon in a poster shop looking then in a cafe she wouldnt walk back they got the tube from camden town to the angel in the train in the tunnel he asked her things hed often wanted to ask but never dared there was a sort of noisy anonymity about the rattling carriage which made him feel safe he asked her about stock had she come to london for him she said nothing for a long time then shook her head she had come to escape to get away the city was big enough to hide in to become lost in and anyway she knew a few people here slater was one stock was here too but she had no illusions never had had any illusions about the permanency of their relationship she was here she said to be herself to find her way again stock was something she still needed even yet something to hold on to a devil she knew immovable in the change and flux of her life she knew they werent suited to each other really she didnt love him but she couldnt give him up just yet besides he wasnt the sort it was easy to give up she stopped talking then as though she thought she had already said more than she should have she looked at graham after a moment put her hand to his cheek said im sorry graham youre good for me i love talking to you that means a lot you dont know how much he put his hand on hers held it she gave a brave little smile im glad im good for you he said keeping his voice down there were people nearby but i dont want to be just like a brother to you her expression froze at that and his heart seemed to sink into his guts as he realised hed almost said the wrong thing but she smiled again and said id understand if you didnt want to see me any more and looked down away from him at her feet she took her hand away he hesitated at first then put his hand on her shoulder thats not what i meant he said i love seeing you id miss you terribly if well if you went away he paused bit his lip lightly for a second but i dont know what youre doing i dont know what your plans are if youre going to stay here or go or what i just feel uncertain join the club she said she looked at him touched his hand where it rested on her shoulder i think ill stay im applying for the rcm i had a place there if id wanted it three four years ago but i didnt go now i might get a place there this time if theyll have me he bit his lip what to do admit his ignorance and ask what rcm stood for or just nod make appreciative noises what exactly will you do there he said she shrugged looked at her long fingers flexed them piano i think i can still play im not getting the practice i should though ive got this electronic one of veronicas well one of her exboyfriends and its action is all right but it isnt the same she shrugged still inspecting her fingers well see he breathed again relieved royal college of music that must be it of course slater had mentioned about her being good on the piano you should have a shot on one of the pianos in a pub sometime he said she smiled well anyway she said taking a deep breath he felt her slim shoulder move under the thick fabric of the tartan shirt as much as i know anything at the moment thats what i think ill be doing staying here probably for the next few years i think ive still to get myself sorted out but im glad youre here you help me think she looked into his eyes as if searching for something in them her white face made the dark heavybrowed eyes look lost and empty and after a while he could not look into them anymore and had to smile and look away then from nowhere a kind of despair seemed to settle on him and he felt lonely and used and cheated and for a moment wanted to be far away from this slim blackhaired woman with her tense white face and her slender fingers the moment passed and he tried to imagine what she was going through how it felt to her the train shuddered and braked slowing graham had a sudden strange image of the train in its tunnel suddenly bursting through clay and bricks into the canal tunnel under saras flat taking some ancient subterranean wrongturning and missing the station entirely smashing into the darkness and water of the old canal under the hill he tried to imagine drawing such a scene but couldnt he shook his head forgetting the idea and looking at sara again as the train stopped in the station she sat forward in her seat smiling wryly all my life people have liked me too quickly graham and for all the wrong reasons maybe youll change your mind when you know me better the doors opened she stood and as he got to his feet as they went out on to the platform he grinned confidently and shook his head no way he said and now in june how much better did he know her a little better he had seen her in a few more moods some higher some lower her attraction had only grown he found himself trying to smell her hair when they sat together in pubs he gazed out of the corner of his eye at her breasts under whatever jumper or tshirt she was wearing wanting to touch them hold them but it never seemed right she would kiss him for not very long at the end of each meeting and he could hold her feel his arms around her narrow back his body briefly against hers but he could feel her tense if his hands went lower than the small of her back and when he tried to kiss her more deeply or hold her tighter she would break away shaking her head he had almost given up testing the limits but now what it sounded as though stock was no more as though at last she was free strong enough to do without him to get rid of his influence and accept graham as more of and more than a friend dont get your hopes up not too much he told himself it might not be all you hope for he stood at the side of pentonville road by a telephone junctionbox with posters advertising woza albert on it and he told himself not to expect everything hopes and dreams had a way of evaporating but he could remember the sound of her voice on the phone that morning when hed called her up from the school too well why dont you come in this time she said ill get us a salad together or something actually come into the flat he laughed you mean come oop and ow you zay zee you zome time he said in a good mood making a silly french voice which he started to regret almost as soon as hed spoken her voice over the phone was cool well why not graham his throat went dry after that he didnt recall what else hed said mrs short social insecurity hed just remembered he owed mrs short a months rent in a couple of days he had plenty of money now but what if they took a long time to give him this social security would he even get enough grout stood outside mrs shorts house in packington street islington he didnt know whether to go in or not now maybe he should go to the pub first it was always easier to face mrs short with a drink in him he decided not to be so stupid he wouldnt really owe the rent until the end of the month and it was only the twentyeighth anyway it being his birthday he deserved favours he let himself in it was dark in the narrow hall of mrs shorts house the small curved window over the front door was brown with grime the walls were covered with dark brown wallpaper and mrs shorts supply of fortywatt lightbulbs appeared to have dried up once again after the bright street grout was almost blind he groped his way to the stairs and started up his bedsit was on the third top storey mrs short pounced on the second floor landing oh mr grout youre home early she said coming out of the television lounge hard chairs monochrome set lodgers to share licence fee and extra electricity turned off at twelve oclock mrs short wiped her hands on her duster then on her nylon dress she was a stout balding lady of about fifty her hair was so tightly tied back at the rear of her skull that grout swore the front strands over her forehead were being pulled out by the roots and that the tautened skin so produced was thus responsible for the expression of malevolent surprise she wore he had the impression that when mrs short blinked her overstretched eyelids didnt quite make it to the bottom of her eyes that was why she blinked a lot and had such red eyes you avent been fired again ave you mr grout mrs short said and burst out laughing bending at the waist and cracking her duster like a whip damn grout hadnt thought about this what was he to say he had a few precious seconds while mrs short laughed and then dried her eyes wiping her nose on the duster she sneezed suddenly more precious seconds he stood there the seconds ticked away ah no he said well it was succinct not all that convincing perhaps he knew that but unequivocal he pressed his lips tight together well then mr grout what brings you back so early mrs short smiled the subtle variations in the colour of the enamel on her false teeth replaced one by one over the years as the originals gave up the unequal struggle against the mint humbugs mrs short favoured drew stevens eyes and he said quickly dentist brilliant he thought oh you been or you going she poked her head forward staring into his mouth he closed it quickly going soon he mumbled whats he going to do then take any out fill them my niece pam she got hers drilled by her dentist the other day hit a nerve she bit him didnt mean to but she closed her mouth didnt she end of the drill snapped off in her mouth right in the tooth mrs short doubled up laughing at this steven watched anxiously to see whether a way round her and up the stairs would present itself but without reward mrs short came upright again searched for a hanky in her dress pocket failed to find one and so used her duster again blowing into it inspecting the nasal hollow indented in it briefly then looking back at grout poor cow off work for a week she was had to eat through a straw she mistook stevens immobile expression for fear and said leaning forward to flick his chest with her duster oh there i go im making you all frightened now arent i oh mr grout you men are all the same least little bit of pain and youre off you should have a kid sometime ha she laughed tears coming to her eyes at the memory gawd mr grout i thought i was bein torn in two scream i thought i was goin to die mrs short gave a long insucking laugh and had to hold on to the banister rail to prevent her mirth from toppling her to the ground she flapped her duster weakly then dried her eyes with it grout tried to estimate the distance between his landlady and the wall opposite the banisters to see if by grasping the latter she had left sufficient room for him to escape upstairs to his room not quite yes well he said edging forward to show that he wanted to go upstairs better get ready for the dentist he shuffled forward turning to one side so that he could squeeze between mrs short and the wall oh you got to go now then have you mrs short said turning to look at him but not actually moving out of his way well i shall get on with my dusting then i shall you quite sure that i cant dust your room for you mr grout it wouldnt be any bother you know ah no no thank you steven said trying to press himself back into the wall to get around mrs shorts bulging hip his back scraped against the peeling varnish of old wooden boards well i should think youd find it was much cleaner and less dusty in your room if i did your dusting for you mr grout really i do why dont we give it a sort of trial period mrs short nudged him in the ribs no honestly no steven said rubbing the place where mrs short had nudged him what did it feel like when your spleen ruptured mrs short still wasnt moving to let him past she frowned at his shoulder and used her duster to flick something off it no i really steven said and then sneezed you wouldnt have that hay fever half as bad if you let me dust your room mr grout she snapped her duster again more of the shining motes which had made steven sneeze the first time floated in the air around his face really must get to my he began but mrs short said no you wouldnt mr grout room grout gasped he pointed up the stairs and with one mighty effort succeeded in squeezing through the tight space between mrs short and the wall almost falling out on the far side mrs short swivelled like a tanks gun turret and looked at him the room mr grout you want me to do it then no steven said backing off towards the next flight of stairs but still facing mrs short and trying to smile without showing his teeth no honestly he said really ill dust my own room really thank you but no really mrs short was still shaking her head and shaking her limp duster when he finally got round the sheltering twist in the stairs steven wiped his damp forehead turned and ran quickly up the rest of the steps shivering and grimacing as he thought about mrs short in his room he could relax he sat by the window after hed washed his face and upper body at the small handbasin in one corner of his room from the basin he had to negotiate four straights and three rightangled corners through his maze of books on the floor to get to the window where he had a small chair and could look out into packington street he liked looking out the window today he had it open it was a nice day and sometimes would spend entire saturday or sunday afternoons just sitting there watching the traffic and the people in the street and a curious sort of peace would slowly take him over like something hypnotic like a trance he would just sit there not thinking or worrying or seething about anything just sitting watching mind blank and free of cares and the cars would move and the people pass and talk and for a little while through that lack of thought that temporary surrender of his own personality he could start to feel part of this place this city and people and species and society feel like he imagined all the other ordinary people the people who were not him and were not there specifically to torment him must feel all the time he dried himself with his small towel it smelled a bit but not offensively comforting like his bed he looked over the mazewalls of books covering the floor of his room the bookwalls which he tried to keep at roughly the same level were up to midthigh level now and he was worried that soon they would start to become unstable of course if he wasnt going to be getting any money he wouldnt be able to buy any more paperbacks for a while maybe not until he found another new job but even so it was depressing to think of the chaos which would result from the books becoming unstable through sheer height and while there was one way round the problem he was proud to have worked this out by putting the books together like bricks in a wall instead of simply stacking them one on top of another this would make it even more difficult to get at a book if he wanted to read it again he started to panic at the thought and wound his way through the books to the door of the room he locked it and took his sundaybest safety helmet down from the overloaded peg behind the door he put the hat on and felt better he took a different route back to the chair by the window and sat down again what would he do now go for a drink that was what you did when you left work or when you had lots of money he took the money out it was mostly in ten pound notes there were lots he looked at the big brown rectangles of paper the queen looked nice the way he liked to think his mother must have looked florence nightingale on the back on the other hand reminded him of some of the nurses at the home hed gone to he put the money away stuffing it into his back pocket he looked round his room over the walls of books the pile of clothes by the side of his bed the hunchback of jackets and shirts and coat and ties on the back of the door the large wardrobe where hed kept all his books originally and still had lots of them stored in shoeboxes the small bedside cabinet with a plastic glass of water and his latest book lying on it the room had an old blockedoff fireplace where his twobar electric fire sat on the mantelpiece was his collection of car mascots there were five jaguars eight rollsroyce silver ladies two old austin signs and a varied collection of leaping salmon racing horses pedigree dogs and one cricketer wielding a bat he still to his disappointment had no bentley mascots he kept the mercedes signs in a big jar at one end of the mantelpiece he wasnt really bothered about mercedes signs but somehow his original reason for hacksawing the mascots off cars his own safety had been complicated by the collectors urge to add depth and breadth to the collection originally he had taken offence at jaguar mascots the leaping cat no longer on every car but still in actual solid form on quite enough seemed designed to disembowel him the silver lady was little better and some of the custommade special mascots were even worse he thought they were illegal but when he went to the police station in upper street to complain that people were riding around in these lethally armed cars the boredlooking sergeant had just looked at him and eventually said well there wasnt a lot he could do about it and sir would just have to look both ways before crossing the street steven had been disappointed about that but on the other hand he was most impressed that a policeman had called him sir they werent usually helpful and of course it was obvious that at least some of them must be in on the whole secret of grouts torment but even so you couldnt help but admire them and look up to them and to have one call him sir was rather good he went back a few weeks later to report the theft of a bicycle he didnt even own just so that he could be called sir again taking the car mascots was often dangerous several times he had almost been caught by enraged owners when they heard some noises in the street outside in the darkness or heard feet crunch in a twilit driveway steven had stuck to the immediate area at first islington especially canonbury and the quiet streets around highbury fields then the pickings became leaner as people were careful not to leave their cars in shady spots and parked them only under lampposts or were more conscientious about putting their cars in their drives or garages and locking the gates steven hacksaw in pocket had accordingly widened his area of operations and now was liable to strike anywhere from the city to highgate capturing jaguars kidnapping silver ladies and pocketing stars he certainly felt a lot safer walking about the streets holding his breath between the parked cars and trucks keeping an eye out for low walls and raised doorsteps he could also use to escape from the lasers in the passing vehicles knowing that a good few of those growling deathtraps had been made that little bit safer thanks to him then he had started to think about bikes motorbikes could be pretty deadly too they were usually driven by suicidal exhibitionists and just the sound of them had given steven some terrible frights in the past and made him hate the people who rode them so hed started putting sugar in their fuel tanks that was what hed been doing the previous evening down in clerkenwell hed been out until two in the morning and had been chased by a security guard whod seen him fiddling with a bikes fuel tank in a car park steven had been very nervous and excited when he got back and even though he felt very tired he had taken a long time to get to sleep maybe that was why hed been on a short fuse this morning well he didnt care that was their problem back at the depot theyd see when those holes in upper street which he had repaired were still intact after all theirs had opened up again let them worry about all that he didnt regret sugaring bikes tanks and scalping car mascots in the least he wasnt even just doing it for himself after all although of course he was the most important person he was doing everybody else all these people walking in packington street for example a favour as well steven hung the small towel on the back of the chair by the window he looked through the pile of clothes hung on the back of his door until he found a cleanish shirt and put it on there was a can of right guard under his bed which he used to spray under his arms when he remembered but it had run out last week and he kept forgetting to get a new one he tucked his shirt into his trousers he took his evidence box out from the bedside cabinet and went to sit with it by the window the evidence box was an old cardboard black and white whisky case steven had picked up somewhere in it he kept a small radiocassette recorder a piece of estate agents literature and a school atlas along with dozens of fading yellow newspaper cuttings the cuttings were of the strange but true type fillers and funnies supposedly true stories which steven could tell were complete nonsense madeup rubbish they taunted him with trying to get him to stand up and challenge them call their bluff but he wasnt going to be so predictable or stupid he would keep quiet and he would collect the evidence one day he might have a real use for it but in the meantime it was reassuring he took out the cassette recorder switched the tape on he had recorded the noise of the socalled static from the short wave band but he knew what it really was he listened to the grinding deep continuous roaring noise and he recognised the sound of the wars eternal heavy bombers of the air he was amazed that nobody else had noticed it those were engines that wasnt static he knew this was a leak a tiny slip they had made which let part of reality slip through into this false prison of life he breathed deeply looking out down packington street trying to remember or imagine what those droning immensesounding noises represented through what limitless airs and atmospheres did those huge craft power what was their seemingly endless mission what was the appalling cargo they carried what dreadful enemy would suffer beneath them when they arrived over their target he switched the tape off rewound it the next piece of evidence was trickier it was a sheet of paper with housebuying details on it the evidence of the leak came from the name of the firm hotblack desiato was the name of the estate agents and grout knew that was a leak he was sure he could recall something about that name which related back to his previous life his real life in the war what that name actually meant whether it was a name at all and if so that of a friend or enemy or place or thing or whether it was a phrase order instruction or what he could not remember no matter how hard he thought about it or how hard he didnt think about it and just waited for his subconscious to come up with the right answer but it meant something he was sure something had happened to him sometime which related to that name oh and as usual they were very clever very subtle if the name was not a leak then it was a deliberate ploy by the tormentors to taunt him tease him they had put that firm of estate agents in the area he lived in just so that he could keep seeing their signs and so be constantly distressed and frustrated by his inability to remember exactly when and where hed heard the name before anyway it was more evidence even if it turned out just to be a leak and they hadnt meant it he folded the paper up again and put it back in the box he took out the atlas opened it at a map of the world he had drawn redink circles round places like suez and panama gibraltar and the dardanelles he snorted with contempt at their ridiculous attempt to design a reasonablelooking planet who did they think they were kidding hoho so the continents just happen to link on to each other do they very handy any idiot could see it was all too carefully arranged to be natural it had been designed whether he really was on a planet with those shapes on it he didnt know he suspected not but it didnt matter even if as he rather suspected the world actually came to an end just outside greater london that wasnt the point the point was that they were trying to get people him to believe this travesty of a map the contempt they must feel for him expecting him to accept this it made him boil just to think of it but they had made a serious mistake they had underestimated him and they would not break him certainly not while he had evidence like this to back him up he turned the atlas to the pages on south east asia yes the island of celebes still looked like a letter from some alien alphabet and the more he thought about it the more familiar it looked too so that sometimes he almost thought he knew what it represented or the sound it made if his human throat or brain was capable of forming such a foreign sound he closed the atlas smiling to himself and feeling better justified and reassured he put everything back in the evidence box and put it back in his bedside cabinet where it fitted in neatly then he made his way carefully back to the window dosed it and threaded his way back through the walls of books to the door making sure that he had his door keys and his money in his pockets he stopped at the door faced with the choice of keeping his good hat on or putting on his usual safety helmet he decided to keep the good one on it was a lovely deepblue colour with almost no scratches or abrasions on it at all and a nice real leather sweatband bit inside the front part of the inner webbing why not keep it on celebrate today it was his birthday after all he wondered if it was worthwhile telling mrs short it was his birthday it didnt seem right that nobody else knew at least if he told mrs short there would be somebody to wish him happy birthday or many happy returns that would be nice still undecided he left the room after first checking that he hadnt left the fire on or left a plug in a socket or left the light on he didnt encounter mrs short on the way down the stairs and found this something of a relief he was walking quietly through the gloom of the front hall towards the door to the street when mrs shorts door opened suddenly and she was there in front of him in the hallway huge arms folded the light reflected on her tautskinned forehead aow there you are mr grout off to the dentist then what steven said foolishly then remembered oh yes yes thats right umm he closed his mouth so that mrs short couldnt see into it not that he expected her to be able to see anything in the darkness but one never knew mrs short said dont suppose youd like to give me my rent money now would you mr grout in case i dont see you for a few days steven thought about this not seeing mrs short for a few days what a pleasant thought but unlikely he shook his head and said no not just now mrs short i havent got enough money just at the moment ill have it on friday he lied starting to feel hot again they were using the microwaves on him even now even here he had one of his hands behind his back the fingers crossed because he was telling lies well if youre sure mr grout mrs short said then looked down at his trousers only i thought i saw this bulge in your rear pocket didnt i an me bein me i just naturally assumed that it was pay steven felt his eyes widen he didnt know what to say mrs short had guessed she must know in fact of course theyd told her she had probably been informed by the depot immediately after hed left that was probably one of the first things that mr smiths secretary had done idiot why hadnt he guessed this well he would just have to brazen it out he decided there was no point in trying to come to some sort of compromise now it was all or nothing mrs short might know but it seemed that it was not in the rules that she was allowed to tell him she knew and she could only imply it friday steven said nodding briskly money on friday definitely he edged towards the welcoming opening of the door shaking his head as he passed her she blinked rapidly at him he had often wondered if this was some sort of code he cleared his throat said thats all right thank you he patted his back pocket dental card he explained mrs short nodded sympathetically he was out he stood on the doorstep almost in the street and hed escaped you mind how you go now mr grout wont you oh yes he said and turned took a deep breath and set off down the street sure i cant dust your room while youre out mr grout mrs short shouted from the stillopen doorway when steven was about ten yards away he felt himself seize up his legs stopped his shoulders came up as though to tense for a falling blow he turned round in the street looked back at the stoutly smiling face of mrs short and shook his head violently there were no parked cars for about thirty metres traffic was grumbling down the street in a ragged stream he shook his head again whats that mr grout mrs short shouted and put one chubby hand cupped to her ear he stared at her widening his eyes shook his head as violently as he dared cant hear you mr g mrs short called to him he was starting to run out of oxygen he put his head down and walked back to the doorway stood up out of the level of the laseraxles and said straight into mrs shorts face no thank you mrs short please dont dust my room i prefer to do it myself well if youre sure mrs short smiled oh completely grout assured her he waited there to see if she would close the door but she didnt he took a deep breath said goodbye and turned away he walked quickly towards upper street and had done perhaps fifty metres before he heard mrs short far in the distance shout at him he didnt turn round but heard her distant scream of byeee with a sort of nauseous relief spotless dominoes they sat on the balcony outside the games room of the castle doors inside was a blaze of light the snow on the balcony had all melted and a warm moist salty breeze blew around them constantly from the room over the balcony and out into the open air quiss and ajayi sat with light tunics on over the small woodfiligree table shuffling plain white sticks of ivory over the cut surface it was now too hot in the games room the boilers of the castle of bequest had been repaired only about thirty of their days ago and according to the seneschal there was still a bit of fine tuning to be done from where she sat ajayi could see the quarries small black figures moved up the snowcovered paths and roads to the mines and quarries and carts trundled to and fro the ponderous laden ones disappearing from her view behind an outcrop of she peered narrowing her eyes to try and see better well either rock or the castle she couldnt tell the rest of the landscape was as nearflat and uniform as ever a gust of warm air from the baking heat of the games room swirled round her then unwound itself again she shivered briefly no doubt all this heat and the salt was playing even greater havoc with the castles plumbing than usual and before too long once they did get things back to normal and an acceptable level of light and heat the whole system would break down again probably for even longer in the meantime they were playing a game called spotless dominoes in which plain pieces of ivory had to be arranged in certain linear patterns neither she nor quiss had any idea when they were going to finish the game or even how well they were doing at any stage because although they knew that in the original version of the game there were spots on the ivory pieces their pieces were blank they had to lay them out in lines each time they played hoping that the small table with the red glowing jewel at its centre on which they played would recognise that the spotvalues it had randomly of course assigned to the pieces before each game were such that the pattern quiss and ajayi produced was a logical one one in which if all the spots suddenly appeared on the surfaces of the dominoes the pattern would make sense a one would be matched with a one or a double one a two with a two or a double two and so on it was the most frustrating game they had played yet and they had been playing it for one hundred and ten days she deliberately did not think about how long they had been in the castle it didnt matter it was one instant of exile that was all she had no idea how much of it she would remember if when she returned to her post in the therapeutic wars it was a rare punishment and not one that people who had had to experience it were likely to talk very much about even if one did bump into them so although she like quiss had always known of the existence of the castle what happened to those who successfully passed through it was not recorded no it did not matter how long they were here as long as they did not despair or go mad they just had to keep playing the games and trying the many different answers and eventually they would get out ajayi looked over at her companion without him seeing quiss was busy mixing the dominoes up frowning deeply at them as though he could somehow bully the pieces of dead animal into forming a correct pattern quiss ajayi thought seemed to be surviving all right she still worried about him though because his urgent intimidatory style was not guaranteed to last for ever against the castles so often impenetrably purposelessseeming regime she was afraid that what he had constructed for himself was something too much like armour too much like what the castle itself represented that armour might have to give in eventually just as no fortress ever built could withstand any siege they had discussed this ultimate vulnerability of the static the hardened before they gave their first answer to the riddle whereas she had tried not to armour herself she had tried to go with the castles strange mood adapt to it accept it oh get on with it you two the red crow said from its perch on the stump of a flagpole about three metres above their heads ive had more fun watching snails fuck why dont you go and do just that quiss growled at it without looking as he took seven of the facedown dominoes from the shuffled logjam of them in the centre of the small table he held all seven of his pieces easily in one huge hand the little bonechips lost in the hard fleshs folds and creases listen greybeard the red crow said its my appointed duty to stay here and annoy you bastards and thats just what im going to do until you have the sense not to mention the common decency considering youve grievously overstayed your welcome to do away with yourselves the red crows voice twisted into an impersonation of ajayis least favourite teacher from her schooldays ajayi you old bag pick up your pieces and play we havent got all day you know the red crow chuckled after this last sentence ajayi said nothing she selected seven of the dominoes biting her lower lip as she did so the birds voice really did grate it war ludicrous really but the damn thing was an uncomfortably accurate mimic and commanded a repertoire of hateful voices from the past it was ajayis turn to start she took one of the blank tiles and set it down in the middle of the table she knew that there was something about the way she inspected her dominoes before placing them down which infuriated quiss who just picked out the first one that came to hand somehow though ajayi needed this pretence it was one of those little things which kept her going she couldnt just pick up the dominoes whack them down one after another mix them up and do the whole thing again even if that was the fastest way of getting through the games that was too mechanical too uncaring it was important to her always to believe that this next game would be the right one the one where everything fitted and all the junctions of all the pieces made sense so giving them another chance to escape from here so she placed her piece down carefully thoughtfully quiss slapped one of his down immediately after her ajayi paused for thought quiss tutted impatiently and tapped one foot the red crow coughed from the stump overhead bugger me here we go again i hope you two get fed up soon and kill yourselves so we can at least get some people in here wholl be fun youre not the most gracious of hosts crow ajayi said putting a domino down im not your host idiot the red crow sneered even you should be able to work that out i know youve no balls but i thought you had the basic minimum of brains quiss snapped another of the white tiles down on the table and ajayi looked suspiciously at him not sure if she could hear him suppressing a laugh or not he cleared his throat ajayi looked up at the red crow oh she said i think you are in a way whether you like it or not in some ways you are a very fitting host because you help to epitomise what this place is about so she looked away from it and studied the pieces of ivory in her hand when she heard the taptap of quisss foot on the balcony floor while you might not like it you do play the part well the red crow was looking out over the snowy landscape and quietly shaking its head not pleasantly ajayi concluded but thoroughly what a load of bullshit the red crow said looking down at her still shaking its head bullshit from an old cow it looked away from her out over the white plain again you think youre being punished ive got to stick around and listen to all this rubbish i wonder why i bother sometimes i really do must be easier ways of making a living ajayi was looking up at it thoughtfully she was wondering if there was some way of making a weapon with which they could shoot the red crow if they did what else would be added to their sentence and would it be worth it she could hear quisss boot going taptap again but ignored it as she looked at the red crow she had been aware of quiss sniggering when the red crow was insulting her and didnt see why she should hurry with her next domino just to please him the red crow stared back at ajayi then after a few seconds shook itself furiously spreading its wings briefly and stretching one leg out as though stiff come on will you it shouted at her good god woman what got you in here prevarication or just plain stupidity or both get on with it ajayi looked away from the bird selecting one of her dominoes and placing it slowly carefully on the surface of the table she felt her face flushing slightly dont tell me quiss said leaning close over the table to talk in a low voice as he put down his next piece that our little feathered friend has hurt you he glanced into the old womans eyes as he leant back again ajayi looked away from quisss eyes then shook her head slowly as she chose between the remaining dominoes in her hand no she said taking one of the ivory pieces from her palm leaning forward to place it on the table then changing her mind putting it back and reconsidering rubbing her chin with one hand an exasperated choking noise came from above their heads this is ridiculous the red crow said i think ill go and watch some icicles form it cant be any more boring than this with that it opened its wings and flew off muttering ajayi watched it go some other rooks and crows from higher battlements flew down and joined it as it flew off in the direction of the slate mines pest quiss said after it he drummed one set of stubby fingers on the table top and looked back at ajayi who nodded and put another domino down no quiss said putting another piece down its just that i wondered if it had struck a bit close to the bone with that remark about how you ended up here quiss darted a look at his companion who watched him look away again and smiled to herself well she said considering the choices in her hand perhaps its time we told each other why were both here what we did to be sent here hmm quiss said apparently not all that interested yes i suppose we might as well perhaps theres even some sort of clue to the right answer we should give you know something common to both our reasons for being here which might help us out he raised his eyebrows at her a whatdoyouthinkofthat expression ajayi thought it politic not to remind quiss that she had come out with exactly that argument for them trading stories not long after she had arrived in the castle quiss had been totally opposed to talking about their separate misfortunes at that point she had decided all she could do all she had better get used to doing was be patient well that might be a good idea quiss if youre quite sure you dont mind telling me no not at all not at all quiss said quickly he paused ah you first ajayi smiled well she said taking a deep breath what happened was i was aidedecamp to our philosophy officer who in our squadron was of marshal rank philosophy officer quiss said nodding knowingly yes ajayi said he was a terribly keen hunter and rather unfashionably enjoyed getting back to the great outdoors and the good oldfashioned ways of doing things whenever he had the opportunity i could appreciate the concept of getting back to ones roots and reaffirming ones integral relationship with nature even if it was alien nature all right but i let him know i thought he took it too far i mean he would never take anything like communication gear or transport along or even modern weapons all we had were a couple of archaic rifles and our own legs you went along with him quiss said had to ajayi shrugged he said he took me along because he liked arguing with me so i used to go on these expeditions with him and i became quite proficient at the art of rhetoric and passably handy with the ancient primitive weapons it amused him to hunt with also quite skilled at rejecting his rarely more than halfhearted advances one day towards dusk on this place we were trudging through a swamp trailing some immense wounded beast hed just shot beset by insects tired out of contact with the fleet until a fast picket rendezvoused with us at midnight wet fed up well i was anyway he was having a great time when suddenly he tripped on a submerged tree trunk or something and as he fell his hand must have closed on the trigger his gun was so old it didnt even have a safety catch and he shot himself in the chest he was in a bad way still conscious but in a lot of pain he didnt believe in taking modern medicines on these trips either i thought id better move him out of the marsh and over to some rocks i could just about make out through the mists but when i tried to move him he started screaming a lot then i remembered reading some historical story about people being shot with these ancient projectile weapons and having bullets dug out of them without any anaesthetic and what they used to do then and i thought that what they did seemed oddly appropriate in the circumstances even if it probably didnt do any real good so i took a bullet out of my own gun and gave it to him to bite on while i dragged him over to the rocks and quiss said once ajayi had stopped she sighed it was an explosive bullet blew his head off soon as he bit it quiss slapped his knee with his free hand and rocked with laughter really explosive ha ha ha he went on slapping his knee and swaying in his seat howling with laughter tears came to his eyes and he had to put his three remaining dominoes face down on the table and hold his belly with both hands i knew i could count on your sympathy ajayi said dryly putting down another ivory tile thats beautiful quiss said voice weakened with laughter he wiped the tears from his old cheeks took up his dominoes again i take it he was dead he played one of the pieces of course he was dead ajayi snapped it was the first time she had ever spoken loudly or harshly to quiss and he sat back looking surprised she tried not to scowl as much as she felt like doing but went on his brains were spread over half the swamp and me ho ho ho quiss said sympathetically ha ha ha he shook his head grinning widely and sniffed what about you what did you do ajayi asked quiss was quiet all of a sudden he frowned at the two remaining dominoes in his hand hmm he said ive told you mine ajayi said now you tell me yours i dont know that youd really be interested quiss said not looking at her he shook his head still looking at his hand its a bit of an anticlimax after yours he looked up a look of pained apology on his face to see that ajayi was glaring at him not only more furiously than he had ever seen her looking before but also rather more furiously than he would have thought her capable of looking he cleared his throat hmm well on the other hand he said i suppose it is only fair he put down his dominoes on the table put his hands on his knees and stared over the top of ajayis head strangely similar to yours in a way might be a common link there was this gun involved anyway he cleared his throat again putting his fist to his mouth and coughing he was still staring over his companions head as though the red crow was still on the broken flagpole above them and he was addressing it not the woman well anyway suffice to say that after a long ahm and strenuous campaign and not one we had expected to survive really i might add i was with others of our guard corps on the roof of this big palace in this city there were celebrations the ahm this dignitary well a prince actually this was one of those backward places as well and we were limited by the rules to fairly crude weapons and equipment and stuff well this prince was due to appear on quiss looked briefly at ajayi then around at the balcony they sat on on a sort of balcony thing like this he said lamely he cleared his throat again well there was this huge crowd waiting to greet the prince maybe a million locals all armed to the mandibles with pitchforks and muskets and things but all more or less on our side and anyway glad the fighting was over and we were guarding the palace roof with a few unobtrusive missiles just in case there was some desperate lastditch aircraft attack not that that was very likely we thought we were all a bit umm happy i suppose and we were celebrating too and in high spirits anyway glad to be alive and we had some drink and two of us this other captain and me were having a lark daring each other to walk along this sort of balustrade thing on the roof looking over the crowd above the balcony where this prince and his cronies were going to appear and we were closing our eyes and walking along and standing on one leg and drinking and using these big machineguns to balance ourselves sounds a bit undisciplined i know but like i say quiss coughed this other captain and myself we collided while we were walking along the parapet walked right into each other while our eyes were closed of course our comrades thought it was a great laugh but while the other fellow was falling towards the roof and into the arms of these other drunken types i was falling the other way over the edge of the roof all there was down that way was the balcony about ten metres down and then the ground about twenty metres beneath that i was offbalance going over my comrades were out of reach i mean that was it i was going to plummet right down to my death i was a goner quiss looked briefly at ajayi his expression one of pained sincerity then he looked away again and continued but well like i said i was holding this big machine gun and just sort of without thinking about it pure instinct i suppose i i brought this big machinegun round and pointed it down the way and fired it off quiss cleared his throat loudly shaking his head and narrowing his eyes thing was set on antiaircraft rate just about leapt out of my hands could barely control it but the recoil was enough to bring me upright again let me get my balance on the parapet before the magazine ran out of bullets so i was saved only trouble was the prince and his retinue had just come out on to the balcony beneath me as this was happening and got caught in this hail of fragging aa shells that bugger of a gun had sprayed all over the place killed the prince and quite a few of his pals not to mention several dozen in the crowd underneath crowd got very annoyed pandemonium riot and mayhem palace was sacked cost us forty days and half a brigade to calm the upset thats it quiss shrugged looked down at the table yours sounds more dramatic ajayi said trying not to sound amused back from the brink of death she played a domino oh yes quiss said and his eyes took on a misty distant expression as he looked up i felt really great for about half a second ajayi smiled so it would appear we share an element of slightly thoughtless irresponsibility and projectile weapons she looked up at the ramshackle heights of the castle above them the links dont seem all that close but there you are here we are does any of this actually help us no quiss said shaking his great grey head sadly i dont think so still ajayi said im glad we both know now yes quiss said placing his second last piece he coughed sorry i ah laughed shouldnt have bad form apologies his head was down so he did not see ajayi smile at him a look of real affection on her old lined face as you say quiss she said smiling quietly her stomach rumbled it must be nearly mealtime a waiter would probably appear soon sometimes the waiters took their orders and brought what was ordered sometimes they brought something quite different sometimes they didnt take their orders but arrived with what they probably would have ordered anyway often they brought far too much food and stood around looking confused as though looking for other people to serve at least the times of the meals were relatively predictable and the food satisfying usually she wanted a break from the games anyway she could take only so much of this purposeless placing of ivory pieces after a while she got bored and restless and wanted to do something else for a while when her stiff back and sore leg permitted she had explored the castle going off for long walks at first always with quiss who knew the rough layout of the place better then later mostly by herself her bones and joints still complained about climbing stairs but she ignored the pain as best she could and anyway took frequent rests and trudged through vast areas of the castle exploring its turrets and rooms and battlements shafts and halls she preferred to keep to the upper levels where there were less people around and the feeling of the castle was more sane she supposed lower down quiss had told her things got more chaotic the kitchens were the worst in some ways but there were even stranger places places quiss didnt like talking about she suspected this was just him enjoying the feeling of power which exclusive knowledge gives to people but perhaps in some clumsy way he thought he was protecting her from something he meant well she would allow him this eventually though the attraction of the castles tortuous internal geography palled on her and now she restricted herself to only very occasional sallies mostly conducted as near as possible on the same level just to stretch her legs the very inexhaustibility of the castles everchanging topography depressed her after a while whereas at first it had seemed encouraging that one could never know the place perfectly that it would never be boring that it was always constantly changing falling down being rebuilt altered and redesigned stuck all the time in a human frame which would not change imprisoned in this one age this cage of cells the analogue of organic change and growth and decay which the castle exhibited seemed somehow unfair an unpleasant reminder of something she might never have again now she filled up her spare time with reading she took books from the interior walls of the castle and read them they were in many different languages most of them tongues from the nameless planet which was the castles subject and from where all the books seemed to originate these languages she could not understand some of the books however appeared to have been produced on this single globe as translations into other alien languages some of which ajayi could to varying degrees understand she often wondered as she read if perhaps the name of the subject world was some sort of clue it had been carefully removed from any and every book in the castle which mentioned it the word cut out from each page it had been written on ajayi read the books she could she took them from the littered floor of the games room or from deteriorating walls and columns only glancing at most of them dropping or replacing those whose languages she couldnt understand scanning the remainder and keeping to read later those which sounded interesting only about one in twenty or thirty was both comprehensible and intriguing quiss wasnt happy with her new pastime and accused her of wasting not only her own time but his as well ajayi had told him she needed something to keep her sane quiss still grumbled but he was hardly blameless himself he still went for his long walks through the castle and sometimes didnt come back for several days she had tried asking him what he did but the reaction was always either blank or hostile so she was reading and gradually with the use of some picture books she had discovered in one nottoodistant gallery she was trying to teach herself one of the languages she kept encountering in the books which appeared to be written in one of the subject worlds own tongues it was difficult almost as though by design but she was persevering and after all she had plenty of time the cat sat on the mat well it was a start ajayi put her last domino down quiss hesitated before completing the pattern suddenly unsure which end of the line of tiles to put his last one on the woman was getting restless and soon he guessed it would be time to eat and this would be another wasted stupid game like all the others no matter what way he put this piece down they should have come up with a solution by now a good pattern a logical arrangement that would satisfy whatever subtle mechanism existed within the small table but they hadnt were they doing something wrong had something escaped them in their attempt to escape they had checked and rechecked and didnt think so perhaps they were just unlucky already they had gone through three sets of the pieces three times he had become so frustrated with the whole idiotic exercise he had just thrown the dominoes away out over the balcony once while still in their ivory box once lifting the table and shaking it over the edge of the balcony ajayi had almost died of fright he remembered with a grim smile she thought he was going to throw the table away too and there was only one table no replacements if it was destroyed or badly damaged then they were not allowed to play any more games and therefore could give no more answers and once he had just cuffed the bone pieces off the table surface and sent them scattering through the potbellied slatework of the balconys balustrade however now the seneschal was saying he would have the table bolted to the floor well what did they expect he was a man of action this constipated decaying puzzlepalace wasnt his sort of place at all ajayi seemed to enjoy it at times and he would have to sit sometimes fidgeting while she expounded on some philosophical or mathematical idea she thought might get them out of their predicament he wasnt going to challenge her on what was more or less her home ground but from the little that even he knew of philosophy he thought that her smug positivism sounded too soulless and logical to be much use in the real world what the hell was the point of trying rationally to analyse what was fundamentally irrational or arational as she splitting hairs as usual would sometimes admit it was a way to arrive at personal madness and despair not some universal understanding but he wasnt going to put this to ajayi shed smile tolerantly and shoot him down in flames without a doubt know your strengths dont attack where youre weak that was his sort of philosophy military that and an acceptance that life was basically absurd unfair and ultimately pointless the woman read a lot she was going downhill even trying to understand one of the common languages she had found in the books on the games room floor and in the walls it was a bad sign quiss was sure she was starting to give in not taking the games they were playing seriously or taking them too seriously the wrong way the appearance was taking over the reality she was getting caught up in the surface of the games not their real meaning so that instead of getting the games over with as quickly as possible and so getting to their real goal another crack at the riddle she was starting to behave as though the playing the motions and apparent choices mattered he wasnt going to give up but he did need to escape this dead desperate feeling the games and the woman gave him he had escorted her round the castle for a while showing her the odd places he had discovered the one or two odd characters who existed in the place the neurotic barber was his personal favourite but gradually she had gone off more and more by herself then seemingly become bored with it or frightened somehow he wasnt sure and stopped he still visited the castles lower floors and storeys journeying down to the kitchens and even beyond so far below he guessed he was almost down to the level of the snowy plain itself deep inside the rocky crag the castle proper stood upon there were a few strange things down there and past a certain level a suspicious number of locked stout metalbanded doors he had a few attendants he had partly befriended and partly terrorised into acting as guides for him he told them he would put in a good word for them with the seneschal if they did what he wanted but that if they didnt he would have them transferred to the slate mines or the icegathering expeditions apart from these bribes and threats none of which he could deliver on as he had no influence whatsoever with the seneschal in such matters he relied entirely on personal charm the stunted minions led him to new places in and under the castle of bequest and even told him things about themselves that of course they too were exiles from the wars but from a somewhat lower scale than he and ajayi they even coyly revealed the secret of their physiology quiss listened patiently though in fact he knew all about their physical makeup having taken one of them apart not long after he first arrived in the castle trying to torture the truth out of it so he knew that these failed soldiers had no solid bodies at all he had peeled layer after layer off the one he was interrogating robe after robe after vest after vest after tunic after tunic taking off finer and finer layers of gloves and little socks and clothing taking off mask after mask only to find smaller and smaller masks inside and a sort of ubiquitous gooey stuff which permeated all the fabrics and in places acted like some silicone mixture flowing easily but cracking when hit sharply this whole weird stripping process was accompanied by the gradually diminishing screams of the wretch he had tried his experiment on the bits of it he tore off and threw to the ground moved weakly of their own accord as though trying to reassemble themselves while the bit he still held slowly getting smaller and weaker and thinner as he went on struggled hopelessly eventually he was holding nothing more than a sort of squidgy sack like a sort of sticky fabric balloon from which a clear odourless fluid wept while all the rest of the layers and pieces of clothing trembled and spasmed on the glassy floor around him their movements attracting the slowly writhing shapes of the luminescent fish in the waters below he hung the whole scrappy assemblage out to dry eventually on a makeshift washing line the wind moved the pieces so that he could not tell whether the thing was still in some dismembered way alive or not a few crows had pecked at the remains but not for long when he brought the bits back in to try and reassemble them they had started to smell so he just threw it all away he had asked the minions if they knew of anything the castle kitchens produced or any other part of the castle produced for that matter which could get a chap merry you know drunk happy smashed out of ones box did they they looked at him mystified drink fermented somethingorother brewed or distilled boiling off vapours to leave alcohol behind or even freezing water offfruit vegetables grains no any plants they knew of which when you dried the leaves the minions had never heard of such things he suggested they investigate see if they could set something up he met a few of them every now and again and was even fairly confident that he could have picked them out in a crowd of the things they werent all identical after all they had slightly different patterns of stains and scorchmarks on their little robes which helped one to identify them and of course their boots seemed to be colourcoded to their precise duty in the castles service structure the ones he had made contact with this gullible gang tried to do what he asked them they stole food from the kitchens and hid bits and pieces of kitchenware under their cloaks they tried to set up a still and a fermentation vat but it didnt work they produced a liquid at one rendezvous which made quiss throw up just from the smell and when he ordered them to take him to their equipment so that he could look it over and set it up properly they explained that they had set it up in the only place they thought was safe from the prying eyes of the seneschal their own quarters where the cramped scale of their tiny cells and corridors made it impossible for the seneschal and alas quiss to enter they refused to set it up anywhere else the seneschal would do much worse things to them than what quiss was threatening this was all strictly illegal and against the rules didnt he know quiss was depressed by this he had thought it would be possible to find some way of getting out of ones skull in this place perhaps it was thought that here in castle doors reality itself was so strange that there was no need for any substance to make it more so that was ajayis sort of thinking logical but out of touch even naive then by chance he found something which really did do just that alter reality but not in the way he had expected he had been exploring alone deep down well underneath the level of the kitchens and the great central clock mechanism the walls were of naked slate blasted and scraped out of the rock on which the castle stood light came from transparent pipes set in the ceiling but it was cold and still quite dark he came to one of the heavy metalstrapped doors he had seen time and time again on his travels in the lower levels but unlike all the rest this one was open very slightly he could see a glint of light as he passed he stopped looked around then pulled the door towards him it was a small lowceilinged room the ceiling was like that of the upper reaches of the castle made of glass with a few dim specimens of the lightfish swimming slowly to and fro the floor was rock the room had one other door on the far wall also constructed of wood and metal strapping in the centre of the room alone in the place stood a small stool above it was what looked like a hole in the glass ceiling quiss looked up and down the dark corridor there was nobody about he slipped into the room observing as he did so that the door had in fact been locked but somehow the bolt had missed the hole it ought to have slipped into he let the door swing to behind him so that it caught on the extruded bolt but was as closed and as unobstrusive from the outside as possible he explored the small room the far door was locked securely there was nothing in the place except for the small stool under the hole in the ceiling glass it looked like the stools the scullions employed to bring themselves up to the right level to attend to their duties in the kitchens the hole above the stool was dark something seemed to be shielding the inside of the hole from the glow of the lightfish a large shadowy shape filled a circle nearly a metre in diameter around the hole which was ringed with what looked like some sort of fur like a collar and which was just about big enough for a human head to go through warily quiss went up to it he stood on the stool there were two metal bands hoops of iron which extended from the lower surface of the glass ceilings iron reinforcing bands with leather pads on them the ushaped pieces of metal were on either side of the hole a little over half a metre apart and hanging about a quarter of a metre down from the ceiling looking at them more closely quiss saw they were adjustable they could be lowered or raised slightly and set further apart or closer together he didnt like the look of them he had seen pieces of torturing apparatus which looked vaguely similar he peered up into the dark hole in the glass ceiling he carefully touched the fur surround it seemed ordinary enough he took the end of his loosefitting fur sleeve and poked the pinched cuff up into the hole it came back down unscathed and he inspected it carefully he grimaced stuck a small finger into the gap nothing he put his whole hand in there was the faintest of tingling feelings like blood going back into a cold limb after a winters walk he looked at his hand it too seemed undamaged and the tingling had disappeared he put his head tentatively up towards the hole the fur tickling his greyhaired head the hole smelled of fur if anything he stuck his head up inside not the full way and only briefly he had a very vague sensation of tingling on his skin and an even more vague impression of scattered lights he put his hand in one more time felt the tickling tingling on it then checked the door again he stood on the stool and put his head fully up into the hole the tingling disappeared quickly the impression of tiny scattered lights like a rather too consistent starfield stayed and it made no difference whether his eyes were open or not he thought for a moment he could hear voices but wasnt sure the lights were unsettling he felt he could make them out individually but at the same time felt there were too many far too many to count or even for him to be able to see separately also he had the disturbing impression that he was looking at the surface of a globe all of it all of it at once in some way spread out in front of him so that no part of it hid another pan his mind swam the lights seemed to beckon him and he could feel himself starting to slide down towards them then pull back as he fought the impulse he arrived back at some still point he got down out of the hole again he rubbed his chin very odd he put his head back in temporarily ignoring the lights he snapped his fingers outside in the room he could just hear the small sound he felt for the iron loops and put his arms through them supporting himself there as one was obviously meant to he felt the pull of those lights again and let himself go towards them sliding down towards one area he found that just by thinking about them he could head for other areas it was as though he was parachuting able to steer however he wanted as he fell as he approached the area of lights he was sliding towards he got the impression of them also being strangely globelike yet spread out he still had the impression that he could see too many that they should not look so individual for their apparent size but he ignored this as he approached the surface of whatever the lights were placed upon he tried to convince himself that he was floating towards the outside of the sphere that he had started at the centre and worked his way out but for some reason he felt he was falling down the way onto a convex surface a single light approached an orb of shifting multicoloured hues like something cellular dividing and redividing within a single membrane yet with the patterns in the sphere somehow like distorted pictures images thrown haphazardly on an unfixed screen he felt himself float round this odd scaleless thing the other lights still apparently as far away as they had always been and he felt oddly attracted to this globe of light and that he could somehow without damage to it or himself enter inside it he was still when he thought about it aware he was standing in the room he snapped his fingers felt the edge of his tunic sleeve where it still hung at his side then willed himself to enter the glowing slowly pulsing sphere it was like walking into a room filled with babbling voices and lit with chaotic everchanging images his head was full of confusion for a moment then he thought he started to glimpse patterns and real shapes within the inchoate mix he let himself relax slightly ready to watch and just then all the images and noises seemed to coalesce become part of some single feeling which included the impression of touch and taste and smell as well quiss reacted against this and was back in the noisy gaudily chaotic roomfeeling he relaxed again just a little more warily and slowly the strange crystallisation of sensation occurred again and slowly quiss became aware of some sort of other thoughtprocess a set of feelings which was at once intimately close but still utterly cut off from him the truth of what was going on suddenly hit him stunning him he was inside somebody elses head he was so amazed he didnt have time to be revolted or really shocked before the novelty the sheer interest of it all took him excited him he shifted his body slightly feeling in a very distant sort of way like something in a dream his feet move on the small stool he stood on his armpits settling a little more comfortably into the leathersoftened hoops he felt a moment of dizziness as the light and sound swelled around him then a sudden sharp feeling of anxiety fear and distress he smelled burning heard loud crude engine noises saw metal wheeled vehicles frighteningly close the fear increased he felt dizzy again sensed he was somehow losing contact then he looked up or the person whose head he was in did and saw a blue blue sky like some polished blue shining sphere some immense smooth and flawless jewel the dizziness made him stagger he only then realised heor his host was walking and a wave of fear pulsed at him sending him out and away breaking off back into the strange dark lightspeckled space again his heart beating wildly his breath quickened he collected himself snapped his fingers a couple of times back in the real room inside the castle doors he vaguely considered giving up his little experiment that experience had been frightening and alien but he decided to persevere this was much too fascinating to abandon now he might not get another chance to explore so and anyway he wasnt going to give in to some undisciplined streak of cowardice not him he let himself fall gently towards another of the softlooking orbs of shifting colours and entered it as before there was the same feeling of dizziness but no fear this time he was looking at a pair of hands holding small stalks in one hand taking a stalk at a time from the bunch and planting them quickly accurately into holes in brown earth his back was sore the arms were brown like the earth they were his arms the arms of the person he was inside and he wore some sort of loose filmy covering the arms were very slim he or rather the other person stood up straightening that sore back putting one arm behind their back and stretching again the view was of lots of women doing the same thing he was stooped putting shoots into the ground the landscape was fiercely lit by a high sun the ground was brown he could see distant shacks and what looked like thatched roofs there were some hills in the distance green cut with terraces like map contours made solid tall trees with naked trunks and all the leaves in a round bunch at the top the sky was blue a thin white vapourtrail stretched across it there were a few clouds pure white his belly rumbled and he thought of what the child in his belly the woman whose body he had invaded bent back to the soil why yes now he thought about it he could feel the weight on her chest tits the child must be small because hisher belly felt normal if a bit empty and at the back of her mind the woman he realised was looking forward to a small meal of some stored baked grain in another few hours after which she still would not feel fullshe would still be hungry she had always been hungry she always would be hungry probably so would this child like all the others a woman quiss thought a peasant a hungry peasant how odd how strange to be in this way inside her body there but not there here but not here listening in he tried to sense her own feelings about her body as the woman bent to her task again methodically planting the small green shoots she was chewing on something her mouth working on some substance she was not actually eating something numbing something which helped to deaden thought and make the work easier how very very singular quiss kept thinking and although this was a womans body strangely it didnt feel all that different to being inside his own less than he would have imagined maybe he just wasnt making full contact he thought but somehow he got the impression he was the woman didnt seem totally aware of herself not specifically as a woman what about her the womans hand moved involuntarily towards her sex actually brushing the gatheredup material of her clothing between her legs she stood up puzzled almost then stooped back to her work a pain or an itch she thought quiss was amazed just by thinking something he had made the woman do it he imagined that she had an itch behind her right knee she scratched there quickly and hard hardly breaking the rhythm of planting and stooping fascinating then something was pulling at the womans leg but she ignored it in fact she didnt seem aware of it quiss didnt understand he could feel the tugging it was quite urgent and insistent then he remembered where he was really standing his head swum slightly for a moment as he reoriented himself mentally then he was aware again of the weight under his arms and on his feet he took his arms out of the loops and ducked down back into the room under the castle doors dont do that dont do that a small attendant squeaked jumping up and down as it tugged on the hem of his tunic you cant do that it isnt allowed dont tell me what to do you nanobrain quiss kicked the attendant square in the chest sending it tumbling away from him over the slate floor it quickly picked itself up pulled its loosened cowlbrim back down tight and glanced at the opened door it put its little hands together the yellowgloved fingers meshing please get out of here it said you really shouldnt be in here at all it isnt allowed im sorry but it just isnt why not quiss said hanging on to one of the iron loops and leaning forward glaring at the small attendant it just isnt it screeched jumping up in the air and waving its arms about quiss found something funny about the things antics juxtaposed with the frozen expression of aching sadness shown on its mask he got the impression from its sheer anxiousness that it was in some way responsible for leaving the door open it wasnt pleading with him to leave just for his sake it was frightened stiff actually quiss said lazily letting the iron hoop he was holding take his weight as he leaned back underneath the open hole in the glass ceiling and looked inside ive found this to be a quite fascinating experience i dont see why i should stop now just because you tell me to but you must the attendant shrieked flapping its arms about and running forward towards him it thought the better of tugging at his tunic again however and stayed about a metre away from the stool hopping about from foot to foot and wringing its hands oh you must you arent supposed to see any of this it isnt allowed the rules ill go if you tell me what it is quiss said glowering at the small figure it shook its head desperately i cant fair enough quiss shrugged and made as though to put his arms back through the hoops again no no no nonono the attendant wailed it ran forward throwing itself at his legs as though tackling him he looked down at it it cuddled his hosed shins like a tiny lover he could feel it trembling it was terrified how delightful get off my legs quiss said slowly im not going to go until you tell me what this is he glanced back up at the dark shadow inside the glass which surrounded the hole he shook his right leg and the quivering attendant rolled along the floor it sat on the slate put its head in its hands then it glanced towards the door which quiss had found open it got up quickly and took a key out of its pocket put it in the lock twisted it shoved the heavy door to with some difficulty then locked it you promise it said quiss nodded of course i am a man of my word all right then the attendant ran forward quiss sat down on the little stool the attendant stood facing him i dont know what its called or even if it has a name its a fish they say and it just sits there and well thinks hmm it thinks eh quiss said thoughtfully rubbing his neck a little bit of fur from the holes collar had stuck to his tunic neck he picked it off and fiddled with it what exactly does it think about well the attendant looked agitated and confused it kept shifting its weight from one yellowbooted foot to the other and back again it doesnt actually think so much as experience i think you think quiss repeated unimpressed its a sort of link the attendant said desperately it links us up with somebody in the on the subject world ahha quiss said i thought so there thats all there is to it the small attendant said and started tugging at his sleeve its other hand indicating the door it had just locked just a moment quiss said and jerked the sleeve away from the creatures grasp what is the name of this subject place this planet i dont know hmm well i suppose ill find out soon enough quiss said and started to get up off the stool looking up at the hole he stood and grasped the iron hoops put one foot on the stool the attendant jumped up and down its little yellow gloves made into fists and jammed together at the small hard mouth of its face mask no it shrieked ill tell you whats it called then dirt its called dirt the hopping attendant said now will you go please dirt quiss said incredulously the attendant beat its gloves on its head i i i think it spluttered i think it loses something in the translation and this thing quiss nodded up at the ceiling at the shadow round the hole it forms a link from here to this place called dirt is that right yes and are all the people on this planet accessible are all those lights you see initially individual people how many can you get into any of them are they all unaware of people looking in on them can they all be affected oooh no the small attendant said it stopped jumping and bouncing around seemingly collapsing in on itself its shoulders dropped it looked forlornly down at the slate floor it went and sat with its back to the door all the lights you see at the start are individuals it sighed talking more slowly now in a small resigned voice they are all available and can all be influenced there are about four billion of them hmm their bodies look quite similar to ours yes theyre supposed to it is our subject after all thats where all the books come from yes i see quiss said why why what the small attendant said looking up at him why the link whats it all for the small attendant put back its head and laughed he had never heard one of them laugh before it said how am i meant to know that it shook its head looked back at the floor again what a question suddenly it sat bolt upright it turned quickly and pressed the side of its head to the door it spun round to face him quickly its the seneschal you must get out it quickly unlocked the door and pulled it open its small boots sliding and skidding on the slate floor with the effort quiss was on his feet but he couldnt hear anything he suspected the small attendant of trying to trick him it looked at him held out its little hands pleading with him for your own sake man youll be here for ever you must go now quiss could hear a sort of deep rumbling noise from beyond the open door it sounded like one of the main driveshafts from the great clock heard through one of the thinner walls it hadnt been there when he entered the room from the corridor outside he went quickly to the door and outside the attendant ducked out with him and he helped it close the heavy door the rumbling noise stopped from along the corridor as quiss and the attendant went in opposite directions the small creature scurried to a tiny door on the far wall and disappeared through slamming it a tortured squeaking squealing noise came quiss was walking slowly towards the source of this cacophany it sounded like metal scraped over metal a wedge of light came from the side of the wall and from a large square room with metal gates which squeaked and squealed as they were concertinaed to one side and which quiss realised must be a lift the seneschal emerged with an entourage of blackcloaked minions they stopped in the corridor when they saw him quiss looked at the small figures surrounding the seneschal and for the first time felt genuinely apprehensive of the castles dwarfish inhabitants may we escort you back to your own levels the seneschals voice was cold quiss got the impression he had little choice he entered the elevator with the seneschal and most of the small minions and they let him out a few storeys below the games room level nothing else was said he had tried since to find either the attendant he had met in the room or the room itself but without success he thought they had probably rebuilt some of the corridors down there a lot of building work had been going on in that area recently he was fairly sure too that even if he did ever find himself in the same place the door would be locked he hadnt said anything to ajayi about this he enjoyed having knowledge she didnt let her read and complain about not having the name of this mysterious place he knew quiss placed his last domino down the two of them sat looking at the irregular construction of flat placed ivories as though expecting it to do something then quiss sighed and went to scoop them up for another game he might persuade ajayi to give it another go before she broke off for food or a book ajayi was leaning forward putting out one hand to stop her companion from starting another game then she became aware that the dominoes werent moving quiss was trying to prise them from the surface of the small table and growing annoyed now what the he began and went to pick up the table ajayi stopped him putting her hands on his forearms no she said and met his gaze this might mean the old man realised and quickly got up from his seat and went into the hot bright space of the games room by the time he came back from calling for an attendant ajayi was leaning over the table with a smile on her face watching as a pattern of spots slowly appeared on the dominoes they had placed there there you see quiss said sitting down brightfaced with sweat and triumph ajayi nodded happily gosh said a small voice its awfwy hot in here that was quick quiss said to a waiter as it appeared from the games rooms bright interior it nodded welw it said i was on my way here to see what you wanted fo wunch but i could take youwanswer if you wike ajayi was smiling at the waiter finding its speech impediment more funny than she knew she ought she was just in a good mood she supposed quiss said certainly you can its he glanced at ajayi who nodded and quiss continued they both disappear in a blaze of radiation got that they bofe disappea in a bwaze of wadiation yes i fink ive got that twy not to be too wong see you water it turned and waddled back through the games room head down mumbling the answer to itself its little blue boots sparkling with reflected light from the fish under the glass floor its steps and voice dopplering oddly as it passed a clock face well quiss said and leaned back in his chair taking a deep breath putting his hands behind his head and resting one booted foot on the balcony balustrade i think we might just have got it this time you know that he looked at ajayi she smiled and shrugged let us hope so quiss snorted at such fainthearted lack of belief and looked out over the blank white plain his thoughts returned to that odd experience in the room deep in the castles bowels what was the point of that hole that absurdly named planet and the link between here and there why the ability actually to make those people do things he had reluctantly discounted the idea that it was only he who had this intriguing capacity it was most frustrating he was still in the process of trying to get his contacts in the attendants to talk about this new aspect of the castles mystery so far they had been quite unforthcoming despite all his cajoling and threats they were frightened no doubt about that he wondered just how immutable the castles society really was might it be possible for example for them him to carry out a coup after all what godgiven right did the seneschal have to run the place how had he come to power just how closely did the two sides in the wars supervise the castle whatever the answers at least it gave him something else to think about apart from the games there might be another way out there just might never assume things were set and certain that was a lesson hed learned long ago even traditions change maybe this rundown heap was approaching some sort of catastrophe curveedge some change once no doubt it had been all its architects had intended perhaps full of people intact not crumbling fortress as well as prison but now quiss felt its pervasive air of decay tottering senility made it if he could find the right key or weapon easy prey the seneschal was only slightly impressive nobody else was at all he along with the woman was the most important person in the place he was sure it was all for them it revolved around them only really made sense if they were here and that itself was a kind of power as well as a comfort he liked to feel he was as he had been in the wars part of an elite ajayi sat wondering whether to wait for the small waiter to return before she went on reading her book it was a strange story about a man a warrior from an island near one of the planets poles he was called grettir as far as she could make out from the translation she was reading he was very brave except for being afraid of the dark she wanted to go on reading no matter what the response was to their riddleanswer either way she couldnt imagine anything happening for a while they were both sitting there quiet absorbed a few minutes later when from the bright airshimmering depths of the games room a small voice said sowwy part four penton street outside the belvedere pub in penton street a table stood on the pavement guarding the pubs open cellar doors they must be expecting a delivery from the brewers graham thought the table wood and formica standing over the two opened traps of the cellar reminded him of the chair in the corridor of the school just before he left he was almost at the top of the low buildingdisguised hill now the road had all but flattened out a few cars went along penton street but it was quiet after the bustle of pentonville road which he had just crossed he looked over to the far side of the street at some shops a cafe the area seemed unable to make up its collective mind whether it was rundown or not a copy of that days sun newspaper tried to wrap itself round grahams feet caught in a sudden dusty gust of wind he stepped out of it and let it flatten against some roadside railings he smiled recalling slaters apoplectic reaction to sun readers the best time graham thought was when only a few weeks ago they had been sitting in hyde park slater had decided that as they were all going to be around during the summer anyway they should arrange days out and had therefore organised a saturday afternoon picnic having made up his mind on the friday that the following day would be hot and sunny which it was slater had invited graham sara and a young man graham assumed was slaters latest conquest a short muscled exsoldier called ed ed had short fair hair and wore cutoff jeans as shorts and a green army tshirt he sat on the grass slowly reading a stephen king novel they had talked at slaters instigation about what they would do if they won a million pounds sara refused to play ask her if she ever did win she said ed thought carefully and said hed buy a big car and a pub somewhere in the country slater didnt know what else hed do but hed had this great idea for using at least some of the money go to the american south hire a cropdusting plane and a willing pilot fill the tanks with a mixture of chilli sauce and indelible black ink then fly over the biggest ku klux klan march of the year that would make their eyes water paint the mothers yippee graham said he would use the money to create an ultimate work of art it would be a map of london with every single street and house shown and on it would be traced in black ink funnily enough the path the route that each individual person in london took that day whether by train tube bus car helicopter plane wheelchair boat or on foot sara laughed but not unkindly ed thought it would be difficult to arrange slater pronounced the idea boring and said that it would be boring even if the map was coloured andor you used differentcoloured inks for the trails and anyway his was a much better idea all round graham thought slater sounded a bit drunk and didnt replyhe just sat with a knowing smile on his face and grinned briefly at sara who smiled back she wore a light summer dress with a high elegant neck and a big white hat she had on white shoes with round toes and rather oldfashionedly large clumpy heels and silk or silklook stockings or tights which graham thought were unnecessary on such a warm day she leant against a tree looking beautiful when she put her head back and put her arm behind her neck he kept glancing quickly ashamed at the dark length of curled hair in the exposed armpit slater in white trousers and striped blazer complete with battered boater real straw graham noticed sat crosslegged on the grass holding a plastic cup full of champagne hed told graham and sara each to bring some food hed bring a magnum from money they had gone on to politics edward slater said you cannot be serious ed shrugged and lay back in the grass one arm propping up his cropped head as he read the paperback gripped spine broken in his other fist i reckon shes done all right he said he had a vaguely east london accent slater bounced the heel of his free hand off his forehead my god the stupidity of the english working class never ceases to amaze me what do those murderous moneygrabbing selfseeking bastards have to do to you before you start getting angry good grief what are you waiting for repeal of the factory safety act compulsory redundancy for all trade unionists the death penalty for cleaning windows for gain while claiming the dole i mean tell me don be daft ed shrugged it isn her fault its the recession isn it bleedin labour couldnt do no better just nationalise everything wouldn they edward slater sighed i think theres a place on the editorial board of the economist just waiting for you well you can come out with all these smart answers ed said still reading or at least looking at the paperback but most people just don see things the way you do yes slater said hissing well theres an open sewer at the bottom of chancery lane you can blame for that ed looked puzzled he looked round at slater whats that then oh good grief slater said he collapsed back in the grass melodramatically but left his hand holding the champagne sticking up bingo he gasped the general election was in a few days slater couldnt believe that people really were going to vote the conservatives back in graham wasnt so sure it was such a bad thing but he kept this private slater would have exploded graham agreed slightly with ed he didnt think anybody could do very much about the economic situation of the country certainly he thought the tories spent too much on arms especially nuclear weapons and maybe they should spend more on things like the health service but he admired mrs thatcher a little and she had had a famous victory in the falklands he knew it was all rubbish but he had felt a sort of grudging pride when the army marched into port stanley ed didnt seem bothered about letting slater know what he thought graham wasnt sure whether to admire him or feel sorry for him he felt somewhat put out when he realised that ed probably wouldnt care what he thought ed stood up well i think ill go an hire a boat you want to come he looked at slater then graham then sara who shook her head slater lay on the grass while graham looked at him theres a terribly long queue slater said they had already discussed hiring a boat if we don queue we won get a boat ed shrugged he stuffed the paperback into the rear waist of the denim shorts against the small of his back slater said nothing stared at the sky well ed said i can queue anyway you come down later when im nearer gettin a boat if you like he stood there sometimes slater said addressing the sky i think it would be nice if they just got the war over with now one tenmegaton over westminster now and wed hardly know a thing just vaporised dust mixed up with the grass and the soil and the water and the clay and the rock youre a right bleedin pessimist ed said you sound like some of them cnders sometimes you do he nodded down at slater hands on hips slater kept staring at the sky then he said i do hope youre not now going to tell me once again what a fine bunch of lads you met in the army shit ed turned away shaking his head and started walking off towards the serpentine and the boat houses well if you don want to fuckin defend yourself slater lay there for a moment then jerked upright spilling a little of his champagne ed was about ten yards way slater shouted after him well when it does fall and you do fry i just hope you remember what a fucking wonderful idea you thought it was ed didnt react people in nearby deckchairs and other groups of people also sunning themselves did though looking over sh sara said lazily you wont do any good shouting at him like that hes an idiot slater said collapsing back on the grass hes entitled to his views graham said oh dont be stupid graham slater snapped he reads the sun on the bus every morning going to work so graham said well my dear boy slater said talking through rictused lips if he spends half an hour each day shovelling shit into his brain you cant expect his ideas to do anything else but stink can you hes still entitled to his views graham said feeling awkward under saras gaze her cool regard he played with a few blades of grass twisting them in his fingers slater sighed if he had any of his own i might allow you that graham but the question is are the proprietors of fleet street entitled to edwards views no he came more upright leaning on one elbow and looking at graham graham made a face and shrugged you expect too much of people sara told slater he looked at her through hooded eyes one eyebrow raised do i indeed theyre not all like you they really dont think the way you do they just dont think period slater snorted sara smiled and graham was glad she was talking it let him look at her drink her in without either of them feeling embarrassed thats just it sara smiled they do of course they do but they believe in different things they have different priorities and a lot of them wouldnt want some perfect socialist state even if you could bring it about slater snorted with derision at this great so theyre now getting ready to vote themselves five more years of cuts poverty and exciting new methods of incinerating millions of our fellow human beings certainly a long way from your ideal socialist state what is this the de sade school of political sociology so they get what they deserve sara said why do you pretend to care so much more about them than they do themselves oh fuck slater said i give in he collapsed back on the grass sara looked at graham smiled and raised her eyebrows conspiratorially graham laughed quietly she hurt his eyes she sat in the shadow of the tree but the whiteness of her skin the bright shoes and stockings and dress and the hat all reflected sunlight from the brilliant sky and he could hardly look at her for the glow which struck his eyes he drank his champagne it was still cool slater had brought the bottle inside a coolbag and it lay by the tree trunk in shadow like sara slater had been genuinely offended when graham told to bring glasses turned up with only plastic cups he thought graham would understand graham had been a bit worried about slater meeting sara the last time either of them had seen her had been earlier that same week and he thought slater might have mentioned it they had gone together up to half moon crescent on a day when sara had suddenly cancelled their afternoon walk along the canal shed been abrupt even distressed over the phone and he had been worried he had decided to walk up that way anyway just to be there in case there was anything obviously wrong slater had been concerned too both at grahams obvious agitation and at saras state as graham described it graham didnt mind his friend coming along he was glad of the company they started out walking but then on theobalds road slater insisted on getting a bus graham pointed out that a only went as far as kings cross which wasnt very far and not even in exactly the right direction slater said it was in roughly the right direction and anyway his new shoes were tight and he didnt want to walk all that way at kings cross he got them a taxi graham said he couldnt really afford slater told him not to worry hed pay it wasnt far in the taxi slater suddenly remembered something he had a present for graham he dug into his jacket pocket here he said and handed graham something hard wrapped in tissue paper graham unwrapped it as the cab went up pentonville road it was a small glazed china figurine of a woman naked with large breasts and her knees bent feet under her buttocks legs spread out her tiny face was set in an expression of ecstasy her shoulders were thrown back as though she was forcing her conical breasts higher and her hands were down at her hips open and delicate each finger carefully moulded her genitals in the quick glance graham gave them seemed rather exaggerated is this supposed to be some sort of joke he said to slater slater took the figurine back with a grin and produced a pencil from his inside pocket no he said its a pencil sharpener look and he inserted the pencil between the models legs graham looked away shaking his head it is just a little bit tasteless i have more taste than anchovies in garlic butter you young pup slater said i was just trying to cheer you up oh graham said as the taxi turned left thanks huh said slater sitting forward in his seat to make sure the taxi driver went the right way as they approached half moon crescent i spent several days making that for you i said thanks graham said then oh tell him to stop here dont want to get too close he checked the street to make sure sara wasnt around they were still in penton street but you never knew the taxi stopped lets have a drink slater said ill tell you one thing said graham as slater led him across the street into a pub called the white conduit what you forgot about how to get the shavings out graham held the china figure up in front of slaters face slater frowned looked at the over scalesized orifice his lips tightened its your round ill have a pint of lager he said and went to sit at a window seat looking down the short stretch of maygood street to half moon crescent they heard stocks bike ten minutes later they both stood up and looked over the top of the window curtains which hung from a brass rail halfway up the window a large black bmw bike turned down maygood street the person riding it wore black leathers and a black full face helmet with a heavily tinted visor yup slater said thats our man graham caught a glimpse of the bikes number stk t it was the first time he had seen the bike since that night in january when he first met sara when they had arrived here in the taxi he hadnt thought to look at the bike properly then and had always avoided coming up this way when he knew stock was about the rider straddling the machine got off it took its key out and went not entirely steady on his feet graham thought to the door of saras flat and put a key into the lock seconds later he was gone did you think he looked six foot graham said looking at slater as they sat down slater nodded took a drink easily looked a bit tipsy i thought what a hunk though eh he waggled his eyebrows up and down theatrically graham let his shoulders slump and looked away do you mind he said slater nudged him dont take it so hard kid im absolutely certain itll all work out believe me are you really graham said turning to his friend slater looked into grahams face for a few seconds watching him bite his lower lip then his own lower lip trembled and finally a smile burst out over slaters face as he turned away shaking his head sniggering well to be honest no but i was trying to be encouraging good grief how on earth should i know jesus graham breathed and finished his half pint of bitter he stood up sighing slater looked at him unhappily oh god youre not going out in a huff are you im just going outside for a little bit to have a look round i wont be too long you know slater said weakly slapping the table top beside his drink gates youre going to have to get those lines right before we hire the icebreaker the last few words were barely comprehensible as slater collapsed forearm on table head on forearm his back shaking as he laughed muffled grunts of mirth echoing off the floor beneath him some of the older customers in the bar looked at him suspiciously graham frowned deeply at slater wondering what on earth he was talking about then left and went for a quick stealthy walk round the back of half moon crescent and up a little side alley listening for any shouts or arguments from inside the flat there was nothing he went back to the pub where slater had bought him a pint as graham sat down slater started to shake and his face went red tears appeared in his eyes and finally he had to splutter fucking norwegian bastards he fell sideways on the bench seat and doubled up with silent spasmic laughter graham sat feeling terrible hating stock and slater and feeling sick about sara and what she might be doing right now and halfwishing that the pub landlord would throw slater out luckily despite his threats slater did not tell sara he and graham had been there that day they sat in the park later that week getting slightly drunk on the champagne and slater talked about lots of things but not that ive just had this great idea he announced from the grass holding up his plastic cup they had almost finished the champagne what sara said she sat against the tree grahams head on her shoulder he was pretending to be asleep so that he could keep his head there near her soft warmscented skin interdopa slater said waving the cup around at the still blue sky this hippy turns up on your doorstep bums a fag off you and shoves a lump of crumpled silver paper into your hand put me down for the inaugural run sara laughed gently graham wanted to laugh too but could not better to rest here feel her lovely body shake tremble under his head and touch he still remembered that feeling weeks later he could still shiver at the thought of it it was like the first time he had ever spent a night with a girl back in somerset the next day with his friends in the pub at lunchtime watching a local football match in the afternoon having dinner with his parents that evening later watching a film on television at a friends house he kept having flashbacks a fleshmemory of the feeling of that young womans skin would suddenly make him shudder and his head swim he recalled with some shame that he had been naive enough at the time to wonder if this feeling was love luckily he hadnt talked to anyone about it he could see the white conduit ahead now and he remembered how wretched he had felt that afternoon since then he had been back here once again when he knew he wasnt expected hed said to slater he was going home when they parted at lunchtime in the sandwich bar in red lion street but in fact he came up here and saw stock arrive on the bike not long after he started watching this time sara was visible moving about in the room she usually greeted graham from when he pressed the entryphone buzzer stock had let himself in and sara had not reappeared graham felt sick and left soon afterwards he got throwingup drunk all by himself in leyton that night the day in the park had been good though he had kept his head on saras shoulder for ages until his back and neck ached but she hadnt appeared to mind and once had even stroked his hair absently with one caressing hand ed had come back later on hed had a halfhours row on the serpentine you shouldve come down when i was nearer the front of the queue you should he told them he had bought some small dumpy cans of mcewans export and handed the others one each he sat down to read you see slater said loudly still lying down his voice slightly affected by the champagne hed drunk this man is a fucking socialist at heart and even he doesnt realise it give it a rest dick ed told him mildly slater poured the last of his champagne over his own forehead he calls me dick he gasped in a strangled voice and rolled over onto his face me the communal ranger superhom the pinko pimpernel the man in the faberge mask ill scratch the mark of zero on your foreskin you shush now sara ffitch said her voice resonating in her chest buzzing grahams head with glorious sensation slater went quiet he started snoring lightly a few minutes later a pretty girl blonde wearing a short bouncy skin and a thin pink top through which graham could just make out the outlines of her nipples passed him on penton street he watched her walk by but didnt make it obvious he had always worried about this he didnt want to be sexist but how the hell did you not look at attractive women he didnt say anything to them or try to touch them hed never dream of that he despised the stupid idiots who did that sort of thing they made him ashamed to be a man they were the sort slater accused of carrying their brains in their scrotums or did slater say scrota but lookingas long as it didnt embarrass the woman that was all right especially now or maybe with a bit of luck until now it had been a strange awkwardly sexual time for him he had been worrying of all things about masturbating he found it difficult almost unpleasant to think of sara at night in bed before he went to sleep but to think of other women previous sexual encounters seemed wrong too it was absurd it was crazy it was like being pubescent again or worse it didnt even make much sense in terms of the beliefs he had worked out long before about sexual fidelity but there it was he hated the idea of pornography even soft pornography but he had almost come round to the idea that it might be better to buy one of the glossy girlie magazines and accept the inhuman labial beauty of those seductive imagewomen it would at least absolve the release of his sexuality from the responsibilities of the real world most peoples ultimate sexual fantasies their idealised desires are built of clay he recalled slater saying slater had just discovered that most of the weight of a glossy magazine came from kaolin the same clay used in a morphine mixture to clog up peoples guts when they had the runs graham seemed to remember slater had been talking about gay photomags but the point was the same anyway what did it matter now it might all be over soon all the worrying and waiting and empty desiring he was opposite the pub now he would turn the corner on to the short length of maygood street and there would be half moon crescent the name fascinated him he made a symbol of it half moon crescent mr sharpe drunk he sat on a park bench in the small triangular piece of ground which was called islington green mr sharpe sat by his side they were both drinking from large bottles of cider mr sharpe was smoking a cigarette steven felt quite drunk i mean mr sharpe said stabbing at the air with his cigarette they dont ave to stay where they fackin well are do they course they dont do they steven shook his head in case mr sharpe was really asking him a question most of the questions seemed to be rhetorical though he couldnt remember what mr sharpe was talking about now was it the jews the blacks scroungers mr sharpe was a small man of about fiftyfive he was going bald and his eyes looked yellow in the greypink skin of his face which was lined with grey stubble he wore a big old coat and working boots he had approached grout in the pub he had gone to the nags head steven usually avoided pub drunks and it was fairly obvious mr sharpe was the resident pd in the nags head that lunchtime but steven was quite drunk himself and apart from mr sharpe seeming to be encouragingly worried about conspiracies grout hadnt entirely given up the idea of finding a fellow exile and cooperating to escape together mr sharpe had also displayed what appeared to be genuine goodheartedness when steven told him it was his birthday a few small tears had come to his eyes in fact when mr sharpe shook his hand for a long time and wished him many happy returns several times in a loud voice steven had bought most of the drinks from then on as mr sharpe wasnt working and didnt have very much money but steven didnt mind he showed mr sharpe all the money he had explaining that he had been paid off that day the cans mr sharpe had said spitting inadvertently the fackin cans i bet it was them unions wasnt it grout hadnt been sure about that but he told mr sharpe he wasnt sorry anyway he did say he couldnt spend all the money of course he had to keep some by for his rent and food and things and he had to wait for his unemployment money mr sharpe said he was quite right but to watch out there were plenty of smart jewboys and big black muggers around the jewboys would swindle it off you and the niggers would slit your throat as soon as look at you after the pub shut at three they went over to the green with a couple of bottles of stout they had bought to carry out steven had bought mr sharpe a packet of cigarettes too and some matches youre a gent steve thats what you are a gent mr sharpe had said and steven felt almost as good as when the policeman had called him sir he sniffed eyes tingling they drank the bottles of stout then mr sharpe said why didnt they nip over to the offlicence in marks and sparks on chapel market and get a couple of bottles of cider it was cheap in fact if steve would lend him the money a fiver say no make it a tenner seeing as he felt generous and steve was a real pal hed get the drink himself seeing as steve had been so generous in the pub and all hed pay him back next wednesday when his giro came through steven thought this sounded fair and so he gave mr sharpe two ten pound notes have twenty he said mr sharpe was taken aback and said again what a gent steven was he went off to the shop and got four bottles of cider and a canon of cigarettes although he felt drunk steven didnt feel all morose like he usually did when hed had a lot to drink he felt quite happy sitting on the bench under the trees of islington green with the traffic rushing harmlessly by all around it was nice to have somebody to talk to somebody you felt was on your side who didnt laugh at you or show contempt for you who felt sympathy for the way you were treated but not pity for who or what you were somebody who wished you happy birthday he didnt mind that mr sharpe was doing all the talking you take the likes of my old boss right mr sharpe was saying drawing smoky patterns with the cigarette he held between his fingers good bloke good bloke you know strict but fair wouldnt stand for any nonsense or people turning up late or anyfink but straight know what i mean in the textile trade e was ad to mix with a lot of jews didnt like it of course but thats business innit e went bust last year didnt e ad to lay me an the rest of the lads off see recession it was basically but also the fackin unions e used to give them short shrift i can tell you wouldnt ave them in the place an quite right too say i but e reckoned theyd got at im beind is back like an es a smart bloke right anyway it was the recession what really did it e said and e said e was really choked e ad to let us go on account of ow wed all stood beind im an we did when e explained to us what was appenin a couple of years ago we didnt take no pay rise did we we even took a pay cut last year that was ow much we was prepared to look after our jobs see not like these fackin union cans we was responsible we was yeah e was really choked mr inglis was that was is name wasn it inglis by name and english by birth and proud of it e would say mr sharpe laughed steven took his blue safety helmet off and wiped his brow he would have to go for a pee soon it was lucky there were toilets at one end of the green yeah es a good bloke that mr inglis an you know wot e told me e told me e didnt even make a profit the last five years these fackin troskyists they talk about bosses an that but they dont know nuffink do they i know cos one of my nephews es a troskyist isnt e little can i nearly knocked is bleedin teeth out last time i saw im only tryin to tell me i was one of them racialists wasnt e i said lissen son i said ive worked with blacks an ive even made friends with some of them which is probly more than youve ever done an i quite liked some of em they was jamaicans not these little pakkie cans and they was okay some of them but that dont alter the fact theres too many of them over ere an that dont make me your racialist now does it little can thats wot i told im straight i did mr sharpe nodded aggressively reliving the confrontation steven was toying with the leather sweatband of the hard hat he was hot it was probably safe to take the hat off there was no scaffolding nearby he put the hat down on the bench between him and mr sharpe who went on where was i oh yeah mr inglis e said e adnt made a profit for five years but people think just because e rides round in a rollsroyce people fink es bleedin rich dont they they dont know see that it dont even belong to im its is companys even is ouse isnt is its is wifes innit ed just as soon drive a mini but people in the trade wouldnt take im seriously would they specially them jewboys steven shook his head thinking this seemed to be required he wasnt all that happy about this mention of a rollsroyce he considered telling mr sharpe about the dangers of disembowellings by rollsroyce mascots but he thought hed better not but im glad to say mr sharpe said smiling lighting another cigarette es managed to get back on is feet again i appened to see im the other day when i was looking for a job es got a new place up in islington park street making dresses an all an repairing machines course the place is full of these little wog wimmin but like mr inglis says ed love to ave whites working for im but peopleve got lazy avent they e cant find white wimmin to work for them wages an why cos the fackin money theyre gettin from the government an from workin on the sides too much thats why mr inglis ed love to take me an the lads back on for the machines but the fackin unions theyve priced us all out of a job avent they mr inglis cant afford to take on more than a couple of experienced blokes an all the rest are these yops or wotever theyre called you know them young kids wot the government pays you to train an that steven nodded he watched the reflections of the trees above him as they slid and swayed about the shiny blue surface of his safety helmet it really was the most lovely shade of blue he took it off the bench and put it on his lap an that stupid young nephew of mine ell tell you they wont take our jobs little poof i think es on that canopus stuff i bet if you looked at is arms youd find them potmarks i tried that stuff you know when i was in the navy i did out in wogland somewhere some fackin place but it didnt do nuffink for me an anyway i wasnt that stupid to take enough to get me ooked was i not me mate give me a pint an a fag an im quite appy mr sharpe puffed on his cigarette and took a drink of his cider grout was thinking about beer crates hed had one once he remembered coming down essex road on the very bit of pavement they could see in front of them over the grass the crate had seemed like such a good idea at first a way round searching for parked cars all the time he had taken the beer crate which hed found behind a pub one night with him when he went to look for work one day about a year ago whenever he was running out of breath and there were no parked cars or low walls to protect him from the laseraxles he simply had to put the crate down on the ground and then stand on it safety at last it had been a brilliant idea but people treated him like some son of maniac young men shouted at him women with children avoided him a gang of kids started to follow him he threw the crate into the canal eventually cruelly hurt not just by the reaction people had exhibited but also because he knew he didnt have the strength of character to resist them he couldnt take that much scorn he couldnt keep up such a high profile for long yes it had hurt but he liked to think he had learned from the experience he knew how cunning they were now how carefully they made sure that he had no easy ways out mere ingenuity wouldnt help him live any easier here he had to concentrate on escape on finding the key the way out maybe he should ask mr sharpe about hotblack desiato he seemed to know the area a bit though steven couldnt remember having seen him before either in the nags head or anywhere else but he said he lived locally maybe he would have some idea yes he supposed the beer crate hadnt been such a good idea it had shown them too obviously that he was on to them that he felt contempt for them he had to be more subtle what a little can eh calling me a can mr sharpe was saying steven nodded he really must go to the toilet soon he took the safety helmet and hung it on the end of the bench he put his bottle of cider down on the tarmac at his feet it wobbled and fell and rolled away spilling cider from the top for a couple of seconds before he could get hold of it again he set it down more carefully oopsadaisy he said ere steve mr sharpe said nudging him with his bottle you wanna watch that thats precious stuff that is you cant afford to go wasting precious stuff like that now can you not on your burfday even you cant eh mr sharpe laughed steven laughed too and got up from the bench his tummy hurt a bit he staggered slightly as he left the bench and his right foot hit the plastic carrier bag with the rest of the drink and the carton of cigarettes mr sharpe had bought steady on mr sharpe laughed putting out one hand to catch grout just going to the lav steven said he patted mr sharpes hand and started off ere steve do one for me mr sharpe shouted after him and laughed steven laughed too he didnt feel too bad but he couldnt stand up properly it was like having appendicitis or something like that he walked bent over luckily it wasnt too far to the public toilets in the gents he had a good long pee and felt much better he was quite drunk he knew but he didnt feel sick actually he felt pretty good it was nice to have somebody to talk to somebody who seemed to understand he was glad he had met mr sharpe steven combed his hair slowly and carefully it was a pity there was nowhere to wash his hands which were a bit sticky but never mind he took some deep breaths to clear his head outside the toilet he stood looking at jims cafe across the street maybe he would treat mr sharpe to a meal that would be nice he swayed slightly as he went back into the little park there were quite a few other men in the park some of them looked very poor and deadbeat and grout felt sorry for them when he got back to the bench mr sharpe had gone he stood looking at the bench swaying staring at it trying to work out if it really was the right bench at first though it seemed to be in the right position he thought it couldnt be because his good blue hat wasnt there hanging on the end of it the carrier bag and everything else had gone too he looked mystified at the nearby benches just a few tramps he scratched his head what could have happened maybe it wasnt the right bench maybe he was in completely the wrong place but no here was quite a lot of grey cigarette ash on the ground and an empty cider bottle lying behind the bench against the concrete kerb which separated tarmac path from green grass his own bottle had gone he looked round traffic buzzed down essex road buses moved redly up and down upper street what could have happened had the police mistaken mr sharpe for a tramp and taken him away surely not the tormentors they wouldnt dare do anything so flagrant so against the rules would they just because he and mr sharpe had been getting on so well he kept looking around thinking that suddenly he would see mr sharpe waving from another bench beckoning him to come and finish his cider and stop being so stupid maybe mr sharpe had moved to another bench that must be it he looked round all the other benches but all he saw were tramps and deadbeats had they done something to mr sharpe it had to be the tormentors it was one of their tricks one of their filthy tests he didnt believe it was the jews like mr sharpe had said he knew it was the tormentors they had done this hed get them though he swore hed get to the bottom of this right now he went to the nearest tramp an old man lying on the grass he had very long greasy black hair and a collection of plastic carrier bags spread out on the ground around him what happened to my friend grout said the tramp opened his eyes his face was very tanned and dirty i didnae do anythin honest i didnae son he said a bloody drunken scotsman grout thought what happened grout insisted what son the scot tried to lever himself up off the grass but couldnt i didnae see anythin honest ive just been sleepin honest i havnae touched anythin son dont you accuse me honest its no crime to sleep you know son ive been abroad you know son to foreign countries grout puzzled over this last statement then shook his head youre sure you didnt see anything he asked carefully showing this drunk scot that he at least knew how to speak correctly he put some menace into his voice as he finished quite sure aye im sure son said the scot ive been sleeping thats what i have been doing he seemed to be waking up making an effort with his speech grout decided the man probably knew nothing he shook his head and went back to the bench standing beside it looking about a tramp a couple of benches further up towards upper street was waving at him grout turned and went up the path to the man this one was even older and grubbier than the scot snoring on the grass cuddling one of his carrier bags where on earth were all the clean people grout thought you lookin for yer frand muster my god this one was irish where were all the english people why didnt they send some of this lot back where they came from yes i am looking for my friend steven said coldly carefully the irishman nodded towards the apex of the small triangle of park towards the busstops on the far northbound side of upper street he wen up that way took all yur stuff the irishman said grout was puzzled why when he scratched his head again the irishman shook his head i dunno muster he just up an wen as soon as you wen down to the toilets i thought youd had an argument or somethin so i did but my hat grout said still unable to fathom why mr sharpe would do such a thing that blue thing the irish tramp said he put that in huz bag i dont grout said his voice trailing off as he walked slowly up in the direction the irishman had pointed he left the small park waited for the traffic to clear then crossed the road over to the other side of upper street keeping down by the roadside rather than going up the stepped curb onto the raised section of pavement because he was afraid of things falling off buildings and he didnt have his hat a horrible knotted feeling a pain started to eat at his guts he felt the way he had in the home when all the children hed befriended were adopted or sent away and he wasnt the way he had when he got lost down by the sea at bournemouth on an outing this cant happen to me not on my birthday he kept thinking not on my birthday he went down the side of the street round the parked cars nosein to the slanted curb down to the busstops looking all the time for mr sharpe for some reason he kept thinking that mr sharpe would be wearing the blue hat and he found himself looking for that all the time instead of mr sharpe who he now realised he probably couldnt have described very well if a policeman had asked him to he wandered down the terrible feeling growing in his guts like a live thing wringing him squeezing him people mobbed about him on the pavement by the busstops down ramps and out of buses blacks and whites and asians men and women people with shopping trolleys or bags of tools women with children in pushchairs or dragged along from one hand older children ran by screaming and shouting people ate hamburgers from polystyrene boxes chips from bags they carried shopping or parcels they were old and young and fat and thin and tall and little dull and gaudy he started to feel dizzy as though the alcohol or the sultry air was dissolving him as though the pain inside was wringing him out like a wet towel twisted and squeezed he staggered pushed past people looking for the blue helmet he could feel himself being dissolved his identity sapped from him lost in this siege of faces he got to the side of the curb made sure there were no buses coming then stepped out on to the inset bus lane turned round and started to head back the way he had come further out from the crowd now staggering and swaying his way back he looked over his shoulder but there were still no buses coming ready to swing into the busstop lane and crush him only traffic from the lights further down charging up the street engines roaring he heard a bike engine revving coughing he kept going heading back for the park maybe mr sharpe would have come back the holes he had repaired were around about here rough screaming engine noises shouted at him he ignored them a bike engine spluttering a diesel engine revving he felt suddenly dizzy and disoriented for a moment filled both with a sudden panic and an unsteadying conviction he had been here before seen this all before he glanced up at the sky for a second and felt himself stagger his head cleared and he did not fall into the stream of traffic but it had been close he heard a great thundering noise then a noise like a car hitting something but probably just the sound empty lorries or trucks make when they go over those speedramp things or holes in the road too fast he turned round slowly still feeling strange to see if it was one of the holes dan ashton and the squad had done he bet it was a woman screamed from the pavement he looked up again into the blue blue sky and saw something sailing out of it like a reflection sliding over a globed shiny blue surface a spinning cylinder a bike and a flatbed truck flashed by on one side he stood transfixed thinking my hat my hat the tumbling aluminium beer barrel hit him right on the top of his head chinese scrabble they sat covered in their furs in a small open area near the summit of the castle of bequest a few decrepit towers and decaying fractions of floors with rooms and chambers rose into the shining grey sky to one side of them but most of the apartments were empty and useless only good for rookeries stones great slabs of slate lay tumbled all around the small cleared area where they sat a few stunted trees and bushes little more than overgrown weeds poked out from the mass of fallen fractured masonry ruins of arches and columns lay about them and while they played chinese scrabble it started to snow quiss looked up slowly in surprise he couldnt recall it snowing for a long time he blew some of the small dry flakes off the surface of the board ajayi hadnt even noticed she was still studying the two small remaining plastic tiles balanced on the little bit of wood in front of her they were very nearly finished nearby perched on a pitted flaking column the red crow sat puffing on the green stump of a fat cigar it had taken up smoking at about the same time they had started playing chinese scrabble i can see this is going to take some time it had said id better find some other interests maybe i can contract lung cancer quiss had asked it casually where it got the good cigars from he should have known better he told himself later tuck off the red crow had said i liked that other game you played the red crow announced suddenly between puffs from the column quiss didnt deign to look at it the red crow balanced on one leg and took the short stump of the cigar out of its beak with the other foot it looked pensively at the glowing end of the cigar a flake of the quietly falling snow landed on it and hissed the red crow cocked its head looking up accusingly at the sky then went on stuffing the cigar back into its beak so that its words came out oddly distorted yes that openplan go was all right i liked that board the way it seemed to stretch for ever in all directions you two looked proper twats i can tell you standing in the middle of an infinite board cut off at the waist real dickheads you looked those dominoes were just stupid even this is pretty boring why dont you just admit defeat you arent going to get the answer throw yourself off the edge over there doesnt take a second dammit at your age youll probably die of shock before you hit the fucking ground hmm ajayi said and quiss wondered if she had been listening to the bird but she was still frowning deeply at the tiles on her little ledge of wood talking to them or herself in a few days if quiss had counted correctly they would have been together in the castle for two thousand days of course he recalled proudly he had been there longer than she had it was good counting up the days working out the anniversaries so that they could celebrate them he had started working them out in different numberbases base five base six seven eight of course nine ten twelve and sixteen so two thousand days would be a quadruple celebration as it was divisible by five and eight and ten and sixteen it was just a pity ajayi didnt share this enthusiasm quiss wiped his head slowly dislodging some small cold flakes of snow he blew some more off the board perhaps they would have to go back in soon if the snow kept up they had got bored with the games room and the weather had seemed milder so after much cajoling of the seneschal they did finally get permission to have the small table with the red jewel in it unbolted again from the floor an apparently simple job which absorbed three sometimes more constantly arguing attendants armed with oilcans screwdrivers hammers boltcutters tweezers wrenches and pliers for all of five days and transported up through the upper levels of the castle to what was by default thanks to the crumbling architecture of previously higher storeys the castles roof in this sort of elevated courtyard surrounded by stunted trees and fallen stones and distant turrets they had played the game of chinese scrabble for the past fiftyodd days the weather had been kind no wind slightly warmer than before until today and the sky still grey but bright grey maybe its spring quiss had said brightly maybe this is high summer ajayi had muttered dourly and quiss had got angry with her for being so pessimistic quiss scratched his scalp it felt funny since the castle barber had cut his hair he wasnt sure if the hair was growing back or not his chin and cheeks which had been grizzly with mottled stubble for nineteen hundred days in the castle now felt smooth to the touch though still lined with age quiss made a funny little laughing noise as he thought of the castle barber who was neurotic he was neurotic because he had the job of shaving every man in the castle who didnt shave himself quiss had heard of this odd character long before he met him the seneschal had told him of the barber shortly after quiss had arrived in the castle in answer to his inquiry whether there were any other relatively ordinary human people in the place quiss hadnt believed the seneschal at first he thought the greyskinned man was joking a barber who shaves everybody who doesnt shave himself quiss said he didnt believe such a person existed that is the provisional conclusion the seneschal had said gravely that the barber has arrived at quiss met the barber much later when he was exploring the middle levels of the castle the barber had a huge splendidly equipped almost totally unused barbers shop with a fine view of the snowfilled plain the barber was taller and skinnier than the seneschal and had deep black skin he had white hair and was halfbald he shaved the right side of his scalp to the skin the left side had a fine head or halfhead of curly white locks he shaved his left eyebrow off but left the right intact he had half a moustache on the lefthand side his beard was very full and bushy on the right side only otherwise he was cleanshaven the barber wore thick white spotless overalls and a white apron he either didnt speak the same language as quiss or had forgotten how to speak because when quiss had entered the brassrailed redleatherchaired barber shop he just danced around quiss pointing at his hair and beard and twittering like a bird his hands and arms fluttering about as he danced he flapped a big white dusty towel at quiss and through pleading imploring motions tried to get him to sit down in one of the chairs quiss wary and suspicious of people who shook and trembled a lot even at the best of times but especially so when they wanted to come near him with anything resembling long scissors and a cutthroat razor had declined later though he found out that the barber had a steady hand when actually carrying out his duties the seneschals hair still grew and he had it cut by the barber a hundred or so days ago quiss had sent an attendant to tell the barber quiss would be coming down soon to have his hair cut either the minion got the message wrong or the barber misunderstood it or couldnt wait because he arrived in the games room a short time later carrying a portable barbering kit quiss let him cut his hair while ajayi looked on the barber had seemed pleased gibbering away to himself quite happily as he skilfully trimmed quisss mottled hair and shaved off his beard the red crow had watched too which was a pity because it had kept telling quiss the barber would cut his throat just as proficiently if he asked him to nicely after all what was the alternative madness or a slip on the stairs one day quiss stroked his chin still finding after a hundred days the smoothness novel and pleasing he had no luck in getting the attendants to brew or distil something alcoholic from the kitchens supplies and he never had found that open door again or any open door all of them were closed and locked these days the last interesting thing hed found was another stupid joke and one he didnt even fully understand hed been deep in the castles lower levels looking for the door or for the small attendant who had discovered him in the room he still had dreams about those alien brown arms that blue sky with the contrail across it that sun and he had heard a steady monotonous thumping noise far away down a network of tunnels and corridors he followed the pounding sound until he came to an area where the floors of the corridors and alcoves were covered with fine grey dust and the air was hazed with the same dry stuff the floor shook rhythmically to the pounding he went down some broad worn steps to a crosscorridor and sneezed on the dust a small attendant wearing grey boots and no cowlbrim scuttled along the broad corridor the steps led down to it stopped when it saw him can i help you it squeaked its voice was very high but at least it was civil quiss decided to take advantage of this yes you can he said holding a bit of his furs over his mouth and nose to keep the swirling dust out his eyes smarted the pounding was closer down the corridor where large double doors faced him what the hells that noise wheres all this dust come from the attendant regarded him quietly for a moment then said come with me it walked off towards the double doors quiss followed the double doors were made out of plastic with clear plastic inserts at about human headlevel on one of the doors there was a large symbol like this d it reminded quiss of a halfmoon on the other door the righthand one there was this symbol p the attendant swept through the doors in a cloud of dust coughing holding the furs tighter over his mouth quiss held one door open and looked through inside a huge cavern of a room hundreds of minions scurried about in the grey mist there were conveyor belts overhead cranes and hoppers buckets and wheelbarrows and a narrowgauge railway system with rails where they could be seen through the piles and drifts of dust which looked very similar to those quiss had noticed in the castle kitchens the whole place was filled with clouds of fine grey swirling dust and shook and echoed to the continuous pounding crashing noise he had heard more distantly earlier the noise was being produced by a single gigantic machine in the very centre of the room the machine appeared to be made up largely of great manthick metal columns tangles of wire and cables and a cagework of constantly rising and falling gates of metal mesh in the centre of the machine something massivelooking flashed silver in time to the pounding noise above the centre of the machine also in time to the beat a silver metal cylinder rose and fell grey oddly crafted blocks or sculptures went in at one side of the machine dust blew out at the other side dust and rubble the rubble was carried away on a conveyor belt to huge vats quiss could just make out in the powderhazed distance the dust was apparently meant to be sucked up by extractor ducts in the ceiling again similar to the system in the kitchens but a lot of the dust seemed to be evading the intakes quiss could see through all the dust in the air great drifts of it piled like frozen waves around vats and conveyor belt housings in several places greybooted minions were shovelling the grey dust into wheelbarrows or small hopperlike wagons on the narrowgauge railways other minions were wheeling full greyheaped barrows up perilously narrow planks and gantries to the lips of the giant vats and tipping the dust in a lot of it billowed out again as far as quiss could make out in the grey gloom from the vats large overhead buckets scooped up grey viscous fluid which was poured into moulds on conveyor belts which disappeared into long hissing machines at the far end of the machines the moulds were stripped off the grey sculptures which were then minionhandled or trolleyed to another conveyor belt which led into the pounding machine in the centre of the room what in hells name is this quiss said incredulously choking on the dust this is dee pee the attendant said primly standing in front of him arms folded this is the nerve centre of the entire castle without us the whole place would simply grind to a halt it sounded proud are you sure quiss said coughing the minion stiffened have you any other questions it said coldly quiss was looking at the objects which he thought of as sculptures as they moved steadily along the conveyor belt to their destruction they were funny shapes yes he said pointing at the shapes what are those meant to be those are the attendant said pointedly numbers dont look like numbers to me quiss said well they are the minion said impatiently thats the whole point the whole point of what quiss said laughing and choking in almost equal parts he could see he was annoying the small minion and thought this was good fun hed certainly never seen numbers that shape before but of course they could easily be numbers in some alien language or system ajayi might even have recognised them the whole point of what were doing here the attendant said as though trying to be more patient than it really felt this is the numbercrunching room those are numbers it said enunciating clearly as though for some small and wilfully obtuse child and motioning behind it to the conveyor belt with one arm and this is where we crunch them that machine is a numbercruncher youre crazy quiss said into the fur over his mouth what the attendant said stiffening still further and then jolting forward drawing itself up to its full if still modest height quiss coughed nothing what do you make the numbers out of whats that grey stuff plaster of salt lake city the minion said as though only an idiot would ask such a question quiss frowned what the hells that its like plaster of paris except duller the minion said then turned and stamped off through the drifts of grey powder quiss shook his head coughed then let the plastic doors swing to ajayi was still looking at the board and her two remaining tiles staring from one to the other then she put her elbows on her knees her chin in her hands and closed her eyes looking thoughtful the snow collected in the thin grey hairs of her head but she still did not notice it was snowing her expression of concentration intensified they were nearly finished chinese scrabble was played on a gridded board a little like an infinitely small square section of the go board they had played on hundreds of days ago but in chinese scrabble one placed small tiles with pictograms on them into the squares formed by the grid of lines not small stones on the interstices they hadnt needed to come up with any complicated things like infinitely long pieces this time but the problem had been the choice of pictograms they had been saddled with at the start of the game apart from anything else they had had to learn a language called chinese that alone had taken them over seven hundred days quiss had nearly given in several times but ajayi kept him going somehow the new language excited her it was a key she said now she read even more ajayi opened her eyes and studied the board again the meanings and possibilities of the pictograms in front of her filled her mind as she tried to fit the last two tiles somewhere into the network of skewed pathways she and quiss had created on the small board chinese was a difficult language even more difficult than the one she had started studying the one called english but they were both worth all the effort they were even worth the effort of having to drag quiss along the same educative road she had helped and cajoled and prompted and shouted and insulted until he could get by in the language they had to play the game in and even once he had just about grasped the basics she still had to keep helping him along shed been able to work out roughly what tiles he still had on his side as the game had entered its final most difficult stage and had deliberately left him easy openings so that his imperfect grasp of the language would not prevent him getting rid of the last of his tiles the result was that now she was stuck unable to see where she could put the last two pictograms she had left if she couldnt place them somewhere make one or two or more new meanings they would have to start again the next game wouldnt take as long as this one which had lasted thirty days so far but she was worried that quiss would get impatient he had already grumbled several times that she hadnt taught him the language properly but the language had been a marvellous magical gift for her to enable them to play the game properly they of course had to understand chinese a language from the castles subject place the still unnamed planet all the books appeared to originate from the seneschal had therefore provided them with a dictionary which gave chinese pictograms and their equivalent in one of the languages common to both sides in the therapeutic wars an ancient longdeciphered battlecode so elegant its utility as a language had ensured its survival after its secrecy had evaporated with that key ajayi could unlock any of the languages original to the unnamed globe it had taken her only a few days to find a chineseenglish dictionary and after that she could read the books she found far more easily she learned chinese for the game and english for her own reading alongside each other becoming relatively fluent in the indoeuropean system long before the more tricky oriental tongue it had been as if the whole massive crumbling ruin of the castle suddenly became transparent now there were so many more books she could find and take and read and enjoy a whole culture and entire civilisation was spread out before her for her to study as she wished she was already learning french german russian and latin soon greek and from the latin italian shouldnt be too big a step her english was already helping her with the ancient roman language the castle was no longer the prison it had seemed before it was a library a museum of literature of literacy of language the only thing which still worried her was that she could not find any way to translate the markings on the slates those cryptic buried symbols still meant nothing she had scoured wall after wall of books but never found a single mention of the strange simple markings somehow etched inside the grained rock but that was a small worry in comparison to the immense satisfaction she felt with her discovery of the key to the castles original tongues she had started methodically to read all the classics of the unnamed planets past having discovered long before a book which acted as a guide to the literature of that world apart from the occasional foray further forward in time to whet her appetite she was being quite strict with herself in keeping to a chronological exploration of the books she had discovered and stored in her rooms she was now at the end of this first and she hoped last game of chinese scrabble just starting the age of the elizabethan dramatists in england and was already starting to get excited about reading shakespeare desperately hoping he hadnt been overpraised in the later critical works she had already encountered even having only got that far she had still missed out a lot there were still books she had to find or go back and read once she had read through to the last era books were still printed in or the castles records stopped she didnt know what had happened did some cataclysm overwhelm the world did they move on to some other form of communication or did the castle only contain works up to a certain period in the worlds history come on ajayi quiss said with a sigh i finished ages ago whats keeping you ajayi looked up at the old mottlehaired man with his smooth cheeks and broad lined face she arched one eyebrow but said nothing she would have liked to have thought that her companion was making a joke but she was afraid that he was serious yeah get a move on the red crow said my cigars getting put out by this fucking snow ajayi looked up then and realised it was snowing somehow she had been aware that quiss kept blowing the board in front of her clear every now and again but she had been so involved with trying to find a niche or two for the remaining tiles on her side of the board that it hadnt got through to her properly that what he was blowing off it was snow oh she said suddenly aware of it she looked around seemingly confused for a second she pulled the collars of her furs up closer around her neck though if anything it had become slightly milder since the snow started to fall not colder she frowned at the board then looked up at quiss again should we go back to the games room do you think oh gods no the red crow said in an exasperated voice lets get this over with shit it pulled the cigar from its mouth glared at its wet black end then tossed it away with a flick of its skinny black leg no point in asking either of you bastards for a light it muttered then shook its head fiercely stretched its wings halfout and fanned its tail it shook itself free of the snow gathering on its back a couple of small red feathers floated down to the soft ground like strange flakes of blood in the white fall ajayi went back to staring at the board quiss had given up all hope of carrying out some sort of coupdechateau the seneschal was in an impregnable position he discovered because he was beyond time five hundred days ago some of the scullions quiss had befriended were working in the kitchens when a temporary stove collapsed sending a huge vat of boiling stew crashing down on the seneschal who was walking by it at the time half a dozen scullions saw what happened next one second the seneschal was there walking the next he was disappearing under the gigantic metal cauldron as it fell and cracked and split flooding an entire section of the kitchens with molten stew two of quisss little attendants were only metres away and had to jump for their lives into the sink with the dishes they were cleaning to escape the tidal wave of steaming bubbling broth a moment later the seneschal was walking past on the other side of that sink unit telling the section undercook to find out who had been responsible for the building of the temporary stove get them to construct another and then burn them alive in it he went on to his office as though nothing had happened no body was ever discovered when the remains of the shattered stove and cauldron were cleared up one still stunned scullion said the seneschal had simply materialised right in front of it quiss wasnt a fool there was no way you could go against power like that he had also given up the idea of trying somehow to shortcircuit the process which occurred when they finished a game and gave an answer to the riddle they had been set the red crow had told him what happened the last creature in the castle quiss would have expected to be so forthcoming but it had obviously decided that by telling him it would discourage him still more and thus send him a little further along the road to selfdestruction quiss couldnt recall the whole story now but it went on for a long time and involved the waiter whispering the answer in a room full of bees which then built some sort of nest which something called the message crow ate and then started flying after that there were some more funny beasts most of which seemed to end up eating each other then a place on the surface of wherevertheywere with thousands of tiny lakes which thousands of animals marched on to and spontaneously combusted melting the ice of the lakes in a certain sequence which some sort of organic communication satellite with a message laser recognised after that it got even more complicated it was in other words foolproof impersonating or somehow coercing the waiter who did the whispering was pointless too as a final check whoever or whatever arrived to take them away from the castle would ask the rooks and crows what they had seen to make sure there had been no tricks employed the whole thing of course happened in some sort of time warp which was why despite the labyrinthine complexity of the answering process they always found out the response to their answer within a matter of minutes quiss found it all very depressing well they were about to finish this game perhaps he told himself they would get it right this time they had only about one good answer left to the riddle which was worrying in one way but encouraging in another maybe this one had to be the right one maybe they would finally say the right thing and get away from here quiss tried to think of the things he used to try not to think about the things he had missed so much at first that it had really hurt to think about them he could think of them quite easily now quite painlessly the good things in life the many pleasures of the flesh and mind the joy of battle plot and drunken reminiscing it all seemed so far away now it felt as if it had all happened to somebody else some young son or grandson some other person entirely could it be that he was starting to think like an old man just because he looked like one was no real reason but perhaps there was a sort of backpressure a feedback cycle of effect and cause which made his thoughts gradually fit the husk they filled he didnt know maybe it was just all that had happened here in the castle doors all the disappointments all the missed chances those brown womanarms that bright promise of a contrail that sun that sun in this overcast place all the chaos and the order the seemingly purposeless apparently directed insanity of the castle maybe it just got to you after a while yes he thought the castle perhaps it makes us as we are as we are to be perhaps it moulds us like those numbers ever circling to destruction reincarnation indeed disintegration and breakup an epilogue at birth why not he would even be sorry to leave in some ways the small minions he used as contacts in the kitchens were hardly the crack troops he was used to or even battlehoned mercenaries but they had their own nervous inefficient attraction they amused him he would miss them he laughed at the thought of the barber he recalled meeting the master mason and the superintendent of mines both surly proud impressive men he would like the time to know better even the seneschal himself was interesting once he could be persuaded to talk ever disregarding his ability to evade catastrophe but a lifetime or more than a lifetime here unbidden the thought suddenly filled him with deep awful despair yes he would miss this place in some strange twisted way if they were able to leave at last but that was only natural as a prison it was very mild indeed and anywhere not unendingly unpleasant could inspire nostalgia given enough time sufficient scope for the processes of memory to select the good and neglect the bad that was not the point that was simply not the point to stay here would be to fail to give in to compound and affirm the error he had made in the first place which brought him here it was duty not to his side or even his comrades they were not involved here it was duty to himself how strange that only now in this odd place he should understand fully a phrase an idea he had heard and dismissed all the way through his education and training ah ajayi said breaking quisss thoughts he looked up to see the woman reaching over the board cupping her hand and blowing into the halfbowl it formed directing her breath down onto an area of the playing surface and scattering the snow flakes which had settled there there she said placing the two tiles down together in one corner of the board then smiling proudly at her companion quiss looked at the two newly setdown tiles thats it then he said nodding dont you think its good ajayi said she pointed quiss shrugged noncommittally ajayi suspected he didnt understand exactly the new meanings she had made on the board itll do quiss said looking not particularly impressed its finished the game thats the main thing well thank kryste for that the red crow said i was just about falling asleep it flapped from its perch on the broken column and hovered over the board inspecting it i didnt know you could hover ajayi said to the bird its wingbeats just above them disturbed the snow falling on them and the board making artificial flurries im not supposed to the red crow said absently eyes fixed on the board but then crows arent supposed to talk either are they yes that looks all right i suppose quiss watched the red bird flapping energetically above them he made a face when it gave its disdainful approval of their game the red crow made a sound like a sneeze then said whats your contribution to the wit and wisdom of the universe this time then why should we tell you quiss said why not the red crow said indignantly well quiss said thinking because we dont like you good grief im only doing my job the red crow said sounding genuinely hurt ajayi coughed on a laugh oh tell it she said waving one hand dismissively quiss gave another sour look first at her then the bird cleared his throat and said our answer is you cant no i mean there is no such thing as either oh the red crow said still hovering unimpressed wow well have you got any better answers quiss said aggressively plenty but im not telling you bastards well ajayi said standing up stiffly and dusting the powdery white snow from her furs i think we should get inside and find an attendant dont bother the red crow said allow me itll be a pleasure it cackled with laughter and flew off no such thing as either ha ha ha its voice trailed back to them as it flew away ajayi picked the small table and the board up slowly and together she and quiss made their way through the tumbled masonry of the roof towards the intact floors some way off quiss watched the red crow flap slowly through the snowfilled air until he lost sight of it do you think its gone off to tell somebody maybe ajayi said holding the small table carefully and watching where she put her feet think we can trust it quiss said probably not hmm quiss said stroking his smooth chin dont worry ajayi said stepping over some cracked slate blocks as they made their way towards the shelter of a broken arcade we can always tell somebody ourselves hmm i suppose so quiss said as they entered the arcade stepping over some of its fallen columns and the remains of part of the roof they came under the shelter of the roof where it was still good and as they did so quiss slipped on a patch of ice crying out as he slid putting out both hands trying to steady himself on a column on one side and ajayi on the other he knocked the board tiles scattered quiss fell heavily to the ground oh quiss ajayi said she put the board down quickly to one side she went to the old man lying on the ground spreadeagled over the ice he had slipped on eyes fixed on the vaulted roof of the arcade quiss ajayi said kneeling down painfully by the mans side quiss quiss made a strangled choking noise his chest moved up and down quickly his face was grey ajayi put her hands to the sides of her head for a second shaking her head tears coming to her eyes quiss gurgled his eyes popping she took his hand in hers held it with both her hands as she leant over him oh quiss the man sucked a huge laboured gust of cold air into his lungs his arms came up and he thumped his chest then he tried to roll over on one side when she saw what he was trying to do ajayi helped him he propped himself up on one elbow then with ajayis help sat up he banged his back with his clenched fist weakly ajayi did it for him harder he nodded his breath coming more regularly now justwinded he said shaking his head he wiped his eyes okay he sucked in more air he looked over at the board the pattern on it broken and spilled oh shit he said and put his head in his hands ajayi kneaded his broad back through the heavy robes and said never mind about that quiss as long as youre all right but the board its all messed up quiss gasped i can remember how it looked quiss ajayi said leaning close behind him and talking into his ear trying to sound confident and encouraging i studied it for long enough goodness knows its engraved on my memory dont worry about it are you all right are you sure im all right stopfussing quiss said irately trying to shove ajayi away with one hand she knelt back from him her hands falling to her lap eyes lowered im sorry she said getting up slowly from her knees i didnt mean to fuss she bent sitting on her haunches grunting with the effort and started to pick the fallen scrabble tiles out of the snow to one side drifting in under the roof of the arcade and off the icecrusted surface of the slate slabs fucking ice quiss said hoarsely he coughed rubbed his nose he looked round at the woman carefully picking the pieces up from the ground and putting them on the board again have you got a noserag he said what yes ajayi said reaching into her furs and bringing out a small handkerchief she handed it to quiss who blew his nose loudly and handed the kerchief back she folded it and put it away ajayi sighed she wanted to tell him to get up hed catch cold sitting on the freezing slabs like that but she didnt want to fuss quiss got up with some difficulty grunting and cursing she watched him out of the corner of her eye as she picked up the scattered pieces ready to help if he asked or reach out quickly if he started to fall back again quiss stood rubbing his buttocks and back leaning against a column they could so easily die she reminded herself they might be fixed in one age but it was an old and fragile one a weak and accidentprone age so far they had not fallen really badly or broken any bones but if they did injure themselves they would take a long time to get better she had asked the seneschal about that long ago his advice had been dont fall she thought she had all the tiles she counted them all the ones on the board and found there was still one missing she got up still stiffly arching her pained back and looking round in the snow and on the slate flagstones got them all quiss said his face was still pale but not as grey as it had been ajayi shook her head still looking round about her no one missing quiss looked quickly over the slates i might have known it they wont let us answer the riddle now i bet well have to start all over again i bet it thats whatll happen this is just typical he turned quickly away and slammed an open palm into one of the columns staying facing away from her breathing deeply head hung down between his shoulders ajayi looked at him then lifted up the small table to see if she had placed it on top of the missing tile when she put it down to help quiss but the tile wasnt there well find it she said gazing into the drifted snow she didnt feel as sure of it as she hoped she sounded she couldnt understand it the tile couldnt have bounced so far could it she counted the tiles on the board again then once more she began to get angry at quiss for falling in the first place and then for trying to shove her away at the missing tile at the castle itself the red crow the seneschal the attendants all of them where could the stupid thing be are you sure youve counted them properly quiss said in a tired voice still holding on to the column of course i have several times theres one missing ajayi snapped her voice clipped now stop asking stupid questions no need to bite my tongue off quiss said huffily i was only trying to help well look for the tile ajayi said she could hear herself and she hated herself for it she shouldnt lose control like this she oughtnt to snap at quiss it did no good they ought to be sticking together through all this not quarrelling like schoolkids or growingapart couples but she couldnt help it look quiss said angrily i didnt hit the fucking board on purpose it was an accident would you rather i broke my neck of course not ajayi said carefully trying not to snap or shout i didnt say you did it deliberately she wasnt looking at quiss she was moving her head from side to side still scanning the snow and slates seemingly intent on finding the missing tile but her mind was all caught up in the words she knew she wouldnt have seen the tile even if it had been quite obvious she wasnt concentrating on the search maybe youd rather i did eh quiss said eh she looked up at him then oh quiss how can you say that she felt as though hed kicked her there had been no need for him to say that what made him say such things quiss just snorted he pushed himself away from the column with one slightly shaking arm and as he did so the missing tile fell out of one of the bottom hems of his furs where it had lodged when it and he fell at the same moment a small figure appeared at the far end of the arcade from a door which led back into the main body of the castle they both looked first at the fallen tile then at the small attendant it waved and called out in an excited voice did you say theres no such thing as either they looked at each other again ajayi tried to answer but had to stop and patted the top of her chest with one hand her throat seemed to have dried up she couldnt get any words out quiss nodded enthusiastically yes he shouted he kept nodding his head the attendant shook its head no it said and with a shrug disappeared back into the castle somewhere far away beneath them in the ruins a familiar voice cackled crowing with distant laughter part five halfmoon crescent on the corner of maygood street and penton street there was an employment office where people went to sign on for dole

but it was outside the door next to saras and it was a red honda not a black bmw he took deep breaths to try and slow his heart down he looked up at the window sara leaned out of sometimes but she wasnt there she will be there though he told himself she wont be out she will be in and she wont have changed her mind he went to the entryphone he pressed the button for her flat firmly he waited staring intently at the grille from which her voice would come very soon he waited he put his finger on the button about to press it again then hesitated uncertain whether to wait a little longer or not she might still be waking up or having a shower anything there could be lots of reasons for her not answering yet he licked his lips kept staring at the grille he leaned forward on the button once more closing his eyes as he did so he let the button go there was still plenty of time even if she wasnt in he could wait she would probably just be out getting something for the salad shed said she would make for them he wondered whether he ought to press the button again his stomach was feeling heavy sick he could just imagine someone from the houses on the corner of maygood street watching him now looking at his back as he stood at the entryphone grille waiting and waiting the grille made a clicking noise hello said a breathless voice it was her it he said and choked on the words throat dry he cleared his throat quickly its me graham she was there she was there graham im sorry she said his heart seemed to sink he closed his eyes she was going to say she had changed her mind i was in the bath the buzzer on the entryphone sounded he stared at the door for a moment then at the entryphone then at the still buzzing door he pushed it quickly just before the buzzer stopped sounding the door swung open and he went in there were carpeted steps down to a basement flat a door straight ahead to the groundfloor flat he went up the stairs cheap but cheerful carpet white paint on the banisters fading pastel wallpaper he could hear an old beatles record being played downstairs he got to the firstfloor landing there were more steps up to another flat but the door on the first floor into her flat was open he knocked and went in looking around with obvious trepidation just on the off chance it wasnt the right flat or she hadnt meant to leave the door open he heard water from a room to his right light showed under the door graham she said hello he called out he put the portfolio down against the wall and closed the door on to the landing go on in to your left her voice was soaked up by the sound of the running water he took the portfolio up again went round to his left into a small cluttered room with a couch chairs television hifi bookcases and a small coffee table at the far end raised up a few inches separated from the main part of the room by small wood railings which each extended a third of the way across the area was a kitchen section cooker and fridge and sink a larger table and behind it main curtains drawn white lace ones floating out slightly on a faint breeze was the window he put his portfolio down by the side of the couch a small table at one end of the couch held the telephone he recalled the time it had rung and rung and she was under the bedclothes hiding from the thunder he crossed the room to the raised kitchen section stepping up on to its worn linoleum surface and going to the sink he rinsed his hands under the cold tap splashed some water on his forehead he dried his face and hands on a dishcloth there was no hand towel he was shaking he went back down onto the carpeted area and stood heart beating quickly in front of the bookcase beside the television he saw a book there which he hadnt read but had seen televised the restaurant at the end of the universe was the second part of the story begun in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy slater had told him that when the bbc made the series they just lumped the two books together graham took the slim volume out flipped through it looking for one bit in particular he found it in about the middle of the book the scene involved a character called hotblack desiato who was spending a year dead for tax reasons desiato was a firm of islington estate agents graham had seen their signs douglas adams must have lived in the area he put the book back although it was funny it was rather light reading he wanted sara to find him reading something more impressive there were a lot of books on best things and worst things books full of quotes criticisms collections of hyberboles and euphemisms lists of lists books full simply of facts books on what had happened on each day throughout the year books about last words famous mistakes most useless objects graham knew what slater thought about such works he took a very dim view indeed they were yet more signs that the end was in sight cant you see hed said one day in march sitting in the small steamy cafe in red lion street its a society getting its affairs in order preparing for the end drawing a bottom line under what its done that stuff and all the bomb literature were becoming a deathbased society in love with the past seeing only annihilation ahead annihilation were fascinated by but powerless to do anything about vote thatcher vote reagan lets all die yipfuckingpee graham took out a book on marxist economics opened it about a third of the way through started reading his eyes took in the words but it was dry hard complicated stuff and the meanings flowed over the surface of his mind and off again like water from a suncreamed shoulder graham sara said from the doorway he turned round heart thumping to see her just leaning in from the hall a white towel round her head like a turban a thin blue dressing gown round her body her face looked white and painfully thin without its usual aura of black hair i wont be long have a seat she went into the room across the hall which he assumed must be the bedroom he put the economics book back he sat down looking around the room after a while he rose to look at the record collection it all seemed very dated a lot of old stones records but much led zeppellin and deep purple middle period floyd and early bob seeger meatloaf was about the latest stuff funny the collection must have belonged to the girl who actually owned the place the one who was in america he inspected the bookshelf again at that moment on st john street near the buildings of the city university and about a quarter of a mile south of the junction of pentonville road and upper street a figure in black leathers wearing a black fullface crash helmet with a smokedglass visor was crouched by the side of a bmw rs motorbike which was propped against the side of the kerb the man in the black leathers sat back looked up the road north in the direction he had been heading when the bike had suddenly started misfiring a quarter of an hour ago while he was making his way as arranged to half moon crescent he cursed leant forward again quickly turning a small screwdriver as he fiddled with the settings on the carbs stk t was the registration number of the bike graham took out a book on ethics it looked like the sort of book to be found reading too slater naturally had his own views on ethics as on everything else his philosophy of life he said was founded on ethical hedonism this was the moral system virtually every decent unblinkered reasonably informed human able to scrape together a quorum of neurons lived by but they didnt realise it ethical hedonism recognised that one had to enjoy oneself where one got the chance these days but that rather than immerse oneself totally in such diversions one ought always to behave in a reasonable and reasonably responsible manner never losing sight of the more general moral issues and their manifestations in society have fun be nice veer left and never stop thinking is what it boils down to slater had said graham had nodded and observed that it sounded like it was easier done than said he got bored with the book on ethics which was even more obscure and difficult than the economics book and replaced it in the bookcase he went back to the couch and sat down looking at his watch it was four twentyfive he took his portfolio up set it on his knees he thought about opening it up so that he would be looking at the drawings when sara came in perhaps even doing some lastminute alterations to them he had a pen and pencil in the portfolio too in the bottom he decided not to he didnt have slaters natural acting ability that way of just adopting a persona you should have been an actor hed told slater late last year sitting in leslies sandwich bar over a couple of cups of tea and two sweet sticky pastries i tried that slater had replied huffily they threw me out of drama school what for overacting slater had said dramatically graham put the portfolio down again he stood up looking at his watch again and walked back to the kitchen part of the room to the window a slight breeze blew the thin white curtains softly towards him the view outside round the corner of maygood street was still a couple of parked cars closed doors the usual grainy sunlight of the summer city a fly buzzed in through the window and graham watched it for a while as it flew around the kitchen area hovering over the cooker flying down underneath it wavering in the air around the door of the fridge floating over the black surface of the round table near the window crisscrossing the air in front of the food cupboard it settled on one of the thin plastic chairs pulled in around the table graham watched as it stretched its two front legs over its head cleaning itself he picked a magazine up off the table and slowly rolled it up until it was tight then he stepped slowly forward towards the chair where the fly was the fly stopped cleaning itself its front legs went back down to the surface of the seatback graham stopped the fly stayed still graham moved into firing range he drew the clenched magazine upwards tensing himself the fly didnt move graham sara said from the doorway what are you doing oh he said putting the magazine down on the table hello he stood there embarrassed the fly flew off sara wore baggy olivegreen dungarees a black tshirt underneath on her feet were a pair of pink trainers her hair was still swept back from her face held at the rear of her skull by a pink ribbon he hadnt seen her with her hair like that before it made her look smaller thinner than ever her white skin glowed in the light coming from the window her dark eyes the heavy lids like hoods regarded him from the far end of the room she was putting her watch on a black band round the thin cord of wrist are you early or is my watch wrong she said looking at it i dont think im early graham said glancing at his own watch sara shrugged and came forward he watched her face he knew he could never draw it properly never do it justice it was flawless precise perfect like something carved out of the finest marble and possessing an ultimate elegance and simplicity of line but yet containing a promise of such softness a tactile transparency im staring again he told himself she stepped up on to the raised kitchen area still fiddling with the strap on her watch and went to the window looking out of it for a moment then she turned to him she looked into his eyes and he felt he was being assessed in some way she took a deep breath nodded at the table between them shall we sit she said it sounded like an odd thing to say sara drew out one of the small plastic chairs her back to the window and sat down she watched as graham sat down too she had her hands on the table he put his there spread out like fans thumbs just touching as hers were when do the rest of the people for the seance turn up he asked then wished he hadnt sara smiled at him in a strange distant sort of way graham wondered if perhaps she was on something she had something of the disengaged look people often have when theyve been smoking dope i didnt have time to get the salad together sara said do you mind if we have a talk first no on you go graham said there was something wrong he felt bad sara wasnt the way she usually was she kept looking at him with that odd vacant assessing gaze which made him uncomfortable made him want to curl up and protect not be himself and open out ive wondered graham she said slowly not looking at him but looking at her own hands where they lay on the black surface of the table about how you see the sort of relationship weve had she looked up at him briefly he swallowed what did she mean what was she talking about why well i he thought as hard as he could about it but he had had no time to prepare to think about the subject with some warning he could have talked about it perfectly easily and naturally but just to be asked outright like this it made things very difficult ive enjoyed it to some extent he said he watched her face ready to alter the way he was expressing himself even alter what he was saying according to the reception of his words on the white surface of her face sara gave him no clues however she was still gazing at her pale thin hands the lidded eyes almost hidden from grahams view a small white section of the scar tissue round her neck showed from the square neck of the tshirt by the pale column of her neck i mean its been great he said awkwardly after a pause i realise youve had well that youve been involved with somebody else but i he dried he couldnt think what to say why was she doing this to him why did they have to talk about this sort of thing what was the point he felt cheated abused sensible people didnt talk about this sort of thing any more did they there had been so much rubbish talked and written and filmed over the years all that romantic crap then the idealistic unrealistic naivety of the sixties and the wideeyed evangelism of the new morality of the seventies all that had gone people were less inclined to talk more liable just to get on with it hed talked to slater about this and theyd agreed it wasnt so much a backlash more a slack pausing for breath so graham believed slater thought it meant the end but then to slater little didnt do you think you love me graham sara asked still not looking at him he frowned at least the question was more direct yes i do he said quietly it felt wrong this wasnt the way he had envisaged telling her this afternoon setting the lightness of the room the distance of blackpainted table between them nothing suited what he had to say what he wanted to tell her he felt i thought you might say that she said still staring at her long white fingers on the table top her voice chilled him why are you asking all this he said he tried to sound a little more jocular than he felt i wanted to know sara began how you feel feel free graham said laughing sara looked at him calm and white and he stopped the laughter in his throat killed the smile on his face he cleared his throat what was going on here sara sat for a moment silent while her fingers lay on the table inspected and observed perhaps he should show her the drawings hed done of her he thought perhaps she was upset about something or just depressed in some general way maybe he ought to try and take her mind off whatever it was sara said you see graham ive deceived you we have stock and i graham felt his stomach go cold inside him at the mention of stocks name something happened deep inside him a gut reaction of ancient evolved fear and distress what do you mean he said sara shrugged jerkily the tendons on her neck standing out like taut ropes you know what deception is dont you graham her voice sounded odd not like hers at all he formed the impression that she had thought this out that like him she had thought in advance about the things she would say but she choosing the ground in advance had the advantage so that her spoken words were more like lines something to be acted out on the tense stage of her body yes i think so he said because she was silent and it seemed they would go no further until her question was answered good she said and sighed im sorry youve been deceived but there were reasons do you want me to explain them to you she looked up again once more just for a second or so i dont understand graham said shaking his head trying by the expression on his face the tone of his voice to make it clear that he wasnt taking all this as seriously as sara was how do you mean deceived how have you been deceiving me ive always known about stock ive known about your relationship but i havent well i might not have been ecstatically happy about it but i didnt do you remember that time when it was raining and you rang up from a callbox i think you said sara interrupted graham smiled of course you were under the bedclothes with your walkman turned up full blast to drown out the thunder sara shook her head quickly briefly so that the movement looked more like some nervous spasm than a sign she kept looking down at her hands no no i wasnt what i was doing underneath the bedclothes was screwing bob stock when you rang and rang and rang he took his stroke from the pulses of the bell she looked up into his eyes her face quite serious even unpitying while his aching guts turned inside him a cold uneven smile crossed her face as a third party you were quite a good screw rhythm and staying power he felt he could not speak it was not the fact of the tawdry revelation itself so much as the tone of its delivery which hurt this clinical deadpan expression the flat voice even if this outer calmness was belied by that tensioned neck the jerkiness of her movements and gestures she went on that time i talked to you from the window when you were down in the street the day we went to camden lock stock was behind me he put the window down on my back all i had on was that shirt he took me from behind you know the corner of her lips jigged nervously twice then twisted with a tiny dry hint of a smile hed always said he might do it one of the times he was there when you called id dared him to do it it was very exciting you know he shook his head he felt he was going to be sick this was absurd insane it was like all slater had ever joked about like all the most sexist caricatures of female deception why why was she telling him all this what did she expect from him she sat on the far side of the circular black table her hair severely gathered back that thin nearly translucent face brought to its own point decks cleared for action she was watching him now he thought the way scientists must watch a rat some animal with its brain exposed wires into it hooked up to a machine with its tiny electric animal thoughts bleeped and phosphoresced recorded by glowing green lines and the smoothly unrolled lengths of paper and the thin metallic scribbling of scratching pens why though why and thought does the rat ever know could it ever comprehend the reasons for the cruel uses it was put to you do remember she said voice purring dont you i remember he said feeling broken unable to look at her and stared at the tables surface and one or two small crumbs lying on it but why he said looking up at her he could not keep his eyes on hers for very long he looked down again even that first time sara said ignoring his question when we met at the party in the loo would you believe that stock was in there we had arranged it all in advance he climbed up the drainpipe i left that room we were in and went down there to meet him thats what i was doing in the bathroom fucking on the floor with bob stock she pronounced the words carefully really he said he had forgotten it all forgotten all he had ever felt for her he would feel it again he knew and it would hurt but for now he was putting it out of his mind it didnt matter any more she had changed all the rules put the whole relationship that had existed between them into quite a different category he stored the old self the hurt young man for the moment concentrated as best he could while still reeling inside from the sheer force and extent of the change on what was being said now on this new set of rules this role he was being forced into for reasons he didnt yet understand but why he said trying not to sound hurt trying to play it the way she was decoy she said shrugging she gazed at her fingers again spreading them out on the black paint surface that divorce of mine my husband was having me followed stock couldnt afford to be involved but we didnt want couldnt stop seeing each other so we decided to use somebody else to seem to have an affair with me you were seen to go upstairs with me at that party we figured that whoever my husband had tailing me would be at the party gatecrashing following me we thought that he would assume wed been screwing i really had of course but that was just a little extra weve been stringing you along ever since sorry graham anyway our man doesnt seem to be following you perhaps hes been called off the case or something maybe my other half just didnt want to spend any more money on me dont ask me so graham said feeling faint sitting back in the chair as though nothing was wrong trying to stop his lips quivering one hand on the top of the seatback where he remembered for no good reason the fly had been his other hand still on the table like some strange animal in a black and circular arena on the far side of it from her pale fingers his hand trembling very slightly scratched at a fleck of white paint on the black surface as he said im not of any use any more is that it sounds rather mean doesnt it sara said she was still trying to sound calm but her words sounded clipped graham laughed shaking his head oh no no not a bit he felt tears starting to come to his eyes and stopped them determined not to show her what he was feeling he shook his head went on laughing still watching his finger scratching at the whitepaint fleck not at all no he shrugged he was aware of a sort of tingling itch all over his body as though the heightened awareness of his earlier anticipation was with him in a single sense only once again and every nerve in his skin was receiving a maximum intensity pouring into his brain a mass of static average signals a bodily white noise giving an impression of unattenuated unsifted exaggerated usualness a paradigm of the pain of clearly felt normality so it was all just an act was it he said after a while when she had said nothing more he still couldnt show what he felt he kept thinking wildly that it might all be a cruel sort of joke or even a test a final examination before he was allowed closer knowledge of this woman he couldnt mustnt overreact sort of sara conceded voice deliberately lazy he had the impression of her turning very slightly to the window as though listening for something but i havent hated it i quite like you graham really i do but having set out to use you there wasnt a lot else i or stock could do but go on with it maybe i shouldnt even be telling you any of this now maybe i should just have told you not to come here and then not have seen you again but i wanted to tell you the truth she swallowed a couple of times gazed at her hands on the table clasped them still there was that false coldness in her voice he thought as he scratched at the white fleck of paint still she was not really telling the whole truth at all she wanted to see what his reaction would be how the words would affect him he sat there and wondered what he could do what was there to do break down and cry become violent just get up and leave he glanced quickly at her then away she sat looking at him still but somehow tensed looking again he saw what might have been a tic near the edge of her jaw under her right ear a pulse on her neck over the white scar on her upper chest beat rapidly he looked away eyes blinking he could not he would not break down she would not see him cry a furious vicious angry part of him some deep buried kernel of animal hatred wanted to attack her slap and punch that cold white face rape her leave her wrecked and battered reciprocate and outbid her in this awful hurtful game she had suddenly chosen to play the only part he trusted but the part that had got him here now in this situation even if through no fault he could see was equally revolted by the idea of either type of assault to embrace either of the sexually conventional reactions adopt either of those segregated responses was insufficient pointless nor was there a way to stay in the game with he searched for a word inside himself honour that was the only word he could think of though it was too old and tainted too historically misused to be quite what he wanted or meant but in more sense than one it was all he had so this is the truth is it he said still with a sort of halflaugh in his voice as his finger picked at the table dont you believe me she said clearing her throat awkwardly on the first word i believe you i suppose why shouldnt i why should you tell me any of this if it wasnt true she didnt answer he smiled emptily as he watched the finger still trying to lift the stuckdown wisp of dried white paint from the black surface of the table back at the bike the black figure twisted the throttle trying to gun the motor but it stuttered rasped then coughed almost died it ran more smoothly but still not perfectly for a few seconds then hesitated once more missing beats the man kicked the bike then straddled it revving the motor he looked behind him for an opening in the traffic he let the clutch in on first gear and the bike jerked forward then the engine failed dying again the bike trickled forward as horns sounded from the cars and trucks behind the bike revved moved forward but each time the engine tried to take the load it stuttered and the bike slowed fuck it the man shouted into his helmet oh god he used his feet to trundle the bike back in to the kerb again he got off quickly should he walk or run up to half moon crescent well then be there she had said hed laughed they had been planning just how they would remove graham from their private equation ill be there hed assured her no problem shed said kissing him if you are not on time i might resort to plan b he had asked her what that was i give him what he wants shed said then tell him to disappear whereon he had laughed he now thought a little too heartily he got down quickly to his knees took off his gloves and threw them to the pavement opened one of the panniers at the back of the bike and snatched the toolkit out come on stock he said to himself you can do it son he took the small screwdriver out damn bike of all the times to let him down he had been concerned mostly for her sake that she wasnt too hard on graham before he got there she was only supposed to tell him she had decided to stay with stock not hurt the kid too much dangerously much with the truth about the way theyd used him let him down gently wont you hed said shed looked at him calmly for some time then said evenly ill let him down he looked over the top of the bike at a young man with fair hair walking up the far pavement for one heartthumping second he thought it was graham park then saw it wasnt as his gaze dropped to the bike again he caught sight of something odd on the top of the blackpolished petrol tank he looked back again more closely there were fresh scratches on the paint round the chrome petrol filler cap and clusters of small white grains when he tried the cap it lifted easily and would not lock the small white grains felt sticky oh shit he breathed poor graham sara ffitch said smiling jerkily at him letting her head tip slightly to one side as though she was trying to get him to look at her why me graham said and wanted to laugh in spite of it all at the sheer absurdity of what he was saying the falsity of the entire situation the way that because it was like a game and the sort of scene they had doubtless both seen portrayed in this popular culture a thousand times there were only certain things he could say certain viable responses he could make why not sara said i heard about you through slater you sounded like the sort of guy i might be able to charm you know he nodded i know he said a small piece of white paint came away from the surface of the black table lodging under his fingernail i didnt think you would actually fall in love with me but it did make things easier in a way i suppose im sorry for you though i mean i dont think we can go on after this do you no no i think youre right of course he nodded again still not looking at her you dont seem very concerned no he shrugged then shook his head the last piece of paint stuck on the tables surface would not come off he took his hand away glanced at her then sat forward in the seat folding his arms crossing his feet at the ankles as though suddenly cold you just acted it all then he asked not really graham she said he thought he could just make out from the tops of his eyes as he stared at the table her shaking her head i didnt act very much at all i told a few lies but i didnt promise very much i didnt have to pretend very much i did like you i certainly didnt love you but youre quite nice quite sweet he laughed briefly quietly at that last word such faint praise indeed and that certainly did she have to put that in as though trying through every single word and nuance to find a way to hurt him how much damage would she be content with what sort of reaction was she trying to get from him and i loved you i thought you were so he could not finish if he went on he knew he would break down and cry he shook his head and angled his gaze so that she would not see his eyes glisten yes i know sara said sighing artificially it was pretty dirty i know terribly unfair but then who gets what they deserve hmm you bitch he said to her looking up and into her eyes through a film of tears you fucking cow something changed in her face as though the game had become more interesting at last her eyebrows might have risen fraction ally or her tiny smile that twisted look at the side of her mouth have reappeared but whatever it was it struck him with almost physical force he was not proud of the words he knew what they sounded like what the whole setting and implication of them was but he could not help them they were all he had to throw at her well she said slowly this is a bit more like it he stood up his breath forced in and out of him in spasms his eyes drying again but smarting staring at her she sat there and looked up at him quizzically some sudden quickness of interest even fear illuminating the until then cool quiet features what the hell did i ever do to you he said staring at her what gave you the right to do this to me his heart pounded he felt sick he stood there quivering with rage but still still remaining unaffected a small part of him saw this unusual unaccustomed anger within him heard the words he spoke with an amusement a sort of critical appreciation not unlike what he saw in her eyes and read on her face she shrugged swallowed still looking up at him you did nothing to me she said slowly or to stock we had no right of course but what difference does that make does it really make you feel worse she looked at him as though she really was asking a serious question something she could not find the answer to in herself something she had to look to him or somebody like him to answer what do you care he said shaking his head leaning towards her across the table his eyes were bright he could look at her now she gazed back something like fear quickening her widening the hooded eyes he saw the small pulse by the side of her neck again he became aware of the shallow rising and falling of her tshirt inside the olive dungarees he could smell the oil she had put on herself after her bath the clean fresh smell of her she shrugged again shoulders jerking just interested she said you dont have to tell me i just wondered how it felt what the hell are you doing he couldnt stop the words coming out in a gasp couldnt stop the anger the pain from being there what are you trying to why did you have to do it this way oh graham she sighed breath ragged shaking her head i didnt set out to hurt you but when i thought about what i had to tell you how i had to tell you i saw it had to be done in a certain way cant you see she looked at him intent almost desperate you were just too perfect it had to go along certain lines once wed set out i cant really explain it to you you you asked for it she held up one hand as though to catch something he had thrown at her as he opened his mouth to speak yes yes she said i know it does sound terrible its what its what rapists say isnt it but thats the way it was with you graham that was all that gave me the right to do any of this to you thats all you did just be the way you were all you were guilty of was being innocent he stared at her his mouth open he walked round the side of the table she stayed sitting as he approached her the beat of her pulse quickened her hands clasped quickly together on the black circle of the table she stared away at where he had been sitting he went round the back of the seat she sat in to the window and stared out of it so i just go now he said quietly i want you to go yes her voice was thin and sharp do you now he said his voice still low i could he thought throw myself out of the window but it isnt very far to the street and why should i give her another little display of grief and petulance anyway or i could draw these curtains and turn on her hand over mouth throw her across the table tear the clothes off her pin her there and act out another part thats all i could plead temporary jealous madness depending on the judge i could have a very good chance of getting away with it i could say no violence was used just that blunt instrument between the legs just that even blunter instrument between the ears just the ageold violence the ancient cruelty the ultimate obscenity of pleasure joy twisted into pain and hatred yes yes that was it what perfect torture an archetype for all the cunningly designed machines us boys have played with shatter and destroy inside leave no outward trace or bruise she led me on your honour yes she led me on and fuck you your honour ill not do that to her or myself always did think pilate had the right idea wash hands let the mob have its grubby desire slater my brains are in the right place after all he turned round halfexpecting her to be holding a breadknife but she was still sitting there in the seat her back to him hair gathered and bunched id better go then he said and was hopelessly emptily elated that his voice did not shake very much he walked slowly past her down to the carpeted section of the room and took up his portfolio of drawings he thought of leaving them for a moment but he needed the plastic portfolio it would be a pointless gesture to leave it or even remove the drawings he walked out into the hall from the corner of his eye he saw she was not moving she sat in the chair unmoving watching him he let himself out by the thin light inner door went down the stairs and out the front door he walked across to the corner of maygood street and straight up it he almost expected to hear her call him from the window and had already decided not to turn if she did but no sound came and he just kept on walking when she heard the door close beneath and the lock catch and then the sound of his footsteps on the pavement outside sara slumped suddenly puppetslack her head dropping as though in a faint to lie on the sweatslicked surfaces of her forearms near her still clasped hands her eyes stared over the smooth dark surface of the table her breathing slackened and her pulse slowed he gunned the bike again sending it out into the traffic drawing a chorus of horns from behind as the bikes engine hesitated once more he gritted his teeth swore felt sweat dribble inside the black helmet and twisted the throttle again the bikes stuttering engine caught and he surged forward beside a flatdecked beer lorry with a few barrels at the rear of its long load platform he gunned the engine swept round the watneys truck the aluminium barrels at its rear glinting in the sunlight then when he was level with the cab the engine failed again he just got round in front of the lorry then had to slow down the trucks engine sounded loud right behind him the dying engine would not restart he would have to steer back in for the side of the road he waited for a break in the traffic on his left which would let him get to the kerb ignoring the pulsing horn of the watneys truck which he was now holding up the engine spluttered then suddenly caught and ran smoothly again he hissed through his teeth revved it the bike shot forward some shouts came from behind from the cab of the lorry at his back they came to the lights at the junction of pentonville road and upper street he would have to go over the junction and then cut down liverpool road to get to half moon crescent he waited at the lights the beer lorry drew up alongside the driver shouting at him loudly asking him what he was up to he said nothing the lights changed the truck moved off the bikes engine died completely he restarted it roared off after the truck caught it and started to pull in front the lorry driver was keeping his foot on the floor the trucks engine screaming the bike stuttered once again the engine caught failed caught again together the bike and lorry roared up the wide stretch of upper street the beer lorry stopping the bike from pulling in towards liverpool road he saw a hole in the tarmac in front of him and was vaguely aware of people on the pavement waiting for buses as their faces flashed by on the far side of the trucks flat deck the long hole in the road surface ahead of him wasnt too large he could avoid it and the long dark plume of disintegrating tarmac strewn out on its far side he swerved the bike neatly at first it looked as though the lorry with the beer barrels would miss the hole too but it swerved suddenly towards the hole and bike as though avoiding somebody stepping out into the road from the busstop and its wheels went thumping crashing into the ragged trench in the roadway with a huge hollowsounding noise and from the trucks lightly laden suddenly bouncing rear something flew into the air graham walked up the street through the hard sunlight of the late afternoon over penton street and into an area where most of the buildings had been demolished around him were some echoes of buildings rows and corridors of corrugated iron new and zincbright in the sunlight standing on end around empty dusty sites where weeds grew in the distance were old buildings tall crumbling places leaning and twisted worn old slates with many missing roofs bowed under the ancient weight old windows glaucomaed with age eaten timbers making up ramshackle additions to the top storeys new kerbs unmadeup pavements dust and sand he caught glimpses of the empty sites through spaces in the corrugated iron most were flat filled with swirled patterns of rubbish and growing weeds some were being worked on he saw the naked bricks and ragged lengths of concretebottomed trenches which would become foundations lengths of string marked lines and levels for bricks he walked through this summit of iron and dust seeing it but numb to it through the slightly humid air and the sounds of the traffic and sirens through the smells of cement dust and rotting rubbish down to liverpool road and over towards upper street he could only think of what had just happened to him as something he had watched not actually taken part in he could not appreciate it directly he could not cope with it in any personal way on a level which related to what he regarded as his real self it was something too important to be assimilated quickly it was as though some vast besieging army had finally smashed the main gate into a great city and swept in to overwhelm its ruined defences but could do so only through that one point so that while the forces spread throughout the streets and houses and the citys fall was assured already underway for a long time in many places within it there was nothing immediately wrong or affected and life could go on almost as normal when he got down to upper street there was a traffic jam and the flashing blue light of an ambulance waiting somewhere at the busstops people were looking in that direction trying to see over the tops of the other peoples heads edging closer trying to find out what happened he could not go near did not want to see other people he crossed the lanes of stationary traffic waited for a break in the still moving southbound streams crossed to the far side walked past another huge building site where tall cranes stuck into the sky and dust moved in the wind then went down through smaller streets ignoring people clutching the black portfolio to him heading towards some trees he could see richard slater lay in bed with his elder sister the woman graham knew as mrs sara ffitch but whose real name was mrs sarah simpsonwallace nee slater the shared mingled sweat dried on their naked bodies sarah took another kleenex from the box under the bed dabbed at herself then put the soggy tissues in the small splitcane bin at the foot of the bed she got up stretching her arms and shaking her black tangled hair slater watched her he had bruised her again dark blue marks were forming on the tops of her arms and under her buttocks at the top and rear of her thighs he had bitten her too on the white scar where she didnt feel it so much she had whimpered at the time cried out but perhaps because she was relieved she had received no physical retaliation from graham she did not seem to be in a mood to complain today still slater felt guilty anyway he was too rough and despised himself and maybe even her for it he had never been like that with anybody else never even felt like being that way with her he couldnt help it he wanted to be like that he wanted to grip her squeeze her to impale and imprison her to shake and pummel her mark her it was that or it was nothing cold without feeling almost masturbatory why he asked himself for the thousandth time why do i do that to her why do i need to he knew he wasnt like that really it went against everything he believed in so why sarah took a plain blue silk dressing gown from the bottom of the bed and tied it around her she still wore the pink training shoes she had put on after her bath slater sighed he said none of which alters the fact that you shouldnt have done it not without me here sarah shrugged without turning round im going to have some orange juice she said want some sarah what she turned to look at him slater looked at her accusingly she grinned back at him i handled it she said nothing went wrong did it hes bigger than you are he might have got violent he is a man after all dear we chaps are all the same didnt you know he could not resist smiling as he said it luckily you arent all the same at all sarah said and went through the doorway across the hall to the sittingroom and kitchen not at all she said from the other room as she walked not even slightly slater lay on the bed shivering once as his flesh dried he got up and took a piece of paper from the small dressing table by the side of the bed it was an old labour election leaflet blank on one side he took a pen from the inside pocket of his biker leathers strewn on the floor with her dungarees and tshirt then sat up in bed and started to write quickly and in a small scratchy precise hand he wrote dear graham i know what sarah has told you it was not the whole truth im afraid the fact is that i am stock and so once was sarah as ill explain there is no bob stock theres only me sarah is my sister and weve had horror of horrors an incestuous relationship for the past six years or so blame singlesex public schools i say sarah is married and her husband was having her followed i couldnt risk being seen with her so i invented stock i keep the bike in a car park at the back of the air gallery i know somebody who works there and they keep the leathers and crash helmet i dress there and visit sarah using the bike looking terribly butch and incognito so far so good you might think but we needed more it wasnt all that important that sarah was known to be committing adultery but it was important at least until very recently that it wasnt known who with quite apart from the fact that what were doing is reasonably illegal it would have done terrible things to our parents dear dad you see was conservative mp for salop west even you might have heard of him very strong line on family life morality and that son of thing supported the festival of light the national viewers and listeners association mary whitehouses mob and spunk or whatever they call it the society for the prevention of unborn conservatives sick prohanging of course the old bugger having made his reputation peddling this sort of reactionary moralist nonsense the revelation that his two children were humping each other would have finished him that applied at the start of all this but became even more important when mag the hag announced the election anyway going back to where you came in i think youll appreciate that the situation was such that we needed another safeguard to stop me being identified we needed somebody else to draw the heat to distract the chap we knew was trailing sarah we chose you all right i chose you why couldnt we just have stopped seeing each other i hear you ask tried that just not poss sarah got married trying to get out of this whole thing and i moved down here but neither of us could stop thinking about the other just couldnt forget i suppose we must be doomed for each other i think you fell for sarah a bit though being you you made it impossible to tell you could have been craniumoverachilles for the girl and still have given nothing away acting joe cool as usual and if my fucking bike hadnt conked out on me i think some bastard put sugar in the petrol tank we were going to let you down easier i was to appear in the street outside while sarah was explaining to you in the flat that she liked you too much to start anything because she was basically a bad un and she and stock deserved each other well it seemed like a good idea at the time you hustled out the back door as sarah panicked unrequited but smug knowing you were too good for her and her worthless bitch back with the bad guy oh well anyway the elections over as you might have noticed and our father was one of the only two tories to lose their seats in a conservative landslide to a liberal ha ha and hes retiring from politics sarah isnt being followed any more as far as i can tell so the need for most if not all of the subterfuge is gone sorry why protect the old fascist in the first place what can i say that blood is thicker than water maybe but also that if anything had come out about sarah and me it might not only have ruined our father but it would certainly have killed our mum who really isnt a bad sort fuck it we both still love her there family loyalty in other words i dont know well you must admit we were thorough we even arranged for you to see stock when i was there you remember in the pub that was sarah padded out with jeans and jumpers and walking on tiptoe with several dozen of my socks stuffed into the bottoms of my boots i dont know how to sarah came back then with two glasses of orange juice and a large plate with small pieces of bread topped with pate various cheeses and honey here she said putting the plate and one glass down by the side of the bed on the small dressing table what are you writing a letter to graham telling him the whole truth all of it nothing but slater said sarah looked at him without saying anything took a drink from the slim glass she held slater looked at the letter reading his own scrawled lines with a frown on his face you know he said to his sister i really wish i could send this to him if youve told the whole truth you certainly can not hmm i know but i need to write it anyway for me he looked at her i guess im still tense she moved closer to the bed looked down at him you still worried about that crash she said slater put the pen and the paper down on the dressing table he rolled his eyes then put his hands over his face yes yes he said and pushed his fingers through his dark hair staring at the ceiling while she watched him calmly oh god oh doom i just hope they didnt get the number what of the bike she said drinking her orange juice yes of course he shook his head at the ceiling then levered himself back up on one elbow and read over the letter graham would never read what to say next how to finish it off sarah watched for a while then turned away and combed her hair she heard a rustle of paper the clatter of the pen on the dressing table after a while she turned to look at him better she asked putting the comb down slater lay on the bed the paper crumpled in one outstretched hand he shook his head still staring at the ceiling then let the crumpled ball of paper roll out of his hand at the same time he croaked rosebud the paper ball rolled along the floor she smiled kicked the paper with one pinkshoed foot towards the bin she turned and studied herself in the mirror calmly stroking her bruises have you ever slater said entertained the idea that we might be evil i mean that despite the fact youre beautiful and im right that nevertheless for some horrible maybe genetic reason maybe class even we i have never even considered any other explanation sarah said smiling still looking at herself slater laughed he did love her it was all that a brothersister relationship was supposed to be all that people meant when they talked of loving someone like a brother or a sister it was just that but not only that he wanted her at least sometimes at least when he did not hate himself for wanting her in the way he did perhaps it was possible though perhaps he could just love her solely and conventionally as a sister she was worth all that alone after all she could not mean less to him sex was only that surely and indeed with her only more intensemore dangerous in its feel than with others not better worse in fact in its penumbra of guilt and selfdisgust he should he really ought to make an effort let what had happened to graham what they had done to him be a tragic landmark a reason almost at least not let it go to waste sarah went to the old mono record player which stood on a small table on the far side of the bedroom she took her current favourite bowie album his latest and put it on at the start of her favourite track the song which was a single and still in the charts lets dance the title track the stylus scraped into the groove neatly between tracks the old speaker crackled slightly and hissed she turned the volume up put the arm mechanism on to repeat slater lay on the bed turned sideways watching her he forgot about the accident he had helped cause about graham and the hurt he had contributed towards as he watched his sister sway and move in front of the record player the music punched out filling the small room she nodded her head her body moved inside the thin blue silk in time to the first few lyrical bars of the song he felt his desire grow for her again she knew the song well just before bowies voice started just before the words lets dance she turned smiling to her brother put her slender fingers to her shoulders opening the blue silk gown and letting it fall from her collecting in soft folds about the pink trainers as she nodded twice in time to the music and over the first phrase mouthed the words lets fuck and for a moment behind his eyes where he felt he really lived he felt complete despair and the absolute necessity of keeping what he felt away from her of stopping it from showing on his face he seemed to halt then in some frozen moment an expression of feigned delight and surprise impacted on his face as behind it inside him a pain he could not name like his wanting with his wanting arose and overwhelmed him from the notebook of detective sergeant nichols interview with thomas edward pritchard islington police station q what about the bike then did you get its no a o yes i got that bastards no alright it was stk something either i or t t i think dr shawcross mr williams mike as he liked to be called was stevens friend in the hospital he called doctor shawcross doctor shock because he said if you were bad and didnt do what they told you to do they gave you electric shocks mr williams was funny he made steven laugh lots and lots he could be cruel sometimes too like when he had dropped the spiders into the lap of harrytheguy whohatedspiders the other day mr williams had used a long word instead of theguywhohatedspiders but steven couldnt remember what it was that had been cruel especially as they had been at dinner at the time but it had been funny too steven had been blamed for that and they had punished him for it but he couldnt recall what the punishment had been the crows called his name dr shawcross sat in his office staring out of the window at the unleaved trees of the kent countryside watching a few crows flap lazily from tall branches out over the bare brown fields in front of him spread out on his desk was the file on steven grout dr shawcross had to write a report on steven for the insurers of one of the vehicles involved in the accident which had resulted in grout ending up here in the dargate sheltered unit it was february th dr shawcross had already noted the date on the sheet of paper he was going to draft the report on it was cold the car had been very slow to start that morning dr shawcross hummed tunelessly to himself and reached down to the floor where his briefcase was he glanced over the previous reports on grout as his right hand fumbled in the case for his pipe and tobacco he found them put the pipe on his desk and started to stuff the tobacco into the bowl his mind wandered when he saw the date of grouts accident june th last year he sighed summer seemed such a long way away but at the same time there was that paper he had to write for the conference in scarborough in june that would come around soon enough hed be pushed for time on that hed bet steven grout no middle name had been involved in a road traffic accident on june th a beer barrel struck him on the head after bouncing off the back of a lorry grout had fallen into the stream of traffic and been run over by a car his scalp was lacerated skull fractured both clavicles and the left scapula sustained fractures and he had multiple rib fractures as well dr shawcross experienced an odd sensation of deja vu then suddenly recalled that hed read something about the trial of the case which resulted from this accident in the paper just the other day was it yesterday hadnt somebody famous been involved or somebody connected with somebody famous some public figure anyway and some sort of scandal he couldnt remember maybe the paper was still in the house hed check when he got back in the evening if he remembered and liz hadnt thrown the paper out dr shawcross read through the previous reports packing the tobacco into the bowl putting the pipe in his mouth then patting his pockets one by one as he searched for his matches his eyes flitted over the typed sheets as he refreshed his memory only certain important words and phrases really registering cyanosed flail chest intubation raised intracranial bloodpressure and dexamethasone and mannitol pulse slowing blood pressure increase very slow response to deep painful stimulus eyes deviated dysconjugately possible frontal lobe contusion neck angle a tracheostomy was performed dr shawcross tutted to himself pulled open a drawer rummaged briefly found a box of matches he lit his pipe the latest of the reports concerned grout when he was physically more or less recovered and in the rehabilitation ward of a hospital in north london grout had been totally disorientated in time and space the report said he had been capable of holding a conversation but unable to remember any fact for longer than a few minutes no recollection from day to day of the nursing staff who tended him dr shawcross puffed away on his pipe once waving a lock of blue smoke away from his eyes as he read he was supposed to have given up for the new year well at least he didnt smoke in the house nowadays well hardly ever the patient improved only slowly conscious and alert but still disorientated marked impairment of reading ability and memory vague recollections of the distant past now knew he had been brought up in a childrens home but thought the date was june th one phrase kept cropping up time after time in the report as various followup and checkup examinations were recorded and grouts posttraumatic amnesia lengthened little insight into his disability no insight into his disability lack of insight into his condition still no insight into his disability grout was usually quite euphoric always smiling and nodding and giving the thumbsup sign he cooperated fully with physical examinations and seemed anxious to help and cooperate in the memory tests and other examinations of his mental faculties he was asked to undergo but while he felt quite sure he was capable of living by himself and of undertaking any job or career his poor shortterm memory and total lack of drive and initiative made him totally unfit for anything but the sheltered environment he now lived in to that extent he was permanently disabled with little if any chance of any further improvement in his condition dr shawcross nodded to himself that was it all right hed examined steven that morning and the man while quite happy and content had no prospect of leaving the unit in the foreseeable future he was still euphoric though when pressed did admit that his memory wasnt all it had been dr shawcross had asked him if he recalled ever having been on any day trips with the other patients in the unit steven had looked exaggeratedly thoughtful and said that he thought he had been to bournemouth hadnt he dr shawcross knew from the file that steven had been on one day trip but that was only as far as canterbury he told steven a little story which he asked him to try and remember a man in a green coat with bright red hair went for a walk with his dog a terrier in nottingham then he talked to steven about how he had settled into the unit since his arrival in january after about five minutes he had asked steven if he could remember the little story hed told him steven had frowned looked very thoughtful for a while was there something about a bald man he had asked dr shawcross had asked him if he could recall any colours involved in the story steven had creased his brows again was the man wearing a brown jacket he had said dr shawcross had said that sounded like a guess and steven had smiled sheepishly and admitted it was dr shawcrosss mouth made small papping noises as he drew on the pipe he sat back a little in his seat looking out of the window again the sky was full of low grey clouds he wondered if it would snow or rain steven was in his favourite place it was a sort of little tunnel under the raised bank of the railway line which passed along one side of the hospital grounds strictly speaking it was out of bounds but only just the tunnel was only about fifty or sixty feet long but it was nice and dark and secluded because both ends were overgrown with bushes and small trees in the direction that grout sat facing over the naked earth fields and the distant lines of trees over low rolling hills towards the unseen sea the end of the tunnel was barred by a lopsided wooden gate twined round with brambles and long grass steven sat on an iron seat a saddleshaped iron seat which itself sat on a rusty old grassroller with a broken towing bar the broken grassroller was one of many interesting things in the dark damp softearthed tunnel there was an old pale pink plastic bucket with a split bottom four woodwormed fenceposts with three staple nails in each an old car battery with the top bit missing a torn plastic woolworth carrier bag two crushed empty skol lager cans an uncrushed pepsi can various sweet wrappers an old damp matchbox with three dead matches inside a yellowing sheet of paper from the daily express dated tuesday march th and several dozen cigarette ends in various stages of decomposition the grass roller was the best thing though because you could sit on it nice and dry and quite comfortable and you could look out over the mass of undergrowth at the end of the tunnel and see the sky and the trees and the fields crows flew around the trees over the nakedearth fields the crows called out calling his name steven was happy it was cold he wore two tshirts and two pullovers and a parka and he could feel the cold of the iron seat under his bum seeping through to his skin his breath glowed in the dark tunnel and he had to keep his hands in his pockets because hed lost his gloves again but he was happy it was nice to get away now and again even though he quite liked the hospital mr williams made him laugh the tricks he played and the funny things he said they went on day trips sometimes though steven couldnt quite remember where he read a lot important books though their names escaped him just for the moment he used to be happy then unhappy he seemed to recall and looking for things but now he was happy again he had mentioned all this to mr williams about how hed been unhappy and looking for things and mr williams have given him an old big rusty key and a plastic sign which said way out steven kept them in his locker and took them out and looked at them sometimes he had other things in his locker things from before when he had been unhappy they had given him these things he couldnt remember when not at the moment but it would come to him anyway they had given him a radio and an atlas some books and a metal sort of sculpture thing of a lion or a tiger or something he kept them because you werent supposed to throw away things people had given you but he didnt really want them then there were some bits and pieces from games which mr williams had given to him there was a chess piece which looked like a little castle and another which looked like a little horse also some bits of plastic with letters on them and little numbers and other bits of plastic which had spots on one side in the old country house around which the hospital had grown and spread since its foundation after the first world war there was the sheltered units library an old man and an old woman sat in there playing games over an old coffee table mr williams took pieces from their games when they werent looking just for a laugh he would give them the bits back later on of course so it wasnt really stealing but oh it was funny watching them get all upset steven thought mr williams was naughty but he did make him laugh and steven liked to feel trusted and liked being in on mr williamss jokes and secrets it was good the crows called his name again wheeling above the turnedover fields scraps of black against the greyly shining clouds steven smiled and looked round the littered surface of the tunnel floor he leaned down and picked up the matchbox with the three dead matches inside it and turned it over in his hands he heard a train hooter in the distance soon a train would go noisily overhead on the rails on the top of the banking the tunnel ran through steven liked the busy steely noise the trains made over his head it wasnt frightening at all he squinted at the words on the faded cover of the little matchbox mcguffins izen brand matches average contents v steven didnt understand he turned the matchbox over and read a riddle printed on the back he didnt understand that either he read the words out slowly to himself q what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object a the unstoppable force stops the immovable object moves steven shook his head and put the matchbox back down on the ground he shivered it would be time for tea soon dr shawcross scratched behind his left ear with one finger brow furrowed like the ploughed kentish fields he couldnt think of any other way to put it so he wrote finishing the sentence and also the report apart from the summingup euphoric but still totally lacking insight into his disability steven stared at the bright inverted u of light as the train clattered and whined overhead and the little iron seat on top of the grassroller vibrated slightly the crows called his name their hoarse voices not quite drowned by the passing train gerout gerout gerout he was happy tunnel quiss stood on the parapet of the balcony staring down at the white plain beneath his mouth was dry his heart beat quickly he was trembling and a nervous tic jigged at one corner of his mouth as he stood swaying slightly getting ready to jump he was going to kill himself because now he knew the secret of the castle he knew what it was founded on what underlay it he even knew where it was and when the red crow had shown him they had played a game called tunnel which was based on a game called bridge they played two hands each using blank cards trying to make things called tricks the idea was that tunnel was like bridge played underneath the table or in the dark as in spotless dominoes they had to go through the motions of playing the game hoping that eventually they would play one game in such a way that the blank cards which the little games table had ascribed values to new ones for each game would end up displayed on the table in a logical sequence the tricks correctly composed of similarsuit cards the game was over after a thousand days they had done it but they were still undecided what to give as an answer to the riddle they couldnt think of anything they both agreed was a reasonable response quiss didnt care any more it wouldnt make any difference anyway there was only death here death or what the red crow had shown him he looked down at the snow it lay over the jumbled crags of slate far below at the base of the castle it was about a hundred metre drop there would be a lot of wind noise he would feel cold for a while weightless for an instant then nothing he should do it now but he had to prepare himself still ajayi might not be away for very long she had gone looking for books as usual and he didnt want her seeing him there he leaned forward over the drop biting his lip no machinegun this time he thought he had been down in the guts of the place more locked doors the same ancient corridors dimly lit his scullions would not help him find keys for the doors they said they had no influence with the keykeepers they didnt know any of them and if they started to make any inquiries they would be under suspicion immediately they thought the seneschal already knew of their allegiance to quiss and merely tolerated it quiss tried to engage the attendants he met down here deep under the castle in conversation on the odd occasions when he encountered them but they were taciturn unhelpful he thought about knocking one over the head sometime seeing if it had a key which he could steal and use but as soon as he had even hinted he might try this his own scullions had started weeping and begging him not to he and they would be terribly punished if he tried to open the castles doors like that the black minions they said in quivering voices the black minions quiss assumed they were talking about the attendants he had seen only once with the seneschal that one time he had found an open door and the seneschal and the blackrobed minions arrived in the creaking elevator he reluctantly shelved the idea of taking a key by force he walked along the corridor he was in the general area of the door he had found open many many days ago he thought he could just make out a sort of halffelt halfheard thumping noise and suspected he was somewhere near the numbercrunching room dee pee as the snooty attendant had called it the corridor opened out to about twice the crosssection which he regarded as the castles standard a slate bench on one wall faced a row of twelve large stout metalstrapped doors he was weary so he sat down on the bench looking through the gloom at the tall dark doors tired old man a voice said from above him he turned and saw the red crow perched on a peg stuck into the wall high above the slate bench near the vaulted ceiling what are you doing way down here he asked the creature surprised to find it so deep in the castles structure following you the crow said to what do i owe such an honour your stupidity the red crow said stretching its wings as though stiff one of its small eyes glinted in the dim light from the glowing transparent tubes at the apex of the ceiling really he said if the red crow was just insulting him let it if it wanted to talk it would have to start things off he suspected it did want to talk it was here for a good reason yes really the red crow said testily it flapped off the perch on the wall and landed in the middle of the floor facing him it folded its wings a little dust swirled around it you wont listen to reason so im going to have to rub your nose in things are you indeed quiss said coldly he didnt like its tone what things call it truth the red crow said spitting the word out like a lump of gristle what would you know about that quiss scoffed oh quite a lot as youll discover man the red crows voice was calm measured and mocking if you want to that is that depends quiss said frowning at the bird what exactly are we talking about the red crow jerked its head indicating the wall and the doors behind it i can get you in there i can show you what you have been looking for all this time can you really quiss said stalling he wondered if the crow was telling the truth if it was why was it telling him the bird its bright plumage dulled to burgundy by the gloom nodded i can do you want to see behind the doors yes quiss said there was little point in denying it whats the catch ah the red crow said and quiss thought that if the bird could have smiled it would i must have your word on what that i show you what i show you of your own free will that you go willingly on the understanding that without any outside influence from me or anything else you may not desire to come back or may desire to kill yourself you may not of course but if you stay or if you kill yourself you must give me your word you will say that i warned you of this first quiss narrowed his eyes leaned forward on the slate seat putting one elbow on his knees one hand to his lips his chin was rough with stubble you are saying that what you will show me may make me wish to stay behind those doors or may make me desire death in a word moreorless the red crow cackled but you wont use any dirty tricks to influence me no need then i give my word good the red crow said with some satisfaction it flapped once and rose into the air and quiss had the impression that it was done too easily that the wings had not powered the bird at all that it flapped them merely for show the bird turned and flew off down the corridor in the direction quiss had been heading it disappeared round a corner in the dim distance quiss got to his feet wondering if he was supposed to follow the creature he scratched his chin looking at the dozen doors his heart started to beat a little faster what was behind the doors the red crow wanted him and ajayi dead it wanted them to admit defeat and give up their struggle with the riddle that was simply part of its job though it claimed it really did want rid of them anyway because they were boring it knew that quiss knew this so it must be very confident that whatever was behind the doors would have a considerable effect on quiss enough to break him perhaps quiss was nervous keyed up but determined he could take whatever the red crow was going to throw at him whatever it had to show him anything which might help him find the way out of this thing even just give a new angle on his and ajayis plight would be useful besides he suspected the red crow did not know that he had been behind one of those doors once even if only briefly if the revelation beyond that heavy wood and metal strapping had something to with the ceilingholes and the place called dirt then quiss vas already prepared the door nearest quiss clicked he heard a tapping noise and went forward there was a metallined slit in the door which he took to be a handle he pulled on it the door opened slowly smoothly and revealed the red crow hovering in a long corridor lit by small glowing globes fixed to the wall welcome the crow said it turned flew slowly down the long corridor close the door follow me it said quiss did as he was told the bird flew and he walked for about ten minutes the tunnel led down and to the left curving gradually it was quite warm the red crow flew silently about five metres in front of him finally they came to another door similar to the one through which they had entered the tunnel the red crow stopped at it excuse me it said and disappeared through the door quiss was startled he touched the door to make sure it was not a projection it was solid warm it clicked the red crow reappeared over quisss head well open it it said quiss pulled the door towards him he walked with the red crow behind him and over him into a strange place his head swam he felt himself stagger momentarily he blinked his eyes and shook his head he felt at once that he had walked into a place but also out into the open air it was as though he stood on a flat desert floor or the dulled bed of a salt lake but the sky was within touching distance as if some flat layer of clouds had lowered to within a couple of metres of that salt or sandy surface behind him as he turned dizzy looking for a point of reference in the confusing pillared infinity before him was the door they had just come through it was set in a black wall which at first sight seemed straight but which he soon realised was curved pan of a gigantic circle the red crow flapped lazily just overhead watching with amused malevolence as quiss turned again to the space in front of them the floor was smooth slate the ceiling composed of the glass and ironwork and water common to the castles upper storeys slate and iron columns supported the roof which was at the same height it had been in the room quiss had found his way into such a long time ago when he discovered the hole in the glass with the creature over and around it all that was missing in three out of the four directions was a wall it was not bright with only a few of the luminous fish waving lazily over his head and nearby but it was light enough to see that the space he was now in seemed endless quiss peered into the distance but all he could see were pillars and columns growing smaller and smaller in the squeezed twisted depths before him pillars and columns and people human figures stood on small stools or sat in high chairs arms in iron hoops shoulders hard up against the undersurface of the endless glass ceiling some of the things he had thought were pillars or columns at first stunned sight were not they were people with their heads stuck in the ceiling dark shadowy forms above them in the glass surrounding holes in the ceiling like the one he had stuck his own head into briefly in that small room long ago he shook his head again peered again into the distance the narrow space between floor and ceiling vanished all around into a thin line hazed by distance the line looked very slightly curved like a horizon of empty water seen from a ship on a planetary ocean he felt dizzy again his eyes could not accept it his brain took in the short space between floor and ceiling and so expected walls expected a roomspace but if he was in a room and if this was not some sort of projection or even some unsubtle trick with mirrors then its walls appeared to be somewhere over the horizon he turned again carefully trying to recall his early training for the wars which had included balance and disorientation exercises that had left him feeling a bit like he did now and looked again at the black wall just behind him with the metalstrapped door in it he looked along the very slightly curved wall trying to estimate the diameter of the circle it implied it must be several kilometres sufficient to encompass the castle mines and quarries this wall was the castles root its foundation this endless space some sort of vast basement what is this place he said and felt as though he was whispering his brain expected echoes but none came it was like speaking in the open air he looked round at the people stood on stools and slumped in tall chairs as the red crow said lets take a walk follow me and ill tell you it flapped slowly past him and he walked slowly after it he passed near one of the standing figures a man dressed in furs similar to his own but olderlooking the man looked skinny a pipe led from the furs round the mans crotch to a stone jug on the floor they passed him by some movement far in the hazy distance attracted quisss eyes it looked like a small train a narrowgauge railway with a small locomotive on it hauling hopperlike carriages it was difficult to estimate the distance but he guessed it was at least four hundred metres away moving out from the castle away into the thin space of standing people and supporting columns he remembered the train he had seen long ago in the kitchens he looked round trying to estimate the density of people in the place there seemed to be about one person per ten metres square fascinated he stared at them seeing hundreds thousands of them if the density was the same throughout the space he could make out in the dim haze of distance before floor and ceiling seemed to meet then there must be it has no name the red crow said flapping in front of him facing away from him its voice far away technically i believe this is part of the castle it may even be thought of as the basement its voice became a chuckle for a moment i have no idea how large this place is i have flown for ten thousand wingbeats in many directions and not even seen a wall it is all very very uniform apart from a greater concentration of railway lines in the floor what you see here is what you would see anywhere in any part of it there must be many tens of millions of people here with their heads stuck inside the ceiling in these reverse goldfishbowls quiss didnt know what a goldfishbowl was but he thought it best to feign ignorance of what these people were doing with their heads stuck in the ceiling he asked the crow about this there is a type of animal which sits over the hollow glass semisphere the people have their heads inside the red crow said the animal translates thoughts through time each of these people is inside the head of a human being from the past i see quiss said hoping he sounded more blase than the red crow expected the past you say he scratched his chin he still could not believe what his eyes told him he was walking forward not bumping into anything but some part of him still expected to hit a projection screen or wall the red crow turned easily in the air in front of him so that it was now flying backwards something it appeared to do with the same facility with which it flew forwards or smoked a cigar you havent guessed have you it said to him there was a smirk in its voice if not on its expressionless face iron reinforcing bands in the ceiling cast bands of shadow over the slowly flapping red wings guessed what where this is where you are the name of this place where tell me then quiss said and stopped walking the small train had disappeared in the distance he thought he could just hear it though rails singing a whisper of that noise seemed to fill this place like low voices hmm the crow said well you may not have heard of it even at the times of the therapeutic wars the memory was being lost well anyway this is as you might have guessed a planet its name is earth quiss nodded yes that made more sense that what the small attendant had told him in the room he had found his way into dirt indeed that is the name of this place that is where the castle is on earth towards the end of the planets life in a few hundred million more years the sun will become a red giant engulfing the inner planets of its system in the meantime with no moon anymore and having stopped wobbling and spinning with only the castle as far as i know on the surface and all trace of previous civilisations and the species of humankind just weathered away or ground beneath continental plates a billion years ago this is your inheritance mine quiss said he looked about some distance behind him the gentle curvature of the castles basewall was more evident than it had been closer to this the red crow said is one of two fates that wait you if you want you can join these people become one of them dreaming of a past time within the body of whoever they choose billions upon billions of years ago why should i want or not want that you might want it because you do not wish to die now you may not want it because you have what they sometimes call a civilised consciousness you see each of these people has tried and failed to do what you and your ladyfriend are trying and will fail to do escape every one of them all these millions of individuals is a failure each one has given up trying to answer the riddle they were set and while others have chosen oblivion these have chosen to live out what time they have left as parasites in the minds of others in forgotten times they experience what others have experienced they even have the illusion of altering the past so that they seem to exercise free will and apparently influence what their hosts do it is to delay death to turn to something like a drug to turn away from reality to refuse to face ones own defeat i have heard it said that this is better than nothing but the creatures voice trailed off its beady eyes stayed fixed on quiss i see he said well i must say i dont find it all that depressing perhaps you will though later perhaps quiss said and did his best to assume a nonchalant air do i take it that these people have to be fed and that the castle kitchens are as large and as busy as they are because they must cater for them oh well done the red crow said only a little sarcastically yes they run little trains from the kitchens full of soups and gruels to the furthest points of the place wherever those may be some trains get lost for years others never return luckily these failed unfortunates need little in the way of nourishment so the easily kitchens can just about cope though even so they couldnt do it if they didnt mess around with subjective time for all i know this universal basement extends right round the planet and the castle supplies all those people or perhaps there are other castles one does hear rumours well the castle feeds all the people you see at any rate theyre eased out of the headhole and given a bowl to sup from they sit there with empty eyes as though asleep drink or sup then like zombies go back to their own little world again their wastes are taken away in the same trains the red crow cocked its head and its voice sounded almost puzzled but dont you find this all rather sapping this is what awaits you man this is where almost all of them end up and a lot of them were a lot brighter than you ask the seneschal if you like he will confirm what i say very few escape virtually none all the same though like you say quiss said its better than nothing to be a parasite to end up with your head stuck inside some cheap biological time machine i dont believe it i thought more even of you i havent lied to you you know the truth is quite awful enough its not as though these zombies really do influence the people whose brains they inhabit the seneschal might like to pretend that they do that free will increases with time and these people account for the sudden impulses in the primitives they haunt but thats all nonsense the creatures around the holes may make them think that but experiments i have carried out myself indicate quite definitely that only the illusion of this effect exists and anyway which is the more likely explanation i tell you these people are as good as dead theirs is a dreaming death still better than nothing quiss insisted definitely the red crow was silent for some time flapping lazily in front of him hovering there black eyes staring expressionless eventually it said then warrior you have no soul it flew in a semicircle around him heading back for the black wall which was the castles base wed better get back it said ask the seneschal about this place if you like he will be angry but he will not punish you and he cannot punish me ask him the red crow said as it beat back to the curved wall of the roots of the castle doors the castle of bequest anything at all he will confirm that i almost none escape that most end up here or the brave ones the really civilised ones kill themselves they arrived back at the door it was still ajar the red crow flapped at its side as quiss following it back walked past the pillars and columns and dreaming people at the same man in furs on a stool he had looked at earlier he stopped and turned to the red crow saying let me ask you something yes of course you can have a preview the red crow said and started to fly towards him theres an empty oh no quiss said shaking his head looking at the bird as it stopped near him quiss nodded at the skinny man in the furs with his head stuck in the glass ceiling i was just wondering if you knew anything about him say whats his name how longs he been here what the red crow said sounding a little confused even upset quiss concealed the thrill of triumph which shivered through him him the red crow fluttered a little closer oh hes been here for ages it said its voice recovering its usual composure names godot goriot gerrut something like that the records arent perfect you know an odd case listen are you sure you dont want to see what its like i can show you where no quiss said firmly and walked smartly to the door leading back to the castle im not interested lets go back now and he had gone to the seneschal who in the kitchens clamour had confirmed most of what the red crow had said so the seneschal had said obviously annoyed you have seen your most likely fate what of it what am i supposed to do about it just think yourself lucky you didnt take the red crow up on its offer once youre in one of those things properly you dont come out of your own free will too beguiling if somebody doesnt come to get you out you stay there tapping every form of human excitement by the time your belly rumbles youre hooked you come out for food and its just a grey dream compared to what you have just left thats what the bird was up to it would have shown you the free ceilingport down there then just have left you and dont trust it on free will either the ceilingports allow full control of the primitives minds everything can be altered every mind contains its own universe we can be sure of nothing that is all i have to say if you want to enter officially that place which you have already seen informally file a notice of surrender with me through the proper channels now go away please the seneschal had scowled and gone back up the rickety wooden steps to his office away from the continuing chaos of the kitchens quiss had gone back to the games room his old legs quite exhausted by the time he got back he said nothing to ajayi he stood on the parapet of the balcony yes the red crow had been right it did not know it it could never have been sure it had probably only dwelled on the awfulness of the dreamers fate to bluff him into trying the experience out so that it could leave him there but it had been right nevertheless about the eventual effect of its revelation the thought of that low limitless space beneath the castle had filled quisss thoughts and more importantly his dreams for almost a hundred days and nights since a deep dark depression had settled on him weighing him down like some heavy suit of armour he felt like some warrior chainmailed stumbling into quicksand he could not keep his mind from dwelling on what he had seen on the sheer extent of the place beneath them that impression of claustrophobic infinity so many people so many failed hopes lost games surrendered dreams and the castle a single island of warped chance in a frozen ocean of missed opportunities that bright beguiling image he had held on to all these days of those brown arms that blue sky the single shining line of contrail it returned only to hurt him now taunt him in his dreams in that deep dark echoless and echofilled space far beneath him his mind was already lost sideless wallless the place bottomless his despair his hope his determination once so fierce so furious and powerful and energetic had ground to a halt rusted up seized the castles doing that was its effect on those within it as well as on itself to grind down to slowly slowly abrade and at the same time fuse wearing away and seizing up at once like sandladen water in some huge engine he felt like that now he felt like some grain of sand inside the place no more important he stared down at the crags and snow far below him rocked once back and forward on his feet felt himself tremble his jaw wanted to shake but he clenched his teeth the wind gusted swaying him cold as a glacier he thought smiling grimly a slowflowing glacier a fit image to take to his death he thought and remembered the room of flowed glass the final straw which had eventually followed the red crows revelation that had been the real trigger that was why he really stood here it was a room he had discovered just that day on one of his now infrequent walks he had wandered lost as usual then he had come to a room inside the thick walls where the wind blew in and snow heaped on the glass floor under the windows in the window spaces there were the remains of metal frames he noticed this as he went to the aperture to look out and so get his bearings from the landscape beyond he should see the slate mines if his sense of direction was right but it had been failing him with increasing frequency lately something like clear tar had flowed from the almost empty frames where only a thin edge of glass lay in the bottom of each hexagon of the metal frames the glass under his feet was dark he looked out of the windows eyes narrowed against the cold funnelled wind moaning quietly through the deep slit the floor sloped slightly up to the windows clear stuff like ice stuck to the walls under the windows he stooped grunting with effort to examine it finally got down stiffly to his knees scraping at the floor there was a slate floor just underneath the thin covering of glass he tapped at the clear stuff still in the window frames above then ran one finger down from the glass still in the frames over the sill down over the clear flow on the walls until finally his finger slid all the way down without a flaw crack or join registering under his fingertip to the floor the glass in the bottom of the frames on the narrow sill on the walls under the windows and on the floor of the room was joined it was all one he stayed kneeling and let his hands rest in his sloped lap he stared ahead he recalled from when he could not remember that glass ordinary glass made from sand was theoretically a liquid that in old buildings very sensitive measuring equipment could detect a significant thinning at the top of the pane and a corresponding thickening at the bottom of the sheet as the glass gradually gave in to the incessant pull of gravity in the castle of bequest in places at least the process had simply had time to go further the glass had flowed was still flowing from the frame over the sill down the wall to the floor he knelt realised this and after a little while to his own astonishment he started to cry the mines anyway had not been visible from the windows he had wandered again mind blank until he found himself back where he had started in the empty games room he had made for the balcony almost automatically then stopped to think vaguely almost innocently surprised at the ease with which he was suddenly able to accept his own death even desire it and thinking there was nothing so he had climbed up onto the cold stone parapet now he knew what the red crow had meant by soul and that areligious quality of irreducible character that selfness would now articulate its most profound selfstatement in its own destruction quiss closed his eyes leaned forward into space arms closed around his waist he was pulled back he opened his eyes to see the sky tipping the wall of the castle above the balcony slanting over him as he fell ajayi gasped as they thumped together onto the slate of the balcony floor quiss rolled over into the warmth of the games room banging his head on the glass floor he looked up dazed to see ajayi lying on the floor of the balcony itself her chest heaving her eyes wide and staring at him she was picking herself up quiss he scrambled to his feet drew back his hand and hit her hard across the face knocking her to the ground again leave me alone he shouted why cant you leave me alone he screamed he bent down and picked her up her mouth was bleeding her face was white she cried out and put her hands up in front of her face to protect herself he threw her into the games room and she staggered across the floor tripped on some fallen books and went sprawling he went after her you just cant leave me alone can you he sobbed his eyes were filling with tears his hands and arms shook he bent and picked the woman off the floor again she brought her hands up her eyes tightly screwed up face grimacing he slapped her and she cried out again falling to the floor as he let her go he drew back his foot to kick her as she lay curled up on he glass floor hands over her head crying he saw the games table not far away with the pack of cards lying on it he didnt kick the woman but stamped over to the small table got hold of it by two of its legs took it over to the woman then as she looked up eyes wide with fear he raised the table over his head she cringed cowered hands over her head again the cards fluttered down he swung the table down into the glass floor near her head shattering the table and smashing a network of cracks a jagged metre in diameter on the floors transparent surface the table disintegrated the small red jewel at its centre broke into a thousand pieces a tracery of shining filaments burst from the tables intricate surface sparking and spitting for a second then smoking and going dull and the solid legs of the table sprang open cracking and revealing tightly compressed pages with print on them quiss kicked the debris then turned away covering his eyes with his hands and sobbing he stumbled off into the back of the room away from the balcony ajayi looked up over the remains of the shattered table and saw quiss bump into the wall by the windingstair he staggered down the first few steps and disappeared she breathed again dabbed at her split lip with the hem of her furs she sat up properly on the glass surface moving away from where a thin pool of warm salty water was spreading from the cracks where the table had hit she was trembling she looked at what was left of the table well they had played their last game they had been left in no doubt about that no table no valid games so they had just their one unused answer left she tried to think calmly wondering what had made quiss want to kill himself she didnt know he had been increasingly morose recently but would not talk about the reasons if there were any she had hoped he would come out of it he had been depressed before as had she but for the last hundred days there had been a special sort of despair about him and he had just kept on going downhill unwilling to talk about it or be cheered up perhaps she shouldnt have left him alone just now but what could she do if he was determined to kill himself there was nothing she could really do about it it was his life it was his right maybe she was just being selfish she stood up shakily she was a little dazed and she hurt in a variety of places well nothing was broken that was something to be thankful for she noticed that the legs of the small table had been made out of books a couple of them had torn covers and pages bits of them were still stuck to the veneer of wood which had covered them when they were still part of the table there had been one or two books making up each of the three legs the books were written in english titus groan she read talking softly to herself the castle labyrinths the trial and another book which had the title page missing she glanced over the torn remains of the first page instead and frowned she looked at the other books she held this was interesting she had been looking for a couple of them having read about them in some of the literary guides and commentaries which she was using to select which books she ought to read they hadnt been in the places in the castle where she had expected to find them perhaps it was significant that they had turned up instead inside the games table she looked again at the book with no title page she decided she would read this nameless book first anyway it might help calm her down take her mind off things yes she thought as she walked over to her stool she would read this one first then the others she would just have to hope quiss would be all right they still had that last answer to come up with she sat down she started reading after all what else was there to do the story began he walked through the white corridors part six truth and consequences the trees stood around the canal where it appeared out of the tunnel under the hill he had just walked over graham went through a small gate and down a path to the old towpath through grass and flowers some distant part of his mind seemed to whisper to him that he had followed the line of the tunnel over the hill that he had walked from the house in half moon crescent which was over the tunnel to here its mouth a sudden quite physical pain made his guts constrict as he remembered the day he had stood in the street talking up to her about secret passages down to the tunnel he shook his head to dislodge the thought he found that he had to breathe deeply more deeply than he had been to clear his head and quell his stomach he stood on one bank of the canal looking over to the far side and the bank of grass there over the calm still water he listened to the distant noises of the traffic another wailing siren perhaps the ambulance he had seen he looked around for a place to sit and walked along the path a little way until he came to a place where some tarmac had been scattered and there were black drops of what looked like dried blood lying on the dusty surface of the towpath flies buzzed in the grass he saw a magazine lying torn he looked more closely at it saw a womans buttocks over a pair of hairy knees the womans bottom was reddened slightly there was a hand poised too obviously posed not in motion over her a small breeze ruffled the pages of the magazine for him as he looked as obligingly as any hollywood windmachine stripping a calendar between scenes the pictures in the rest of the magazine were almost all identical he turned away disgusted with something other than the pathetic but relatively harmless fetish of the magazine and saw a flurry of flies swirl into the air from something dark in the grass it looked like an animals leg he closed his eyes willing tears to come some final part of him giving in only now wanting the surrender to animal emotion which until now he had fought against but as he stood there he could feel no tears coming only a son of resigned ugly bitterness a comprehensive revulsion for everything around him for all the people and their artefacts and thoughts all their stupid ways and pointless aims he opened his smarting eyes blinking angrily here it was this was what it all really meant here was your civilisation your billion years of evolution right here a soiled and tattered wankingmag and chopped domestic animal sex and violence writ small like all our standard fantasies the pain in his belly which had afflicted him earlier returned sharp and fierce as a rusty blade it swelled in him then like some wildfire cancer a rapid disgust a total allergy syndrome directed at everything around him at the filthy eviscerated mundanity of it all the sheer crawling awfulness of existence all the lies and the pain the legalized murder the privileged theft the genocides and the hatreds and the stupefying human cruelties all the starveling beauty of the burgeoning poor and the crippled in body and brain all the lifedefying squalor of the cities and the camps all the sweltering frenetics of the creeds and the faiths all the torturingly ingenious carefully civilised savagery of the technology of pain and the economies of greed all the hollow ringing bullshitting words used to justify and explain the utter howling grief of our own cruelty and stupidity it piled on him in him like a weight of atmosphere that awful mass of air above for those moments no longer balanced by a pressure within so that he felt at once crushed smashed inside but swollen too bursting with the sickening burden of a cheap and tumid revelation he turned towards the canal his belly like a lump of lead inside him his tongue felt swollen there was a thickness in his throat and his tongue that instrument of articulation felt like a great poisoned sac some gland caught full of all the bodys wastes and debris tight with putrid volume ripe as any bloated carcase he fought the urge to heave tried to ignore his trembling guts he took his portfolio and by the side of the canal he opened it and drew out the large sheets of paper inside they were drawings of her face done in hundreds of small lines to make a maze within them all carefully penned in thin black india ink he thought still even now that they were the best work he had ever done he looked at them swaying as he stood feeling sick sick to the stomach sick to the brain then one by one he dropped the drawings into the slack limp waters of the dark canal they slipped and sideslipped through the air some falling together some landing all by themselves some landing face up and some face down some obscured by others some gazing up at the clear sky or down into the cloudy water he watched as the water penetrated them making the ink run blackly over the many versions of her face while the slow current of the canal gradually took them moved them swept them away from him towards the mouth of the tunnel back under the hill and the houses and the distant traffic he watched them go standing there less sick now the pain in his guts still there his eyes unable to cry then he zipped the portfolio up again he was about to go then he changed his mind he went back to the grass bank picked the spanking magazine up threw it into the canal too then waved the flies away from the bloody stump of black and white furred leg picked it up by one still protruding claw and slung it in the water as well he watched it all float towards the tunnel mouth the great flat rectangles of paper like blackstained leaves from some strange winter tree the magazine like some dead bird its spine sunk pages like limp wings the barely floating stump of leg a couple of determined flies still hovering over it then he kicked the bloodspotted dust off the towpath sending it into the canal stones sinking dust coating the water and as the dust floated in the air and on the water and settled slowly on the path again he walked off away down the canalside back up towards the little gate towards the city again end
