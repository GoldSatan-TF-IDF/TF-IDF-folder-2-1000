to commit nearly any crime by computer you could even kill a person using a computer a los angeles police department officer chapter one the battered white van had made her uneasy lara gibson sat at the bar of vestas grill on de anza in cupertino california gripping the cold stem of her martini glass and ignoring the two young chipjocks standing nearby casting flirtatious glances at her she looked outside again into the overcast drizzle and saw no sign of the windowless econoline that she believed had followed her from her house a few miles away to the restaurant lara slid off the bar stool and walked to the window glanced outside the van wasnt in the restaurants parking lot nor was it across the street in the apple computer lot or the one next to it belonging to sun microsystems either of those lots wouldve been a logical place to park to keep an eye on her if the driver had in fact been stalking her no the van was just a coincidence she decided a coincidence aggravated by a splinter of paranoia she returned to the bar and glanced at the two young men who were alternately ignoring her and offering subtle smiles like nearly all the young men here for happy hour they were in casual slacks and tieless dress shirts and wore the ubiquitous insignia of silicon valley corporate identification badges on thin canvas lanyards around their necks these two sported the blue cards of sun microsystems other squadrons represented here were compaq hewlettpackard and apple not to mention a slew of new kids on the block startup internet companies which were held in some disdain by the venerable valley regulars at thirtytwo lara gibson was probably five years older than her two admirers and as a selfemployed businesswoman who wasnt a geek connected with a computer company she was easily five times poorer but that didnt matter to these two men who were already captivated by her exotic intense face surrounded by a tangle of raven hair her ankle boots a redandorange gypsy skirt and a black sleeveless top that showed off hardearned biceps she figured that it would be two minutes before one of these boys approached her and she missed that estimate by only ten seconds the young man gave her a variation of a line shed heard a dozen times before excuse me dont mean to interrupt but hey would you like me to break your boyfriends leg for making a beautiful woman wait alone in a bar and by the way can i buy you a drink while you decide which kneecap another woman might have gotten mad another woman might have stammered and blushed and looked uneasy or might have flirted back and let him buy her an unwanted drink because she didnt have the wherewithal to handle the situation but those would be women weaker than she lara gibson was the queen of urban protection as the san francisco chronicle had once dubbed her she fixed her eyes on the mans gave a formal smile and said i dont care for any company right now simple as that end of conversation he blinked at her frankness avoided her staunch eyes and returned to his friend power it was all about power she sipped her drink in fact that damn white van had brought to mind all the rules shed developed as someone who taught women to protect themselves in todays society several times on the way to the restaurant shed glanced into her rearview mirror and noticed the van thirty or forty feet behind it had been driven by some kid he was white but his hair was knotted into messy brown dreadlocks he wore combat fatigues and despite the overcast and misty rain sunglasses this was of course silicon valley home of slackers and hackers and it wasnt unusual to stop in starbucks for a venti skim latte and be waited on by a polite teenager with a dozen body piercings a shaved head and an outfit like innercity gangstas still the driver had seemed to stare at her with an eerie hostility lara found herself absently fondling the can of pepper spray she kept in her purse another glance out the window no van only fancy cars bought with dotcom money a look around the room only harmless geeks relax she told herself and sipped her potent martini she glanced at the wall clock quarter after seven sandy was fifteen minutes late not like her lara pulled out her cell phone but the display read no service she was about to find the pay phone when she glanced up and saw a young man enter the bar and wave at her she knew him from somewhere but couldnt quite place him his trim but long blond hair and the goatee had stuck in her mind he wore white jeans and a rumpled blue work shirt his concession to the fact he was part of corporate america was a tie as befit a silicon valley businessman though the design wasnt stripes or jerry garcia flowers but a cartoon tweety bird hey lara he walked up and shook her hand leaned against the bar remember me im will randolph sandy s cousin cheryl and i met you on nantucket at fred and marys wedding right thats where she recognized him from he and his pregnant wife sat at the same table with lara and her boyfriend hank sure how you doing good busy but who isnt around here his plastic neckwear read xerox corporation parc she was impressed even nongeeks knew about xeroxs legendary palo alto research center five or six miles north of here will flagged down the bartender and ordered a light beer hows hank he asked sandy said he was trying to get a job at wells fargo oh yeah that came through hes at orientation down in la right now the beer came and will sipped congratulations a flash of white in the parking lot lara looked toward it quickly alarmed but the vehicle turned out to be a white ford explorer with a young couple inside her eyes focused past the ford and scanned the street and the parking lots again recalling that on the way here shed glanced at the side of the van as it passed her when shed turned into the restaurants parking lot thered been a smear of something dark and reddish on the side probably mud but shed thought it almost looked like blood you okay will asked sure sorry she turned back to him glad she had an ally another of her urban protection rules two people are always better than one lara now modified that by adding even if one of them is a skinny geek who cant be more than five feet ten inches tall and is wearing a cartoon tie will continued sandy called me on my way home and asked if id stop by and give you a message she tried to call you but couldnt get through on your cell shes running late and asked if you could meet her at that place next to her office where you went last month ciros in mountain view she made a reservation at eight you didnt have to come by she couldve called the bartender she wanted me to give you the pictures i took at the wedding you two can look at em tonight and tell me if you want any copies will noticed a friend across the bar and waved silicon valley may contain hundreds of square miles but its really just a small town he said to lara cheryl and i were going to bring the pictures this weekend to sandy s place in santa barbara yeah were going down on friday will paused and smiled as if he had a huge secret to share he pulled his wallet out and flipped it open to a picture of himself his wife and a very tiny ruddy baby last week he said proudly claire oh adorable lara whispered so well be staying pretty close to home for a while hows cheryl fine babys fine theres nothing like it but ill tell you being a father totally changes your life im sure it does lara glanced at the clock again seventhirty it was a halfhour drive to giros this time of night i better get going then with a thud of alarm she thought again about the van and the driver the dreadlocks the rusty smear on the battered door will gestured for the check and paid you dont have to do that she said ill get it he laughed you already did what that mutual fund you told me about at the wedding the one youd just bought lara remembered shamelessly bragging about a biotech fund that had zoomed up percent last year i got home from nantucket and bought a shitload of it so thanks he tipped the beer toward her then he stood you all set you bet lara stared uneasily at the door as they walked toward it it was just paranoia she told herself she thought momentarily as she did from time to time that she should get a real job like all of these people in the bar she shouldnt dwell so much on the world of violence sure just paranoia but if so then why had the dreadlocked kid sped off so fast when shed pulled into the parking lot here and glanced at him will stepped outside and opened his umbrella he held it up for both of them to use lara recalled another rule of urban protection never feel too embarrassed or proud to ask for help and yet as lara was about to ask will randolph to walk her to her car after they got the snapshots she had a thought if the kid in the van really was a threat wasnt it selfish of her to ask him to endanger himself here he was a husband and new father with other people depending on him it seemed unfair to something wrong will asked not really you sure he persisted well i think somebody followed me here to the restaurant some kid will looked around you see him not now he asked you have that web site right about how women can protect themselves thats right you think he knows about it maybe hes harassing you could be youd be surprised at the hate mail i get he reached for his cell phone you want to call the police she debated never feel too embarrassed or proud to ask for help no no just would you mind after we get the pictures walking me to my car will smiled of course not i dont exactly know karate but i can yell for help with the best of them she laughed thanks they walked along the sidewalk in front of the restaurant and she checked out the cars as in every parking lot in silicon valley there were dozens of saabs bmws and lexuses no vans though no kids no bloody smears will nodded toward where hed parked in the back lot he said you see him no they walked past a stand of juniper and toward his car a spotless silver jaguar jesus did everybody in silicon valley have money except her he dug the keys out of his pocket they walked to the trunk i only took two rolls at the wedding but some of them are pretty good he opened the trunk and paused and then looked around the parking lot she did too it was completely deserted his was the only car there will glanced at her you were probably wondering about the dreads dreads yeah he said the dreadlocks his voice was flatter distracted he was still smiling but his face was different now it seemed hungry what do you mean she asked calmly but fear was detonating inside her she noticed a chain was blocking the entrance to the back parking lot and she knew hed hooked it after hed pulled in to make sure nobody else could park there it was a wig oh jesus my lord thought lara gibson who hadnt prayed in twenty years he looked into her eyes recording her fear i parked the jag here a while ago then stole the van and followed you from home with the combat jacket and wig on you know just so youd get edgy and paranoid and want me to stay close i know all your rules that urban protection stuff never go into a deserted parking lot with a man married men with children are safer than single men and my family portrait in my wallet i hacked it together from a picture in parents magazine she whispered hopelessly youre not sandy s cousin dont even know him i picked will randolph because hes somebody you sort of know who sort of looks like me i mean theres no way in the world i couldve gotten you out here alone if you hadnt known me or thought you did oh you can take your hand out of your purse he held up the canister of pepper spray i got it when we were walking outside but sobbing now shoulders slumped in hopelessness who are you you dont even know me not true lara he whispered studying her anguish the way an imperious chess master examines his defeated opponents face i know everything about you everything in the world chapter two slowly slowly dont damage them dont break them one by one the tiny screws eased from the black plastic housing of the small radio and fell into the young mans long exceedingly muscular fingers once he nearly stripped the minuscule threads of one screw and had to stop sit back in his chair and gaze out his small window at the overcast sky blanketing santa clara county until hed relaxed the time was eight am and hed been at this arduous task for over two hours finally all twelve screws securing the radio housing were removed and placed on the sticky side of a yellow postit wyatt gillette removed the chassis of the samsung and studied it his curiosity as always plunged forward like a racehorse he wondered why the designers had allowed this amount of space between the boards why the tuner used string of this particular gauge what the proportion of metals in the solder was maybe this was the optimal design but maybe not maybe the engineers had been lazy or distracted was there a better way to build the radio he continued dismantling it unscrewing the circuit boards themselves slowly slowly at twentynine wyatt gillette had the hollow face of a man who was six feet one inch tall and weighed pounds a man about whom people were always thinking somebody should fatten him up his hair was dark nearly black and hadnt been recently trimmed or washed on his right arm was a clumsy tattoo of a seagull flying over a palm tree faded blue jeans and a gray work shirt hung loosely on him he shivered in the chill spring air a tremor made his fingers jerk and he stripped the slot in the head of one tiny screw he sighed in frustration as talented mechanically as gillette was without the proper equipment you can only do so much and he was now using a screwdriver hed made from a paper clip he had no tools other than it and his fingernails even a razor blade would have been more efficient but that was something not to be found here in gillettes temporary home the mediumsecurity federal mens correctional facility in san jose california slowly slowly once the circuit board was dismantled he located the holy grail hed been after a small gray transistor and he bent its tiny wires until they fatigued he then mounted the transistor to the small circuit board hed been working on for months carefully twining together the wire leads just as he finished a door slammed nearby and footsteps sounded in the corridor gillette looked up alarmed someone was coming to his cell oh christ no he thought the footsteps were about twenty feet away he slipped the circuit board hed been working on into a copy of wired magazine and shoved the components back into the housing of the radio he set it against the wall he lay back on the cot and began flipping through another magazine the hacking journal praying to the generalpurpose god that even atheist prisoners start bargaining with soon after they land in jail please let them not roust me and if they do please let them not find the circuit board the guard looked through the peephole and said position gillette the inmate stood and stepped to the back of the room hands on his head the guard entered the small dim cell but this wasnt as it turned out a roust the man didnt even look around the cell he silently shackled gillettes hands in front of him and led him out the door at the intersection of hallways where the administrative seclusion wing ran into the general population wing the guard turned and led his prisoner down a corridor that wasnt familiar to gillette the sounds of music and shouts from the exercise yard faded and in a few minutes he was directed into a small room furnished with a table and two benches both bolted to the floor there were rings on the table for an inmates shackles though the guard didnt hook gillettes to them sit down gillette did the guard left and the door slammed leaving gillette alone with his curiosity and itchy desire to get back to his circuit board he sat shivering in the windowless room which seemed to be less a place in the real world than a scene from a computer game one set in medieval times this cell he decided was the chamber where the bodies of heretics broken on the rack were left to await the high executioners axe thomas frederick anderson was a man of many names tom or tommy in his grade school days a dozen handles like stealth and crypto when hed been a high school student in menlo park california running bulletin boards and hacking on trashs and commodores and apples hed been tf when hed worked for the security departments of at t and sprint and cellular one tracking down hackers and phone phreaks and call jackers the initials colleagues decided stood for tenacious fucker in light of his percent success record in helping the cops catch the perps as a young police detective in san jose hed had another series of names hed been known as courtney or lonelygirl or brittanyt in online chat rooms where in the personas of fourteenyearold girls hed written awkward messages to pedophiles who would email seductive propositions to these fictional dream girls and then drive to suburban shopping malls for romantic liaisons only to find that their dates were in fact a halfdozen cops armed with a warrant and guns nowadays he was usually called either dr anderson when introduced at computer conferences or just plain andy in official records though he was lieutenant thomas f anderson chief of the california state police computer crimes unit the lanky man fortyfive years old with thinning curly brown hair now walked down a chill damp corridor beside the pudgy warden of the san jose correctional facility san ho as it was called by perps and cops alike a solidly built latino guard accompanied them they continued down the hallway until they came to a door the warden nodded the guard opened it and anderson stepped inside eyeing the prisoner wyatt gillette was very pale he had a hacker tan as the pallor was ironically called and quite thin his hair was filthy as were his fingernails gillette apparently hadnt showered or shaved in days the cop noticed an odd look in gillettes dark brown eyes he was blinking in recognition he asked youre are you andy anderson thats detective anderson the warden corrected his voice a whip crack you run the states computer crimes division gillette said you know me i heard you lecture at comsec a couple of years ago the comsec conference on computer and network security was limited to documented security professionals and law enforcers it was closed to outsiders anderson knew it was a national pastime for young hackers to try to crack into the registration computer and issue themselves admission badges only two or three had ever been able to do so in the history of the conference howd you get in gillette shrugged i found a badge somebody dropped anderson nodded skeptically whatd you think of my lecture i agree with you silicon chipsll be outmoded faster than most people think computersll be running on molecular electronics and that means usersll have to start looking at a whole new way to protect themselves against hackers nobody else felt that way at the conference they heckled you gillette recalled but you didnt no i took notes the warden leaned against the wall while the cop sat down across from gillette and said youve got one year left on a threeyear sentence under the federal computer fraud and abuse act you cracked western softwares machines and stole the source codes for most of their programs right gillette nodded the source code is the brains and heart of software fiercely guarded by its owner stealing it lets the thief easily strip out identification and security codes then repackage the software and sell it under his own name western softwares source codes for the companys games business applications and utilities were its main assets if an unscrupulous hacker had stolen the codes he might have put the billiondollar company out of business gillette pointed out i didnt do anything with the codes i erased them after i downloaded them then whyd you crack their systems the hacker shrugged i saw the head of the company on cnn or something he said nobody could get into their network their security systems were foolproof i wanted to see if that was true were they as a matter of fact yeah they were foolproof the problem is that you dont have to protect yourself against fools you have to protect yourself against people like me well once youd broken in why didnt you tell the company about the security flaws do a white hat white hats were hackers who cracked into computer systems and then pointed out the security flaws to their victims sometimes for the glory of it sometimes for money sometimes even because they thought it was the right thing to do gillette shrugged its their problem that guy said that it couldnt be done i just wanted to see if i could why another shrug curious whyd the feds come down on you so hard anderson asked if a hacker doesnt disrupt business or try to sell what he steals the fbi rarely even investigates let alone refers a case to the us attorney it was the warden who answered the reason is the dod department of defense anderson asked glancing at a gaudy tattoo on gillettes arm was that an airplane no it was a bird of some kind its bogus gillette muttered complete bullshit the cop looked at the warden who explained the pentagon thinks he wrote some program or something that cracked the dods latest encryption software their standard anderson gave a laugh youd need a dozen supercomputers running full time for six months to crack a single email standard had recently replaced des the defense encryption standard as the stateoftheart encryption software for the government it was used to encrypt secret data and messages the encryption program was so important to national security that it was considered a munition under the export laws and couldnt be transferred overseas without military approval anderson continued but even if he did crack something encoded with standard so what everybody tries to crack encryptions there was nothing illegal about this as long as the encrypted document wasnt classified or stolen in fact many software manufacturers dare people to try to break documents encrypted with their programs and offer prizes to anybody who can do so no gillette explained the dods saying that i cracked into their computer found out something about how standard works and then wrote some script that decrypts the document it can do it in seconds impossible anderson said laughing cant be done gillette said thats what i told them they didnt believe me yet as anderson studied the mans quick eyes hollow beneath dark brows hands fidgeting impatiently in front of him he wondered if maybe the hacker actually had written a magic program like this anderson himself couldnt have done it he didnt know anybody who could but after all the cop was here now hat in hand because gillette was a wizard the term used by hackers to describe those among them whove reached the highest levels of skill in the machine world there was a knock on the door and the guard let two men inside the first one fortyish had a lean face dark blond hair swept back and frozen in place with hairspray honesttogod sideburns too he wore a cheap gray suit his overwashed white shirt was far too big for him and was halfway untucked he glanced at gillette without a splinter of interest sir he said to the warden in a flat voice im detective frank bishop state police homicide he nodded an anemic greeting to anderson and fell silent the second man a little younger much heavier shook the wardens hand then anderson s detective bob shelton his face was pockmarked from childhood acne anderson didnt know anything about shelton but hed talked to bishop and had mixed feelings concerning his involvement in the case anderson was here about bishop was supposedly a wizard in his own right though his expertise lay in tracking down killers and rapists in hardscrabble neighborhoods like the oakland waterfront haightashbury and the infamous san francisco tenderloin computer crimes wasnt authorized or equipped to run a homicide like this one without somebody from the violent crimes detail but after several brief phone discussions with bishop anderson was not impressed the homicide cop seemed humorless and distracted and more troubling knew zero about computers anderson had also heard that bishop himself didnt even want to be working with computer crimes hed been lobbying for the marinkill case so named by the fbi for the site of the crime several days ago three bank robbers had murdered two bystanders and a cop at a bank of america branch in sausalito in marin county and had been seen headed east which meant they might very well turn south toward bishops present turf the san jose area now in fact the first thing bishop did was to check the screen of his cell phone presumably to see if he had a page or message about a reassignment anderson said to the detectives you gentlemen want to sit down nodding at the benches around the metal table bishop shook his head and remained standing he tucked his shirt in then crossed his arms shelton sat down next to gillette then the bulky cop looked distastefully at the prisoner and got up sat on the other side of the table to gillette he muttered you might want to wash up sometime the convict retorted you might want to ask the warden why i only get one shower a week because wyatt the warden said patiently you broke the prison rules thats why youre in administrative seclusion anderson didnt have the patience or time for squabbles he said to gillette weve got a problem and were hoping youll help us with it he glanced at bishop and asked you want to brief him according to state police protocol frank bishop was technically in charge of the case but the detective shook his head no sir you can go ahead last night a woman was abducted from a restaurant in cupertino she was murdered and her body found in portola valley shed been stabbed to death she wasnt sexually molested and theres no apparent motive now the victim lara gibson ran this web site about how women can protect themselves and gave lectures on the subject around the country shed been in the press a lot and was on larry king well what happens is shes in a bar and this guy comes in who seems to know her he gives his name as will randolph the bartender said thats the name of the cousin of the woman the victim was going to meet for dinner last night randolph wasnt involved hes been in new york for a week but we found a digital picture of him on the victims computer and they look alike the suspect and randolph we think thats why the perp picked him to impersonate so he knows all this information about her friends where shes traveled what she does what stocks she owns who her boyfriend is it even looked like he waved to somebody in the bar but homicide canvassed most of the patrons who were there last night and didnt find anybody who knew him so we think he was faking you know to put her at ease making it look like he was a regular he social engineered her gillette offered hows that shelton asked anderson knew the term but he deferred to gillette who said it means conning somebody pretending youre somebody youre not hackers do it to get access to databases and phone lines and passcodes the more facts about somebody you can feed back to them the more they believe you and the more theyll do what you want them to now the girlfriend lara was supposed to meet sandra hardwick said she got a call from somebody claiming to be laras boyfriend canceling the dinner plans she tried to call lara but her phone was out gillette nodded he crashed her mobile phone then he frowned no probably the whole cell anderson nodded mobile america reported an outage in cell for exactly fortyfive minutes somebody loaded code that shut the switch down then turned it back on gillettes eyes narrowed the detective could see he was growing interested so the hacker mused he turned himself into somebody shed trust and then he killed her and he did it with information he got from her computer exactly did she have an online service horizon online gillette laughed jesus you know how secure that is he hacked into one of their routers and read her emails then he shook his head studied anderson s face but thats kindergarten stuff anybody could do that theres more isnt there right anderson continued we talked to her boyfriend and went through her computer half the information the bartender heard the killer tell her wasnt in her emails it was in the machine itself maybe he went dumpster diving and got the information that way anderson explained to bishop and shelton he means going digging through trash bins to get information thatll help you hack discarded company manuals printouts bills receipts things like that but he said to gillette i doubt it everything he knew was stored on her machine what about hard access gillette asked hard access is when a hacker breaks into somebodys house or office and goes through the victims machine itself soft access is breaking into somebodys computer online from a remote location but anderson responded it had to be soft access i talked to the friend lara was supposed to meet sandra she said the only time they talked about getting together that night was in an instant message that afternoon and lara was home all day the killer had to be in a different location thiss interesting gillette whispered i thought so too anderson said the bottom line is that we think theres some kind of new virus the killer used to get inside her machine the thing is computer crimes cant find it were hoping youd take a look gillette nodded squinting as he looked up at the grimy ceiling anderson noticed the young mans fingers were moving in tiny rapid taps at first the cop thought gillette had palsy or some nervous twitch but then he realized what the hacker was doing he was unconsciously typing on an invisible keyboard a nervous habit it seemed the hacker lowered his eyes to anderson whatd you use to examine her drive norton commander viscan the fbis forensic detection package restores and the dods partition and file allocation analyzer we even tried surfacescour gillette gave a confused laugh all that and you didnt find anything nope howm i going to find something you couldnt ive looked at some of the software youve written therere only three or four people in the world who could write script like that youve gotta have code thats better than ours or could hack some together gillette asked anderson so whats in it for me what bob shelton asked wrinkling up his pocked face and staring at the hacker if i help you what do i get you little prick shelton snapped a girl got murdered dont you give a shit im sorry about her gillette shot back but the deal is if i help you i want something in return anderson asked such as i want a machine no computers the warden snapped no way to anderson he said thats why hes in seclusion we caught him at the computer in the library on the internet the judge issued an order as part of his sentence that he cant go online i wont go online gillette said ill stay on e wing where i am now i wont have access to a phone line the warden scoffed youd rather stay in administrative seclusion solitary confinement gillette corrected just to have a computer yes anderson asked if he was to stay in seclusion so there was no chance of going online would that be okay i guess the warden said uncertainly the cop then said to gillette its a deal well get you a laptop youre going to bargain with him shelton asked anderson in disbelief he glanced at bishop for support but the lean cop brushed at his anachronistic sideburns and studied his cell phone again waiting for his reprieve anderson didnt respond to shelton he added to gillette but you get your machine only after you analyze the gibson womans computer and give us a complete report absolutely the prisoner said eyes glowing with excitement her machines an ibm clone off the shelf well get it over here in the next hour weve got all her disks and software and no no no gillette said firmly i cant do it here why ill need access to a mainframe maybe a supercomputer ill need tech manuals software anderson looked at bishop who didnt seem to be listening to any of this no fucking way said shelton the more talkative of the homicide partners even if he had a distinctly limited vocabulary anderson was debating with himself when the warden asked can i see you gentlemen up the hall for a minute chapter three it had been a fun hack but not as challenging as he wouldve liked phate his screen name spelled in the best hacker tradition with a phand not an f now drove to his house in los altos in the heart of silicon valley hed been busy this morning hed abandoned the bloodsmeared white van that hed used to light the fires of paranoia within lara gibson yesterday and hed ditched the disguises the dreadlock wig combat jacket and sunglasses of the stalker and the squeakyclean chipjockey costume of will randolph sandy hardwicks accommodating cousin he was now someone entirely different not his real name or identity of course jon patrick holloway whod been born twentyseven years ago in upper saddle river new jersey no he was at the moment one of six or seven fictional characters hed created recently they were like a group of friends to him and came complete with drivers licenses employee id cards social security cards and all the telltale documentation that is so indispensable nowadays hed even endowed his cast with different accents and mannerisms which he practiced religiously who do you want to be phates answer to this question was pretty much anybody in the world reflecting now on the lara gibson hack he decided itd been just a bit too easy to get close to someone who prided herself on being the queen of urban protection and so it was time to notch the game up a bit phates jaguar moved slowly through morning rushhour traffic along interstate the junipero serra highway to the west mountains rose into the specters of fog slipping overhead toward san francisco bay in recent years droughts had plagued the valley but much of this spring like today for instance had been rainy and the flora was a rich green phate however paid the expansive scenery no mind he was listening to a play on his cd player death of a salesman it was one of his favorites occasionally his mouth would move to the words he knew all the parts ten minutes later at he was pulling up into the garage of his large detached house in the stonecrest development off el monte road in los altos he parked in the garage closed the door he noticed a drop of lara gibsons blood in the shape of a sloppy comma on the otherwise immaculate floor careless to miss it earlier he chided himself he cleaned the stain then went inside closed and locked the door the house was new only about six months old and smelled of carpet glue and sweet paint if neighbors were to come acalling to welcome him to the neighborhood and stand in the front hallway glancing into the living room theyd see evidence of an uppermiddleclass family living the comfortable life that chip money has provided for so many people here in the valley hey nice to meet you yeah thats right just moved in last month im with a dotcom startup over in palo alto they brought me and half the furniture out from austin early before kathy and the kids theyll be moving here in june after schools over thats them took that one on vacation in florida in january troy and brittany hes seven shes going to be five next month on the mantel and on the expensive end tables and coffee tables were dozens of pictures of phate and a blond woman posing at the beach horseback riding hugging each other atop a mountain at a ski resort dancing at their wedding other pictures showed the couple with their two children vacations soccer practice christmas easter you know id ask you over for dinner or something but this new companys got me working like crazy probably better to wait till after the family gets here anyway you know kathys really the social director and a lot better cook than me okay you take care now and the neighbors would pass him the welcoming wine or cookies or begonias and return home never guessing that in the best spirit of creative social engineering the entire scene had been as fake as a movie set like the pictures hed shown lara gibson these snapshots had been created on his computer his face had replaced a male models kathys was a generic female face morphed from a model in self the kids had come from a vogue bambini the house itself was a facade too the living room and hall were the only fully furnished rooms and that had been done exclusively to fool people who came to the door in the bedroom was a cot and lamp in the dining room phates office were a table lamp two laptop computers and an office chair in the basement well the basement contained a few other things but they definitely werent for public view if need be and he knew it was a possibility he could walk out the door immediately and leave everything behind all his important possessions his serious hardware the computer antiquities he collected his id card machine the supercomputer parts he bought and sold to make his living were in a warehouse miles away and there was nothing here that would lead police to that location he now walked into the dining room and sat down at the table he turned on a laptop the screen came to life a c prompt flashed on the screen and with the appearance of that blinking symbol phate rose from the dead who do you want to be well at the moment he was no longer jon patrick holloway or will randolph or warren gregg or james l seymour or any of the other characters hed created he was now phate no longer the blond fivefootten character of slight build floating aimlessly among threedimensional houses and office buildings and stores and airplanes and concrete ribbons of highway and brown lawns chainlink fences semiconductor plants strip malls pets people people people people as numerous as flies thiswas his reality the world inside his monitor he keyed some commands and with an excited churning in his groin he heard the rising and falling whistle of his modems sensual electronic handshake most real hackers would never use dogslow modems and telephone lines like this rather than a direct connection to get online but phate had to compromise speed was far less important than being able to stay mobile and hide his tracks through millions of miles of telephone lines around the world after he was connected to the net he checked his email he would have opened any letters from shawn right away but there were none the others hed read later he exited the mail reader and then keyed in another command a menu popped up on his screen when he and shawn had written the software for trapdoor last year hed decided that even though no one else would be using it hed make the menu userfriendly simply because this is what you did when you were a brilliant codeslinger trapdoor main menu do you want to continue a prior session do you want to createopenedit a background file do you want to find a new target do you want to decodedecrypt a password or text do you want to exit to the system he scrolled down to and hit the enter key a moment later the trapdoor program politely asked please enter the email address of the target from memory he typed a screen name and hit enter within ten seconds he was connected to someone elses machine in effect looking over the unsuspecting users shoulder he read for a few moments then started jotting notes lara gibson had been a fun hack but this one would be better he made this the warden told them the cops stood in a storage room in san ho lining the shelves were drug paraphernalia nazi decorations and nation of islam banners handmade weapons clubs and knives and knuckledusters even a few guns this was the confiscation room and these grim items had been taken away from the prisons difficult residents over the past several years what the warden was now pointing out though was nothing so clearly inflammatory or deadly it was a wooden box about two by three feet filled with a hundred strips of bell wire which connected dozens of electronic components what is it bob shelton asked in his gravelly voice andy anderson laughed and whispered jesus its a computer its a homemade computer he leaned forward studying the simplicity of the wiring the perfect twisting of the solderless connections the efficient use of space it was rudimentary and yet it was astonishingly elegant i didnt know you could make a computer shelton offered thin frank bishop said nothing the warden said gillettes the worst addict ive ever seen and we get guys in hereve been on smack for years only what hes addicted to are these computers i guarantee you hell do anything he can to get online and hes capable of hurting people to do it i mean hurting them bad he built this just to get on the internet its got a modem built in anderson asked still awed by the device wait there it is yeah so id think twice about getting him out we can control him anderson said reluctantly looking away from gillettes creation you think you can the warden said shrugging people like himll say whatever they have to so they can get online just like alcoholics you know about his wife hes married anderson asked was he tried to stop hacking after he got married but couldnt then he got arrested and they lost everything paying the lawyer and court fine she divorced him a couple years ago i was here when he got the papers he didnt even care the door opened and a guard entered with a battered recycled manila folder he handed it to the warden who in turned passed it to anderson heres the file weve got on him might help you decide whether you really want him or not anderson flipped through the file the prisoner had a record going back years the juvenile detention time though wasnt for anything serious gillette had called pacific bells main office from a pay phone what hackers call fortress phones and programmed it to let him make free longdistance calls fortress phones are considered elementary schools for young hackers who use them to break into phone company switches which are nothing more than huge computer systems the art of cracking into the phone company to make free calls or just for the challenge of it is known as phreaking the notes in the file indicated that gillette had placed stolen calls to the time and temperature numbers in paris athens frankfurt tokyo and ankara which suggested that hed broken into the system just because he was curious to see if he could do it he wasnt after money anderson kept flipping through the young mans file there was clearly something to what the warden had said gillettes behavior was addictive hed been questioned in connection with twelve major hacking incidents over the past eight years in his sentencing for the western software hack the prosecutor had borrowed a phrase from the judge whod sentenced the famous hacker kevin mitnick saying that gillette was dangerous when armed with a keyboard the hackers behavior regarding computers wasnt however exclusively felonious anderson also learned hed worked for a number of silicon valley companies and invariably had gotten glowing reports on his programming skills at least until he was fired for missing work or falling asleep on the job because hed been up all night hacking hed also written a lot of brilliant freeware and shareware software programs given away to anyone who wants them and had lectured at conferences about new developments in computer programming languages and security then anderson did a double take and gave a surprised laugh he was looking at a reprint of an article that wyatt gillette had written for online magazine several years ago the article was well known and anderson recalled reading it when it first came out but had paid no attention to who the author was the title was life in the blue nowhere its theme was that computers are the first technological invention in history that affect every aspect of human life from psychology to entertainment to intelligence to material comfort to evil and that because of this humans and machines will continue to grow closer together there are many benefits to this but also many dangers the phrase blue nowhere which was replacing the term cyberspace meant the world of computers or as it was also called the machine world in gillettes coined phrase blue referred to the electricity that made computers work nowhere meant that it was an intangible place andy anderson also found some photocopies of documents from gillettes most recent trial he saw dozens of letters that had been sent to the judge requesting leniency in sentencing the hackers mother had passed away an unexpected heart attack when the woman was in her fifties but it sounded like the young man and his father had an enviable relationship gillettes father an american engineer working in saudi arabia had emailed several heartfelt pleas to the judge for a reduced sentence the hackers brother rick a government employee in montana had come to his siblings aid with several faxed letters to the court also urging leniency rick gillette even touchingly suggested that his brother could come live with him and his wife in a rugged and pristine mountain setting as if clean air and physical labor could cure the hacker of his criminal ways anderson was touched by this but surprised as well most of the hackers that anderson had arrested came from dysfunctional families he closed the file and handed it to bishop who read through it absently seemingly bewildered by the technical references to machines the detective muttered the blue nowhere a moment later he gave up and passed the folder to his partner whats the timetable for release shelton asked flipping through the file anderson replied weve got the paperwork waiting at the courthouse now as soon as we can get a federal magistrate to sign it gillettes ours im just giving you fair warning the warden said ominously he nodded at the homemade computer if you want to go ahead with a release be my guest only you gotta pretend hes a junkie whos been off the needle for two weeks shelton said i think we ought to call the fbi we could use some feds anyway on this one and thered be more bodies to keep an eye on him but anderson shook his head if we tell them then the dodll hear about it and have a stroke about us releasing the man who cracked their standard gillettell be back inside in a half hour no weve got to keep it quiet the release orderll be under a john doe anderson looked toward bishop caught in the act of checking out his silent cell phone once again what do you think frank the lean detective tucked in his shirt again and finally put together several complete sentences well sir i think we should get him out and the sooner the better that killer probably isnt sitting around talking like us chapter four for a terrible half hour wyatt gillette had sat in the cold medieval dungeon refusing to speculate if it would really happen if hed be released he wouldnt allow himself even a wisp of hope in prison expectations are the first to die then with a nearly silent click the door opened and the cops returned gillette looked up and happened to notice in anderson s left lobe a tiny brown dot of an earring hole that had closed up long ago a magistrates signed a temporary release order the cop said gillette realized that hed been sitting with his teeth clenched and shoulders drawn into a fierce knot with this news he exhaled in relief thank you thank you now you have a choice either youll be shackled the whole time youre out or you wear an electronic tracking anklet the hacker considered this anklet its a new variety anderson said titanium you can only get it on and off with a special key nobodys ever slipped out of one well one guy did bob shelton said cheerfully but he had to cut his foot off to do it he only got a mile before he bled to death gillette by now disliked the burly cop as much as shelton for some reason seemed to hate him it tracks you for sixty miles and broadcasts through metal anderson continued you made your point gillette said to the warden he said i need some things from my cell what things the man grumbled you arent gonna be away that long gillette you dont need to pack gillette said to anderson i need some of my books and notebooks and ive got a lot of printouts thatll be helpful from things like wired and the ccu cop said to the warden its okay a loud electronic braying came from nearby gillette jumped at the noise it took a minute to recognize the sound one that hed never heard in san ho frank bishop answered his cell phone the gaunt cop took the call listened for a moment flicking at a sideburn then answered yessir captain and there was a long pause during which the corner of his mouth tightened very slightly you cant do anything okay sir he hung up anderson cocked an eyebrow at him the homicide detective said evenly that was captain bernstein there was another report on the wire about the marinkill case the perps were spotted near walnut creek probably headed in this direction he glanced quickly at gillette as if he were a stain on the bench and then said to anderson i should tell you i requested to be removed from this case and put on that one they said no captain bernstein thought id be more helpful here thanks for telling me anderson said to gillette though the ccu cop didnt seem particularly grateful for the confirmation that the detective was only halfheartedly involved in the case anderson asked shelton did you want marinkill too no i wanted this one the girl was killed pretty much in my backyard i want to make sure it doesnt happen again anderson glanced at his watch it was we should get back to ccu the warden summoned the huge guard and instructions were given the man led gillette back down the corridor to his cell five minutes later hed collected what he needed used the toilet and pulled on his jacket he preceded the guard into the central part of san ho out one door out another past the visitors area where hed see a friend once a month or so and the lawyerclient rooms where hed spent so many hours working on the futile appeal with the man whod taken every penny that he and ellie had finally breathing fast now as the excitement flooded into him gillette stepped through the secondtothelast doorway into the area of offices and the guards locker rooms the cops were waiting for him there anderson nodded to the guard who undid the wrist shackles for the first time in two years gillette was no longer under the physical domination of the prison system hed attained a freedom of sorts he rubbed the skin on his wrists as they walked toward the exit two wooden doors with latticed fireglass in them through which gillette could see the gray sky well put the anklet on outside anderson said shelton stepped brusquely up to the hacker and whispered i want to say one thing gillette maybe youre thinking youll be in striking distance of some weapon or another what with your hands free well if you even get an itchy look that i dont like youre going to get hurt bad follow me i wont hesitate to take you out i broke into a computer the hacker said exasperated thats all i did ive never hurt anyone just remember what i said gillette sped up slightly so that he was walking next to anderson wherere we going the state police computer crimes unit office is in san jose its a separate facility we an alarm went off and a red light blinked on the metal detector they were walking through since they were leaving not entering the prison the guard manning the security station shut the buzzer off and nodded at them to continue but just as anderson put his hand on the front door to push it open a voice called excuse me it was frank bishop and he was pointing at gillette scan him gillette laughed thats crazy im going out not coming in whos going to smuggle something out of prison anderson said nothing but bishop gestured the guard forward he ran a metaldetecting wand over gillettes body the wand got to his right slacks pocket and emitted a piercing squeal the guard reached into the pocket and pulled out a circuit board sprouting wires what the fucks that shelton snapped anderson examined it closely a red box he asked gillette who glanced at the ceiling in frustration yeah the detective said to bishop and shelton therere dozens of circuit boxes that phone phreaks used to cheat the phone company to get free service tap somebodys line cut out wiretaps theyre known by colors you dont see many of them anymore except this one a red box it mimics the sound of coins in a pay phone you can call anywhere in the world and just keep punching the coindroptone button enough times to pay for the call he looked at gillette what were you going to do with this figured i might get lost and need to phone somebody you could also sell a red box on the street for i dont know a couple of hundred bucks to a phone phreak if say you were to escape and needed some money i guess somebody could but im not going to do that anderson looked the board over nice wiring thanks you missed having a soldering iron right gillette nodded i sure did you pull something like that again and youll be back inside as soon as i can get a patrol car to bring you in got it got it nice try bob shelton whispered but fuck lifes just one big disappointment dont you think no wyatt gillette thought lifes just one big hack on the eastern edge of silicon valley a pudgy fifteenyearold student pounded furiously on a keyboard as he peered through thick glasses at a monitor in the computer room at st francis academy an old private boys school in san jose the name of this area wasnt quite right though yeah it had computers in it but the room part was a little dicey the students thought stuck away down in the basement bars on the windows it looked like a cell it may actually have been one once this part of the building was years old and the rumor was that the famous missionary in old california father junípero serra had spread the gospel in this particular room by stripping native americans to the waist and flogging them until they accepted jesus some of these unfortunates the older students happily told the younger never survived their conversion and their ghosts continued to hang out in cells well rooms like this one jamie turner the youngster who was presently ignoring spirits and keying at the speed of light was a gawky darkhaired sophomore hed never gotten a grade below a and even though there were two months to go until the end of term he had completed the required reading and most of the assignments for all of his classes he owned more books than any two students at st francis and had read the harry potter books five times each lord of the rings eight times and every single word written by computersciencefiction visionary william gibson more often than he could remember like muted machinegun fire the sound of his keying filled the small room he heard a creak behind him looked around fast nothing then a snap silence now the sound of the wind damn ghosts fuck em get back to work jamie turner shoved his heavy glasses up on his nose and returned to his task gray light from the misty day was bleeding through the barred windows outside on the soccer field his classmates were shouting laughing scoring goals racing back and forth the physical ed period had just started jamie was supposed to be with them and booty wouldnt like him hiding out here but booty didnt know not that jamie disliked the principal of the boarding school not at all really it was hard to dislike somebody who cared about him unlike say for instance hellllohhh jamies parents see you on the twentythird son oh and for instance refusing to let the boys go to harmless rock concerts with their older and way responsible brothers unless their parents had signed a permission slip when who knew where the hell your parents even were let alone getting them to spend a few minutes to sign something and fax it back to you in time no matter how important it was love you bye but now jamie was taking matters into his own hands his brother mark a sound engineer at an oakland concert venue had told jamie that if he could escape from st francis that night hed get the boy into the santana concert and could probably get his hands on a couple of unlimitedaccess backstage passes but if he wasnt out of the school by sixthirty his brotherd have to leave to get to work on time and meeting that deadline was a problem because getting out of st francis wasnt like sliding down a bedsheet rope the way kids in old movies snuck out for the night st francis may have looked like an old spanish castle but its security was totally hightech jamie could get out of his room of course that wasnt locked even at night st francis wasnt exactly a prison and he could get out of the building proper through the fire door provided he could disable the fire alarm but that would only get him onto the school grounds and they were surrounded by a twelvefoothigh stone wall topped with barbed wire and there was no way to get over that at least no way for him a chubby geek who hated heights unless he cracked the passcode to one of the gates that opened onto the street which is why he was now cracking the passcode file of herr mein fuhrer booty excuse me dr willem c boethe med phd so far hed easily hacked into bootys computer and downloaded the file containing the passcode conveniently named security passcodes hey way subtle booty what was stored in the file was of course an encrypted version of the password and would have to be decrypted before jamie could use it but jamies puny clone computer would take days to crack the code and so the boy was presently hacking into a nearby computer site to find a machine powerful enough to crack it in time for the magic deadline jamie knew that the internet had been started as a largely academic network to facilitate the exchange of research not keep information secret the first organizations to be linked via the net universities had far poorer security than the government agencies and corporations that had more recently come online he now figuratively knocked on the door of northern california tech and engineering college s computer lab and was greeted with this username jamie answered user passcode his response user and the message popped up welcome user hm how bout an f minus for security jamie thought wryly and began to browse through the machines root directory the main one until he found what would be a very large supercomputer probably an old cray on the schools network at the moment the machine was calculating the age of the universe interesting but not as cool as santana jamie thought he nudged aside the astronomy project and uploaded a program he himself had written called cracker which started its sweat labor to extract the englishlanguage password from bootys files he oh hell shit he said in very unbooty language his computer had frozen up again this had occurred several times recently and it pissed him off that he couldnt figure out why he knew computers cold and he could find no reason for this sort of jamming he had no time for crashes not today with his deadline still the boy jotted the occurrence in his hackers notebook as any diligent codeslinger would do and restarted the system then logged back online he checked on the cray and found that the colleges computer had kept working away running cracker on bootys password file even while hed been offline he could mr turner mr turner came a nearby voice what are we up to here the words scared the absolute hell out of jamie but he wasnt so startled that he failed to hit altf on his computer just before principal booty padded up to the computer terminal on his crepesoled shoes a screen containing an essay about the plight of the rain forest replaced the status report from his illegal cracking program hi mr boethe jamie said ah the tall thin man bent down peering at the screen thought you might be looking at nasty pictures mr turner no sir jamie said i wouldnt do that studying the environment concerned about what weve done to poor mother nature are we good for you good for you but i cant help but notice that this is your physical education period you should be experiencing mother nature firsthand out in the sports fields inhaling that good california air running and kicking goals isnt it raining jamie asked misting id call it besides playing soccer in the rain builds character now out we go mr turner the greens are down one player mr lochnell turned left and his ankle turned right go to their aid your team needs you i just have to shut down the system sir itll take a few minutes the principal walked to the door calling i expect to see you out there in full gear in fifteen minutes yessir responded jamie turner not revealing his huge disappointment at forsaking his machine for a muddy patch of grass and a dozen stupid students altfing out of the rain forest window jamie started to type a status request to see how his cracker program was doing on the passcode file then he paused squinted at the screen and noticed something odd the type on the monitor seemed slightly fuzzier than normal the letters seemed to flicker too and something else the keys were a little sluggish under his touch this was way weird he wondered what the problem might be jamie had written a couple of diagnostic programs and he decided hed run one or two of them after hed extracted the passcode they might tell him what was wrong he guessed the trouble was a bug in the system folder maybe a graphics accelerator problem hed check that first but for a brief instant jamie turner had a ridiculous thought that the unclear letters and slow response times of the keys werent a problem with his operating system at all they were due to the ghost of a longdead indian floating in between jamie and his machine angry at the human presence as the spirits cold spectral fingers keyed in a desperate message for help chapter five at the top lefthand corner of phates screen was a small dialogue box containing this trapdoor hunt mode target jamiettholcom online yes operating system msdoswindows antivirus software disabled on the screen itself phate was looking at exactly what jamie turner was seeing on his own machine several miles away in st francis academy this particular character in his game had intrigued phate from the first time hed invaded the boys machine a month ago phate had spent a lot of time browsing through jamies files and hed learned as much about him as hed learned about the late lara gibson for instance jamie turner hated sports and history and loved math and science he read voraciously the youngster was a mudhead he spent hours in the multiuser domain chat rooms on the internet excelling at roleplaying games and active in creating and maintaining the fantasy societies so popular in the mud realm jamie was also a brilliant codeslinger a selftaught programmer hed designed his own web site which had gotten a runnerup prize from web site revue online hed come up with an idea for a new computer game that phate found intriguing and that clearly had commercial potential the boys biggest fear was losing his eyesight he ordered special shatterproof glasses from an online optometrist the only member of his family he spent much time emailing and communicating with was his older brother mark their parents were rich and busy and tended to respond to every fifth or sixth email their son sent jamie turner phate had concluded was brilliant and imaginative and vulnerable and the boy was also just the sort of hacker whod one day surpass him phate like many of the great computer wizards had a mystical side to him he was like those physicists who accept god wholeheartedly or hardheaded politicians whore devoutly committed to masonic mysticism there was phate believed an indescribably spiritual side to machines and only those with limited vision denied that so it wasnt at all out of character for phate to be superstitious and one of the things that hed come to believe as hed used trapdoor to stroll through jamie turners computer over the past few weeks was that the boy had the skill to ultimately replace phate as the greatest codeslinger of all time this was why he had to stop little jamie t turner from continuing his adventures in the machine world and phate planned to stop him in a particularly effective way he now scrolled through more files these which had been emailed to him by shawn gave detailed information about the boys school st francis academy the boarding school was renowned academically but more important it represented a true tactical challenge to phate if there was no difficulty and risk to him in killing the characters in the game then there was no point in playing and st francis offered some serious obstacles the security was very extensive because the school had been the scene of a breakin several years ago in which one student had been killed and a teacher severely wounded the principal willem boethe had vowed to never let that happen again to reassure parents he had renovated the entire school and turned it into a fortress halls were locked down at night the grounds doublegated windows and doors alarmed you needed passcodes to get in and out of the tall razorwired wall surrounding the compound getting inside the school was in short just the right kind of challenge for phate it was a step up from lara gibson moving to a higher more difficult level in his game he coulda phate squinted at the screen oh no not again jamies computer and therefore his too had crashed itd happened just ten minutes ago too this was the onebug in trapdoor sometimes his machine and the invaded computer would simply stop working then theyd both have to reboot restart their computers and go back online it resulted in a delay of no more than a minute or so but to phate it was a terrible flaw software had to be perfect it had to be elegant he and shawn had been trying to fix this bug for months but had had no luck so far a moment later he and his young friend were back online and phate was browsing through the boys machine once more a small window appeared on phates monitor and the trapdoor program asked target subject has received an instant message from marktheman do you want to monitor that would be jamie turners brother mark phate keyed yand saw the brothers dialogue on his screen marktheman can you instant message jamiett gotta go play sucker i mean soccer marktheman lol still on for tonight jamiett you bet santana rules marktheman cant wait ill see you across the street by the north gate at you ready to rock n roll phate thought you bet we are wyatt gillette paused in the doorway and felt as if hed been transported back in time he gazed around him at the california state police computer crimes unit which was housed in an old onestory building several miles from the state polices san jose headquarters its a dinosaur pen of our very own andy anderson said he then explained to bishop and shelton neither of whom seemed to want the information that in the early computing days huge computers like the mainframes made by ibm and control data corporation were housed in special rooms like this called dinosaur pens the pens featured raised floors beneath which ran massive cables called boas after the snakes which they resembled and which had been known to uncurl violently at times and injure technicians dozens of air conditioner ducts also crisscrossed the room the cooling systems were necessary to keep the massive computers from overheating and catching fire the computer crimes unit was located off west san carlos in a lowrent commercial district of san jose near the town of santa clara to reach it you drove past a number of car dealerships ez terms for you se habla espanol and over a series of railroad tracks the rambling onestory building in need of painting and repair was in clear contrast to say apple computer headquarters a mile away a pristine futuristic building decorated with a fortyfoot portrait of cofounder steve wozniak ccus only artwork was a broken rusty pepsi machine squatting beside the front door inside the huge building were dozens of dark corridors and empty offices the police were using only a small portion of the space the central work area in which a dozen modular cubicles had been assembled there were eight sun microsystems workstations several ibms and apples a dozen laptops cables ran everywhere some ducttaped to the floor some hanging overhead like jungle vines you can rent these old dataprocessing facilities for a song anderson explained to gillette he laughed the ccu finally gets recognized as a legit part of the state police and they give us digs thatre twenty years out of date look a scram switch gillette nodded at a red switch on the wall a dusty sign said emergency use only ive never seen one whats that bob shelton asked anderson explained the old mainframes would get so hot that if the cooling system went down the computers could overheat and catch fire in seconds with all the resins and plastic and rubber the gases from a burning computer would kill you before the flames would so all dinosaur pens came equipped with a scram switch the name borrowed from the emergency shutdown switch in nuclear reactors if there was a fire you hit the scram button which shut off the computer summoned the fire department and dumped halon gas on the machine to extinguish the flames andy anderson introduced gillette bishop and shelton to the ccu team first linda sanchez a short stocky middleaged latina in a lumpy tan suit she was the units ssl officer seizure search and logging she explained she was the one who secured a perpetrators computer checked it for booby traps copied the files and logged hardware and software into evidence she also was a digital evidence recovery specialist an expert at excavating a hard drive searching it for hidden or erased data accordingly such officers were also known as computer archaeologists im the team bloodhound she explained to gillette any word linda not yet boss that daughter of mine shes the laziest girl on earth anderson said to gillette lindas about to be a grandmother a week overdue driving the family crazy and this is my second in command sergeant stephen miller miller was older than anderson close to fifty he had bushy graying hair sloping shoulders bearish pearshaped he seemed cautious because of his age gillette guessed he was from the second generation of computer programmers men and women who were innovators in the computer world in the early seventies the third person was tony mott a cheerful thirtyyearold with long straight blond hair and oakley sunglasses dangling from a green fluorescent cord around his neck his cubicle was filled with pictures of him and a pretty asian girl snowboarding and mountain biking a crash helmet sat on his desk snowboarding boots in the corner hed represent the latest generation of hackers athletic risktakers equally at home hacking together script at a keyboard and skateboarding halfpipes at extremesport competitions gillette noticed too that of all the cops at ccu mott wore the biggest pistol on his hip a shiny silver automatic the computer crimes unit also had a receptionist but the woman was out sick ccu was low in the state police hierarchy it was referred to as the geek squad by fellow cops and headquarters wouldnt spring for a temporary replacement the members of the unit had to take phone messages sift through mail and file documents by themselves and none of them understandably was very happy about this then gillettes eyes slipped to one of several erasable whiteboards against the wall apparently used for listing clues a photo was taped to one he couldnt make out what it depicted and walked closer then he gasped and stopped in shock the photo was of a young woman in an orangeandred skirt naked from the waist up bloody and pale lying in a patch of grass dead gillette had played plenty of computer games mortal kombat and doom and tomb raider but as gruesome as those games were they were nothing compared to this still horrible violence against a real victim andy anderson glanced at the wall clock which wasnt digital as would befit a computer center but an old dusty analog model with big and little hands the time was am the cop said weve got to get moving on this now were taking a twoprong approach to the case detectives bishop and shelton are going to be running a standard homicide investigation ccull handle the computer evidence with wyatts help here he glanced at a fax on his desk and added were also expecting a consultant from seattle an expert on the internet and online systems patricia nolan she should be here any minute police shelton asked no civilian anderson said miller added we use corporate security people all the time the technology changes so fast we cant keep up with all the latest developments perpsre always one step ahead of us so we try to use private consultants whenever we can tony mott said theyre usually standing in line to help its real chic now to put catching a hacker on your resume anderson asked linda sanchez now wheres the gibson womans computer in the analysis lab boss the woman nodded down one of the dark corridors that spidered out from the central room a couple of techs from crime scene are fingerprinting it just in case the perp broke into her house and left some nice juicy latents should be ready in ten minutes mott handed frank bishop an envelope this came for you a few minutes ago its the preliminary crime scene report bishop brushed at his stiff hair with the backs of his fingers gillette could see the tooth marks from the comb very clearly in the heavily sprayed strands the cop glanced through the file but said nothing he handed the thin stack of papers to shelton tucked his shirt in once more then leaned against the wall the chunky cop opened the file read for a few moments then looked up witnesses report the perpetrator was a white male medium build and medium height white slacks a light blue shirt tie with a cartoon character of some kind on it late twenties early thirties looked like every techie in there the bartender said the cop walked to the whiteboard and began to write down these clues he continued id card around his neck said xerox palo alto research center but were sure that was fake there were no hard leads to anybody there he had a mustache and goatee blond hair also there were several frayed blue denim fibers on the victim that didnt match her clothes or anything in her closet at home mightve come from the perp the murder weapon was probably a military kabar knife with a serrated top tony mott asked howd you know that the woundsre consistent with that type of weapon shelton turned back to the file the victim was killed elsewhere and dumped by the highway mott interrupted how could they tell that shelton frowned slightly apparently not wishing to digress quantity of her blood found at the scene the young cops lengthy blond hair danced as he nodded and seemed to record this information for future reference shelton resumed nobody near the body drop site saw anything a sour glance at the others like they ever do now were trying to trace the doers car he and lara left the bar together and were seen walking toward the back parking lot but nobody got a look at his wheels crime scene was lucky the bartender remembered that the perp wrapped his beer bottle in a napkin and one of the techs found it in the trash but we printed both the bottle and the napkin and came up with zip the lab lifted some kind of adhesive off the lip of the bottle but we cant tell what it is its nontoxic thats all they know it doesnt match anything in the lab database frank bishop finally spoke a costume store costume anderson asked the cop said maybe he needed some help to look like this will randolph guy he was impersonating might be glue for a fake mustache or beard gillette agreed a good social engineer always dresses for the con i have friends whove sewed together complete pac bell linemen uniforms thats good tony mott said to bishop adding more data to his continuing education file anderson nodded his approval of this suggestion shelton called homicide headquarters in san jose and arranged to have some troopers check the adhesive against samples of theatrical glue frank bishop took off his wrinkled suit jacket and hung it carefully on the back of a chair he stared at the photo and the whiteboard arms crossed his shirt was already billowing out again he wore boots with pointed toes when gillette was a college student he and some friends at berkeley had rented a skin flick for a party a stag film from the fifties or sixties one of the actors had looked and dressed just like bishop lifting the crime scene file away from shelton bishop flipped through it then he looked up the bartender said that the victim had a martini and the killer had a light beer the killer paid if we can get a hold of the check we might lift a fingerprint howre you going to do that it was bulky stephen miller who asked this the bartender probably pitched them out last night with a thousand others bishop nodded at gillette well have some troopers do what hementioned dumpster diving to shelton he said have them look through the bars trash bins for a receipt for a martini and a light beer timestamped about seventhirty pm thatll take forever miller said but bishop ignored him and nodded to shelton who made the call to follow up on his suggestion gillette then realized that nobody had been standing close to him he eyed everyone elses clean clothes shampooed hair grimefree fingernails he asked anderson if weve got a few minutes before that computers ready i dont suppose you have a shower round here anderson tugged at the lobe that bore the stigmata of a pastlife earring and broke into a laugh i was wondering how to bring that up he said to mott take him down to the employee locker room but stay close the young cop nodded and led gillette down the hallway he chattered away nonstop his first topic the advantages of the linux operating system a variation on the classic unix which many people were starting to use in place of windows he spoke enthusiastically and was well informed he then told gillette about the recent formation of the computer crimes unit theyd been in existence for less than a year the geek squad mott explained could easily have used another halfdozen fulltime cops but they werent in the budget there were more cases than they could possibly handle from hacking to cyberstalking to child pornography to copyright infringement of software and the workload seemed to get heavier with every passing month whyd you get into it gillette asked him ccu hoping for a little excitement i mean i love machines and guess i have a mind for em but sifting through code to find a copyright violations not quite what id hoped i thought itd be a little more rig and rage you know how bout linda sanchez gillette asked she a geek not really shes smart but machines arent in her blood she was a gang girl down in lettuce land you know salinas then she went into social work and decided to go to the academy her partner was shot up pretty bad in monterey a few years ago linda has kids the daughter whos expecting and a girl in high school and her husbands never home hes an ins agent so she figured it was time to move to a little quieter side of the business just the opposite of you mott laughed i guess so as gillette toweled off after the shower mott placed an extra set of his own workout clothes on the bench for the hacker tshirt black sweatpants and a warmup windbreaker mott was shorter than gillette but they had basically the same build thanks gillette said donning the clothes he felt exhilarated having washed away one particular type of filth from his thin frame the residue of prison on the way back to the main room they passed a small kitchenette there was a coffeepot a refrigerator and a table on which sat a plate of bagels gillette stopped looked hungrily at the food then he eyed a row of cabinets he asked mott i dont suppose you have any poptarts in there poptarts naw but have a bagel gillette walked over to the table and poured a cup of coffee he picked up a raisin bagel not one of those mott said he took it out of gillettes hand and dropped it on the floor it bounced like a ball gillette frowned linda brought these in its a joke when gillette stared at him in confusion the cop added dont you get it get what whats todays date i dont have a clue the days of the month arent how you mark time in prison april fools day mott said those bagelsre plastic linda and i put em out this morning and weve been waiting for andy to bite so to speak but we havent got him yet i think hes on a diet he opened the cabinet and took out a bag of fresh ones here gillette ate one quickly mott said go ahead have another another followed washed down with gulps from the large cup of coffee they were the best thing hed had in ages mott got a carrot juice from the fridge and they returned to the main area of ccu gillette looked around the dinosaur pen at the hundreds of disconnected boas lying in the corners and at the airconditioning vents his mind churning a thought occurred to him april fools day so the murder was march thirtyfirst right anderson confirmed is that significant gillette said uncertainly its probably a coincidence go ahead well its just that march thirtyfirst is sort of a redletter day in computer history bishop asked why a womans gravelly voice spoke from the doorway isnt that the date the first univac was delivered chapter six they turned to see a hippy brunette in her midthirties wearing an unfortunate gray sweater suit and thick black shoes anderson asked patricia she nodded and walked into the room shook his hand thiss patricia nolan the consultant i was telling you about shes with the security department of horizon online horizon was the biggest commercial internet service provider in the world larger even than america online since there were tens of millions of registered subscribers and since every one of them could have up to eight different usernames for friends or family members it was likely that at any given time a large percentage of the world was checking stock quotes lying to people in chat rooms reading hollywood gossip buying things finding out the weather reading and sending emails and downloading softcore porn via horizon online nolan kept her eyes on gillettes face for a moment she glanced at the palm tree tattoo then at his fingers keying compulsively in the air anderson explained horizon called us when they heard the victim was a customer and volunteered to send somebody to help out the detective introduced her to the team and now gillette examined her the trendy designer eyeglasses probably bought on impulse didnt do much to make her masculine plain face any less plain but the striking green eyes behind them were piercing and very quick gillette could see that she too was amused to find herself in an antiquated dinosaur pen nolans complexion was loose and doughy and obscured with thick makeup that would have been stylish if excessive in the s her brunette hair was very thick and unruly and tended to fall into her face after hands were shaken and introductions made she returned immediately to gillette she twined a mass of hair around her fingers and not caring who heard said bluntly i saw the way you looked at me when you heard i worked for horizon like all big commercial internet service providers aol compuserve prodigy and the others horizon online was held in contempt by true hackers computer wizards used telnet programs to jump directly from their computers to others and they roamed the blue nowhere with customized web browsers built for interstellar travel they wouldnt think of using simpleminded lowhorsepower internet providers like horizon which was geared for family entertainment subscribers to horizon online were known as holamers or holosers or echoing gillettes current address just plain hos nolan continued speaking to gillette just so we get everything on the table i went to mit undergrad and princeton for my masters and doctorate both in computer science ai gillette asked in new jersey princeton s artificial intelligence lab was one of the top in the country nolan nodded thats right and ive done my share of hacking too gillette was amused that she was justifying herself to him the one felon in the crowd and not to the police he could hear an edgy tone in her voice and the delivery sounded rehearsed he supposed this was because she was a woman the equal employment opportunity commission doesnt have jurisdiction to stop the relentless prejudice against women trying to make their way in the blue nowhere not only are they hounded out of chat rooms and off bulletin boards but theyre often blatantly insulted and even threatened teenage girls who want to hack need to be smarter and ten times tougher than their male counterparts what were you saying about univac tony mott asked nolan filled in march the first univac was delivered to the census bureau for regular operations what was it bob shelton asked it stands for universal automatic computer gillette said acronymsre real popular in the machine world nolan said univac is one of the first modern mainframe computers as we know them it took up a room as big as this one of course nowadays you can buy laptops thatre faster and do a hundred times more anderson mused the date think its a coincidence nolan shrugged i dont know maybe our perps got a theme of some kind mott suggested i mean a milestone computer date and a motiveless killing right in the heart of silicon valley lets follow up on it anderson said find out if therere any recent unsolved killings in other hightech areas that fit this mo try seattle portland they have the silicon forest there chicago s got the silicon prairie route outside of boston austin texas miller suggested good and the dulles toll road corridor outside of dc start there and lets see what we can find send the request to vicap tony mott keyed in some information and a few minutes later he got a response he read from the screen and said got something in portland february fifteenth and seventeenth of this year two unsolved killings same mo in both of them and it was similar to here both victims stabbed to death died of chest wounds perp was believed to be a white male late twenties didnt seem to know the victims and robbery and rape werent motives the vics were a wealthy corporate executive male and a professional woman athlete february fifteenth gillette asked patricia nolan glanced at him eniac right the hacker said then explained eniac was similar to univac but earlier it came online in the forties the dedication date was february fifteenth whats that acronym gillette said the electronic numerical integrator and calculator like all hackers he was an aficionado of computer history shit shelton muttered weve got a pattern doer great another message arrived from vicar gillette glanced at the screen and learned that these letters stood for the department of justices violent criminal apprehension program it seemed that cops used acronyms as much as hackers man heres one more mott said reading the screen more stephen miller asked dismayed he absently organized some of the disks and papers that covered his desk six inches deep about eighteen months ago a diplomat and a colonel at the pentagon both of them with bodyguards were killed in herndon virginia thats the dulles toll road hightech corridor im ordering the complete files what were the dates of the virginia killings anderson asked august twelfth and thirteenth he wrote this on the whiteboard and looked at gillette with a raised eyebrow any clue ibms first pc the hacker replied the release date was august twelfth nolan nodded so hes got a theme shelton said frank bishop added and that means hes going to keep going the computer terminal where mott sat gave a soft beep the young cop leaned forward his large automatic pistol clanking loudly against his chair he frowned weve got a problem here on the screen were the words unable to download files a longer message was beneath it anderson read the text shook his head the case files at vicap on the portland and virginia killingsre missing the note from the sysadmin says they were damaged in a datastorage mishap mishap nolan muttered sharing a look with gillette linda sanchez eyes wide said you dont think i mean he couldntve cracked vicap nobodys ever done that anderson said to the younger cop try the state databases oregon and virginia state police case archives in a moment mott looked up no record of any files on those cases they vanished mott and miller eyed each other uncertainly thiss getting scary mott said anderson mused but whats his motive hes a goddamn hacker shelton muttered thats his motive hes not a hacker gillette said then what is he gillette didnt feel like educating the difficult cop he glanced at anderson who explained the word hacker is a compliment it means an innovative programmer as in hacking together software a real hacker breaks into somebodys machine only to see if he can do it and to find out whats inside its a curiosity thing the hacker ethic is its okay to look but dont touch people who break into systems as vandals or thieves are called crackers as in safecrackers i wouldnt even call him that gillette said crackers maybe steal and vandalize but they dont hurt people id call him a kracker with a k for killer cracker with a c kracker with a k shelton muttered what the hell difference does it make a big difference gillette said spell phreak with a ph and youre talking about somebody who steals phone services phishing with a ph is searching the net for someones identity misspell wares with a z on the end not an s and youre not talking about housewares but about stolen software when it comes to hacking its all in the spelling shelton shrugged and remained unimpressed by the distinction the identification techs from the california state police forensics division returned to the main part of the ccu office wheeling battered suitcases behind them one consulted a sheet of paper we lifted eighteen partial latents twelve partial visibles he nodded at a laptop computer case slung over his shoulder we scanned them and it looks like theyre all the victims or her boyfriends and there was no evidence of glove smears on the keys so anderson said he got inside her system from a remote location soft access like we thought he thanked the techs and they left then linda sanchez all business at the moment no longer the grandmothertobe said to gillette ive secured and logged everything in her machine she handed him a floppy disk heres a boot disk this was a disk that contained enough of an operating system to boot up or start a suspects computer police used boot disks rather than the hard drive itself to start the computer in case the owner or the killer in this case had installed some software on the hard drive that would destroy data ive been through her machine three times now and i havent found any booby traps but that doesnt mean they arent there you probably know all this too but keep the victims machine and any disks away from plastic bags or boxes or folders they can create static and zap data same thing with speakers they have magnets in them and dont put any disks on metal shelves they might be magnetized youll find nonmagnetic tools in the lab i guess you know what to do from here yep she said good luck the labs down that corridor there the boot disk in hand gillette started toward the hallway bob shelton followed the hacker turned i dont really want anybody looking over my shoulder especially you he added to himself its okay anderson said to the homicide cop the only exit back theres alarmed and hes got his jewelry on nodding at the shiny metal transmission anklet hes not going anywhere shelton wasnt pleased but he acquiesced gillette noticed though that he didnt return to the main room he leaned against the hallway wall near the lab and crossed his arms looking like a bouncer with a bad attitude if you even get an itchy look that i dont like youre going to get hurt bad inside the analysis room gillette walked up to lara gibsons computer it was an unremarkable offtheshelf ibm clone he did nothing with her machine just yet though instead he sat down at a workstation and wrote a kludge a downanddirty software program in five minutes he was finished writing the source code he named the program detective then compiled and copied it to the boot disk sanchez had given him he inserted the disk into the floppy drive of lara gibsons machine he turned on the power switch and the drives hummed and snapped with comforting familiarity wyatt gillettes thick muscular fingers slid eagerly onto the cool plastic of the keys he positioned his fingertips callused from years of keyboarding on the tiny orientation bumps on the f and j keys the boot disk bypassed the machines windows operating system and went straight to the leaner msdos the famous microsoft disk operating system which is the basis for the more userfriendly windows the c prompt appeared on the black screen his heart raced as he stared at the hypnotically pulsing cursor then not looking at the keyboard he pressed a key the one for dthe first letter in the command line detectiveexe which would start his program in the blue nowhere time is very different from what we know it to be in the real world and in the first thousandth of a second after wyatt gillette pushed that key this happened the voltage flowing through the circuit beneath the d key changed ever so slightly the keyboard processor noticed the change in current and transmitted an interrupt signal to the computer itself which momentarily sent the dozens of tasks it was currently performing to a storage area known as the stack and then created a special priority route for codes coming from the keyboard the code for the letter d was directed by the keyboard processor along this express route into the computers basic inputoutput system the bios which checked to see if wyatt gillette had pressed the shift control or alternate keys at the same time hed hit the d key assured that he hadnt the bios translated the letters keyboard code for the lowercase d into another one its ascii code which was then sent into the computers graphics adapter the adapter in turn converted the code to a digital signal which it forwarded to the electron guns located in the back of the monitor the guns fired a burst of energy into the chemical coating on the screen and miraculously the white letter d burned into existence on the black monitor all this in that fraction of a second and in what remained of that second gillette typed the rest of the letters of his command etectiveexe and then hit the enter key with his right little finger more type and graphics appeared and soon like a surgeon on the trail of an elusive tumor wyatt gillette began probing carefully through lara gibsons computer the only aspect of the woman that had survived the vicious attack that was still warm that retained at least a few memories of who she was and what shed done in her brief life chapter seven he walks in a hackers slump andy anderson thought watching wyatt gillette return from the analysis lab machine people had the worst posture of any profession in the world it was nearly am the hacker had spent only thirty minutes looking over lara gibsons machine bob shelton who now dogged gillette back to the main office to the hackers obvious irritation asked so whatd you find the question was delivered in a chilly tone and anderson wondered again why shelton was riding the young man so hard especially considering that the hacker was helping them out on a case the detective had volunteered for gillette ignored the pockfaced cop and sat down in a swivel chair flipped open his notebook when he spoke it was to anderson theres something odd going on the killer was in her computer he seized root and dumb it down shelton muttered seized what gillette explained when somebody has root that means they have complete control over a computer network and all the machines on it anderson added when youre root you can rewrite programs delete files add authorized users remove them go online as somebody else gillette continued but i cant figure out how he did it the only thing unusual i found were some scrambled files i thought they were some kind of encrypted virus but they turned out to be just gibberish theres not a trace of any kind of software on her machine that would let him get inside glancing at bishop he explained see i could load a virus in your computer thatd let me seize root on your machine and get inside it from wherever i am whenever i want to without needing a passcode theyre called back door viruses as in sneaking in through the back door but in order for them to work i have to somehow actually install the software on your computer and activate it i could send it to you as an attachment to an email say and you could activate it by opening the attachment without knowing what it was or i could break into your house and install it on your computer then activate it myself but theres no evidence that happened no he seized root some other way the hacker was an animated speaker anderson noticed his eyes were glowing with that absorbed animation hed seen in so many young geeks even the ones who were sitting in court more or less convicting themselves as they excitedly described their exploits to the judge and jury then how do you know he seized root linda sanchez asked i hacked together this kludge he handed anderson a floppy disk whats it do patricia nolan asked her professional curiosity piqued as was anderson s its called detective it looks for things that arent inside a computer he explained for the benefit of the nonccu cops when your computer runs the operating system like windows stores parts of the programs it needs all over your hard drive therere patterns to where and when it stores those files indicating the disk he said that showed me that a lot of those bits of programsd been moved to places on the hard drive that make sense only if somebody was going through her computer from a remote location shelton shook his head in confusion but frank bishop said you mean its like you know a burglar was inside your house because he moved furniture and didnt put the pieces back even though he was gone when you got home gillette nodded exactly andy anderson as much a wizard as gillette in some areas hefted the thin disk in his hand he couldnt help feeling impressed when he was considering asking gillette to help them the cop had looked through some of gillettes script which the prosecutor had submitted as evidence in the case against him after examining the brilliant lines of source code anderson had two thoughts the first was that if anyone could figure out how the perp had gotten into lara gibsons computer it was wyatt gillette the second was pure painful envy of the young mans skills throughout the world there were tens of thousands of code crunchers people who happily churn out tight efficient software for mundane tasks and there were just as many script bunnies the term for kids who write wildly creative but clumsy and largely useless programs just for the fun of it but only a few programmers have both the vision to conceive of script thats elegant the highest form of praise for software and the skill to write it wyatt gillette was just such a codeslinger once again anderson noticed frank bishop looking around the room absently his mind elsewhere he wondered if he should call headquarters and see about getting a new detective on board let bishop go chase his marinkill bank robbers if thats what was so goddamn important to him and well replace him with somebody who at least could pay attention the ccu cop said to gillette so the bottom line is he got into her system thanks to some new unknown program or virus basically thats it could you find out anything else about him mott asked only what you already know that hes been trained on unix unix is a computer operating system just like msdos or windows though it controls larger more powerful machines than personal computers wait anderson interrupted what do you mean what we already know that mistake he made what mistake gillette frowned when the killer was inside her system he keyed some commands to get into her files but they were unix commands he mustve entered them by mistake before he remembered her machine was running windows you mustve seen them in there anderson looked questioningly at stephen miller whod apparently been the one analyzing the victims computer in the first place miller said uneasily i noticed a couple lines of unix yeah but i just assumed shed typed them shes a civilian gillette said using the hacker term for a casual computer user i doubt shed even heard of unix let alone known the commands in windows and apple operating systems people control their machines by simply clicking on pictures or typing common english words for commands unix requires users to learn hundreds of complicated codes i didnt think sorry the bearish cop said defensively he seemed put out at this criticism over what he must have thought was a small point so stephen miller had made yet another mistake anderson reflected this had been an ongoing problem ever since miller had joined ccu recently in the s miller had headed a promising company that made computers and developed software but his products were always one step behind ibms digital equipments and microsofts and he eventually went bankrupt miller complained that hed often anticipated the nbt the next big thing the silicon valley phrase for an innovation that would revolutionize the industry but the big boys were continually sabotaging him after his company went under hed gotten divorced and left the machine world for a few years then surfaced as a freelance programmer miller drifted into computer security and finally applied to the state police he wouldntve been andersons first choice for a computer cop but then again ccu had very few qualified applicants to choose from why earn a year working a job where theres a chance you might get shot when you can make ten times that at one of silicon valleys corporate legends besides miller whod never remarried and didnt seem to have much of a personal life put in the longest hours in the department and could be found in the dinosaur pen long after everyone else had left he also took work home that is to some of the local university computer departments where friends would let him run ccu projects on stateoftheart supercomputers for free whats that mean for us shelton asked that he knows this unix stuff anderson said its bad for us thats what it means hackers who use windows or apple systems are usually smalltime serious hackers work in unix or digital equipments operating system vms gillette concurred he added unix is also the operating system of the internet anybody whos going to crack into the big servers and routers on the net has to know unix bishops phone rang and he took the call then he looked around and sat down at a nearby workstation to jot notes he sat upright no hackers slouch here anderson observed when he disconnected the call bishop said got some leads one of our troopers heard from some cis it was a moment before anderson recalled what the letters stood for confidential informants snitches bishop said in his soft unemotional voice somebody named peter fowler white male about twentyfive from bakersfield s been seen selling guns in this area been hawking kabars too a nod at the whiteboard like the murder weapon he was seen an hour ago near the stanford campus in palo alto some park near page mill a quarter mile north of hackers knoll boss linda sanchez said in milliken park anderson nodded he knew the place well and wasnt surprised when gillette said that he did too its a deserted grassy area near the campus where computer science majors hackers and chipjocks hang out they trade warez and swap stories smoke weed i know some people there anderson said ill go check it out when were through here bishop consulted his notes again and said the report from the lab shows that the adhesive on the bottle is the type of glue used in theatrical makeup a couple of our people checked the phone book for stores theres only one in the immediate area ollies theatrical supply on el camino real in mountain view they sell a lot of the stuff the clerk said they dont keep records of the sales but theyll let us know if anybody comes in to buy some now bishop continued we might have a lead on the perps car a security guard in an office building across the street from vestas the restaurant where he picked up the gibson woman noticed a latemodel lightcolored sedan parked in the company lot around the time the victim was in the bar he thought somebody was inside the sedan if there was the driver mayve gotten a good view of the perps vehicle we should canvass all the employees in the company anderson said to bishop you want to check that out while im at hackers knoll yessir thats what i had in mind another look at his notes then he nodded his crisp hair toward gillette some crime scene techs did find a receipt for a light beer and martini in the trash bins behind the restaurant theyve lifted a couple of prints theyre sending em to the bureau for apis tony mott noticed gillettes frown of curiosity automated fingerprint identification system he explained to the hacker itll search the federal system and then do a statebystate search takes time to do the whole country but if hes been collared for anything in the past eight or nine years well probably get a match although he had a real talent for computers mott was fascinated with what he called real police work and was constantly hounding anderson for a transfer to homicide or major crimes so he could go chase real perps he was undoubtedly the only cybercop in the country who wore as his sidearm a carstopping automatic bishop said theyll concentrate on the west coast first california washington oregon and no gillette said go east to west do new jersey new york massachusetts and north carolina first then illinois and wisconsin then texas do california last why bishop asked those unix commands he typed they were the east coast version patricia nolan explained that there were several versions of the unix operating system using the east coast commands suggested that the killer had atlantic seaboard roots bishop nodded and called this information into headquarters he then glanced at his notebook and said theres one other thing we should add to the profile whats that anderson asked the id division said that it looks like the perp was in an accident of some kind hes missing the tips of most of his fingers hes got enough of the pads to leave prints but the tips end in scar tissue the id tech was thinking maybe hed been injured in a fire gillette shook his head callus the cops looked at him gillette held up his own hands the fingertips were flat and ended in yellow calluses its called a hacker manicure he explained you pound keys twelve hours a day thiss what happens shelton wrote this on the whiteboard gillette said what i want to do now is go online and check out some of the renegade hacking newsgroups and chat rooms whatever the killers doing is the sort of thing thats going to cause a big stir in the underground and no youre not going online anderson told him what nope the cop repeated adamantly i have to no thosere the rules you stay offline wait a minute shelton said he was online i saw him anderson s head swiveled toward the cop he was yeah in that room in the back the lab i looked in on him when he was checking out the victims computer he glanced at anderson i assumed you okayed it no i didnt anderson asked gillette did you log on no gillette said firmly he mustve seen me writing my kludge and thought i was online looked like it to me shelton said youre wrong shelton smiled sourly and appeared unconvinced anderson could have checked out the login files of the ccu computer to find out for certain but then decided that whether or not hed gone online didnt really matter gillettes job here was finished he picked up the phone and called hq weve got a prisoner here to be transferred back to the san jose correctional facility gillette turned toward him dismay in his eyes no he said you cantsend me back ill make sure you get that laptop we promised you no you dont understand i cant stop now weve got to find out what this guy did to get into her machine shelton grumbled you said you couldnt find anything thats exactly the problem if i had found something we could understand it but i cant thats whats so scary about what he did i need to keep going anderson said if we find the killers machine or another victims and if we need you to analyze it well bring you back but the chat rooms the newsgroups the hacker sites there could be a hundred leads there people have to be talking about software like this anderson saw the addicts desperation in gillettes face just as the warden had predicted the cybercop pulled on his raincoat and said firmly well take it from here wyatt and thanks again chapter eight he wasnt going to make it jamie turner realized with dismay the time was nearly noon and he was sitting by himself in the cold dim computer room still in his damp soccer outfit playing in the mist doesnt build character at all booty it just makes you fucking wet but he didnt want to waste the time on a shower and change of clothes when hed been out on the playing field all hed been able to think about was whether the college computer hed hacked into had cracked the outergate passcode and now peering at the monitor through his thick misted glasses he saw that the cray probably wasnt going to spit out the decrypted password in time it would take he estimated another two days to crack the code he thought about his brother about the santana concert about the backstage passes all just out of reach and he felt like crying he began to type some commands to see if he could log on to another of the schools computers a faster one in the physics department but there was a long queue of users waiting to get into that one jamie sat back and out of frustration not hunger wolfed down a package of m ms he felt a painful chill and he looked quickly around the dark musty room he shivered in fear that damn ghost again maybe he should just forget the whole thing he was sick of being scared sick of being cold he should get the hell out of here go hang with dave or totter or some of the guys from french club his hands went to the keyboard to stop cracker and run the cloaking program that would destroy the evidence of his hack then something happened on the screen in front of him the root directory of the colleges computer suddenly appeared way bizarre then all by itself the computer dialed out to another one outside of the school the machines electronically shook hands and a moment later jamie turners cracker and bootys password file were transferred to the second computer how the hell had that happened jamie turner was very savvy in the ways of computers but hed never seen this the only explanation was that the first computer the colleges had some kind of arrangement with other computer departments so that tasks that took a long time were automatically transferred to speedier machines but what was totally weird was that the machine jamies software had been transferred to was the defense research center s massive parallel array of supercomputers in colorado springs one of the fastest computer systems in the world it was also one of the most secure and was virtually impossible to crack jamie knew hed tried it it contained highly classified information and no civilian had ever been allowed to use it in the past jamie supposed theyd started renting out the system to defray the huge cost of maintaining a parallel array ecstatic he peered at the screen and saw that the drcs machines were cracking bootys passcode at a blistering rate well if there was a ghost in his machine he decided maybe it was a good ghost after all maybe it was even a santana fan he laughed to himself jamie now turned to his next task the second hack he needed to complete before the great escape in less than sixty seconds hed transformed himself into a middleaged overworked service tech employed by west coast security systems inc whod unfortunately misplaced the schematic diagram for an wcs model alarmed fire door he was trying to repair and needed some help from the technical supervisor the man was all too happy to oblige phate sitting at his dining room office was watching jamie turners program hard at work in the defense research center s supercomputers where hed just sent it along with the password file unknown to the sysadmins at the drc the huge computers were presently under his root control and were burning about of computer time for the sole purpose of letting a sophomore in high school open a single locked gate phate had examined the progress of the first supercomputer jamie had used at a nearby college and had seen at once that it wasnt going to spit out the passcode in time for the boy to escape from the school for his rendezvous with his brother which meant that hed stay safely tucked away at st francis and phate would lose this round of the game and that wasnt acceptable but as hed known the drcs parallel array would easily crack the code before the deadline if jamie turner had actually gotten to the concert that night which wasnt going to happen now hed have had phate to thank phate then hacked into the san jose city planning and zoning board computer files and found a construction proposal submitted by the principal of st francis academy whod wanted to put up a gated wall and needed p z approval phate downloaded the documents and printed out diagrams of the school itself and the grounds as he was examining the diagrams his machine beeped and a box flashed onto the screen alerting him that hed received an email from shawn he felt the ping of excitement he always did when shawn sent a message this reaction struck him as significant an important insight into phates no make that jon holloways personal development hed grown up in a household where love was as rare as money was plentiful and he knew that hed developed into a cold distant person hed felt this way toward everyone his family fellow workers classmates and the few people hed tried to have relationships with and yet the depth of what phate felt for shawn proved that he wasnt emotionally dead that he had within him a vast well of love eager to read the message he logged off the planning and zoning network and called up the email but as he read the stark words the smile slipped from his face his breath grew rapid his pulse increased oh christ he muttered the gist of the email was that the police were much further along on his trail than hed anticipated they even knew about the killings in portland and virginia then he glanced at the second paragraph and got no further than the reference to milliken park no no he now had a real problem phate rose from his desk and hurried downstairs to the basement of his house he glanced at another smear of dried blood on the floor from the lara gibson character and then opened a footlocker from it he took his dark stained knife he walked to the closet opened it and flicked the light on ten minutes later he was in his jaguar speeding onto the freeway in the beginning god created the advanced research projects agency network which was called arpanet and the arpanet flourished and begat the milnet and the arpanet and the milnet begat the internet and the internet and its issue usenet newsgroups and the world wide web became a trinity that changed the life of his people forever and ever andy anderson whod described the net thus when he taught classes on computer history thought of this slightly toowitty description now as he drove through palo alto and saw stanford university ahead of him for it was at the nearby stanford research institute that the department of defense had established the internets predecessor in to link the sri with ucla the university of california at santa barbara and the university of utah the reverence he felt for the site however faded quickly as he drove on through misty rain and saw the deserted hill of hackers knoll ahead of him in john milliken park normally the place would be crowded with young people swapping software and tales of their cyber exploits today though the cold april drizzle had emptied the place he parked pulled on the rumpled gray rain hat his sixyearold daughter had given him as a birthday present and climbed out of the car striding through the grass as streamers of rain flew from his shoes he was discouraged by the lack of possible witnesses who might have a lead to peter fowler the gunrunner still there was a covered bridge in the middle of the park sometimes kids hung out there when it was rainy or cold but as anderson approached he saw that the bridge too was deserted he paused and looked around the only people here clearly werent hackers an elderly woman walking a dog and a businessman making a cell phone call under the awning of one of the nearby university buildings anderson recalled a coffee shop in downtown palo alto near the hotel california it was a place where geeks gathered to sip strong coffee and swap tales of their outrageous hacks he decided to try the restaurant and see if anyone had heard about peter fowler or somebody selling knives in the area if not hed try the computer science building and ask some of the professors and grad students if theyd seen anybody who then the detective saw motion nearby fifty feet away was a young man walking furtively through the bushes toward the bridge he was looking around uneasily clearly paranoid anderson ducked behind a thick stand of juniper his heart pounding like a pile driver because this was he knew lara gibsons killer he was in his twenties and was wearing the blue jean jacket that mustve shed the denim fibers found on the womans body he had blond hair and was clean shaven the beard and mustache hed worn in the bar had been fake glued on with the theatrical adhesive social engineering then the mans jacket fell away for a moment and anderson could see protruding from the waistband of the mans jeans the knobby hilt of a kabar knife the killer quickly pulled the jacket closed and continued to the covered bridge where he stepped into the shadows and peered out anderson remained out of sight he made a call to the state polices field operations central dispatch a moment later he heard the dispatcher answer and ask for his badge number four three eight nine two anderson whispered in reply request immediate backup ive got a visual on a suspect in a homicide im in john milliken park palo alto southeast corner copy four three eight the man replied is suspect armed i see a knife i dont know about any firearms is he in a vehicle negative anderson said hes on foot at the moment the dispatcher asked him to hold on anderson stared at the killer squinting hard as if that would keep him frozen in place he whispered to central whats the eta of that backup one moment four three eight okay be advised theyll be there in twelve minutes cant you get somebody here faster than that negative four three eight can you stay with him ill try but just then the man began walking again he left the bridge and started down the sidewalk hes on the move central hes heading west through the middle of the park toward some university buildings ill stay with him and keep you posted on his location copy that four three eight cau is on its way cau he wondered what the hell was that again oh right closest available unit hugging the trees and brush anderson moved closer to the bridge keeping out of the killers sight what had he come back here for to find another victim to cover up some traces of the earlier crime to buy more weapons from peter fowler he glanced at his watch less than a minute had passed should he call back and tell the unit to roll up silently he didnt know there were probably procedures for handling this sort of situation procedures that cops like frank bishop and bob shelton would surely know well anderson was used to a very different kind of police work hisstakeouts were conducted sitting in vans staring at the screen of a toshiba laptop connected to a cellscope radio directionalfinding system then he remembered his weapon he looked down at the chunky butt of the clock he pulled it off his hip and pointed it downward finger outside the trigger as he vaguely remembered he ought to do then through the mist he heard a faint electronic trill the killer had gotten a phone call he pulled a cell phone off his belt and held it to his ear he glanced at his watch spoke a few words then he put the phone away and turned back the way hed come hell hes going back to his car the detective thought im going lose him ten minutes till the backup gets here jesus andy anderson decided he had no choice he was going to do something hed never done make an arrest alone chapter nine anderson moved next to a low bush the killer was walking quickly along the path hands in his pockets that was good anderson decided the hands encumbered which would make it more difficult to get to the knife but wait he wondered what if he was hiding a pistol in his pocket okay keep that in mind and remember too that he might have mace or pepper spray or tear gas and remember that he might simply turn and sprint away the cop wondered what hed do then what were the fleeing felon rules could he shoot the killer in the back hed busted dozens of criminals but hed always been backed up by cops like frank bishop for whom guns and highrisk arrests were as routine as compiling a program in c was for anderson the detective now moved closer to the killer thankful the rain was obscuring the sound of his footsteps they were paralleling each other now on opposite sides of a row of tall boxwood anderson kept low and squinted through the rain he got a good look at the killers face an intense curiosity coursed through him what made this young man commit the terrible crimes he was responsible for this curiosity was similar to what he felt when examining software code or puzzling over the crimes ccu investigated but it was stronger now because though he understood the principles of computer science and the crimes that that science made possible a criminal like this was a pure enigma to andy anderson except for the knife except for the gun he might or might not be clutching in his hidden hand the man seemed benign almost friendly the detective wiped his hand on his shirt to dry some of the rain and gripped the pistol firmly once more he continued on thiss a hell of a lot different from taking down hackers at a public terminal in the mall or serving warrants in houses where the biggest dangers were the plates of putrid food sitting stacked next to a teenagers machine closer closer twenty feet farther on their paths would converge soon anderson would have no more cover and hed have to make his move for an instant his courage broke and he stopped he thought of his wife and daughter and how alien he felt here how completely out of his depth he was he thought just follow the killer back to his car get the license plate and follow as best you can but then anderson thought of the deaths this man had caused and the deaths that hed cause again if not stopped this might be their only chance to capture him he started forward again along the path that would intersect with the killers ten feet eight a deep breath watch the hand in the pocket he reminded himself a bird flew close a gull and the killer turned to look at it startled he laughed and that was when anderson burst from the bushes shoving the pistol toward the killer shouting freeze police hand out of your pocket the man spun around to face the detective muttering shit he hesitated for a moment anderson brought the gun even with the killers chest now move slow the hands appeared anderson stared at the fingers what was he holding he almost laughed it was a rabbits foot a lucky key chain drop it he did and then lifted his hands in the resigned familiar way of someone whos been through an arrest before lie down on the ground and keep your arms spread jesus the man spat out jesus how the fuck did you find me do it anderson shouted in a quaking voice the killer lay down on the ground half on the grass and half on the sidewalk anderson was kneeling over him shoving his gun into the mans neck as he put the cuffs on an awkward feat that took several tries he then frisked the killer and relieved him of the kabar knife and cell phone and wallet he had been carrying a small pistol it turned out but that had been in the pocket of his jacket the weapons wallet phone and rabbits foot went into a pile on the grass nearby anderson stepped back his hands shaking from the adrenaline where the fuck dyou come from the man muttered anderson didnt respond but just stared at his prisoner as the shock of what hed done was replaced with euphoria what a story hed have to tell his wife would love it he wanted to tell his little daughter but that would have to wait a few years oh and stan his neighbors who then anderson realized that hed forgotten the miranda warning he didnt want to blow an arrest like this by making a technical mistake he found the card in his wallet and read the words stiffly the killer muttered that he understood his rights officer you okay a mans voice called you need any help anderson glanced behind him it was the businessman hed seen under the awning his dark suit expensivelooking was dampened by the rain ive got a cell phone you need to use it no no thats okay everythings under control anderson turned back to his prisoner he holstered his weapon and pulled out his own cell phone to report in he hit redial but for some reason the call wouldnt go through he glanced at the screen and the phone reported no signal that was odd why and in an instant an instant of pure horror he realized that no street cop in the world wouldve let an unidentified civilian get behind him during an arrest as he groped for his pistol and started to turn the businessman grabbed his shoulder and the detective felt an explosion of pain in his back anderson cried out and dropped to his knees the man stabbed him again with his own kabar knife no please no the man lifted away anderson s gun and kicked him forward onto the wet sidewalk he then walked over to the young man anderson had just handcuffed he rolled him over on his side and looked down man im fucking glad youre here the cuffed man said this guy comes out of nowhere and i thought i was fucked get me out of these things will you i shhhh the businessman said and turned back to the ccu cop who was struggling to reach the terrible pain in his back trying to touch it if he could only touch it then the searing agony would go away the attacker crouched down next to him youre the one anderson whispered to the businessman you killed lara gibson his eyes flicked to the man hed handcuffed and hes fowler the man nodded thats right then he said and youre andy anderson the awe in his voice was genuine i didnt think itd be you coming after me i mean i knew you worked for the computer crimes unit andd be investigating the gibson case but not here not in the field amazing andy anderson youre a total wizard please ive got a family please then the killer did something odd holding the knife in one hand he touched the cops abdomen with the other then he slid his fingers up slowly to the detectives chest counting ribs beneath which his heart was beating so very quickly please anderson pleaded the killer paused and lowered his head to anderson s ear you never know somebody the way you know them at a moment like this he whispered then resumed his eerie reconnaissance of the cops chest ii demons he was a new generation of hacker not the third generation inspired by innocent wonder but a disenfranchised fourth generation driven by anger jonathan littman the watchman chapter ten at pm a tall man in a gray suit walked into the computer crimes unit he was accompanied by a stocky woman wearing a forestgreen pantsuit two uniformed state troopers were beside them their shoulders were damp from the rain and their faces were grim they walked to stephen millers cubicle the tall man said steve miller stood brushed his hand through his thinning hair he said captain bernstein ive got something to tell you the captain said in that tone that wyatt gillette recognized immediately as the precursor to tragic news his look included linda sanchez and tony mott they joined him i wanted to come in person we just found andy andersons body in milliken park it looks like the perp the one in the gibson womans killing got him oh sanchez choked her hand going to her mouth she began to cry not andy no motts face grew dark he muttered something gillette couldnt hear patricia nolan had spent the past half hour sitting with gillette speculating about what software the killer mightve used to invade lara gibsons computer as theyd talked shed opened her purse taken out a small bottle and incongruously started applying nail polish now the tiny brush drooped in her hand oh my god stephen miller closed his eyes momentarily what happened he asked in a shaky voice the door pushed open and frank bishop and bob shelton hurried into the room we heard shelton said we got back here as fast as we could its true the tableau of shocked faces before them though left little doubt sanchez asked through the tears have you talked to his wife oh god and hes got that little girl connie shes only five or six the commander and a counselor are on their way over to the house right now what the hell happened miller repeated captain bernstein said we have a pretty good idea there was a witness a woman walking her dog in the park seems like andyd just collared somebody named peter fowler right shelton said he was the dealer we think supplied the perp with some of his weapons captain bernstein continued only it looks like he mustve thought that fowler was the killer he was blond and wearing a denim jacket those denim fibers crime scene found on lara gibson mustve been stuck to the knife the killer bought from fowler anyway while andy was busy cuffing fowler a white male came up behind him he was late twenties dark hair navy blue suit and carrying a briefcase he stabbed andy in the back the woman went to call for help and that was all she saw the killer stabbed fowler to death too why didnt he call for backup mott asked bernstein frowned well now that was odd we checked his cell phone and the last number hed dialed was to dispatch it was a completed threeminute call but there was no record of central receiving it and none of the dispatchers talked to him nobody can figure out how that happened easy the hacker said the killer cracked the switch youre gillette the captain said he didnt need a nod to verify his identity the tracking anklet was very evident whats that mean cracked the switch he hacked into the cell phone companys computer and had all of andys outgoing calls sent to his own phone probably pretended he was the dispatcher and told him a squad car was on the way then he shut down andys phone service so he couldnt call anyone else for help the captain nodded slowly he did all that jesus what the hellre we up against the best social engineer ive ever heard of gillette said goddamit shelton shouted at him why dont you just can the fucking computer buzzwords frank bishop touched his partners arm said to the captain thisd be my fault sir your fault captain bernstein asked the thin detective what do you mean bishops slow eyes moved from gillette to the floor andy was a whitecollar cop he wasnt qualified for a takedown he was still a trained detective the captain said trainings a lot different than what goes down on the street bishop looked up in my opinion sir the woman whod accompanied bernstein stirred the captain glanced at her and then announced this is detective susan wilkins from homicide in oakland shell be taking over the case shes got a task force of troopers crime scene and tactical up and running at headquarters in san jose turning to bishop the captain said frank ive okayed that request of yours for the marinkill case theres a report that the perps were spotted an hour ago outside a convenience store ten miles south of walnut creek it looks like theyre headed this way he glanced at miller steve youll take over what andy was doing the computer side of the case working with susan of course captain you bet the captain turned to patricia nolan youre the one the commander called us about right the security consultant from that computer outfit horizon online she nodded they asked if youd stay on board too they the powersthatbe in sacramento oh sure id be happy to gillette didnt merit a direct address the captain said to miller the troopers herell take the prisoner back to san jose look gillette protested dont send me back what you need me i have to the captain dismissed him with a wave and turned to susan wilkins gesturing at the whiteboard and talking to her about the case captain gillette called you cant send me back we need his help nolan said emphatically but the captain glanced at the two large troopers whod accompanied him here they cuffed gillette positioned themselves on either side as if he himself were the murderer and started out of the office no gillette protested you dont know how dangerous this man is another look from the captain was all it took the troopers escorted him quickly toward the exit gillette started to ask bishop to intervene but the detective was elsewhere mentally apparently already on his marinkill assignment he stared vacantly at the floor all right gillette heard detective susan wilkins say to miller sanchez and mott im sorry for whats happened to your boss but ive been through this before and im sure youve been through it before and the best way to show that you cared for him is to apprehend this perpetrator and thats what were going to do now i think were all on the same page in terms of our approach im up to speed on the file and the crime scene report and ive got a proactive plan in mind the preliminary report is that detective anderson as well as this fowler individual were stabbed cause of death was trauma to the heart they wait gillette shouted just as he was about to be led out the door wilkins paused bernstein gestured to the cops to get him out but gillette said quickly what about lara gibson was she stabbed in the chest too whats your point bernstein asked was she gillette asked emphatically and the victims in the other killings in portland and in virginia no one said anything for a moment finally bob shelton glanced at the report on the lara gibson killing cause of death was a stab wound to the heart right gillette asked shelton glanced at his partner then to bernstein he nodded tony mott reminded we dont know about virginia and oregon he erased the files itll be the same gillette said i guarantee it shelton asked howd you know that because i know his motive now which is bernstein asked access what does that mean shelton muttered belligerently patricia nolan said thats what all hackersre after access to information to secrets to data when you hack gillette said access is god whats that got to do with the stabbings the killers a mudhead sure tony mott said i know muds miller did too it seemed he was nodding gillette said another acronym it stands for multiuser domain or dimension its a bunch of specialized chat rooms places on the internet where people log on for roleplaying games adventure games knights quests science fiction war the people who play mudsre you know pretty decent businessmen geeks a lot of students professors but three or four years ago there was a big controversy about this game called access i heard about that miller said a lot of internet providers refused to carry it gillette nodded the way it worked was that there was a virtual city it was populated with characters who carried on a normal life going to work dating raising a family whatever but on the anniversary of a famous death like john kennedys assassination or the day lennon was shot or good friday a random number generator picked one of the players to be a killer he had one week to work his way into peoples lives and kill as many of them as he could the killer could pick anyone to be his victim but the more challenging the murder the more points he got a politician with a bodyguard was worth ten points an armed cop was worth fifteen the one limitation on the killer was that he had to get close enough to the victims to stab them in the heart with a knife that was the ultimate form of access jesus thats our perp in a nutshell tony mott said the knife stab wounds to the chest the anniversary dates going after people whore hard to kill he won the game in portland and virginia and here he is playing it in silicon valley the young cop added cynically hes at the expert level level bishop asked in computer games gillette explained you move up in the degree of challenge from the beginning level to the hardest the expert level so this whole thing is a fucking game to him shelton said thats a little hard to believe no patricia nolan said im afraid its pretty easy to believe the fbis behavioral science unit in quantico considers criminal hackers compulsive progressive offenders just like lustdriven serial killers like wyatt said access is god they have to find increasingly intense crimes to satisfy themselves this guys spent so much time in the machine world he probably doesnt see any difference between a digital character and a human being with a glance at the whiteboard nolan continued id even say that to him the machines themselvesre more important than people a human death is nothing a crashed hard drive well thats a tragedy bernstein nodded thats helpful well consider it he nodded at gillette but youve still got to go back to the prison no the hacker cried look were already in deep water getting a federal prisoner released under a john doe order andy was willing to take that risk im not thats all there is to it he pointed at the troopers and they led the hacker out of the dinosaur pen it seemed to gillette that they gripped him harder this time as if they could sense his desperation and desire to flee nolan sighed and shook her head gave a mournful smile of farewell to gillette as he was led out detective susan wilkins started up her monologue again but her voice soon faded as gillette stepped outside the rain was coming down steadily one of the troopers said sorry about that though whether it was for his failed attempt to stay at ccu or the absence of an umbrella gillette didnt know the trooper eased him down into the backseat of the squad car and slammed the door gillette closed his eyes rested his head against the glass heard the hollow sound of the rain pelting the top of the car he felt utter dismay at this defeat lord how close hed come he thought of the months in prison he thought of all the planning hed done wasted it was all the car door opened frank bishop was crouching down water ran down his face glistening on his sideburns and staining his shirt but his sprayed hair at least was impervious to the drops got a question for you sir sir gillette asked whats that that mud stuff thats not hogwash nope the killers playing his own version of that game a reallife version is anybody still playing it now on the internet i mean i doubt it real mudheads were so offended by it that they sabotaged the games and spammed the players until they stopped the detective glanced back at the rusting soda machine in front of the ccu building he then asked that fellow in there stephen miller hes a lightweight isnt he gillette thought for a moment and said hes from the elder days the what the phrase meant the sixties and seventies that revolutionary era in the history of computing that ended more or less with the release of digital equipment corporations pdp the computer that changed the face of the machine world forever but gillette didnt explain this he said simply he was good id guess but hes past his prime now and in silicon valley that means yeah hes a lightweight i see bishop straightened up looking out at the traffic that sped along the nearby freeway he then said to the troopers bring this man back inside please they looked at each other and when bishop nodded emphatically hustled gillette out of the squad car as they walked back into the ccu office gillette heard susan wilkinss voice still droning on liaise with security at mobile america and pac bell if need be and ive established lines of communication with the tactical teams now in my estimation its probably sixtyforty more efficient to be located closer to main resources so well be moving the computer crimes unit to headquarters in san jose i understand youre missing some administrative support in terms of your receptionist and at hq well be able to mitigate that gillette tuned out the words and wondered what bishop was up to the cop walked up to bob shelton with whom he whispered for a moment the conversation ended with bishops asking you with me on this the stocky cop surveyed gillette with a disdainful gaze and then muttered something grudgingly affirmative as wilkins continued to speak captain bernstein frowned and walked up to bishop who said to him id like to run this case sir and i want gillette here to work it with us you wanted the marinkill case i did sir but i changed my mind i know what you said before frank but andys death that wasnt your fault he shouldve known his limits nobody forced him to go after that guy alone i dont care if it was my fault or not thats not what this is about its about collaring a dangerous perp before someone else gets killed captain bernstein caught his meaning and glanced at wilkins susans run major homicides before shes good i know she is sir weve worked together but shes textbook shes never worked in the trenches the way i have i ought to be running the case but the other problem is that were way out of our league here we need somebody sharp on this one the stiff hair nodded toward gillette and i think hes as good as the perp probably he is bernstein muttered but thats not my worry ill ride point on this one sir something goes bad it can all come down on me nobody else has to take any heat patricia nolan joined them and said captain stopping this guys going to take more than fingerprints and canvassing witnesses shelton sighed welcome to the new fucking millennium bernstein reluctantly nodded to bishop okay you got the case youll have full tactical and crime scene backup and pick some people from homicide in san jose to help you huerto ramirez and tim morgan bishop said without hesitating id like them here asap if you could arrange that sir i want to brief everybody the captain called hq to summon the detectives here he hung up theyre on their way bernstein then broke the news to susan wilkins and more perplexed than upset at the loss of the new assignment she left the captain asked bishop you want to move the operation back to headquarters bishop said no well stay here sir he nodded toward a row of computer screens thiss where well do most of the work ive got a feeling well good luck frank bishop said to the troopers whod come to take gillette back to san ho you can take the cuffs off one of the men did this then he pointed at the hackers leg how bout the anklet no bishop said offering a very uncharacteristic smile i think well keep that on a short while later two men joined the team in ccu a broad swarthy latino who was extremely muscular golds gym muscular and a tall sandyhaired detective in one of those stylish fourbutton mens suits dark shirt and dark tie bishop introduced huerto ramirez and tim morgan the detectives from headquarters bishop had requested now id like to say a word bishop said tucking his unruly shirt into his slacks and stepping in front of the team he looked over everybody holding their gazes for a moment this fellow were after hes somebody whos perfectly willing to kill anybody in his way and that includes law enforcers and innocents hes an expert at social engineering a glance toward the newcomers ramirez and morgan which is basically disguise and diversion so its important that you continually remind yourself what we know about him bishop continued his low unhesitant monologue i think we have enough confirmation to place him in his late twenties hes medium build maybe blond but probably darkhaired clean shaven but sometimes disguised with fake facial hair he prefers a kabar as a murder weapon and wants to get close enough to his victims to inflict a fatal chest wound he can break into the phone company and interrupt service or transfer calls he can hack into law enforcement computers gillette now received a glance excuse me crackinto computers and destroy police records he likes challenges he thinks of killing as a game hes spent a lot of time on the east coast and hes somewhere in the silicon valley area but we have no exact locale we think hes bought some items for his disguises at a theatrical supply store on camino real in mountain view hes a progressive lustdriven sociopath whos lost touch with reality and is treating what hes doing like its some big computer game gillette was astonished the detectives back was to the whiteboard as he recited all of this information the hacker realized that hed misjudged the man all the time that the detective had seemed to stare absently out the window or at the floor hed been absorbing the evidence bishop lowered his head but kept his eyes on them all im not going to lose anybody else on this team so watch your backs and dont trust another living soul even people you think you know go on this assumption nothing is what it seems to be gillette found himself nodding along with the others now about his victims we know that hes going after people whore hard to get close to people with bodyguards and security systems the harder to get to the better well have to keep that in mind when were trying to anticipate him were going to keep to the general plan for the investigation huerto and tim i want you two to run the anderson crime scene in palo alto canvass everybody you can find in and around milliken park bob and i didnt get a chance to find that witness who mightve seen the killers vehicle outside the restaurant where ms gibson was killed thats what he and ill do and wyatt youre going to head up the computer side of the investigation gillette shook his head not sure hed understood bishop correctly im sorry you bishop responded are going to head up the computer side of the investigation no further explanation stephen miller said nothing though his eyes stared coldly at the hacker as he continued to pointlessly rearrange the sloppy piles of disks and paperwork on his desk bishop asked should we be worried about him listening to our phones i mean thats how he killed andy patricia nolan replied its a risk i suppose but the killerd have to monitor hundreds of frequencies for the numbers of our cell phones i agree gillette said and even if he cracked the switch hed have to sit with a headset all day long listening to our conversations doesnt sound like hes got the time to do that in the park he was close to andy thats how he got his specific frequency besides as it turned out there wasnt much to do about the risk miller explained that while the ccu did have a scrambler it would only work when the caller on the other end of the line had a scrambler as well as for secure cell phones miller explained theyre five thousand bucks each and said nothing more meaning apparently that such toys werent in the ccu budget and never would be bishop then sent ramirez and the gq cop tim morgan to palo alto after theyd left bishop asked gillette you were telling andy that you thought you could find out more about how this killer got into ms gibsons computer thats right whatever this guy is doing has tove caused some buzz in the hacker underground what ill do is go online and bishop nodded to a workstation just do what you have to do and give us a report in a half hour just like that gillette asked make it less if you can twenty minutes uhm stephen miller stirred what is it the detective asked him gillette was expecting the cybercop to make a comment about his demotion but that wasnt what he had in mind the thing is miller protested andy said he wasnt ever supposed to go online and then theres that court order that said he couldnt it was part of his sentencing thats all true bishop said eyes scanning the whiteboard but andys dead and the court isnt running this case i am he glanced over at gillette with a look of polite impatience so id appreciate it if youd get going chapter eleven wyatt gillette settled himself in the cheap office chair he was in a dim workstation cubicle in the back of the ccu quiet away from the others on the team staring at the blinking cursor on the screen he rolled the chair closer and wiped his hands on his pants then his callused fingertips rose and began pounding furiously on the black keyboard his eyes never left the screen gillette knew the location of every character and symbol on the keyboard and touchtyped a words a minute with perfect accuracy when he was starting to hack years ago he found that eight fingers were too slow so hed taught himself a new keyboarding technique in which he used his thumbs on certain keys too not just reserving them for the space bar weak otherwise his forearms and fingers were pure muscle in prison where most inmates spend hours lifting iron in the yard gillette had done only fingertip pushups to stay in shape for his passion now the plastic keyboard danced under his hammering as he prepared to go online most of todays internet is a combination shopping mall usa today multiplex cinema and amusement park browsers and search engines are populated with cartoon characters and decorated with pretty pictures plenty of those damn ads too the pointandclick technology of the mouse can be mastered by a threeyearold simpleminded help menus await at every new window this is the internet as packaged for the public through the glossy facade of the commercialized world wide web but the real internet the internet of the true hacker lurking behind the web is a wild raw place where hackers use complicated commands telnet utilities and communications software stripped bare as a dragster to sail throughout the world at literally the speed of light this is what wyatt gillette was about to do there was a preliminary matter to take care of though a mythological wizard wouldnt go off on a quest without his magic wands and book of spells and potions computer wizards have to do the same one of the first skills hackers learn is the art of hiding software since you have to assume that an enemy hacker if not the police or fbi will at some point seize or destroy your machine you never leave the only copy of your tools on your hard drive and backup disks in your home you hide them in a distant computer one that has no link to you most hackers store their stash in university computers because their security is notoriously lacking but gillette had spent years working on his software tools writing code from scratch in many cases as well as modifying existing programs to suit his needs itd be a tragedy for him to lose all that work and pure hell for many of the worlds computer users since gillettes programs would help even a mediocre hacker crack into nearly any corporate or government site so he cached his tools in a slightly more secure location than the dataprocessing department of dartmouth or the university of tulsa with a glance behind him now to make sure that no one was shoulder surfing standing behind him and reading the screen he typed a command and linked the ccus computer with another one several states away after a moment these words scrolled onto the screen welcome to the united states air force los alamos nuclear weapons research facility username in response to this request he typed jarmstrong gillettes fathers name was john armstrong gillette it was generally abad idea for a hacker to pick a screen name or username that had any connection with his real life but hed allowed himself this one concession to his human side the computer then asked password he typed xttfllkq which was unlike the username pure stonecold hacker this series of characters had been excruciating to memorize part of his mental daily calisthenics in prison was recalling two dozen passwords as long as this one but it would be impossible for someone to guess and because it was seventeen characters long would take a supercomputer weeks to crack an ibmclone personal computer would have to work continuously for hundreds of years before it spit out a password this complicated the cursor blinked for a moment then the screen shifted and he read welcome capt j armstrong in three minutes hed downloaded a number of files from the fictional captain armstrongs account his weaponry included the famous satan program the security administer tool for analyzing networks used by both sysadmins and hackers to check the hackability of computer networks several breaking and entering programs that would let him grab root access on various types of machines and networks a custommade web browser and newsreader a cloaking program to hide his presence while he was in someone elses computer and which would delete traces of his activities when he logged off sniffer programs that would sniff out find usernames passwords and other helpful information on the net or in someones computer a communications program to send that data back to him encryption programs and lists of hacker web sites and anonymizer sites commercial services that would in effect launder emails and messages so that the recipient couldnt trace gillette the last of the tools he downloaded was a program hed hacked together a few years ago hypertrace which could track down other users on the net with these tools downloaded onto a highcapacity disk gillette logged out of the los alamos site he paused for a moment flexed his fingers and then sat forward pounding on the keys with the subtlety of a sumo wrestler once more gillette entered the net he began the search in the multiuser domains because of the killers apparent motivation playing a real world version of the infamous access game no one gillette queried on the subject however had played access or knew anyone who had or so they claimed still gillette came away with a few leads from the muds he moved to the world wide web which everyone talks about but few could define the www is simply an international network of computers accessed through special computer protocols that let users see graphics and hear sounds and leap through a web site and to other sites by simply clicking on certain places on their screen hyperlinks prior to the web most of the information on the net was in text form and navigating from one site to another was extremely cumbersome the web is still in its adolescence having been born a little over a decade ago at cern the swiss physics institute gillette searched through the underground hacking sites on the web the eerie tenderloin districts of the net gaining entry to some of these sites required an answer to an esoteric question on hacking finding and clicking on a microscopic dot on the screen or supplying a passcode none of these barriers though barred wyatt gillette for more than a minute or two from site to site to site losing himself further and further in the blue nowhere prowling through computers that might have been in moscow or cape town or mexico city or right next door in cupertino or santa clara gillette sped through this world so quickly that he was reluctant to take his fingers off the keys for fear of losing his stride so rather than jotting notes with pen and paper as most hackers did he copied material he thought was useful and pasted it into a wordprocessing window he kept open on the screen from the web he searched the usenet the collection of newsgroups in which people interested in a particular subject can post messages pictures programs movies and sound clips gillette scoured the classic hacking newsgroups like alt althack altvirus and altbinarieshackingutilities cutting and pasting whatever seemed relevant he found references to dozens of newsgroups that hadnt existed when hed gone to jail he jumped to those groups scrolled through them and found mention of still others more scrolling more reading more cutting and pasting a snap under his fingers and on the screen he saw mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm one of his powerful keystrokes had jammed the keyboard which had often happened when hed been hacking gillette unplugged it tossed it on the floor behind him hooked up another keyboard and started typing again he then moved to the internet relay chat rooms the irc was an unregulated noholdsbarred series of networks where you could find realtime discussions among people who had similar interests you typed your comment hit the enter key and your words appeared on the screens of everyone who was logged into the room at that time he logged into the room hack the rooms were designated by a number sign followed by a descriptive word it was in this same room where hed spent thousands of hours sharing information arguing and joking with fellow hackers around the world after the irc gillette began searching through the bbs bulletin boards which are like web sites but can be accessed for only the cost of a local phone call no internet service provider is required many were legitimate but many others with names like deathhack and silent spring were the darkest parts of the online world completely unregulated and unmonitored these were the places to go for recipes for bombs and poisonous gases and debilitating computer viruses that would wipe the hard drives of half the population of the world following the leads losing himself in web sites newsgroups chat rooms and archives hunting this is what lawyers do when they paw through hoary old shelves searching for that one case that will save their client from execution what sportsmen do easing through the grass toward where they thought they heard the snarl of a bear what lovers do seeking the core of each others lust except that hunting in the blue nowhere isnt like searching library stacks or a field of tall grass or on your mates smooth flesh its like prowling through the entire everexpanding universe which contains not only the known world and its unshared mysteries but worlds past and worlds yet to come endless snap he had broken another key the allimportant e gillette flung this keyboard into the corner of the cubicle where it joined its dead friend he plugged in a new one and kept going at pm gillette emerged from the cubicle his back was racked with pure fiery pain from sitting frozen in one place yet he could still feel the exhilarating rush from that brief time hed spent online and the fierce reluctance at leaving the machine in the main part of the ccu he found bishop talking with shelton the others were on telephones or standing around the whiteboard looking over the evidence bishop noticed gillette first and fell silent ive found something the hacker said holding up a stack of printouts tell us dumb it down shelton reminded whats the bottom line the bottom line gillette responded is that theres somebody named phate and weve got a real problem chapter twelve fate frank bishop asked a gillette said thats his username his screen name only he spells it phate like ph phishing remember the way hackers do its all in the spelling whats his real name patricia nolan asked i dont know nobody seems to know much about him hes a loner but the people whove heard of himre scared as hell a wizard stephen miller asked definitely a wizard bishop asked why do you think hes the killer gillette flipped through the printouts heres what i found phate and a friend of his somebody named shawn wrote some software called trapdoor now trapdoor in the computer world means a hole built into a security system that lets the software designers get back inside to fix problems without needing a passcode phate and shawn use the same name for their script but thiss a little different its a program that somehow lets them get inside anybodys computer trapdoor bishop mused like a gallows too like a gallows gillette echoed nolan asked how does it work gillette was about to explain it to her in the language of the initiated then glanced at bishop and shelton dumb it down the hacker walked to one of the blank whiteboards and drew a chart he said the way information travels on the net isnt like on a telephone everything sent online an email music you listen to a picture you download the graphics on a web site is broken down into small fragments of data called packets when your browser requests something from a web site it sends packets out into the internet at the receiving end the web server computer reassembles your request and then sends its response also broken into packets back to your machine whyre they broken up shelton asked nolan answered so that a lot of different messages can be sent over the same wires at the same time also if some of the packets get lost or corrupted your computer gets a notice about it and resends just the problem packets you dont have to resend the whole message gillette pointed to his diagram and continued the packets are forwarded through the internet by these routers huge computers around the country that guide the packets to their final destination routers have real tight security but phates managed to crack into some of them and put a packetsniffer inside which bishop said looks for certain packets i assume exactly gillette continued it identifies them by somebodys screen name or the address of the machines the packetsre coming from or going to when the sniffer finds the packets its been waiting for it diverts them to phates computer once theyre there phate adds something to the packets gillette asked miller you ever heard of stenanography the cop shook his head tony mott and linda sanchez werent familiar with the term either but patricia nolan said thats hiding secret data in say pictures or sound files youre sending online spy stuff right gillette confirmed encrypted data is woven right into the file itself so that even if somebody intercepts your email and reads it or looks at the picture youve sent all theyll see is an innocentlooking file and not the secret data well thats what phates trapdoor software does only it doesnt hide messages in the files it hides an application a working program nolan said yep then he sends it on its way to the victim nolan shook her head her pale doughy face revealed both shock and admiration her voice was hushed with awe as she said no ones ever done that before whats this software that he sends bishop asked its a demon gillette answered drawing a second diagram to show how trapdoor worked demon shelton asked theres a whole category of software called bots gillette explained short for robots and thats just what they are software robots once theyre activated they run completely on their own without any human input they can travel from one machine to another they can reproduce they can hide they can communicate with other computers or people they can kill themselves gillette continued demons are a type of bot they sit inside your computer and do things like run the clock and automatically back up files scut work but the trapdoor demon does something a lot scarier once its inside your computer it modifies the operating system and when you go online it links your computer to phates and he seizes root bishop said exactly oh this is bad linda sanchez muttered man nolan twined more of her unkempt hair around a finger beneath the fragile designer glasses her green eyes were troubled as if shed just seen a terrible accident so if you surf the web read a news story read an email pay a bill listen to music download pictures look up a stock quotation if youre online at all phate can get inside your computer yep anything you get via the internet might have the trapdoor demon in it but what about firewalls miller asked why dont they stop it firewalls are computer sentries that keep files or data you havent requested out of your machine gillette explained thats whats brilliant about this because the demons hidden in data that youve asked for firewalls wont stop it brilliant bob shelton muttered sarcastically tony mott drummed his fingers absently on his bike helmet hes breaking rule number one which is bishop asked gillette recited leave the civilians alone mott nodding continued hackers feel that the government corporations and other hackers are fair game but you should never target the general public sanchez asked is there any way to tell if hes inside your machine only little things your keyboard seems a little sluggish the graphics look a little fuzzy a game doesnt respond quite as quickly as usual your hard drive engages for a second or two when it shouldnt nothing so obvious that most peopled notice shelton asked how come you didnt find this demon thing in lara gibsons computer i did only what i found was its corpse digital gibberish phate built some kind of selfdestruct into it if the demon senses youre looking for it it rewrites itself into garbage how did you find all this out bishop asked gillette shrugged pieced it together from these he handed bishop the printouts bishop looked at the top sheet of paper to group from triplex i heard that titan was asking for a copy of trapdoor dont do it man forget you heard about it i know about phate and shawn theyre dangerous im not kidding whos he shelton asked triplex be good to have a talk with him in person i dont have any clue what his real name is or where he lives gillette said maybe he was in some cybergang with phate and shawn bishop flipped through the rest of the printouts all of which gave some detail or rumor about trapdoor triplexs name was on several of them nolan tapped one can we trace the information in the header back to triplexs machine gillette explained to bishop and shelton headers in newsgroup postings and emails show the route the message took from the senders computer to the recipients theoretically you can look at a header and trace a message back to find the location of the senders machine but i checked these already nodding at the sheet theyre fake most serious hackers falsify the headers so nobody can find them so its a dead end shelton muttered i just read everything quickly we should look at them again carefully gillette said nodding at the printouts then im going to hack together a bot of my own itll search for any mention of the words phate shawn trapdooror triplex a fishing expedition bishop mused ph phishing its all in the spelling tony mott said lets call cert see if theyve heard anything about this although the organization itself denied it every geek in the world knew that these initials stood for the computer emergency response team located on the carnegie mellon campus in pittsburgh cert was a clearinghouse for information about viruses and other computer threats it also warned systems administrators of impending hacker attacks after the organization was described to him bishop nodded lets give them a call nolan added but dont say anything about wyatt certs connected with the department of defense mott made the call and spoke to someone he knew at the organization after a brief conversation he hung up theyve never heard about trapdoor or anything similar they want us to keep them posted linda sanchez was staring at the picture of andy andersons daughter on his desk in a troubled whisper she said so nobody who goes online is safe gillette looked into the womans round brown eyes phate can find out every secret youve got he can impersonate you or read your medical records he can empty your bank accounts make illegal political contributions in your name give you a phony lover and send your wife or husband copies of fake love letters he could get you fired or patricia nolan added softly he could kill you mr holloway are you with us mr holloway huh huh huh is that the response of a respectful student ive asked you twice to answer the question and youre staring out the window if you dont do the assignments were going to have a prob what was the question again let me finish young man if you dont do the assignments then were going to have some problems do you know how many deserving studentsre on the waiting list to get into this school of course you dont and you dont care either did you read the assignment not exactly not exactly i see well the question is define the octal number system and give me the decimal equivalent of the octal numbers and but why do you want to know the question if you havent read the assignment you can hardly answer the octal system is a number system with eight digits like the decimal system has ten and the binary system has two so you remember something from the discovery channel mr holloway no i if you know so much why dont you come up to the board and try to convert those numbers for us up to the board up you go i dont need to write it out the octal number converts to decimal you made a mistake with the second number isnt an octal number theres no digit in the octal system only zero through seven i didnt make a mistake it was a trick question to see if the class was on its toes if you say so okay mr holloway time for a visit to the principal sitting in the dining room office of his house in los altos listening to a cd of james earl jones in othello phate was roaming through the files of the young character jamie turner and planning that evenings visit to st francis academy but thinking of the student had brought back memories of his own academic history like this difficult recollection of freshman high school math phates early schooling fell into a very predictable pattern for the first semester hed get straight as but in the spring his grades would plunge to ds or fs this was because he could stave off the boredom of school for the first three or four months but after that even going to class was too tedious for him and hed invariably miss most of the secondsemester then his parents would ship him off to a new school and the same thing would happen again mr holloway are you with us well that had been phates problem all along no basically he hadnt been with anyone ever he was lightyears ahead of them his teachers and counselors would try theyd put him into giftedandtalented classes and then advanced g t programs but even those didnt hold his interest and when he grew bored he became sadistic and vicious his teachers like poor mr cummings the freshman math teacher of the octal number incident stopped calling on him for fear that hed mock them and their own limitations after some years of this his parents both scientists themselves pretty much gave up busy with their own lives dad an electrical engineer mom a chemist for a cosmetics company they were happy to hand off their boy to a series of tutors after school in effect buying themselves a couple of extra hours at their respective jobs they took to bribing phates brother richard two years older into keeping him occupied which usually amounted to dropping the boy off on the atlantic city boardwalk video arcades or at nearby shopping malls with a hundred dollars in quarters at am and picking him up twelve hours later as for his fellow students they of course disliked him on first meeting he was the brain he was jon the head he was mr wizard they avoided him during the early days of class and as the semester wore on teased and insulted him unmercifully at least no one bothered to beat him up because as one football player said a fucking girl could pound the crap out of him im not gonna bother and so to keep the pressure inside his whirling brain from blowing him to pieces he spent more and more time in the one place that challenged him the machine world since mom and dad were happy to spend money to keep him out of their hair he always had the best personal computers that were available a typical high school day would find him tolerating classes then racing home at three pm and disappearing into his room where he would launch himself into bulletin boards or crack the phone companys switches or slip into the computers of the national science foundation the centers for disease control the pentagon los alamos harvard and cern his parents weighed the monthly phone bills against the alternative missed work and an endless series of meetings with teachers and counselors and happily opted to write a check to new jersey bell still though it was obvious that the boy was on a downward spiral his increasing reclusiveness and vicious outbursts whenever he wasnt online but before he bottomed out and as hed thought back then did a socrates with some clever poison whose recipe hed downloaded from the net something happened the sixteenyearold stumbled onto a bulletin board where people were playing a mud game this particular one was a medieval game knights on a quest for a magic sword or ring that sort of thing he watched for a while and then shyly keyed can i play one of the seasoned players welcomed him warmly and then asked who do you want to be young jon decided to be a knight and went off happily with his band of brothers killing orcs and dragons and enemy troops for the next eight hours that night as he lay in bed after signing off he couldnt stop thinking about that remarkable day it occurred to him that he didnt have to be jon the head he didnt have to be the scorned mr wizard all day long hed been a knight in the mythical land of cyrania and hed been happy maybe in the real world he could be someone else too who do you want to be the next day he signed up for an extracurricular activity at school something hed never done before what he picked was drama club he soon learned that he had a natural ability to act the rest of his time at that particular school didnt improve there was too much bad blood between jon and his teachers and fellow students but he didnt care he had a plan at the end of the semester he asked his parents if he could transfer to yet a different school for the next his junior year since he said hed take care of all the paperwork himself and the transfer wouldnt disrupt their lives they agreed the next fall among the eager students registering for classes at thomas jefferson high school for the gifted was a particularly eager youngster named jon patrick holloway the teachers and counselors reviewed the documentation emailed to them from his prior schools the transcripts which showed his consistent b performance in all grades since kindergarten counselors glowing reports describing a welladjusted and socialized child his outstanding placement test scores and a number of recommendation letters from his former teachers the inperson interview with the polite young man cutting quite a figure in tan slacks powder blue shirt and navy blazer went very well and he was heartily welcomed into the school the boy always did his assignments and rarely missed a class he was consistently in the upperb and lowera range pretty much like the other students at tom jefferson he worked out diligently and took up several sports hed sit on the grassy hill outside the school where the incrowd gathered and sneak cigarettes and make jokes about the geeks and losers he dated went to dances worked on homecoming floats just like everybody else he sat in susan coynes kitchen and fumbled under her blouse and tasted her braces he and billy pickford took his dads vintage corvette out onto the highway where they got the car up to a hundred and then sped home where they dismantled and reset the odometer he was happy some moody some boisterous some just like everybody else at the age of seventeen jon holloway social engineered himself into one of the most normal and popular kids in school he was so popular in fact that the funeral of his parents and brother was one of the most widely attended in the history of the small new jersey town where they were living it was a miracle friends of the family remarked that young jon just happened to be taking his computer to a repair shop early saturday morning when the tragic gas explosion took the lives of his family jon holloway had looked at life and decided that god and his parents had fucked him up so much that the only way he could survive was to see it as a mud game and he was now playing again who do you want to be in the basement of his pleasant suburban house in los altos phate washed the blood off his kabar knife and began sharpening it enjoying the hiss of the blade against the sharpening steel hed bought at williamssonoma this was the same knife hed used to tease to stillness the heart of an important character in the game andy anderson hiss hiss hiss access as he swiped the knife against the steel phates perfect memory recalled a passage from the article life in the blue nowhere which hed copied into one of his hacking notebooks several years ago the line between the real world and the machine world is becoming more and more blurred every day but its not that humans are turning into automatons or becoming slaves to machines no humans and machines are simply growing toward each other were bending machines to our purposes and nature in the blue nowhere machines are taking on our personalities and culture our language myths metaphors philosophy and spirit and those personalities and cultures are in turn being changed more and more by the machine world itself think about the loner who used to return home from work and spend the night eating junk food and watching tv all night now he turns on his computer and enters the blue nowhere a place where he interacts he has tactile stimulation on the keyboard verbal exchanges hes challenged he cant be passive anymore he has to provide input to get some response hes entered a higher level of existence and the reason is that machines have come to him they speak his language for good or bad machines now reflect human voices spirits hearts and goals for good or bad they reflect human conscience or the lack of conscience too phate finished honing the blade and wiped it clean he replaced it in his footlocker and returned upstairs to find that his taxpayer dollars had been well spent the defense research center s supercomputers had just finished running jamie turners program and had spit out the passcode to st francis academy s gates he was going to get to play his game tonight for good or bad after twenty minutes of poring over the printouts from gillettes search the team could find no other leads the hacker sat down at a workstation to write code for the bot that would continue to search the net for him then he paused and looked up theres one thing we have to do sooner or later phates going to realize that youve got a hacker looking for him and he might try to come after us he turned to stephen miller what external networks do you have access to from here two the internet through our own domain cspccugov thats the one youve been using to get online then were also hooked to islenet sanchez explained the acronym thats the integrated statewide law enforcement network is it quarantined a quarantined network was made up of machines connected only to one another and only by hardwire cables so that no one could hack in via a phone line or the internet no miller said you can log on from anywhere but you need passcodes and have to get through a couple of firewalls what outside networks could i get to from islenet sanchez shrugged any state or federal police system around the country the fbi secret service atf nypd even scotland yard and interpol the works mott added since were a clearing house for all computer crimes in the state ccu has root authority on islenet so we have access to more machines and networks than anybody else gillette said then well have to cut our links to it hey hey hey backspace backspace miller said using the hacker term for hold on a minute cut the link to islenet we cant do that we have to why bishop asked because if phate gets inside them with a trapdoor demon he could jump right to islenet if he does that hell have access to every law enforcement network its connected to itd be a disaster but we use islenet a dozen times a day shelton protested the automatic fingerprint identification databases warrants suspect records case files research wyatts right patricia nolan said remember that this guys already cracked vicap and two state police databases we cant risk him getting into any other systems gillette said if you need to use islenet youll have to go to some other location headquarters or wherever thats ridiculous stephen miller said we cant drive five miles to log on to a database itll add hours to the investigation were already swimming upstream here shelton said this perp is way ahead of us he doesnt need any more advantages he glanced at bishop imploringly the lean detective glanced down at his sloppy shirttail and tucked it in after a moment he said go ahead do what he says cut the connection sanchez sighed gillette quickly keyed in the commands severing the outside links as stephen miller and tony mott looked on unhappily he also renamed the ccu domain caltourismgov to make it much harder for phate to track them down and crack their system when he finished the job he looked up at the team one more thing from now on nobody goes online but me why shelton asked because i can sense if the trapdoor demons in our system how the roughfaced cop asked sourly psychic friends hotline gillette answered evenly the feel of the keyboard the delays in the systems responses the sounds of the hard drive what i mentioned before shelton shook his head he asked bishop youre not going to agree to that are you first we werent supposed to let him get near the net at all but he ended up roaming all over the fucking world online now hes telling us that hes the only one who can do that and we cant thats backwards frank somethings going on here whats going on gillette argued is that i know what im doing when youre a hacker you get the feel for machines agreed bishop said shelton lifted his arms helplessly stephen miller didnt look any happier tony mott caressed the grip of his big gun and seemed to be thinking less about machines and more about how much he wanted a clear shot at the killer bishops phone rang and he took the call he listened for a moment and while he didnt exactly smile the cops face grew animated he picked up a pen and paper and started taking notes after five minutes of jotting he hung up and glanced at the team we dont have to call him phate anymore weve got his name chapter thirteen jon patrick holloway its holloway patricia nolans voice rose in surprise you know him bishop asked oh you bet most of us in computer security do but nobodys heard from him in years i thought hed gone legit or was dead bishop said to gillette it was thanks to you we found him that suggestion about the east coast version of unix the massachusetts state police had positive matches on the prints bishop read his notes ive got a little history hes twentyseven born in new jersey parents and only sibling a brother are dead he went to rutgers and princeton good grades brilliant computer programmer popular on campus involved in a lot of activities after he graduated he came out here and got a job at sun microsystems doing artificial intelligence and supercomputing research left there and went to nec then he went to work for apple over in cupertino a year later he was back on the east coast doing advanced phoneswitch design at western electric in new jersey then he got a job with harvards computer science lab looks like he was pretty much your perfect employee team player united way campaign captain things like that typical upper middleclass silicon valley codeslingerchipjockey mott summarized bishop nodded except there was one problem all the while he looked like he was mr upstanding citizen hed been hacking at night and running cybergangs the most famous was the knights of access he founded that with another hacker somebody named valleyman no record of his real name the koa miller said troubled they were bad news they took on masters of evil that gang from austin and the deceptors in new york he cracked both gangs servers and sent their files to the fbis manhattan office got half of them arrested the knights were probably the gang that shut down nineoneone in oakland for two days looking through his notes bishop said a few people died because of that medical emergencies that never got reported but the da could never prove they did it pricks shelton spat out bishop continued holloway didnt go by phate then his username was certaindeath he asked gillette do you know him not personally but ive heard of him every hacker has he was at the top of the list of wizards a few years ago bishop returned to his notes somebody snitched on him when he was working for harvard and the massachusetts state police paid him a visit his whole life turned out to be fake hed been ripping off software and supercomputer parts from harvard and selling them the police checked with western electric sun nec all his other employers and it seemed hed been doing the same thing there he jumped bail in massachusetts and nobodys seen or heard from him for three or four years mott said lets get the files from the mass state police theres bound to be some good forensics in there that we can use theyre gone bishop replied he destroyed those files too linda sanchez asked grimly what else bishop replied sarcastically then glanced at gillette can you change that hot of yours the search program and add the names holloway and valleyman piece of cake gillette began keying in code once more bishop called huerto ramirez and spoke to him for a few moments when they hung up he said to the team huerto said therere no leads from the andy anderson crime scene hes going to run the name jon patrick holloway through vicap and state networks be faster to just use islenet here stephen miller muttered bishop ignored the dig and continued then hes going to get a copy of holloways booking picture from massachusetts he and tim morgan are going to leave some pictures around mountain view near the theatrical supply store in case phate goes shopping then theyll call all the employers phate used to work for and get any internal reports on the crimes assuming they havent been deleted too sanchez muttered pessimistically bishop looked up at the clock it was nearly he shook his head weve gotta move if his goal is killing as many people as he can in a week he might already have somebody else targeted he picked up a marker and began transcribing his handwritten notes on the whiteboard patricia nolan nodded at the board where the word trapdoor was prominently written in black marker she said thats the crime of the new century violation violation in the twentieth century people stole your money now what gets stolen is your privacy your secrets your fantasies access is god but on one level gillette reflected youve got to admit that trapdoors brilliant its a totally robust program a voice behind him asked angrily robust what does that mean gillette wasnt surprised to find that the questioner was bob shelton i mean its simple and powerful software jesus shelton said it sounds like you wish youd invented the fucking thing gillette said evenly its an astonishing program i dont understand how it works and id like to thats all im curious about it curious you happen to forget a little matter like hes killing people with it i you asshole its a game to you too isnt it just like him he stalked out of ccu calling to bishop lets get the hell out of here and find that witness thats how were going to nail this prick not with this computer shit he stormed off no one moved for a moment the team looked awkwardly at the whiteboard or computer terminals or the floor bishop nodded for gillette to follow him into the pantry where the detective poured some coffee into a styrofoam cup jennie thats my wife keeps me rationed bishop said glancing at the dark brew love the stuff but ive got gut problems preulcer the doctor says is that a crazy way to put it or what sounds like im in training ive got reflux gillette said he touched his upper chest lot of hackers do from all the coffee and soda look about bob shelton he had a thing happen a few years ago the detective sipped the coffee glanced down at his blossoming shirt he tucked it in yet again i read those letters in your court file the emails your father sent to the judge as part of the sentencing hearing it sounds like you two have a good relationship real good yeah gillette said nodding especially after my mom passed away well then i think youll understand this bob had a son had he loved the kid a lot like your dad loves you sounds like only the kid was killed in a car accident a few years ago he was sixteen bob hasnt been the same since then i know its a lot to ask but try to cut him some slack im sorry about that gillette thought suddenly about his own exwife how hed spent hours and hours in prison wishing he were still married wishing that he and ellie had had a son or daughter wondering how the hell hed screwed up so badly and ruined his chances for a family ill try appreciate that they walked back to the main room gillette returned to his workstation bishop nodded toward the parking lot bob and ill be checking out that witness at vestas grill detective tony mott said standing up how bout if i come along with you why bishop asked frowning thought i could help youve got the computer side covered here with wyatt and patricia and stephen i could help canvassing witnesses maybe you ever do any canvassing sure after a few seconds he grinned well not postcrime on the street exactly but ive interviewed plenty of people online well maybe later tony i think bob and ill just go alone on this one he left the office the young cop returned to his workstation clearly disappointed gillette wondered if he was upset that hed been left to report to a civilian or if he really wanted to get a chance to use that very large pistol of his the butt of which kept nicking the office furniture in five minutes gillette had finished hacking together his bot its ready he announced he went online and typed the commands to send his creation out into the blue nowhere patricia nolan leaned forward staring at the screen good luck she whispered godspeed like a ship captains wife bidding her husband farewell as his vessel pulled out of port on a treacherous voyage to uncharted waters another beep on his machine phate looked up from the architectural diagram hed downloaded st francis academy and the grounds surrounding it and saw another message from shawn he opened the mail and read it more bad news the police had learned his real name he was momentarily concerned but then decided this wasnt critical jon patrick hollow ay was hidden beneath so many layers of fake personas and addresses that there were no links to him as phate still the police could get their hands on a picture of him some parts of our past cant be erased with a delete command and theyd undoubtedly distribute it throughout silicon valley but at least he was now forewarned hed use more disguises anyway what was the point of playing a mud game if it wasnt challenging he glanced at the clock on his computer time to get to st francis academy for tonights game he had over two hours but hed have to stake out the school to see if the patrol routes of the security guards had changed besides he knew little jamie turner might be feeling antsy and want to slip out of the school before the appointed hour for a stroll around the block while he waited for his brother phate walked down to the basement of his house and took what he needed from his footlocker his knife a pistol some duct tape then he went into the downstairs bathroom and pulled a plastic bottle from under the sink it contained some liquids hed mixed together earlier he could still detect the pungent aroma of the chemicals it contained when his tools were ready he returned to the dining room of his house and checked the computer once more in case there were more warnings from shawn but he had no messages he logged off and left the room shutting out the overhead light in the dining room as he did so the screen saver on his computer came on and glowed brightly in the dim room the words scrolled up the screen slowly they read access is god chapter fourteen here brought you this gillette turned patricia nolan was offering him a cup of coffee milk and sugar right he nodded thanks i noticed thats how you like it she said he was about to tell her how prisoners in san ho would trade cigarettes for packages of real coffee and brew it in hot water from the tap but as interesting as this trivia might be he decided he wasnt eager to remind everyone himself included that he was a convict she sat down beside him tugged at the ungainly knit dress pulled the nail polish out of her louis vuitton purse again and opened it nolan noticed him looking at the bottle conditioner she explained all the keying is hell on my nails she glanced into his eyes once then looked down examining her fingertips carefully she said i could cut them short but thats not part of my plan there was a certain emphasis on the word plan as if shed decided to share something personal with him facts that he however wasnt sure he wanted to know she said i woke up one morning earlier this year new years day as a matter of fact after id spent the holiday on a plane by myself and i realized that im a thirtyfouryearold single geek girl who lives with a cat and twenty thousand dollars worth of semiconductor products in her bedroom i decided i was changing my ways im no fashion model but i thought id fix some of the things that could be fixed nails hair weight i hate exercise but im at the health club every morning at five the stepaerobics queen at seattle health and racquet well youve got really nice nails gillette said thanks really good thigh muscles too she said with averted eyes he decided that her plan should probably include a little work on flirtation she could use some practice she asked you married divorced nolan said i came close once she let it go at that but glanced at him to gauge his reaction gillette gave her no response but he thought dont waste your time on me lady im a nowin proposition yet at the same time he saw that her interest in him was palpable and wyatt gillette knew that it didnt matter that he was a skinny obsessive geek with a year left on a prison term hed seen her adoring gaze as hed hacked together his bot and he knew that her attraction to him was rooted in his mind and his passion for his craft whichll ultimately beat a handsome face and a chippendale body any day but the topic of romance and single life put in his mind thoughts of his exwife elana and that depressed him he fell silent and nodded as nolan told him about life at horizon online which really was she kept asserting more stimulating than he might think though nothing she said bore out that proposition about life in seattle with friends and her tabby cat about the bizarre dates shed had with geeks and chipjocks he absorbed all the data politely if vacantly for ten minutes then his machine beeped loudly and gillette glanced at the screen search results search request phate location altpicturestruecrime status newsgroup reference my bot caught a fish he called theres a reference to phate in a newsgroup newsgroups those collections of specialinterest messages on every topic under the sun are contained on a subdivision of the internet known as usenet which stands for unix user network started in to send messages between the university of north carolina and duke university the usenet was purely scientific at first and contained strict prohibitions against topics like hacking sex and drugs in the eighties though a number of users thought these limitations smacked of censorship the great rebellion ensued which led to the creation of the alternate category of newsgroups from then on the usenet was like a frontier town you can now find messages on every subject on earth from hardcore porn to literary criticism to catholic theology to pronazi politics to irreverent swipes at popular culture such as altbarneythedinosaurmustdie gillettes bot had learned that someone had posted a message that included phates name in one of these alternate newsgroups altpicturestruecrime and had alerted its master the hacker loaded up his newsgroup reader and went online he found the group and then examined the screen somebody with the screen name vlast had posted a message that mentioned phates name hed included a picture attachment mott miller and nolan crowded around the screen gillette clicked on the message he glanced at the header from vlast newsgroups altpicturestruecrime subject a old one from phate anyboddy have others date april lines messageid hjdfnewsgsvrpddcouk references engfmlhcfcom nntppostinghost modemflonasedialuppolcouk

pestusenetservercomnewsoutusenetservercomdiablotheworldnetnewstheworldnetnewsposttheworldnet then he read the message that vlast had sent to the group i am receved this from our friend phate it was sixths months ago i am not hearing from him after then can anyboddy post more like this vlast tony mott observed look at the grammar and spelling hes from overseas the language people used on the net told a great deal about them english was the most common choice but serious hackers mastered a number of languages especially german dutch and french so they could share information with as many fellow hackers as possible gillette downloaded the picture that accompanied vlasts message it was an old crime scene photograph and showed a young womans naked body stabbed a dozen times linda sanchez undoubtedly mindful of her own daughter and her fetal grandchild looked at the picture once and then quickly away disgusting she muttered it was gillette agreed but he forced himself to think past the image lets try to trace this guy he suggested if we can get to him maybe he can give us some leads to phate there are two ways to trace someone on the internet if you have the real header of an email or newsgroup posting you can examine the path notation which will reveal where the message entered the internet and the route it followed to get to the computer from which you have downloaded it if presented with a court order the sysadmin of that initial network might give the police the name and address of the user who sent the message usually though hackers use fake headers so that they cant be traced vlasts header gillette noted immediately was bogus real internet routes contain only lowercase words and this one contained uppercase and lowercase he told the ccu team this then added however that hed try to find vlast with the second type of trace through the mans internet address vlasteuronetnet gillette loaded up hypertrace he typed in vlasts address and the program went to work a map of the world appeared and a dotted line moved outward from san jose the location of ccus computer across the pacific every time it hit a new internet router and changed direction the machine gave an electronic tone called a ping named after a submarines sonar beep which is just what it sounded like nolan said this is your program right its brilliant yeah it was a fun hack gillette said noting that his prowess had earned him a bit more adoration from the woman the line representing the route from ccu to vlasts computer headed west and finally stopped in central europe ending in a box that contained a question mark gillette looked at the graph and tapped the screen okay vlast isnt online at the moment or hes cloaking his machines location thats the question mark where the trail ends the closest we can get is his service provider euronetbulgnet hes logging on through euronets bulgarian server i shouldve guessed that nolan and miller nodded their agreement bulgaria probably has more hackers per capita than any other country after the fall of the berlin wall and the demise of central european communism the bulgarian government tried to turn the country into the silicon valley of the former soviet bloc and imported thousands of codeslingers and chipjocks to their dismay however ibm apple microsoft and other us companies swept through the world markets foreign tech companies failed in droves and the young geeks were left with nothing to do except hang out in coffee shops and hack bulgaria produces more computer viruses annually than any other country in the world nolan asked miller do the bulgarian authorities cooperate never the government doesnt even answer our requests for information stephen miller then suggested why dont we email him directly vlast no gillette said he might warn phate i think thiss a dead end but just then the computer beeped as gillettes hot signaled yet another catch search results search request triplex location irc hack status currently online triplex was the hacker gillette had tracked down earlier the one who seemed to know a great deal about phate and trapdoor hes in the hacking chat room on the internet relay chat gillette said i dont know if hell give up anything about phate to a stranger but lets try to trace him he asked miller ill need an anonymizer before i log on id have to modify mine to run on your system an anonymizer or cloak is a software program that blocks any attempts to trace you when youre online by making it appear that youre someone else and are in a different location from where you really are sure i just hacked one together the other day miller loaded the program into the workstation in front of gillette if triplex tries to trace you all hell see is that youre logging on through a publicaccess terminal in austin thats a big hightech area and a lot of texas u students do some serious hacking good gillette returned to the keyboard examined millers program briefly and then keyed his new fake username renegade into the anonymizer he looked at the team okay lets go swimming with some sharks he said and hit the enter key thats where it was said the security guard parked right there a lightcolored sedan was there for about an hour just around the time that girl was kidnapped im pretty sure somebody was in the front seat the guard pointed to a row of empty parking spaces in the lot behind the threestory building occupied by internet marketing solutions unlimited inc the spaces overlooked the back parking lot of vestas grill in cupertino where jon holloway aka phate had social engineered lara gibson to her death anyone in the mystery sedan would have had a perfect view of phates car even if they hadnt witnessed the actual abduction itself but frank bishop bob shelton and the woman who ran internet marketings human resources department had just interviewed all of the thirtytwo people who worked in the building and hadnt been able to identify the sedan the two cops were now interviewing the guard whod noticed it to see if they could learn anything else that would help them find the car bob shelton asked and it had to belong to somebody who worked for the company had to the tall guard confirmed you need an employee pass to get through the gate into this lot visitors bishop asked no they park in front bishop and shelton shared a troubled glance nobodys leads were panning out after leaving the computer crimes unit theyd stopped by state police headquarters in san jose and picked up a copy of jon holloways booking picture from the massachusetts state police it showed a thin young man with dark brown hair and virtually no distinguishing features a dead ringer for other young men in silicon valley huerto ramirez and tim morgan had also drawn a blank when theyd canvassed ollies theatrical supply in mountain view the only clerk on hand didnt recognize phates picture the team at ccu had found a lead wyatt gillettes bot had turned up a reference to phate linda sanchez had told bishop in a phone call but that too was a dead end bulgaria bishop thought cynically what kind of case is this the detective now said to the security guard let me ask you a question sir whyd you notice the car im sorry its a parking lot itd be normal for a car to be parked here whyd you pay any attention to the sedan well the thing is its not normal for cars to be parked back here it was the only one ive seen here for a while he looked around and making sure the three men were alone added see the company aint doing so well were down to forty people on the payroll was nearly two hundred last year the whole staff can park in the front lot if they want in fact the president encourages it so the company dont look like its on its last legs he lowered his voice you ask me this dotcorn internet crap aint the golden egg everybody makes it out to be i myself am looking for work at costco retail now thats a job with a future okay frank bishop told himself gazing at vestas grill think about it a car parked here by itself when it doesnt have to be parked here do something with that he had a wisp of a thought but it eluded him they thanked the guard and returned to their car walking along a gravel path that wound through a park surrounding the office building waste of time shelton said but he was stating a simple truth most investigating is a waste of time and didnt seem particularly discouraged think bishop repeated silently do something with that it was quitting time and some employees were walking along the path to the front lot bishop saw a businessman in his thirties walking silently beside a young woman in a business suit suddenly the man turned aside and took the woman by the hand they laughed and vanished into a stand of lilac bushes in the shadows they threw their arms around each other and kissed passionately this liaison brought his own family to mind and bishop wondered how much hed see of his wife and son over the next week he knew it wouldnt be much then as happened sometimes two thoughts merged in his mind and a third was born do something he stopped suddenly with that lets go bishop called and started running back the way theyd come far thinner than shelton but not in much better shape he puffed hard as they returned to the office building his shirt enthusiastically untucking itself once again what the hells the hurry his partner gasped but the detective didnt answer he ran through the lobby of internet marketing back to the human resources department he ignored the secretary who rose in alarm at his blustery entry and opened the door of the human resources directors office where the woman sat speaking with a young man detective the surprised woman said what is it bishop struggled to catch his breath i need to ask you some questions about your employees he glanced at the young man better in private would you excuse us please she nodded at the man across from her and he fled the office shelton swung the door closed what sort of questions personnel nobishop replied personal chapter fifteen here is the land of fulfillment here is the land of plenty the land of king midas where the golden touch though isnt the sly trickery of wall street or the muscle of midwest industry but pure imagination here is the land where some secretaries and janitors are stockoption millionaires and others ride the number bus all night long on its route between san jose and menlo park just so they can catch some sleep they like one third of the homeless in this area have fulltime jobs but cant afford to pay a million dollars for a tiny bungalow or a month for an apartment here is silicon valley the land that changed the world santa clara county a green valley measuring twentyfive by ten miles was dubbed the valley of the hearts delight long ago though the joy referred to when that phrase was coined was culinary rather than technological apricots prunes walnuts and cherries grew abundantly in the fertile land nestled fifty miles south of san francisco the valley might have remained linked forever with produce like other parts of california castroville with its artichokes gilroy with garlic except for an impulsive decision in by a man named david starr jordan the president of stanford university which was located smack in the middle of santa clara valley jordan decided to put some venture capital money on a littleknown invention by a man named lee de forrest the inventors gadget the audion tube wasnt like the phonograph player or the internalcombustion engine it was the type of innovation that the general public couldnt quite understand and in fact didnt care about one bit at the time it was announced but jordan and other engineers at stanford believed that the device might have a few practical applications and before long it became clear how stunningly correct they were the audion was the first electronic vacuum tube and its descendants ultimately made possible radio television radar medical monitors navigation systems and computers themselves once the tiny audions potential was unearthed nothing would ever be the same in this green placid valley stanford university became a breeding ground for electronics engineers many of whom stayed in the area after graduation david packard and william hewlett for instance russell varian and philo farnsworth too whose research gave us the first television radar and microwave technologies the early computers like eniac and univac were east coast inventions but their limitations massive size and scalding heat from vacuum tubes sent innovators scurrying to california where companies were making advances with tiny devices known as semiconductor chips far smaller cooler and more efficient than tubes once chips were developed in the late s the machine world raced forward like a spaceship from ibm to xeroxs parc to stanford research institute to intel to apple to the thousands of dotcorn companies scattered throughout this lush landscape today the promised land silicon valley through which jon patrick holloway phate now drove southeast on the rainswept freeway toward st francis academy and his appointment with jamie turner for their real world mud game in the jaguars cd player was a recording of yet another play hamlet laurence oliviers performance reciting the words in unison with the actor phate turned off the freeway at a san jose exit and five minutes later he was cruising past the brooding spanish colonial st francis academy it was and he had more than an hour to stake out the structure he parked on a dusty commercial street near the north gate through which jamie was planning on making his escape unfurling a planning and zoning commission diagram of the building and a recorder of deeds map of the grounds phate pored over the documents for ten minutes then he got out of the car and circled the school slowly studying the entrances and exits he returned to the jaguar turning the volume up on his cd he reclined the seat and watched people stroll and bicycle along the wet sidewalk he squinted at them with fascination they were no more or less real to him than the tormented danish prince in shakespeares play and phate was not sure for a moment whether he was in the machine world or the real he heard a voice maybe his own maybe not reciting a slightly different version of a passage from the play what a piece of work is a machine how noble in reason how infinite in faculty in form in moving how express and admirable in operation how like an angel in access how like a god he checked his knife and the squeeze bottle containing the pungent liquid concoction all carefully arranged in the pockets of his gray coveralls on whose back hed carefully embroidered the words aaa cleaning and maintenance company he looked at his watch then closed his eyes again leaning back in the sumptuous leather of his car thinking only forty minutes till jamie turner sneaks into the school yard to meet his brother only forty minutes until phate would find out if hed win or lose this round of the game he rubbed his thumb carefully against the razorsharp blade of the knife in operation how like an angel in access how like a god in his persona as renegade wyatt gillette had been lurking observing but saying nothing in the hack chat room before you social engineer someone you have to learn as much about them as you can to make the scam credible hed call out observations and patricia nolan would jot down whatever gillette had deduced about triplex the woman sat close to him he smelled a very pleasant perfume and he wondered if this particular scent had been part of her makeover plan so far gillette had learned this about triplex he was currently in the pacific time zone hed made a reference to cocktail happy hour in a bar nearby it was nearly pm on the west coast he was probably in northern california hed complained about the rain and according to ccus hightech meteorology source the weather channel most of the rain on the west coast was currently concentrated in and around the san francisco bay area he was american older and probably college educated his grammar and punctuation were very good for a hacker too good for a high school cyberpunk and his use of slang was correct indicating he wasnt your typical eurotrashhacker who often tried to impress others with their use of idioms and invariably got them wrong he was probably in a shopping mall dialing into the internet relay chat from a commercial internet access location a cybercafe probably hed referred to a couple of girls hed just seen go into victorias secret the happyhour comment too suggested this he was a serious and potentially dangerous hacker ditto the shopping center public access most people doing risky hacks tended to avoid going online out of their houses on their own machines and used public dialup terminals instead he had a huge ego and he considered himself a wizard and an older brother to the youngsters in the group tirelessly explaining esoteric aspects of hacking to novices in the chat room but having no patience for knowitalls with this profile in mind gillette was now almost ready to trace triplex its easy to find someone in the blue nowhere if they dont mind being found but if theyre determined to remain hidden then tracing is an arduous and usually unsuccessful task to track a connection back to an individuals computer while hes online you need an internet tracing tool like gillettes hypertrace but you might also need a phone company trace if triplexs computer was hooked up to his internet service provider via a fiberoptic or other highspeed cable connection rather than a telephone line then hypertrace could lead them to the exact longitude and latitude of the shopping mall where the hackers computer sat if however triplexs machine was connected to the net over a standard phone line via a modem a dialup connection like most personal computers at home gillettes hypertrace could trace the call back only to triplexs internet service provider and would stop there then the phone companys security people would have to trace the call from the service provider to triplexs computer itself tony mott then snapped his fingers looked up from his phone with a grin and said okay pac bells set to trace here we go said gillette he typed a message and hit enter on the screens of everyone logged on to the hack chat room appeared this message renegade hey triple how you doing gillette was now imping pretending to be someone else in this case hed decided to be a seventeenyearold hacker with marginal education but plenty of balls and adolescent attitude just the sort youd expect to find in this room triplex good renegade saw you lurking in chat rooms you can see whos logged on even if theyre not participating in the conversation triplex was reminding gillette that he was vigilant the corollary of which was dont fuck with me renegade im at a public terminal and people keep walking bye its pissing me off triplex where you hanging gillette glanced at the weather channel renegade austin man the heat sucks you ever been hear triplex only dallas renegade dallas sucks austin rules everybody ready gillette called im going to try to get him alone affirmative responses from around him he felt patricia nolans leg brush his stephen miller sat next to her gillette keyed a phrase and hit enter renegade triple how bout icq icq as in i seek you was like instant messaging it would link their machines together so that no one else would be able to see the conversation a request to icq suggested that renegade might have something illegal or furtive to share with triplex a temptation that few hackers could resist triplex why renegade cant go into it hear a moment later a small window opened on gillettes screen triplex so whats happening dude run it gillette called to stephen miller who started hypertrace another window popped up on the monitor depicting a map of northern california blue lines appeared on the map as the program traced the route from ccu back to triplex its tracing miller called signal goes from here to oakland to reno to seattle renegade thanks man for the icq thing is i got a problem and im scared this dudes on my case and the word is your a total wizard and i heard you might know somthing you can never massage a hackers ego too much wyatt gillette knew triplex what dude renegade his names phate there was no response come on come on gillette urged in a whisper thinking dont vanish im a scared kid youre a wizard help me triplex what aobut him i mean about gillette glanced at the window on his computer screen that showed hypertraces progress in locating the routing computers triplexs signal was jumping all over the western united states finally it ended at the last hub bay area online services located in walnut creek which was just north of oakland got his service provider stephen miller called its a dialin service damn patricia nolan muttered this meant that a phone company trace was necessary to pinpoint the final link from the server in walnut creek to the computer cafe where triplex was sitting we can do it linda sanchez called enthusiastically a cheerleader just keep him on the line wyatt tony mott called bay area online and told the head of the security department what was going on the security chief in turn called his own technicians who would coordinate with pacific bell and trace the connection from bay area back to triplexs location mott listened for a moment then called pac bells scanning its a busy area might take ten fifteen minutes too long too long gillette said tell em to speed it up but from his days as a phone phreak breaking into pac bell himself gillette knew that phone company employees might have to physically run through the switches which are huge rooms filled with electrical relays visually finding the connections in order to trace a call back to its source renegade i heard about this totally robust hack of phates i mean totally and i saw him online and i asked him about it only he just dissed me then weird stuff started happening after that and i heard about this script he wrote called trapdoor and now im totally paranoyd a pause then triplex so whatre you asking hes scared gillette said i can feel it renegade this trapdoor thing does it really get him in your machine and go through all your shit i mean like everything and you dont even know it triplex i dont think it really exists like an urban legend renegade i dont know man i think its real i saw my fucking files opening and no way was i doing it weve got incoming miller said hes pinging us triplex was as gillette had predicted running his own version of hypertrace to check out renegade the anonymizing program that stephen miller had hacked together however would make triplexs machine think renegade was in austin the hacker must have gotten this report and believed it because he didnt log off triplex why do you care about him youre at a public terminal he cant get into your files there renegade im just hear today cause my fucking parents took away my dell for a week cause a my grades at home i was online and the keyboard was fucked up and then files started opening all by themself i freaked i mean totally another long pause then finally the hacker responded triplex you oughta be freaked i know phate renegade yeah how triplex just started talking to him in a chat room helped me debug some script traded some warez this guy is gold tony mott whispered nolan said maybe he knows phates address ask him no gillette said we cant scare him off there was no message for a moment then triplex brb chat room regulars have developed a shorthand of initials that represent phrases to save keyboarding time and energy brb meant be right back is he headed for the hills sanchez asked the connections still open gillette said maybe he just went to take a leak or something keep pac bell on the trace he sat back in the chair which creaked loudly moments passed the screen remained unchanged brb gillette glanced at patricia nolan she opened her purse as bulky as her dress took out her fingernail conditioner again and absently began to apply it the cursor continued to blink the screen remained blank the ghosts were back and this time there were plenty of them jamie turner could hear them as he moved along the corridors of st francis academy well the sound was probably only booty or one of the teachers making certain that windows and doors were secure or students trying to find a place to sneak a cigarette or play their game boys but he couldnt get ghosts out of his mind the spirits of indians tortured to death and the student murdered a couple of years ago by that crazy guy who broke in the one who jamie now realized also added to the ghost population by getting shot dead by the cops in the old lunchroom jamie turner was certainly a product of the machine world a hacker and scientist and he knew ghosts and mythical creatures and spirits didnt exist so why did he feel so damn scared then this weird idea occurred to him he wondered if maybe thanks to computers life had returned to an earlier more spiritual and more witchy time computers made the world seem like a place out of one of those books from the s by washington irving or nathaniel hawthorne the legend of sleepy hollow and the house of the seven gables back then people believed in ghosts and spirits and weird stuff going on that you couldnt exactly see now there was the net and code and bots and electrons and things you couldnt see just like ghosts they could float around you they could appear out of nowhere they could do things these thoughts scared the hell out of him but he forced them away and continued down the dark corridors of st francis academy smelling the musty stucco hearing the muted conversations and music from the students rooms recede as he left the residence area and slipped past the gymghosts no forget it he told himself think about santana think about hanging out with your brother think about what a great night youre going to have think about backstage passes then finally he came to the fire door the one that led out into the garden he looked around no sign of booty no sign of the other teachers who occasionally wandered through the halls like guards in some prisonerofwar movie dropping to his knees jamie turner looked over the alarm bar on the door the way a wrestler sizes up his opponent warning alarm sounds if door is opened if he didnt disable the alarm if it went off when he tried to open the door bright lights would come on throughout the school and the police and the fire department would be here in minutes hed have to sprint back to his room and his entire evening would be fucked he now unfolded a small sheet of paper which contained the wiring schematic of the alarm that the door manufacturers service chief had kindly sent him playing a small flashlight over the sheet he studied the diagram once more then he caressed the metal of the alarm bar observing how the triggering device worked where the screws were how the power supply was hidden in his quick mind he matched what he saw in front of him with the schematic he took a deep breath he thought of his brother pulling on his thick glasses to protect his precious eyes jamie turner reached into his pocket pulled out the plastic case containing his tools and selected a phillips head screwdriver he had plenty of time he told himself no need to hurry ready to rock n roll chapter sixteen frank bishop parked the unmarked navy blue ford in front of the modest colonial house on a pristine plot of land only an eighth of an acre he estimated yet being in the heart of silicon valley itd be worth an easy million dollars bishop noted that a new lightcolored lexus sedan sat in the driveway they walked to the door knocked a harried fortysomething woman in jeans and a faded floral blouse opened the door the smell of cooking onions and meat escaped it was pm the bishop familys normal suppertime and the detective was struck by a blast of hunger he realized he hadnt eaten since that morning yes the woman asked mrs cargill thats right can i help you cautious now is your husband home bishop asked displaying his shield uhm i what is it kath a stocky man in chinos and a buttondown pink dress shirt came to the door he was holding a cocktail when he noticed the badges the men displayed he put the liquor out of sight on an entry way table bishop said could we talk to you for a minute please sir whats this about whats going on jim he glanced at her with irritation i dont know if i knew i wouldntve asked now would i grimfaced she stepped back bishop said itll just take a minute he and shelton walked halfway down the front path and paused cargill followed the detectives when they were out of earshot of the house bishop said you work for internet marketing solutions in cupertino right im a regional sales director whats this we have reason to believe that you may have seen a vehicle were trying to track down as part of a homicide investigation yesterday at about seven pm this car was parked in the lot behind vestas grill across the street from your company and we think you mightve gotten a look at it he shook his head our human resources director asked me about that but i told her i didnt see anything didnt she tell you that she did sir bishop said evenly but i have reason to believe you werent telling her the truth hey hold on a minute you were parked in the lot behind the company around that time in your lexus engaging in sexual activity with sally jacobs from the companys payroll department the priceless look of shock morphing into horror told bishop that he was right on the money but cargill said what he had to thats bullshit whoever told you thats lying ive been married for seventeen years besides sally jacobs if you saw her youd know how idiotic that suggestion is shes the ugliest girl on the sixteenth floor bishop was aware of the fleeting time he recalled wyatt gillettes description of the access game to murder as many people as possible in a week phate could already be close to another victim the detective said shortly sir i dont care about your personal life all i care about is that yesterday you saw a car parked in the lot behind vestas it belonged to a suspected killer and i need to know what kind of car it was i wasntthere cargill said adamantly looking toward the house his wifes face was peering at them from behind a lace curtain bishop said calmly yes sir you were and i know you got a look at the killers car no i didnt the man growled you did let me explain why i know the man gave a cynical laugh the detective said a latemodel lightcolored sedan like your lexus was parked in the back lot of internet marketing yesterday around the time the victim was abducted from vestas now i know that the president of your company encourages employees to park in front of the building so that clients dont notice that youre down to less than half the staff so the only logical reason to park in the back portion of the lot is to do something illicit and not be seen from the building or the street that would include use of some controlled substances andor sexual relations cargill stopped smiling bishop continued since its an accesscontrolled lot whoever was parked there was a company employee not a visitor i asked the personnel director which employee who owns a lightcolored sedan either has a drug problem or was having an affair she said you were seeing sally jacobs which by the way everybody in the company knows lowering his voice so far that bishop had to lean forward to hear cargill muttered fucking office rumors thats all they are twentytwo years as a detective bishop was a walking lie detector he continued now if a man is parked with his mistress shes not my mistress in a parking lot hes going to check out every car nearby to make sure its not his wifes or a neighbors so therefore sir you saw the suspects car what kind was it i didnt see anything the businessman snapped it was bob sheltons turn we dont have time for any more bullshit cargill he said to bishop lets go get sally and bring her over here maybe the two of them together can remember a little more the detectives had already talked to sally jacobs who was far from being the ugliest girl on the sixteenth or any other floor of the company and shed confirmed her affair with cargill but being single and for some reason in love with this jerk she was far less paranoid than he and hadnt bothered to check out nearby cars shed thought thered been one but she couldnt remember what type bishop had believed her bring her here cargill asked slowly sally bishop gestured to shelton and they turned he called over his shoulder well be back no dont cargill begged they stopped disgust flooded into cargills face the most guilty always look the most victimized streetcop bishop had learned it was a jaguar convertible late model silver or gray black top license number california plate i didnt see the number you ever see the car in the area before no did you see anybody in or around the car no i didnt bishop decided he was telling the truth then a conspiratorial smile blossomed in cargills face say officer mantoman you know how it is we can keep this between you and me right he glanced back at house indicating his wife the polite fagade remained on bishops face as he said thats not a problem sir thanks the businessman said with massive relief except for the final statement the detective added that willhave a reference to your affair with ms jacobs statement cargill asked uneasily that our evidence departmentll mail to you mail to the house its a state law shelton said we have to give every witness a copy of their final statement you cant do that unsmiling by nature unsmiling because of circumstance now bishop said actually we have to sir as my partner said its a state law ill drive down to your office and pick it up has to be mailed comes from sacramento youll be getting it within the next few months few months cant you tell me when exactly we dont know ourselves sir could be next week could be july or august you have a nice night and thanks for your cooperation sir they hurried back to their navyblue crown victoria leaving the mortified businessman undoubtedly thinking up wild schemes for intercepting the mail for the next two or three months so his wife didnt see the report evidence department shelton asked with a cocked eyebrow sounded good to me bishop shrugged both men laughed bishop then called central dispatch and requested an evl an emergency vehicle locator on phates car this request pulled all department of motor vehicles records on latemodel silver or gray jaguar convertibles bishop knew that if phate used this car in the crime it would either be stolen or registered under a fake name and address which meant that the dmv report probably wouldnt help but an evl would also alert every state county and local law enforcer in the northern california area to immediately report any sightings of a car fitting that description he nodded for shelton the more aggressive and faster driver of the two to get behind the wheel back to ccu he said shelton mused so hes driving a jag man this guys no ordinary hacker but bishop reflected we already knew that a message finally popped up on wyatt gillettes machine at ccu triplex sorry dude this guy had to ask me some shit about breaking screen saver passcodes some luser for the next few minutes gillette in his persona as the alienated texas teenager told triplex about how he defeated windows screen saver passcodes and let the hacker give him advice on better ways to do it gillette was digitally genuflecting before the guru when the door to the ccu opened and he glanced up to see frank bishop and bob shelton returning patricia nolan said excitedly were close to finding triplex hes in a cybercafe in a mall somewhere around here he said he knows phate gillette called to bishop but hes not saying anything concrete about him he knows things but hes scared pac bell and bay area online say theyll have his location in five minutes tony mott said listening into his headset theyre narrowing down the exchange looks like hes in atherton menlo park or redwood city bishop said well how many malls can there be get some tactical troops into the area bob shelton made a call and then announced theyre rolling be in the area in five minutes come on come on mott said to the monitor fondling the square butt of his silver gun bishop reading the screen said steer him back to phate see if you can get him to give you something concrete renegade man this phste dude isnt their some thing i can do i mean to stop him id like to fuck him up triplex listen dude you dont fuck up phate he fucks you up renegade you think triplex phate is walking death dude same with his friend shawn dont go close to them if phate got you with trapdoor burn your drive and install a new one change your screen name renegade could he get to me do you think even in texas wheres he hang good said bishop but triplex didnt answer right away after a moment this message appeared on the screen triplex i dont think hed get to austin but i ought tell you something dude renegade whats that triplex your ass aint the least bit safe in northern california which is where youre sitting right at the moment you fucking poser shit he made us gillette snapped renegade hey man im in texas triplex hey man no youre not check out the response times on your anonymizer esad triplex logged off goddamn nolan said hes gone gillette told bishop and slammed his palm onto the workstation desktop in anger the detective glanced at the last message on the screen he nodded toward it whats he mean by response times gillette didnt answer right away he typed some commands and examined the anonymizer that miller had hacked together hell he muttered when he saw what had happened he explained triplex had been tracing ccus computer by sending out the same sort of tiny electronic pings that gillette was sending to find him the anonymizer did tell triplex that renegade was in austin but when hed typed brb the hacker mustve run a further test which showed that the length of time it took the pings to get to and from renegades computer was far too short for the electrons to make the roundtrip all the way to texas and back this was a serious mistake it would have been simple to build a short delay into the anonymizer to add few milliseconds and make it appear that renegade was a thousand miles farther away gillette couldnt understand why miller hadnt thought of it fuck the cybercop said shaking his head when he realized his mistake thats my fault im sorry i just didnt think no you sure as hell hadnt gillette thought theyd been so close in a soft discouraged voice bishop said recall swat shelton pulled out his cell phone and made the call bishop asked that other thing triplex typed esad what does that mean just a friendly acronym gillette said sourly it means eat shit and die bit of a nasty temper bishop observed then a phone rang it was his cell and the detective answered yes then tersely he asked where he jotted notes and then said get every available unit in the area over there now call the san jose metro police too move on it and i mean big he hung up then looked at the team we got a break there was a response to our emergency vehicle locator a traffic cop in san jose saw a parked gray latemodel jag about a half hour ago it was in an old area of town where you dont see expensive cars very often he walked to the map and made an xat the intersection where the car had been seen shelton said i know the area a little therere a lot of apartments near there some bodegas a few package stores pretty lowrent district then bishop tapped a small square on the map it was labeled st francis academy remember that case a few years ago the detective asked shelton right some psycho got into the school and killed a student or teacher the principal put in all kinds of security real hightech stuff it was in all the papers he nodded at the whiteboard phate likes challenges remember jesus shelton muttered in fury hes going after kids now bishop grabbed the phone and called in an assaultinprogress code to central dispatch no one dared to mention out loud what everybody was thinking that the evl report had placed the car there a half hour ago which meant phate had already had plenty of time to play his macabre game it was just like life jamie turner reflected with no fanfare no buzzing no satisfying kachunks like in the movies without even a faint click the light on the alarmed door went out in the real world you dont get sound effects you do what you set out to do and theres nothing to commemorate it except a light silently going dark he stood up and listened carefully from far off down the halls of st francis academy he heard music some shouting laughter tinny arguing on a talkradio show which he was leaving behind on his way to spend a totally perfect evening with his brother easing the door open silence no alarms no shouts from booty the smell of cold air fragrant with grass filled his nose it reminded him of those long lonely hours after dinner at his parents house in mill valley during the summer his brother mark in sacramento where hed taken a job to get away from home those endless nights his mother giving jamie desserts and snacks to keep him out of their hair his father saying go outside and play while they and their friends told pointless stories that got more and more fuzzy as everybody guzzled local wines go outside and play like he was in fucking kindergarten well jamie hadnt gone outside at all hed gone inside and hacked like there was no tomorrow thats what the cool spring air reminded him of but at the moment he was immune to these memories he was thrilled that hed been successful and that he was going to spend the night with his brother he taped the door latch down so that he could get back inside when he returned to the school later that night jamie paused and turned back listening no footsteps no booty no ghosts he took a step outside his first step to freedom yes hed made it he it was then that the ghost got him suddenly a mans arm gripped him painfully around the chest and a powerful hand covered his mouth god god god jamie tried to leap back into the school but his attacker wearing some kind of maintenance man uniform was strong and wrestled him to the ground then the man pulled the thick safety glasses off the boys nose whatve we got here he whispered tossing them on the ground and caressing the boys eyelids no no jamie tried to raise his arms to protect his eyes whatre you doing the man took something from the coveralls he wore it looked like a spray bottle he held it close to jamies face what was a stream of milky liquid shot from the nozzle into his eyes the terrible burn started a moment later and the boy began to cry and shake in utter panic his worst fear was coming true blindness jamie turner shook his head furiously to fling off the pain and horror but the stinging only got worse he was screaming no no no the words muffled under the strong grip of the hand around his mouth the man leaned close and began to whisper in the boys ear but jamie had no idea what he said the pain and the horror consumed him like fire in dry brush chapter seventeen frank bishop and wyatt gillette walked through the old archway of the entrance to st francis academy their shoes sounding in gritty scrapes on the cobblestones bishop nodded a greeting to huerto ramirez whose massive bulk filled half the archway and asked its true yep frank sorry he got away ramirez and tim morgan who was presently canvassing witnesses along the streets around the school had been among the first at the scene ramirez turned and led bishop gillette and behind them bob shelton and patricia nolan into the school proper linda sanchez pulling a large wheelie suitcase joined them outside were two ambulances and a dozen police cars their lights flashing silently a large crowd of the curious stood on the sidewalk across the street what happened shelton asked him as near as we can tell the jaguar was outside that gate over there ramirez pointed into a yard separated from the street by a high wall we were all on silent rollup but it looks like he heard we were coming and sprinted out of the school and got away we set up roadblocks eight and sixteen blocks away but he got through them used alleys and sidestreets probably as they walked through the dim corridors nolan fell into step beside gillette she seemed to want to say something but changed her mind and remained silent gillette noticed no students as they walked down the hallways maybe the teachers were keeping them in their rooms until parents and counselors arrived crime scene finding anything bishop asked ramirez nothing that you know jumps up and gives us the perps address they turned a corner and at the end of it saw an open door outside of which were dozens of police officers and several medical technicians ramirez glanced at bishop and then whispered something to him bishop nodded and said to gillette its pretty unpleasant in there it was like andy anderson and lara gibson the killer used his knife again in the heart but it looks like it took him a while to die its pretty messy why dont you wait outside when we need you to look at the computer ill let you know i can handle it the hacker replied you sure yep bishop asked ramirez how old the kid fifteen bishop lifted an eyebrow at patricia nolan asking her if she too could tolerate the carnage she answered its okay they walked inside the classroom despite his measured response to bishops question gillette stopped in shock there was blood everywhere an astonishing amount on the floor walls chairs picture frames whiteboard the lectern the color was different depending on what substance the blood covered ranging from bright pink to nearly black the body lay under a darkgreen rubberized blanket on the floor in the middle of the room gillette glanced at nolan expecting her to be repulsed too but after a glance at the crimson spatters and streaks and puddles around the room her eyes simply scanned the classroom maybe looking for the computer they were going to analyze whats the boys name bishop asked a woman officer from the san jose police department said jamie turner linda sanchez walked into the room and inhaled deeply when she saw the blood and the body she seemed to be deciding if she was going to faint or not she stepped outside again frank bishop walked into the classroom next door to the murder site where a teenage boy sat clutching himself and rocking back and forth in a chair gillette joined the detective jamie bishop asked jamie turner the boy didnt respond gillette noticed that his eyes were bright red and the skin around them seemed inflamed bishop glanced at another man in the room he was thin and in his midtwenties he stood beside jamie and had his arm on the boys shoulder the man said to the detective this is jamie thats right im his brother mark turner bootys dead jamie whispered miserably and pressed a damp cloth on his eyes booty another man in his forties wearing chinos and an izod shirt identified himself as the assistant principal at the school and said it was the boys nickname for him he nodded toward the room where the body bag rested for the principal bishop crouched down how you feeling young man he killed him he had this knife he stabbed him and mr boethe just kept screaming and screaming and running around trying to get away i he lost his voice to a cascade of sobbing his brother gripped his shoulders tighter he all right bishop asked one of the medical techs a woman whose jacket was adorned with a stethoscope and hemostat clamps she said hell be fine looks like the perp squirted him in the eyes with water that had a little ammonia and tabasco mixed in just enough to sting not enough to do any damage why bishop asked she shrugged you got me bishop pulled up a chair and sat down im sorry this happened jamie i know youre upset but its real important you tell us what you know after a few minutes the boy calmed and explained that hed broken out of the school to go to a concert with his brother but as soon as hed gotten the door open this man in a uniform like a janitors grabbed him and squirted some stuff in his eyes hed told jamie it was acid and that if the boy led him to where mr boethe was hed give him an antidote but if he didnt the acidd eat his eyes away the boys hands shook and he started to cry its his big fear mark said angrily going blind the bastard found that out somehow bishop nodded and said to gillette the principal was his target its a big school phate needed jamie to find the victim fast and it hurt so much it really really did i told him i wasnt going to help him i didnt want to i tried not to but i couldnt help it i he fell silent gillette felt there was something more that jamie wanted to say but couldnt bring himself to bishop touched the boys shoulder you did exactly the right thing you did just what i wouldve done son dont you worry about it tell me jamie did you email anybody about what you were going to do tonight its important that we know the boy swallowed and looked down nothings going to happen to you jamie dont worry we just want to find this guy my brother i guess and then go ahead what it was i kind of went online to find some passcodes and stuff passcodes to the front gate he mustve hacked my machine and seen them and thats how he got into the courtyard how about you being afraid of going blind bishop asked could he have read about that online jamie nodded again gillette said so phate made jamie himself a trapdoor to get inside youve been real brave young man bishop said kindly but the boy was beyond consoling the medical examiners technicians took the principals body away and the cops conferred in the corridor gillette and nolan with them shelton reported what hed learned from the forensic techs crime scene doesnt have dick a few dozen obvious fingerprints theyll run those but hell we already know its holloway he was wearing shoes without distinctive tread marks therere a million fibers in the room enough to keep the bureaus lab busy for a year oh they found this its the turner kids he handed a sheet of paper to bishop who read it and passed it on to gillette it appeared to be the boys notes about cracking the passcode and deactivating the door alarm huerto ramirez told them nobody was exactly sure where the jaguar was parked in any case the rains washed away any tread marks we got a ton of trash by the roadside but whether our perp dropped any of it or not who knows nolan said hes a cracker that means hes an organized offender hes not going to be pitching out junk mailers with his address on them while hes staking out a victim ramirez continued tims still pounding the pavement with some troopers from hq but nobodys seen anything at all bishop glanced at nolan sanchez and gillette okay secure the boys machine and check it out linda sanchez asked where is it the assistant principal said hed lead them to the schools computer department gillette returned to the room where jamie was sitting and asked him which machine hed used number three the boy sullenly replied and continued pressing the cloth into his eyes the team started down the dim corridor as they walked linda sanchez made a call on her cell phone she learned gillette deduced from the conversation that her daughter still hadnt started labor she hung up saying dios in the basement computer room a chill and depressing place gillette nolan and sanchez walked up to the machine marked no gillette told sanchez not to run any of her excavation programs just yet he sat down and said as far as we know the trapdoor demon hasnt selfdestructed im going to try to find out where its resident in the system nolan looked around the damp gothic room feels like were in the exorcist spooky atmosphere and demonic possession gillette gave a faint smile he powered up the computer and examined the main menu he then loaded various applications a word processor a spreadsheet a fax program a virus checker some diskcopying utilities some games some web browsers a passwordcracking program that jamie had apparently written some very robust codewriting for a teenager gillette noticed as he typed hed stare at the screen watching how soon the character he typed would appear in the glowing letters on the monitor hed listen to the grind of the hard drive to see if it was making any sounds that were out of sync with the task it was supposed to be performing at that moment patricia nolan sat close to him also gazing at the screen i can feel the demon gillette whispered but its odd it seems to move around it jumps from program to program as soon as i open one it slips into the software maybe to see if im looking for it when it decides that im not it leaves but it has to be resident somewhere where bishop asked lets see if we can find out gillette opened and closed a dozen programs then a dozen more all the while typing furiously okay okay this is the most sluggish directory he looked over a list of files then gave a cold laugh you know where trapdoor hangs out where the games folder at the moment its in the solitaire program what the card game sanchez said but games come with almost every computer sold in america nolan said thats probably why phate wrote the code that way bishop shook his head so anybody with a game on his computer could have trapdoor in it nolan asked what happens if you disabled solitaire or erased it they debated this for a moment gillette was desperately curious about how trapdoor worked and wanted to extract the demon and examine it if they deleted the game program the demon might kill itself but knowing that this would destroy it would give them a weapon anyone who suspected the demon was inside could simply remove the game they decided to copy the contents of the hard drive from the computer jamie had used and then gillette would delete solitaire and theyd see what happened once sanchez was finished copying the contents gillette erased the solitaire program but he noticed a faint delay in the delete operation he tested various programs again then laughed bitterly its still there it jumped to another program ands alive and well how the hell does it do that the trapdoor demon had sensed its home was about to be destroyed and had delayed the delete program just long enough to escape from the solitaire software to another program gillette stood up and shook his head theres nothing more i can do here lets take the machine back to ccu and there was a blur of motion as the door to the computer room swung open fast shattering glass a raging cry filled the room and a figure charged up to the computer nolan dropped to her knees giving a faint scream of surprise bishop was knocked aside linda sanchez fumbled for her gun gillette dove for cover just as the chair swung past his head and crashed into the monitor hed been sitting at jamie the assistant principal cried sharply no but the boy drew back the heavy chair and slammed it into the monitor again which imploded with a loud pop and scattered glass shards around them smoke rose from the carcass of the unit the administrator grabbed the chair and ripped it from jamies hand pulling the boy aside and shoving him to the floor what the hell are you doing mister the boy scrambled to his feet sobbing and made another grab for the computer but bishop and the administrator restrained him im going to smash it it killed him it killed mr boethe the assistant principal shouted you cut that out this minute young man im not going to have that kind of behavior in my students get your fucking hands off me the boy raged it killed him and im going to kill it the boy shook with anger mr turner you will calm down this instant im not going to tell you again mark jamies brother ran into the computer room he put his arm around the boy who collapsed against him sobbing the students have to behave the shaken administrator said looking at the cool faces of the ccu team thats the way we do things around here bishop glanced at sanchez who was surveying the damage she said central processors okay the monitors all he nailed wyatt gillette pulled a couple of chairs into the corner and motioned jamie over to him the boy looked at his brother who nodded and he joined the hacker i think that fucks up the warranty gillette said laughing and nodding at the monitor the boy flashed a weak smile but it vanished almost immediately after a moment the boy said its my fault booty died the boy looked at him i hacked the passcode to the gate i downloaded the schematic for the alarms oh i wish i was fucking dead he wiped his face on his sleeve there was more on the boys mind gillette could see once again go on tell me he encouraged softly the boy looked down and finally said that man he said that if i hadnt been hacking mr boethed still be alive it was me who killed him and i should never touch another computer again because i might kill somebody else gillette was shaking his head no no no jamie the man who did this is a sick fuck he got it into his head that he was going to kill your principal and nothing was going to stop him if he hadnt used you he wouldve used somebody else he said those things to you cause hes afraid of you afraid of me hes been watching you watching you write script and hack hes scared of what you might do to him someday jamie said nothing gillette nodded at the smoking monitor you cant break all the machines in the world but i can fuck up that one he raged its just a tool gillette said softly some people use screwdrivers to break into houses you cant get rid of all the screwdrivers jamie sagged against a stack of books crying gillette put his arm around the boys shoulders im never going on a fucking computer again i hate them well thats going to be a problem the boy wiped his face again problem gillette said see we need you to help us help you the hacker nodded at the machine you wrote that script cracker the boy nodded youre good jamie youre really good there are sysadmins who couldnt run the hacks you did were going to take that machine with us so we can analyze it at headquarters but im going to leave the other ones here and i was hoping youd go through them and see if theres anything you can find that might help us catch this asshole you want me to do that you know what a whitehat hacker is yeah a good hacker who helps find bad hackers will you be our white hat we dont have enough people at the state police maybe youll find something we cant the boy now seemed embarrassed hed been crying he angrily wiped his face i dont know i dont think i want to we sure could use your help the assistant principal said okay jamie its time to get back to your room his brother said no way hes not staying here tonight were going to that concert and then he can spend the night with me the assistant principal said firmly no he needs written permission from your parents and we couldnt get in touch with them we have rules here and after all this he waved his hands vaguely toward the crime scene were not deviating from them mark turner leaned forward and whispered harshly jesus christ loosen up will you the kids had the worst night of his life and youre the administrator responded you have no say about how i deal with my students then frank bishop said but i do and jamies not doing either staying here or going to any concerts hes coming to police headquarters and making a statement then well take him to his parents i dont want to go there the boy said miserably not my parents im afraid i dont have any choice jamie said the detective the boy sighed and looked like he was going to start crying again bishop glanced at the assistant principal and said ill take care of it from here youre going to have your hands full with the other boys tonight the man glanced distastefully at the detective and at the broken door and left the computer room after he was gone frank bishop smiled and said to the boy okay young man you and your brother get on out of here now you might miss the opening act but if you move fast youll probably make the main show but my parents you said forget what i said ill call your mom and dad and tell them youre spending the night with your brother he looked at mark just make sure hes back here in time for classes tomorrow the boy couldnt smile not after everything that had happened but he offered a faint thanks he walked toward the door mark turner shook the detectives hand jamie gillette called the boy turned think about what i asked about helping us jamie looked at the smoking monitor for a moment he turned and left without responding bishop asked gillette you think he can find something i dont have any idea thats not why i asked him to help i figured that after something like this he needs to get back on the horse gillette nodded at jamies notes hes brilliant itd be a real crime if he got gunshy and gave up machines the detective gave a brief laugh the more i know you the more you dont seem like the typical hacker who knows maybe im not gillette helped linda sanchez go through the ritual of disconnecting the computer that had been a coconspirator in the death of poor willem boethe she wrapped it in a blanket and strapped it onto a wheelie cart carefully as if she were afraid that jostling or rough treatment would dislodge any fragile clues to the whereabouts of their adversary at the computer crimes unit the investigation stalled the bots alarm that would alert them to the presence of phate or shawn on the net hadnt gone off nor had triplex gone back online tony mott who still seemed unhappy at missing a chance to play real cop was grudgingly poring over sheets of legal paper on which he and miller had taken numerous notes while the rest of the team had been at st francis academy he announced there was nothing helpful in vicap or the state databases under the name holloway a lot of the files were missing and the ones still there dont tell us shit mott continued we talked to some of the places that hollowayd worked western electric apple and nippon electronics thats nec a few of the people who remember him say that he was a brilliant codeslinger and a brilliant social engineer tms linda sanchez recited idk gillette and nolan laughed mott translated yet another acronym from the blue nowhere for bishop and shelton tell me something dont know he continued but surprise surprise all the files were gone from their personnel and audit departments i can see how he hacks in and erases computer files linda sanchez said but hows he get rid of the deadtree stuff the what shelton asked paper files gillette explained but thats easy he hacks into the fileroom computer and issues a memo to the staff to shred them mott added that several of the security officers at phates former employers believed hed made his living and might still be making it now by brokering stolen supercomputer parts for which there was huge demand especially in europe and thirdworld nations their hopes blossomed for a moment when ramirez called in to say that hed finally heard from the owner of ollies theatrical supply the man had looked at the booking picture of young jon holloway and confirmed that hed come into the store several times in the past month the owner couldnt recall exactly what hed bought but he remembered the purchases were large and had been paid for with cash the owner had no idea where holloway lived but he did remember a brief exchange hed asked holloway if he was an actor and if so wasnt it hard to get jobs the killer had replied nope its not hard at all i act every single day a half hour later frank bishop stretched and looked around the dinosaur pen the energy was low in the room linda sanchez was on the phone with her daughter stephen miller sat sullenly by himself looking over notes perhaps still troubled by the mistake hed made with the anonymizer which had let triplex get away gillette was in the analysis lab checking out the contents of jamie turners computer patricia nolan was in a nearby cubicle making phone calls bishop wasnt sure where bob shelton was bishops phone rang and he took the call it was from the highway patrol a motorcycle officer had found phates jaguar in oakland there wasnt any direct evidence linking the car to the hacker but it had to be his the only reason to douse a vehicle with copious amounts of gasoline and set it aflame was to destroy evidence which the fire did with great efficiency according to the crime scene unit there were no clues that might help the team bishop turned back to the preliminary crime scene report from st francis academy huerto ramirez had compiled it in record time but there wasnt much that was helpful here either the murder weapon had again been a kabar knife the duct tape used to bind jamie turner was untraceable as were the tabasco and ammonia that had stung his eyes theyd found plenty of holloways fingerprints but those were useless now since they already knew his identity bishop walked to the whiteboard and gestured to mott for the marker who pitched it to him the detective wrote these details on the board but when he started to write fingerprints he paused phates fingerprints the burning jaguar these facts troubled him for some reason why he wondered brushing his sideburns with his knuckles do something with that he snapped his fingers what linda sanchez asked mott miller and nolan looked at him phate didnt wear gloves this time at vestas when hed kidnapped lara gibson phate had carefully wrapped a napkin around his beer bottle to obscure his prints at st francis he hadnt bothered that means he knows we have his real identity then the detective added and the car too the only reason to destroy it is if he knew that wed found out he was driving a jaguar howd he do that the press hadnt mentioned his name or the fact that the killer was driving a jaguar we have ourselves a spy you think linda sanchez said bishops eyes fell again on the whiteboard and he noticed the reference to shawn phates mysterious partner he tapped the name and asked whats the whole point of this game of his its to find some hidden way of getting access to your victims life nolan said youre thinking shawns a trapdoor an insider tony mott shrugged maybe hes a dispatcher at headquarters or a trooper or somebody from california state data management stephen miller suggested or maybe a mans voice growled gillette is shawn bishop turned and saw bob shelton standing in front of a cubicle toward the back of the room whatre you talking about patricia nolan asked come here he said gesturing them toward the cubicle inside on the desk a computer monitor glowed with text shelton sat down and scrolled through it as the others on the team crammed into the cubicle linda sanchez looked over the screen with some concern she said youre on islenet gillette said we werent supposed to log on from here of course he said that shelton spat out bitterly know why because he was afraid wed find this he scrolled a little further down and gestured toward the screen its an old department of justice report i found in the contra costa county archives phate mightve erased the copy in washington but he missed this one shelton tapped the screen gillette was valleyman he and holloway ran that gang knights of access together they founded it shit miller muttered no bishop whispered cant be mott spat out he fucking social engineered us too bishop closed his eyes seared by the betrayal shelton muttered gillette and hollowayve known each other for years shawn could be one of gillettes screen names remember that the warden said hed been caught going online he was probably contacting phate maybe this whole thing was a plan to get gillette out of prison what a fucking son of bitch nolan pointed out but gillette programmed his bot to search for valleyman too wrong shelton pushed a printout toward bishop heres how he modified his program the printout read search irc undernet dalnet wais gopher usenet bbss www ftp archives search for phate or holloway or jon patrick holloway or jon holloway but not valleyman or gillette bishop shook his head i dont understand it the way he wrote the request nolan said his bot would retrieve anything that had a reference to phate holloway or trapdoor in it unless it also referred to gillette or valleyman those it would ignore shelton continued hes the one whos been warning phate thats why he got away from st francis in time and gillette told him that we knew what kind of car he was driving so he burned it miller added and he was so desperate to stay and help us remember sure he was shelton said nodding otherwise hed lose his chance to the detectives looked at each other bishop whispered escape they sprinted down the corridor that led to the analysis lab bishop noticed that shelton had drawn his weapon the door to the lab was locked bishop pounded but there was no response key he called to miller but shelton growled fuck the key and kicked the door in raising his gun the room was empty bishop continued to the end of the corridor and pushed into a storeroom in the back of the building he saw the fire door which led outside into the parking lot it was wide open the fire alarm in the dooropener bar had been dismantled just as jamie turner had done to escape from st francis academy bishop closed his eyes and leaned against the damp wall he felt the betrayal deep within his heart as sharp as phates terrible knife the more i know you the more you dont seem like the typical hacker who knows maybe im not then the detective turned and hurried back into the main area of the ccu he picked up the phone and called the department of corrections detention coordination office at the santa clara county building the detective identified himself and said weve got a fugitive on the run wearing an anklet we need an emergency trace ill give you the number of his unit he consulted his notebook its could you call back later lieutenant came the weary response call back excuse me sir you dont understand we just had an escape within the last thirty minutes we need to trace him well were not doing any tracing the whole systems down crashed like the hindenberg our tech people cant figure out why bishop felt the chill run through his body tell them youve been hacked he said thats why the voice on the other end of the line gave a condescending laugh youve been watching too many movies detective nobody can get into our computers call back in three or four hours our peoplere saying we should be up and running by then iii social engineering anonymity is one thing that the next wave of computing will abolish newsweek chapter eighteen he takes things apart wyatt gillette was jogging through the chill evening rain down a sidewalk in santa clara his chest aching breathless it was pm and hed put nearly two miles between him and ccu headquarters since hed escaped he knew his way around this neighborhood he wasnt far from one of the houses where hed lived as a boy and he was thinking of the time his mother had told a friend whod asked if tenyearold wyatt preferred baseball to soccer oh he doesnt like sports he takes things apart that seems to be all he likes to do a police car approached and gillette eased to a quick walk keeping his head under the umbrella hed found in the computer analysis lab at ccu the car disappeared without slowing the hacker sped up once again the anklet tracking system would be down for several hours but he couldnt afford to dawdle he takes things apart nature had cursed wyatt edward gillette with a raging curiosity that seemed to grow exponentially with every new year but that perverse gift had at least been mitigated somewhat by the blessing of hands and a mind skillful enough to more often than not satisfy his obsession he lived to understand how things worked and there was only one way to do that take them apart not a single thing in the gillette house had been safe from the boy and his tool kit his mother would return home from her job to find young wyatt sitting in front of her food processor happily examining its component parts do you know how much that cost shed ask angrily didnt know didnt care but ten minutes later it would be reassembled and working fine neither better nor worse for its dismemberment and the cuisinarts surgery had occurred when the boy was only five years old soon though hed taken apart and put back together all the things mechanical in the house he understood pulleys and wheels and gears and motors and they began to bore him so it was on to electronics for a year he preyed upon stereos and record players and tape decks taking em apart putting em back together it didnt take long before the boy had dispensed with the mysteries of vacuum tubes and circuit boards and his curiosity began to prowl like a tiger with a reawakened hunger but then he discovered computers he thought of his father a tall man with the perfect posture and trim hair that had been his legacy from the air force the man had taken him to a radio shack when his son was eight and told him he could pick out something for himself you can get anything you want anything asked the boy eyeing the hundreds of items on the shelves anything you want hed picked a computer it was a perfect choice for a boy who takes things apart because the little trash computer was a portal to the blue nowhere which is infinitely deep and infinitely complex made up of layer upon layer of parts small as molecules and big as the exploding universe its the place where curiosity can roam free forever schools however tend to prefer their students minds to be compliant first and curious second if at all and as he moved up through his grades young wyatt gillette began to founder before he bottomed out though a wise counselor plucked him out of the stew of high school sized him up and sent him off to santa clara magnet school number three the school was billed as a haven for gifted but troubled students residing in silicon valley a description that could of course be translated only one way hacker heaven a typical day for a typical student at magnet three involved cutting pe and english classes tolerating history and acing math and physics all the while concentrating on the only schoolwork that really mattered talking with your buddies nonstop about the machine world now walking down a rainy sidewalk not far from this very school in fact he had many memories of his early days in the blue nowhere gillette clearly remembered sitting in the magnet three school yard practicing his whistle for hour upon hour if you could whistle into a fortress phone at just the right tone you could fool the phone switches into thinking you yourself were another switch and would be rewarded with the golden ring of access everybody knew about captain crunch the username of a legendary young hacker who had discovered that the whistle given away with the cereal of the same name generated a tone of megahertz the exact frequency that let you break into the phone companys longdistance lines and make free calls he remembered all the hours hed spent in the magnet three cafeteria which smelled like wet dough or in study hall or the green corridors talking about cpus graphics cards bulletin boards viruses virtual disks passwords expandable ram and the bible that is william gibsons novel neuromancer which popularized the term cyberpunk he remembered the first time he cracked into a government computer and the first time he got busted and sentenced to detention for hacking at seventeen still a juvenile though he still had to do time the judge was stern with boys who seized root of ford motor companys mainframe when they shouldve been out playing baseball and the old jurist was more stern yet with boys who lectured him adamantly pointing out that the worldd be in pretty shitty shape today if thomas alva edison had been more concerned with sports than inventing but the most prominent memory at the moment was of an event that occurred a few years after he graduated from berkeley his first online meeting with a young hacker named certaindeath the username of jon patrick holloway in the hack chat room gillette was working as a programmer during the day but like many code crunchers he was bored with that life and counted the hours until he could get home to his machine to explore the blue nowhere and meet kindred souls which holloway certainly was their first online conversation lasted four and a half hours initially they traded phone phreaking information they then put theory into practice and pulled off what they declared to be some totally moby hacks cracking into the pac bell at t and british telecom switching systems from these modest beginnings they began prowling through corporate and government machines their reputation spread and pretty soon other hackers began to seek them out running unix finger searches on the net to find them by name and then sitting at the young mens virtual feet to learn what the gurus had to teach after a year or so of hanging out online with various regulars he and holloway realized that theyd become a cybergang a rather legendary one as a matter of fact certaindeath the leader and bona fide wizard valleyman the second in command the thoughtful philosopher of the group and nearly as good a codeslinger as certaindeath sauron and klepto not as smart but half crazy and willing to do anything online others too mosk replicant grok neuro byter they needed a name and gillette had delivered knights of access had occurred to him after playing a medieval mud game for sixteen hours straight their notoriety spread around the world largely because they wrote programs that could get computers to do amazing things far too many hackers and cyberpunks werent programmers at all they were referred to contemptuously as pointandclickers but the leaders of the knights were skilled software writers so good that they didnt even bother to compile many of their programs turning the raw source code into working software because they knew clearly how the software would perform elana gillettes exwife whom hed met around this time was a piano teacher and she said gillette and holloway reminded her of beethoven who could imagine his music so perfectly in his head that once hed written it the performance was anticlimactic recalling this he now thought of his exwife not far from here was the beige apartment where he and elana had lived for several years he could picture the time they spent together so clearly a thousand images leapt from deep memory but unlike the unix operating system or a math coprocessor chip the relationship between him and elana was something he couldnt understand he didnt know how to take it apart and look at the components and therefore it was something he couldnt fix this woman still consumed him he longed for her he wanted a child with her but in the matter of love wyatt gillette knew he was no wizard he now put these reflections aside and stepped under the awning of a shabby goodwill store near the sunnyvale town line once he was out of the rain he looked around him then seeing he was alone reached into his pocket and extracted a small electronic circuit board which hed had with him all day when hed gone back to his cell at san ho that morning to collect the magazines and clippings for his excursion to the ccu office hed taped the board to his right thigh near his groin this board which hed been working on for the past six months was what hed intended to smuggle out of prison from the beginning not the phone phreaking red box which hed slipped into his pocket so that the guards would find that and he hoped let him leave prison without going through the metal detector again in the computer analysis lab back at ccu forty minutes ago hed pulled the board off his skin and successfully tested it now in the pale fluorescent light from the goodwill shop he examined the circuit again and found that it had survived his jog from ccu just fine he slipped it back into his pocket and stepped inside the store nodding a greeting to the night clerk who said we close at ten gillette knew this hed checked their hours out earlier i wont be long he assured the man then proceeded to pick out a change of clothing which in the best tradition of social engineering were the sort of things he wouldnt normally wear he paid with money hed lifted from a jacket in ccu and started toward the door he paused and turned back to the clerk excuse me theres a bus stop around here isnt there the old man pointed to the west of the store fifty feet up the street its a transfer point you can get a bus there thatll take you anywhere you want to go anywhere wyatt gillette asked cheerfully who could ask for more than that and he stepped back into the rainy night opening his borrowed umbrella the computer crimes unit was mute from the betrayal frank bishop felt the hot pressure of silence around him bob shelton was coordinating with the local police tony mott and linda sanchez were also on the phones checking leads they spoke in quiet tones reverent almost suggesting the intensity of their desire to recapture their betrayer the more i know you the more you dont seem like the typical hacker after bishop it was patricia nolan who seemed the most upset and took the young mans escape personally bishop had sensed a connection between them well sheat least was attracted to the hacker the detective wondered if this crush mightve fit a certain pattern the smart but ungainly woman would fall hard and fast for a brilliant renegade whod charm her for a while but then would slip out of her life for the fiftieth time that day bishop pictured his wife jennie and thought how glad he was to be contentedly married the reports came back but there were no leads no one in the buildings near ccu had seen gillette escape no cars were missing from the parking lot but the office was right next to a major county bus route and he could easily have escaped that way no county or municipal police cars reported seeing anyone fitting his description on foot with the absence of hard evidence as to where gillette had gone bishop decided to look at the hackers history try to track down his father or brother friends too and former coworkers bishop looked over andy andersons desk for copies of gillettes court and prison files but he couldnt find them when bishop put in an emergency request for copies of the files from central records he learned that they were gone someone issued a memo to shred them right bishop asked the night clerk as a matter of fact sir thats right howd you know wild guess the detective hung up then an idea occurred to him he recalled that the hacker had done juvenile time so bishop called a friend at the night magistrates office the man did some checking and learned that yes they did have a file on wyatt gillettes arrest and sentencing when hed been seventeen theyd send a copy over as soon as possible he forgot to have those shredded bishop said to nolan at least weve got one break suddenly tony mott glanced at a computer terminal and leapt to his feet shouting look he ran to the terminal and started banging on the keyboard what bishop asked a housekeeping program just started to wipe the empty space on the hard drive mott said breathlessly as he keyed he hit enter then looked up there its stopped bishop noted the alarm in his face but had no clue what was going on it was linda sanchez who explained almost all the data on a computer even things youve deleted or that vanish when you shut the computer off stay in the empty space of your hard drive you cant see them as files but theyre easy to recover thats how we catch a lot of bad guys who think they deleted incriminating evidence the only way to completely destroy that information is to run a program that wipes the empty space its like a digital shredder before he escaped wyatt mustve programmed it to start running which means tony mott said that he doesnt want us to see what he was just doing online linda sanchez said ive got a program thatll find whatever he was looking at she flipped through a box containing floppy disks and loaded one into the machine her stubby fingers danced over the keyboard and in a moment cryptic symbols filled the screen they made no sense whatsoever to frank bishop he noticed though that this must have been a victory for their side because sanchez smiled faintly and motioned her colleagues over to the terminal thiss interesting mott said stephen miller nodded and began taking notes what bishop asked but miller was too busy writing to respond chapter nineteen phate sat in the dining room of his house in los altos listening to death of a salesman on his diskman hunching over his laptop though he was distracted he was badly shaken up by the close call at st francis academy he remembered standing with his arm around trembling jamie turner both of them watching poor booty thrash about in his death throes and telling the kid to stay away from computers forever but his compelling monologue had been interrupted by shawns emergency page which alerted him that the police were on their way to the school phate had sprinted out of st francis and gotten away just in time as the police cruisers approached from three different directions how on earth had they figured that out well he was shaken true but an expert at mud games a supreme strategist phate knew that there was only one thing to do when the enemy has a near success attack again he needed a new victim he scrolled through his computers directory and opened a folder labeled univac week which contained information on lara gibson st francis academy and other potential victims in silicon valley he started reading through some of the articles from local newspaper web sites there were stories about people like paranoid rap stars who traveled with armed entourages politicians who supported unpopular causes and abortion doctors who lived in virtual fortresses but whom to pick he wondered whod be more challenging than boethe and lara gibson then his eye caught a newspaper article that shawn had sent to him about a month ago it concerned a family who lived in an affluent part of palo alto high security in a hightech world donald w is a man whos been to the edge and he didnt like it donald who agreed to be interviewed only if we didnt use his last name is chief executive officer of one of silicon valley s most successful venture capital firms while another man might brag about this accomplishment donald tries desperately to keep his success and all the other facts about his life completely hidden theres a very good reason for this six years ago while in argentina to close a deal with investors he was kidnapped at gunpoint and held for two weeks his company paid an undisclosed amount of ransom for his release donald was subsequently found unharmed by buenos aires police but he says he hasnt been the same since you look death right in the face and you think ive taken so much for granted we think we live in a civilized world but thats not the case at all donald is among a growing number of wealthy executives in silicon valley who are starting to take security seriously he and his wife even picked a private school for their only child samantha on the basis of its highsecurity facilities perfect phate thought and went online the anonymity of these characters was of course merely a slight inconvenience and in ten minutes hed hacked into the newspapers editorial computer system and was browsing through the notes of the reporter whod written the article he soon had all the details he needed on donald wingate hesperia way palo alto married to joyce fortytwo nee shearer who were the parents of a third grader at junipero serra school rio del vista also in palo alto he learned too about wingates brother irving and irvs wife kathy and about the two bodyguards in wingates employ there were some mudhead game players whod consider it bad strategy to hit the same type of target a private school in this case twice in a row phate on the contrary thought it made perfect sense and that the cops would be caught completely off guard he scrolled through the files again slowly who do you want to be patricia nolan said youre not going to hurt him are you its not like hes dangerous you know that frank bishop snapped that they werent going to shoot gillette in the back but beyond that there were no guarantees his response wasnt very civil but his goal at the moment was to find the fugitive not to comfort consultants who had a crush on him the main ccu phone line rang tony mott took the call listened nodding his head broadly eyes slightly wider than they normally were bishop frowned wondering who was on the other end of the line in a respectful voice mott said please hold a minute the young cop then handed the receiver to the detective as if it were a bomb its for you the cop whispered uncertainly sorry sorry bishop lifted an eyebrow its washington frank the pentagon the pentagon it was after am east coast time this is trouble he took the receiver hello detective bishop yessir thiss david chambers i run the department of defenses criminal investigation division bishop shifted the phone as if the news he was about to hear would hurt less in his left ear ive heard from various sources that a john doe release order was issued in the northern district of california and that that order might concern an individual we have some interest in chambers added quickly dont mention that persons name over the phone line thats right bishop responded where is he now brazil cleveland paris hacking into the new york stock exchange to bring the world economy to a halt in my custody bishop said youre a california state trooper is that right i am yessir how the hell dyou get a federal prisoner released and more important how the hell dyou get him out on a john doe even the warden at san jose doesnt know anything or claims he doesnt the us attorney and ire friends we closed the gonzalez killings a couple of years ago and weve been working together ever since this is a murder case youre running yessir a hackers been breaking into peoples computers and using the information inside to get close to his victims bishop looked at bob sheltons concerned face and drew his finger across his own throat shelton rolled his eyes sorry you know why were after this individual dont you chambers asked something about him writing some software that cracks yoursoftware trying to be as vague as he could he guessed that in washington two conversations often went on simultaneously the one you meant and the one you said out loud which if he did is illegal to start with and if a copy of what this person wrote gets out of the country its treason i understand that bishop filled the ensuing silence with and you want him back in prison is that it thats right weve got three days on the order bishop said firmly a laugh from the other end of the phone i make one phone call and that order becomes toilet paper i imagine you could do that yessir there was a pause then chambers asked the names frank yessir okay frank cop to cop has this individual been helpful with the case aside from one slight glitch bishop responded very see the perpetrators a computer expert were no match for him without somebody like this person weve been talking about another pause chambers said ill say this i personally dont think hes the devil incarnate like hes made out to be round here there wasnt any good evidence that he cracked our system but therere plenty of people in washington who think he did and its becoming a witchhunt in the department here if he did anything illegal hell go to jail but im on the side that hes innocent until proven otherwise yessir bishop said then added delicately of course you could also look at it that if some kid could crack the code maybe you might want to write a better one the detective thought okay now that remark may just get me fired but chambers laughed he said im not sure standard is all its touted to be but therere a lot of people involved in encryption here who dont want to hear that they dont like to get shown up and they really hate it if they get shown up in the media now theres an assistant undersecretary peter kenyon whod shit bricks if he thought there was a chance our unnamed individual was out of prison and might end up on the news see kenyon was the one in charge of the task force that commissioned standard i was wondering kenyon doesnt know the boys out but hes heard rumors and if he does find out it could be bad for me and for a lot of people he let bishop mull these intraagency politics over for a moment chambers then said i was a cop before i got into this bureaucracy stuff where sir i was an mp in the navy spent most of my time in san diego broke up some fights did you bishop asked only if the army was winning listen frank if that boy is helping you catch this perp okay go ahead you can keep him until the release order expires thank you sir but i dont need to tell you that youre the one wholl get hung out to dry if he hacks into somebodys web site or if he disappears i understand sir keep me informed frank the phone went dead bishop hung up shook his head sorry what was that all about shelton asked but the detectives explanation was interrupted when they heard a triumphant shout from miller got something here he called excitedly linda sanchez was nodding her weary head weve managed to recover a list of web sites gillette logged on to just before he escaped she handed bishop some printouts they contained a lot of gibberish computer symbols and fragments of data and text that made no sense to him but among the fragments were references to a number of airlines and information about flights that evening from san francisco international to other countries miller handed him another sheet of paper he also downloaded this the schedule of buses from santa clara to the airport the pearshaped detective smiled with pleasure presumably at having recovered from his earlier bumbling but how would he pay for the airfare shelton wondered out loud money are you kidding tony mott asked with a sour laugh hes probably at an atm right now emptying your bank account bishop had a thought he went to the phone in the analysis lab and picked it up hit redial the detective spoke with someone on the other end of the line for a moment then he hung up bishop reported his conversation to the team the last number gillette dialed was a goodwill store a couple of miles from here in santa clara theyre closed but the clerks still there he said somebody fitting gillettes description came in about twenty minutes ago he bought a black trench coat a pair of white jeans an oakland as cap and a gym bag he remembered him because he kept looking around and seemed really nervous gillette also asked the clerk where the nearest bus stop was theres one near the store and the airport bus does stop there mott said it takes the bus about fortyfive minutes to get up to the airport he checked his pistol and started to rise no mott bishop said weve been through this before come on the young man urged im in better shape than ninety percent of the rest of the force i bicycle a hundred miles a week and i run two marathons a year bishop said were not paying you to run gillette to ground you stay here or better yet go home and get some rest you too linda whatever happens with gillette were still going to be working overtime to find the killer mott shook his head not at all happy about the detectives order but he agreed bob shelton said we can be at the airport in twenty minutes ill call in his description to the port authority police theyll cover all the bus stops but i tell you im personally going to be at the international terminal i cant wait to see the look in that mans eyes when i say hello the stocky detective cracked the first smile bishop had seen in days chapter twenty wyatt gillette stepped off the bus and watched it pull away from the curb he looked up into the night sky specters of clouds moved quickly overhead and sprinkled droplets of cold rain on the ground the moisture brought out the smells of silicon valley auto exhaust and the medicinal scent of eucalyptus trees the bus which wasnt bound for the airport at all but was making local stops in santa clara county had deposited him on a dark empty street in the pleasant suburb of sunnyvale he was a good ten miles from the san francisco airport where bishop shelton and a slew of police officers would be frantically searching for an oakland as fan in white jeans and a black raincoat as soon as hed left the goodwill store hed pitched out those clothes and had stolen what he now wore a tan jacket and blue jeans from the collection box in front of the shop the canvas gym bag was the only purchase still with him opening his umbrella and starting up a dimly lit street gillette inhaled deeply to calm his nerves he wasnt worried about recapture hed covered his tracks at ccu just fine logging on to airline web sites looking up international flight information then running emptyshred to catch the attention of the team and to draw them to the fake clues hed planted about leaving the country no gillette was nervous as hell because of where he was now headed it was after and many of the houses in this hardworking town were dark their owners already asleep days begin early in silicon valley he walked north away from el camino real and soon the sound of traffic on that busy commercial street faded ten minutes later he saw the house and slowed down no he reminded himself keep going dont act suspicious he started walking again eyes on the sidewalk avoiding the glances of the few people on the street a woman in a silly plastic rain hat walking her dog two men hunched over a cars open hood one held an umbrella and flashlight while the other struggled with a wrench still as he drew closer to the house an old classic california bungalow gillette found his steps slowing until twenty feet away he stopped altogether the circuit board in the gym bag which weighed only a few ounces seemed suddenly to be heavy as lead go ahead he told himself you have to do it go on a deep breath he closed his eyes lowered the umbrella and looked upward he let the rain fall on his face wondering if what he was about to do was brilliant or completely foolish what was he risking everything he thought then he decided that it didnt matter he had no choice gillette started forward toward the house no more than three seconds later they nailed him the dog walker turned suddenly and sprinted toward him the dog a german shepherd growling fiercely a gun was in the womans hand and she was shouting freeze gillette freeze the two men supposedly working on the car also drew weapons and raced toward him shining flashlights in his eyes dazed gillette dropped the umbrella and the gym bag he lifted his hands and backed up slowly he felt someone grip his shoulder and he turned frank bishop had come up behind him bob shelton was there too holding a large black pistol pointed at his chest how did you gillette began but shelton lashed out with his fist and struck gillette squarely in the jaw his head popped back and stunned he fell hard to the sidewalk frank bishop handed him a kleenex nodded toward his jaw you missed some there no to the right gillette wiped the blood away shelton s punch hadnt been that hard but his knuckles had cut skin and the rain flowed into it making the wound sting fiercely other than offering the tissue bishop gave no reaction to the blow delivered by his partner he crouched opened the canvas bag he took out the circuit board he turned it over and over in his hands what is it a bomb he asked with a lethargy that suggested he didnt think it was explosive just something i made gillette muttered pressing his palm to his nose id rather you didnt get it wet bishop stood put it in his pocket shelton his scarred face wet and red kept staring at him gillette tensed slightly wondering if the cop was going to lose control and hit him again how gillette asked again bishop said we were on the way to the airport but then i started thinking if youd really gone online and looked up something about where you were going youdve just destroyed the hard drive and done it as soon as you left not timed that program to run later which all it did was draw our attention to the clues youd left about the airport like youd planned right gillette nodded the detective then added and why on earth would you pretend to go to europe youd get stopped at customs i didnt have a lot of time to plan gillette muttered the detective looked up the street you know how we found out you were coming here dont you of course he knew bishop had called the phone company and learned what number had been dialed from the phone in the lab before hed called goodwill then bishop had gotten the address of that location the house in front of them and theyd staked out the approaches if bishops handling of the escape had been software the hacker within gillette would have called it one moby kludge he said i shouldve cracked the switch at pac bell and changed the localcall records i wouldve done that if id had time shock at the arrest was diminishing replaced by despair as he looked at the outline of his electronic creation in bishops raincoat pocket how close hed come to the goal that had obsessed him for months he looked at the house hed been headed for the lights glowed warmly beckoning shelton said youre shawn arent you no im not i dont know who shawn is but you were valleyman right yes and i was in the knights of access you know holloway i did know him yes jesus christ the bulky detective continued of course youre shawn all you assholes have a dozen different ids youre him and youre on your way to meet phate right now he grabbed the hacker by the collar of his cheap goodwill jacket this time bishop intervened and touched shelton s shoulder the big cop released the hacker but continued in his low threatening voice nodding at the house up the street phates going by the identity of donald papandolos hes the one you called and you called him a couple of times today from ccu to tip him off about us we saw the fucking phone records gillette was shaking his head no i shelton continued weve got tactical troopers surrounding the place and youre going to help us get him out i have no idea where phate is but ill guarantee you hes not in there who is then bishop asked my wife thats her fathers house chapter twentyone elenas the one i called gillette explained he turned to shelton and you were right i did go online when i first got to ccu i lied about it i hacked into dmv to see if she was still living at her fathers then i called her tonight to see if she was home youre divorced i thought bishop said i amdivorced he hesitated i still think of her as my wife elana bishop said last name gillette no she went back to her maiden name papandolos bishop said to shelton run the name the cop made the call and a moment later nodded its her thiss her address house owned by donald and irene papandolos no warrants bishop pulled on a headset mike he said into his mouthpiece alonso its bishop were pretty sure therere only innocents inside the house check it out and tell me what you see a pause of a few minutes then he listened into the microphone he looked up at gillette theres a woman in her sixties gray hair elanas mother irene a man in his twenties curly black hair bishop repeated the question listened to the response then nodded thats her brother christian and a blonde in her midthirties shes reading to two little boys elana has dark hair thats probably camilla her sister she used to be a redhead but shed change her hair color every few months the kidsre hers shes got four of them bishop said into the microphone okay its sounding legit tell everybody to stand down im releasing the scene the detective asked gillette whats this all about you were going to check the computer from st francis and instead you escaped i did check the machine there was nothing thatd help us find him as soon as i booted up the demon sensed something probably that wed disconnected the modem and killed itself if id found anything helpful i wouldve left you a note left us a note shelton snapped you make it sound like youre running to the goddamn eleven for cigarettes you fucking escaped from custody i didnt escape he pointed at the anklet check out the tracking system its set to go back on in an hour i was going to call you from her house and have somebody come get me and take me back to ccu i just needed some time to see ellie bishop eyed the hacker closely then asked does she want to see you gillette hesitated probably not she doesnt know im coming but you called her you said shelton pointed out and i hung up as soon as she answered i just wanted to make sure she was home tonight whys she living at her parents because of me she doesnt have any money she spent it all on my defense and on the fine he nodded toward bishops pocket thats why ive been working on that what i smuggled out it was hidden under that phone box thing in your pocket right gillette nodded i shouldve had them sweep you with the wand twice i got careless whats this thing got to do with your wife i was going to give it to ellie she can patent it and license it to a hardware company make some money its a new kind of wireless modem you can use with your laptop you can go online when youre traveling and not have to use your cell phone it uses global positioning to tell a cellular switch where you are and then automatically links you to the best signal for data transmission it bishop waved off the techspeak you made it with things you found in prison found or bought or stole shelton said found or bought gillette repeated bishop asked why didnt you tell us you were valleyman and that you and phate were in knights of access because youd send me right back to prison and then i wouldntve been able to help you track him down he paused and i wouldntve had a chance to see ellie look if there was anything i knew about phate that wouldve helped catch him i wouldve told you sure we were in knights of access together but that was years ago in cybergangs you never see the people youre running with i didnt even know what he looked like whether he was gay or straight married or single all i knew was his real name and that he was in massachusetts but you found that out by yourselves at the same time i did and i never heard about shawn until today shelton said angrily so you were one of those assholes with him sending out viruses and bomb recipes and shutting down nineoneone no gillette said adamantly he went on to explain that for the first year or so knights of access was one of the worlds premiere cybergangs but they never did anything harmful to civilians they fought hacking battles with other gangs and cracked your typical corporate and government sites the worst we did was we wrote our own freeware that did the same things that expensive commercial software did and gave copies away so a halfdozen big companies lost a few thousand bucks in profit thats it but he continued he began to realize there was another person inside of certaindeath holloways screen name back then he was becoming dangerous and vindictive and started looking for more and more of a particular type of access the access that let you hurt people he kept getting confused about who was real and who was a character in the computer games he was playing gillette spent long hours instant messaging with holloway trying try to talk him out of his more vicious hacks and his plans for getting even with people he saw as his enemies finally he cracked holloways machine and found to his shock that hed been writing deadly viruses programs like the one that took down oakland s system or that would block transmissions from airtraffic controllers to pilots gillette downloaded the viruses and wrote inoculations against them then posted those on the net gillette found stolen harvard university software in holloways machine he sent a copy to the school and to the massachusetts state police along with certaindeaths email address holloway was arrested gillette retired valleyman as a username and fully aware of holloways vindictive nature came up with a number of other online identities when he began hacking again shelton said lets get the scumbag back to san ho weve wasted enough time no dont please bishop studied him with some amusement you want to keep working with us i have to youve seen how good phate is you need somebody as good as me to stop him man shelton said laughing youve got some balls i know youre good wyatt bishop said but you also just escaped from my custody and that couldve cost me my job its going to be pretty tough to trust you now isnt it well make do with somebody else you cant make do when it comes to somebody like phate stephen miller cant handle it hes in over his head patricia nolan is just security as good as they are security peoplere always one step behind the hackers you need somebody whos been in the trenches trenches bishop said softly the comment seemed to amuse him he fell silent and finally said i believe im going to give you one more chance shelton s eyes fluttered with dark resentment bad mistake bishop gave a faint nod as if acknowledging that it might very well be then he said to shelton tell everybody to get some dinner and a few hours sleep im taking wyatt back to san ho for the night shelton shook his head dismayed at his partners plans but went off to do what hed been asked gillette rubbed his jaw and said give me ten minutes with her who my wife youre serious arent you ten minutes is all im asking not an hour ago i got a call from david chambers at the department of defense whos about an inch away from rescinding that release order they found out they sure did so ill tell you son this fresh air youre breathing and those free hands of yours thosere all just gravy by rights you should be sleeping on a prison mattress right now the detective took the hackers wrist but before the metal of the cuff closed around it gillette asked you married bishop yes i am do you love your wife the cop said nothing for a moment he looked up at the rainy sky then put the cuffs away ten minutes he saw her first in silhouette lit from behind but there was no doubt it was ellie her sensuous figure the mass of long black hair that became wilder and more tangled as it reached her lower back her round face the only evidence of the tension shed surely be feeling was the way she gripped the doorjamb on the other side of the screen her pianists lingers were red from the fierce pressure wyatt she whispered did they release me he shook his head a glint in the shadow of her eyes as she looked over his shoulder and saw vigilant frank bishop on the sidewalk gillette continued im just out for a few days sort of a temporary parole im helping them find somebody jon holloway she muttered your gang friend he asked have you heard from him me no why would i i dont see any of your friends anymore looking over her shoulder at her sisters children she stepped farther outside and pulled the door shut as if she wanted to separate him and the past firmly from her present life what are you doing here how did you know i was wait those phone calls the hang ups they came up call blocked on caller id that was you he nodded i wanted to make sure you were home why she asked bitterly he hated her tone he remembered it from the trial he remembered that single word too why shed asked that often in the days before he went to prison why didnt you give up your goddamn machines you wouldnt be going to jail you wouldnt be losing me if you had why i wanted to talk to you he said to her now we have nothing to talk about wyatt we had years to talk but you had other things to do with your time please he said sensing that she was about to bolt back inside gillette heard the desperation in his voice but he was past pride the plantsve grown gillette nodded toward a thick boxwood elana glanced at it and for a moment her facade softened one balmy november night years ago theyd made love beside that very shrub while her parents were inside watching election night results more memories of their life together flooded into gillettes thoughts a health food restaurant in palo alto they ate at every friday midnight runs for poptarts and pizza bicycling through the stanford campus for a moment wyatt gillette was hopelessly entangled in those memories then elanas face hardened once more she gave another glance inside the house through the lacecovered window the children now in their pajamas trotted out of sight she turned back and looked at the tattoo of the palm tree and seabird on his arm years ago hed told her he wanted to get it removed and shed seemed to like the idea but he never had now he felt hed disappointed her hows camilla and the kids fine your parents exasperated elana asked what do you want wyatt i brought you this he handed her the circuit board and explained what it was whyre you giving it to me its worth a lot of money he gave her a technical specification sheet for the device that hed written out on the bus ride from the goodwill store find yourself a sand hill road lawyer and sell it to one of the big companies compaq apple sun theyll want to license it and thats okay but make sure they pay you a big advance up front nonreturnable not just royalties the lawyerll know all about it i dont want it its not a present im just repaying you you lost the house and your savings because of me you should make enough to recover that she looked down at the board but didnt take it from his outstretched hand i should go wait he said there was more hed wanted to say so much more hed rehearsed his speech in prison for days trying to figure out the best way to present his arguments her strong fingers tipped in faint purple polish now kneaded the wet porch banister she looked out over the rainy yard he stared at her studying her hands her hair her chin her feet dont say it he told himself do not say it but say it he did i love you no she responded sternly and help up a hand as if to deflect the words i want to try again its too late for that wyatt i was wrong what i did wont ever happen again too late she repeated i got carried away i wasnt there for you but i will be i promise you wanted children well we can have children you have your machines why do you need children ive changed youve been in jail you havent had a chance to prove to anybody yourself included that you can change i want to have a family with you she walked to the door opened the screen i wanted that too and look what happened he blurted dont move to new york elana froze she turned new york youre moving to new york with your friend ed how do you know about ed out of control now he asked are you going to marry him how do you know about him she repeated how do you know about new york dont do it elana stay here give me a how she snapped gillette looked down at the porch at the spattering of rain on the gray deck paint i cracked your online account and read your email you what she let the screen door swing shut luxurious greek temper flooded into her beautiful face there was no going back now gillette blurted do you love ed are you going to marry him christ i dont believe you from prison you hacked into my email from prison do you love him eds none of your goddamn business you had every chance in the world to have a family with me and you chose not to you have absolutely no right to say a word about my personal life please no well ed and i are going to new york and we leave in three days and theres not a single goddamn thing in the world you can do to stop me goodbye wyatt dont bother me again i love you dont love anyone she interrupted you social engineer them she walked inside closing the door quietly he walked down the steps to bishop gillette asked whats the phone number at ccu bishop gave it to him and the hacker wrote the number on the specification sheet and jotted please call me he wrapped the sheet around the circuit board and left it in the mailbox bishop led him back down the gritty wet sidewalk he gave no reaction to what hed just witnessed on the porch as the two of them approached the crown victoria one with perfect posture the other with a permanent slouch a man appeared out of the shadows across the street from elanas house he was in his late thirties thin with trim hair and a mustache gillettes first impression was that he was gay he was wearing a raincoat but had no umbrella gillette noticed that the detectives hand was hovering near his pistol as the man approached the stranger slowed and cautiously held up a wallet revealing a badge and an id card im charlie pittman santa clara county sheriffs department bishop read the card carefully and seemed satisfied with pittmans credentials youre state police pittman asked frank bishop pittman glanced at gillette and youre before gillette could speak bishop asked what can we do for you charlie im investigating the peter fowler case gillette recalled he was the gun dealer killed by phate along with andy anderson on hackers knoll earlier that day pittman explained we heard there was a related operation here tonight bishop shook his head false alarm nothing thatll help you out good night sir he started to walk past gesturing gillette to come with him but pittman said were swimming upstream on this one frank anything you can tell usd be a big help the stanford peoplere all shook up cause somebody was selling guns on campus werethe ones theyre beating up on were not pursuing the weapon side of the investigation were after the perp who killed fowler but if you want any information youll have to go through troop headquarters in san jose you know the drill is that where youre working out of bishop mustve known police politics as well as he knew life on the mean streets of oakland he was suitably evasive as he said theyre the ones you ought to talk to captain bernstein can help you out pittmans deep eyes scanned gillette up and down then he glanced into the murky sky im sure sick of this weather been raining way too long he looked back to bishop you know frank we get the scut work we county folks were always getting lost in the shuffle and end up having to do the same work somebody elses already done get kind of tired of it sometimes bernsteins a straight shooter hell help you out if he can pittman looked over gillette once more probably wondering what a skinny young man in a muddy jacket clearly not a cop was doing here good luck to you bishop said thanks detective pittman walked back into the night when they were inside the squad car gillette said i really dont want to go back to san ho well im going back to ccu to look over the evidence and grab a few winks and i didnt see any lockup there gillette said im not going to escape again bishop didnt respond i dont really want to go back to jail the detective remained silent and the hacker added handcuff me to a chair if you dont trust me bishop said put your seat belt on chapter twentytwo the junipero serra school looked idyllic in the earlymorning fog the exclusive private school located on eight landscaped acres was sandwiched between xeroxs palo alto research center and one of the many hewlettpackard facilities near stanford university it enjoyed a wonderful reputation and was known for launching virtually all of its students to advanced schools of their well their parents choice the grounds were beautiful and the staff was paid extremely well at the moment however the woman whod been the receptionist of the school for the past few years wasnt basking in the benefits of her working environment her eyes were filled with tears and she struggled to control the tremors in her voice my god my god she whispered joyce just dropped her off a halfhour ago i saw her she was fine i mean just a half hour standing in front of her was a young man with reddish hair and mustache wearing an expensive business suit his eyes were red as if hed been crying too and he clasped his hands in a way that suggested that he was very upset she and don were driving to napa for the day to the vineyard they were meeting some of dons investors for lunch what happened she asked breathlessly one of those buses with migrant workers it veered right into them oh god she muttered again another woman walked past and the receptionist said amy come here the woman wearing a bright red suit and carrying a sheet of paper headed with the words lesson plan walked to the desk the receptionist whispered joyce and don wingate were in an accident no it sounds bad the receptionist nodded thiss dons brother irv they nodded and stricken amy said how are they the brother swallowed and cleared his emotionthickened throat theyll live at least thats what the doctorsre saying now but theyre both unconscious still my brother broke his back he forced back tears the receptionist wiped away her own joyces so active in the pta everybody loves her what can we do i dont know yet irv said shaking his head im not thinking real clearly no no of course not amy said but everybody at the schoolll be here for you whatever you need amy summoned a stocky woman in her fifties oh mrs nagler the graysuited woman approached and glanced at irv who nodded at her mrs nagler he said youre the director here right thats right im irv wingate samanthas uncle i met you at the spring recital last year she nodded and shook his hand wingate recapped the story of the accident oh my god no mrs nagler whispered im so sorry irv said kathy thats my wife shes up there now im here to pick up sammie of course but mrs nagler sympathetic though she was nonetheless ran a tight ship and wasnt going to deviate from the rules she leaned over the computer keyboard and typed with blunt polishfree nails on the keys she read the screen and then said youre on the authorized list of relatives to release samantha to she hit another key and a picture popped up the drivers license photo of irving wingate she looked up at him it was a perfect match then she said but im afraid therere two other things we have to verify first could i see your drivers license please sure he displayed the card it matched both his appearance and the photo on the computer just one more thing im sorry your brother was very security minded you know oh sure wingate said the password he whispered to her its shep mrs nagler nodded in confirmation irv gazed out the window at the liquid sunlight falling on a boxwood hedge that was donalds first airedale shep we got it when he was twelve that was a great dog he still raises them you know mrs nagler said sadly i know we sometimes email each other pictures of our dogs ive got two weimaraners her voice faded and she put this sorrowful thought away she made a call spoke to the girls teacher and asked that she be brought to the main reception area irv said dont say anything to sammie please ill break the news to her on the way up of course well stop for breakfast on the way egg mcmuffinsre her favorite amy of the crimson suit choked at this bit of trivia thats what she had on the class trip to yosemite she covered her eyes and cried silently for a moment an asian woman presumably the girls teacher led a skinny redheaded girl into the office mrs nagler smiled and said your uncle irving s here irv he corrected she calls me uncle irv hi sammie wow you grew your mustache back like totally fast wingate laughed your aunt kathy said i looked more distinguished he crouched down listen your mommy and daddy decided you could take the day off school were going to go spend the day with them in napa they went up to the vineyard thats right a frown crossed the girls freckled face dad said they couldnt go till next week because of the painters they changed their mind and you get to go up there with me cool the teacher said you go get your book bag now okay the girl ran off and mrs nagler told the teacher whatd happened oh no the woman whispered as she shouldered her portion of the tragedy a few minutes later samantha reappeared her heavy book bag hooked over her shoulder she and uncle irv started out the door the receptionist said to mrs nagler thank god shell be in good hands and irv wingate mustve heard her say this because he turned and nodded still the receptionist did a brief double take the smile he offered seemed just a little off like an eerie gloat but the woman decided she was wrong and put the look down to the terrible stress the poor man had to be under rise and shine the snappy voice said gillette opened his eyes and looked up at frank bishop who was shaved and showered and absently tucking in his ornery shirttail its eightthirty bishop said they let you sleep late at prison i was up till four the hacker grumbled i couldnt get comfortable but thats not really a surprise is it he nodded at the large iron chair that bishop had handcuffed him to it was your idea the cuffs and the chair i didnt think youd take it literally whats to take literally bishop asked either you handcuff somebody to a chair or you dont the detective unhooked gillette and the hacker rose stiffly rubbing his wrist he went into the kitchen and got coffee and a dayold bagel by any chance you ever get any poptarts around here gillette called returning to the main room of ccu i dont know bishop responded this isnt my office remember anyway im not much for sweets people should have bacon and eggs for breakfast you know hearty food he sipped his coffee i was watching you when you were asleep gillette didnt know what to do with that he lifted an eyebrow you were typing in your sleep they call it keying nowadays not typing did you know you did that the hacker nodded ellie used to tell me i did i sometimes dream in code you do what i see script in my dreams you know lines of software source code in basic or c or java he looked around where is everybody linda and tonyre on their way miller too lindas still not a grandmother patricia nolan called from her hotel he held gillettes eyes for a moment she asked if you were okay she did the detective nodded with a smile gave me hell for cuffing you to the chair she said you couldve spent the night on the couch in her hotel room make of that what you will shelton bishop said hes at home with his wife i called him but there was no answer sometimes he just has to disappear and spend time with her you know because that trouble i told you about before his son dying a beep sounded from a nearby workstation gillette rose and went to look at the screen his tireless bot had worked through the night traveling the globe and it now had another prize to show for its efforts he read the message and told bishop triplexs online again hes back in the hacker chat room gillette sat down at the computer we going to social engineer him again bishop asked no ive got another idea what im going to try the truth tony mott sped his expensive fisher bicycle east along stevens creek boulevard outpacing many of the cars and trucks and turned fast into the computer crimes unit parking lot he always rode the miles from his home in santa clara to the ccu building at a good pace the lean muscular cop bicycled as fast as he did all his other sports whether he was skiing the chutes at abasin in colorado heliskiing in europe whitewater rafting or rapelling down the sheer rock faces of the mountains he loved to climb but today hed hiked particularly fast thinking that sooner or later hed wear down frank bishop the way he hadnt been able to wear down andy anderson and strap on body armor and do some real police work hed worked hard at the academy and though he was a good cybercop his assignment at ccu wasnt any more exciting than working on a graduate thesis it was as if he were being discriminated against just because of his grade point average at mit hooking the old battered kryptonite lock through the frame of his cycle he glanced up to see a slim mustachioed man in a raincoat striding up to him hi the man offered smiling hi there im charlie pittman santa clara county sheriffs department mott shook the offered hand he knew many of the county detectives and didnt recognize this man but he gave a fast glance at the id badge dangling from his neck and saw that the picture matched you must be tony mott right the county cop admired the fisher i heard that you cycle like a son of a bitch only when im going downhill mott said smiling modestly even though the truth was that yes he did cycle like a son of a bitch whether it was downhill uphill or on the flats pittman laughed too i dont get half the exercise i should especially when were after some perp like this computer guy funny mott hadnt heard anything about somebody from the county working the case you going inside mott pulled off his helmet i was just in there frank was briefing me this is one crazy case i hear that mott agreed stuffing the shooting gloves that doubled as biking gloves in the waistband of his spandex shorts that guy that franks been using that consultant the young guy you mean wyatt gillette yeah thats his name he really knows his stuff doesnt he the man is a wizard mott said how longs he going to be helping you out till we catch this asshole i guess pittman looked at his watch i better run ill check in later tony mott nodded as pittman walked away pulling out his cell phone and placing a call the county cop walked all the way through the ccu parking lot and into the one next door mott noticed this and thought momentarily that it was odd hed parked that far away when there were plenty of spaces right in front of ccu but then he started toward the office thinking of nothing except the case and how one way or another he was going to finagle a spot on the dynamic entry team when they kicked in the door to collar jon patrick holloway ani ani animorphs the little girl said what phate asked absently they were driving in an acura legend which had been recently stolen but was duly registered to one of his identities en route to the basement of his house in los altos where duct tape the kabar knife and a digital camera awaited little samantha wingates arrival ani ani animorphs hey uncle irv you like animorphs no not one fucking little bit thought phate but uncle irv said you bet i do why was mrs gitting upset sammie wingate asked who the lady at the front desk i dont know like are mom and dad in napa already thats right phate didnt have a clue where they were but wherever it was he knew theyd be enjoying the last moments of peace before the storm of horror descended it was only a matter of minutes before somebody from the junipero serra school started calling the wingates friends and family and would learn that thered been no accident phate wondered whod feel the greatest level of panic the parents of the missing child or the principal and teachers whod released her to a killer ani ani ani ani animorphs whos your favorite favorite what phate asked what do you think little samantha asked a bit disrespectfully thought both phate and uncle irv the girl said favorite animorph i think rachels my favorite she turns into a lion i made up this story about her and it was totally cool what happened was phate listened to the inane story as the girl continued to drone on and on the little brat kept up the prattle without the least encouragement from old uncle irv whose only comfort at the moment was the razorsharp knife at home and the anticipation of donald wingates reaction when the businessman received the plastic bag containing a rather gruesome present later that day in accordance with the point system in the access game phate himself would be the ups deliveryman who dropped off the package and got the signature of d wingate on the receipt this would earn him points the highest for any particular murder he reflected on his social engineering at the school now thathad been a good hack challenging yet clean even though uncooperative uncle irv apparently had shaved off his mustache after his last drivers license photo the girl bounced obnoxiously on her seat you think we can ride that pony dad got me man that is so neat billy tomkins was talking all about this stupid dog he got like who doesnt have a dog i mean everybody has a dog but ive got a pony phate glanced at the girl her perfectly done hair the expensive watch whose leather band shed defaced with indecipherable pictures drawn in ink the shoes polished by someone else the cheesy breath he decided that sammie wasnt like jamie turner whom hed been reluctant to kill because he reminded him so much of himself no this kid was like all the other little shits whod made young jon patrick holloways life at school pure hell taking some pictures of little samantha before the trip to the basement and little samantha after now that would give him a great deal of satisfaction you want to ride on charizard uncle irv who phate asked duh my pony the one dad got me for my birthday you were like there right i forgot dad and me go riding sometimes charizards pretty cool he knows his way back to the barn all by himself or i know you could take dads horse and we could go around the lake together if you can keep up phate wondered if he could wait long enough to get the girl into the basement suddenly a loud beeping filled the car and as the girl continued to prattle on about morphing dogs or lions or whatever phate pulled the pager off his belt and scrolled through the display his reaction was an audible gasp the gist of shawns message was that wyatt gillette was at ccu headquarters phate felt the shock as if hed touched a live wire he had to pull off the road jesus in heaven gillette valleyman was helping the cops thats why theyd learned so much about him and were so close on his trail instantly hundreds of memories from the knights of access days came back to him the incredible hacks the hours and hours of mad conversations typing as fast as they could out of fear that an idea might escape the paranoia the risks the exhilaration of going places online where nobody else could go and just yesterday hed been thinking about that article gillette had written he remembered the last line once youve spent time in the blue nowhere you can never completely return to the real world valleyman whose childlike curiosity and dogged nature didnt let him rest until hed understood everything there was to know about something new to him valleyman whose brilliance in writing code approached and sometimes surpassed phates own valleyman whose betrayal had destroyed holloways life and shattered the great social engineering and who was alive now only because phate hadnt yet focused on killing him uncle irv um how come were stopped here i mean is there something wrong with the car he glanced at the girl then looked around the deserted road well sammie you know what i think there may be how bout you take a look um me yeah im not sure what to do just see if the tires flat kindly uncle irv said could you do that i guess like which tire right rear the girl looked left phate pointed the other way um okay that one what should i look for well what would the animorphs look for i dont know maybe if there was a nail in it or something thats good why dont you look and see if theres a nail okay phate unhooked the girls seat belt then he reached across sammie for the door handle i can do it myself she said defiantly you dont have to okay phate sat back and watched the girl fumble with the latch then push the door open sammie got out and walked to the back of the car it looks okay to me she called good phate called and gunned the engine racing forward the door slammed shut and the tires sprayed sammie with dust and gravel she started to scream wait uncle irv phate skidded onto the highway the sobbing girl ran after the car but she was soon obscured by a huge cloud of dust from the spinning wheels phate for his part had stopped thinking about little samantha wingate the moment the door slammed chapter twentythree renegade triplex its me again i want to talk to you nbs the acronym means no bullshit patricia nolan explained to frank bishop as they gazed at the computer screen in front of wyatt gillette nolan had arrived from her hotel a few minutes before as gillette was hurrying to a nearby workstation shed hovered near him as if she was about to hug him good morning but she seemed to sense his complete concentration and chose not to she pulled up a chair and sat close to the monitor tony mott too sat nearby bob shelton had called and told bishop that his wife was sick and that hed be in late gillette typed another message and hit return renegade are you there i want to talk come on gillette encouraged in a whisper come on talk to me finally an icq window opened and triplex responded triplex youre keying a lot fucking better now grammar and spelling too btw

tell me what you cracked six years ago the big one you know what i mean hes testing me gillette said he probably heard about a koa hack from phate and wants to see if i know it he typed renegade fort meade fort meade maryland was home of the national security agency and had more supercomputers than anywhere in the world it also had the tightest security of any government installation jesus christ mott whispered you cracked meade gillette shrugged just the internet connection not the black boxes but still jesus triplex so how did you get through their firewalls renegade we heard nsa was installing a new system we got in through the sendmail flaw in unix we had three minutes after they installed the machine before they loaded the patch to fix it thats when we got in the famous sendmail flaw was a bug in an early version of unix later fixed that let someone send a certain type of email to the root user the systems administrator that would sometimes let the sender seize control of the computer triplex man youre a wizard everybodys heard about you i thought you were in jail renegade i am im in custody but dont worry theyre not after you mott whispered please dont run for the hills triplex what do you want renegade were trying to find phate jon holloway triplex why do you want him gillette looked at bishop who nodded his okay to tell all renegade hes killing people another pause gillette typed invisible messages in the air for thirty seconds before triplex replied triplex i heard rumors hes using that program of his trapdoor to go after people right renegade thats right triplex i knew hed use it to hurt people that man is one sick mf no translation necessary for those initials gillette concluded triplex what do you want from me renegade help finding him triplex idts bishop tried i dont think so linda sanchez laughed thats it boss youre learning the lingo gillette noticed that bishop had finally earned the title boss which sanchez had apparently reserved for andy anderson renegade we need help triplex you have no clue how dangerous that fucker is hes psycho hell come after me renegade you can change your username and system address triplex ltw nolan said to bishop like thatd work sarcastic triplex hed find me in ten minutes renegade then stay offline till we get him triplex and when you were hacking was there a single day you werent

it renegade we need your help please triplex thats weird renegade what triplex i dont think i ever saw a hacker write please before the connection terminated after phate had learned that wyatt gillette was helping the cops look for him and had left the little animorph crying by the side of the road hed ditched his car the whirry brat could identify it and bought a used clunker with cash he then sped through the chill overcast to the warehouse he rented near san jose when he played his real world game of access hed travel to a different city and set up house for a while but this warehouse was more or less his permanent residence it was where he kept everything that was important to him if in a thousand years archaeologists dug through layers of sand and loam and found this webby dustfilled place they might believe that theyd discovered a temple from the early computer age as significant a find as explorer howard carters unearthing the tomb of pharaoh tutankhamen in egypt here in this cold empty space an abandoned dinosaur pen were all of phates treasures a complete eai tr analog computer from the sixties a heath electronic analog kit computer an altair and b computers a twentyfiveyearold ibm portable a commodore kim the famous trs a kaypro portable a cosmac vip a number of apples and macs tubes from the original univac brass gears and a number disk from a prototype of charles babbages nevercompleted difference engine from the s and notes about it jotted down by ada byron lord byrons daughter and babbages companion who wrote instructions for his machines and is therefore considered the worlds first computer programmer dozens of other items of hardware too on shelves were all the rainbow books the technical manuals that cover every aspect of computer networking and security their jackets standing out in the gloom with their distinctive oranges reds yellows aquas lavenders and teal greens perhaps phates favorite souvenir was a framed poster of correspondence bearing the letterhead of the trafodata company bill gatess original name for microsoft but the warehouse was not simply a museum it served a purpose too here were rows and rows of boxes of disks a dozen working computers and perhaps two million dollars worth of specialized computer components most of them for supercomputer construction and repair buying and selling these products through shell companies was how phate made his substantial income this also was his staging area where he planned his games and where he changed his description and personality most of his costumes and disguises were here in the corner was an id a security identification pass maker complete with magnetic strip burner other machines let him make active identification cards which broadcast passwords for access to particularly secure facilities with these machines and a brief hack into the department of motor vehicles various schools and departments of vital records he could become anyone he wanted to be and create the documentation to prove it he could even write himself a passport who do you want to be he now surveyed his equipment from a shelf above his desk he took a cell phone and several powerful toshiba laptops into one of which he loaded a jpeg a compressed photo image he also found a large diskstorage box which would serve his needs nicely the shock and dismay of finding that valleyman was among his adversaries was gone and had turned to electric excitement phate was now thrilled that the game he was playing had taken a dramatic twist one that was familiar to anybody whod ever played access or other mud games this was the moment when the plot turns degrees and the hunters became the prey cruising through the blue nowhere like a dolphin in coves close to shore in open sea breaking the surface or nosing through dim vegetation on the impenetrable bottom wyatt gillettes tireless bot sent an urgent message back to its master in ccu headquarters the computer beeped what do we have patricia nolan asked gillette nodded at the screen search results search request phate location newsgroup altpicturestruecrime status posted message gillettes face bristled with excitement he called to bishop phates posted something himself he called up the message messageidnpkrdka xnewsposter newspost newsgroups altpicturestruecrime from phateicsnetcom to group

pathnewsnewspostcomsouthwestcomnewscommeshadjpcounterculturesystemscomlarivegauchefrnetfrankfltdenetswipnetnewssrrvedeluxeinterpostnetinternetgatewaynet romainternetitglobalsystemsuk remember all the worlds a mud and the people in it merely characters no one could figure out what phates paraphrase of shakespeare might mean until gillette downloaded the picture that was attached to the message it slowly appeared on the screen oh my god linda sanchez muttered her eyes fixed on the terrible image son of a bitch tony mott whispered stephen miller said nothing then he looked away on the screen was a picture of lara gibson she was half naked and lying on a tile floor in a basement somewhere it appeared there were slashes on her body and she was covered with blood her dim eyes were gazing hopelessly at the camera gillette sickened by the picture supposed that it had been taken when shed had only a few minutes left to live he like stephen miller had to turn away bishop asked that address phateicsnetcom any chance its real gillette ran his hypertrace and checked the address fake he said not surprising anyone with this news miller suggested the picture we know phates in the area here somewhere how about if you send troopers to canvass the onehour photoprocessing places they might recognize it before gillette could respond patricia nolan said impatiently hes not going to risk taking film to a photo lab hell use a digital camera even nontechno frank bishop had figured this out so this isnt any help to us the detective said well it might be gillette said he leaned forward and tapped the screen indicating the line that was labeled path he reminded bishop about the pathway in email headers which identified the networks that phates message had made its way through to get to the computer server theyd downloaded it from theyre just like street directions the hacker in bulgaria vlast his path listings were all faked but this one might be real or at least have some networks that phate really used to upload the gibson womans picture gillette began checking every network listed in the path heading with hypertrace the program revealed that one was legitimate thats the network phates computer was actually connected to newsservedeluxeinterpostnet gillette ordered hypertrace to dig up more information about the company in a moment this popped up on the screen domain name interpostnet registered to interpost europe sa grand palais bruges belgium services internet service provider web hosting anonymous browsing and remailing its a chainer gillette said shaking his head im not surprised nolan explained to bishop why this was discouraging its a service that hides your identity when you send emails or post messages gillette continued phate sent the picture to interpost and their computers stripped out his real return address added the fake ones in place of his and then sent it on its way we cant trace it bishop asked no nolan said its a dead end thats why phate didnt bother to write a fake header the way vlast did well the cop pointed out interpost knows where phates computer is lets get their phone number call them up and find out the hacker shook his head chainers stay in business because they guarantee that nobody can find out who the sender is even the police so were dead in the water bishop said but wyatt gillette said not necessarily i think we ought to do some more fishing and he loaded one of his own search engines into the ccu machine chapter twentyfour as the computer at the state polices ccu was sending out a request for information about interpost phate sat in the bay view motel a decrepit inn along a sandy stretch of commercial sprawl in freemont california just north of san jose staring at the laptops monitor he was following the progress of gillettes search gillette would of course know that a foreign chainer like interpost wouldnt give any us cop as much as the courtesy of a reply to a request for a clients identity so as phate had anticipated gillette had used a search engine to look for general information about interpost in hopes of retrieving something that might let the cops beg or bribe some cooperation from the belgium internet service within seconds gillettes search engine had found dozens of sites in which interpost was mentioned and was shooting their names and addresses back to the ccu computer but the packets of data that made up this information took a detour they were diverted to phates laptop trapdoor then modified the packets to insert its hardworking demon and sent them on their way to ccu phate now got this message trapdoor link complete do you wish to enter subjects computer yn phate keyed y hit enter and a moment later was wandering around inside ccus system he typed more commands and began looking through files reflecting that the cops at ccu had thought that like some slobbering serial killer phate had posted the picture of the dying gibson woman just to threaten them or to get off on some weird sadosexual exhibitionist thing but no hed posted the picture as bait to find the internet address of the ccu machine once hed uploaded the picture hed instructed a bot to tell him the address of everybody whod downloaded it one of those had been a california state government computer in the western san jose area which hed guessed was the ccu office even though the domain name suggested it was a tourism organization phate now raced through the police computer copying information then he went straight to a folder labeled personnel records computer crimes unit the contents were not surprisingly encrypted phate pulled down a screen window on trapdoor and clicked on decrypt the program went to work to crack the code as the hard drive moaned phate stood and fetched a mountain dew from a cooler sitting on the motel room floor he stirred in a nodoz and sipping the sweet drink walked to the window where shafts of brilliant sunlight had momentarily broken through the storm clouds the flood of jarring light agitated him and he pulled the shade down quickly then turned back to the muted colors of the computer screen which were far more pleasing to him than gods palette could ever be weve got him gillette announced to the team phates inside our machine lets start the trace all right tony mott said offering a deafening whistle of victory gillette began hypertrace and with faint pings one by one the route between ccus computer and phates appeared on the screen as a tiny yellow line our boys good whatta you say boss linda sanchez offered nodding an admiring head toward gillette looks like he got it right bishop said ten minutes before gillette had had a thought that phates message was a feint he decided that the killer had been setting them up like a master mud player and that hed posted the picture of lara not to taunt or threaten them but so he could find out ccus internet address and get inside their computer gillette had explained this to the team and then added and were going to let him so we can trace him bishop said you got it gillette confirmed waving a hand at the ccu machines stephen miller protested but we cant let him in our system gillette said shortly ill transfer out all the real data to backup tapes and load some encrypted files while hes trying to decrypt them well track him down bishop agreed and gillette had transferred all the sensitive data like the real personnel files to tape and replaced them with scrambled files then gillette sent out a search request about interpost and when the results came back the trapdoor demon came with them its like hes a rapist linda sanchez said seeing the folders in their system opening and closing as phate examined them violation is the crime of the new century come on come on gillette encouraged his hypertrace program which was issuing faint sonar pings each time another link in the chain of connection was identified what if hes using an anonymizer bishop asked i doubt that he is if i were him id be doing a hit and run probably logging on from a pay phone or hotel room and id be using a hot machine nolan explained thats a computer you use once and abandon it doesnt have anything on it that could be traced back to you gillette sat forward staring intently at the screen as the hypertrace lines slowly made their way from ccu toward phate finally they stopped at a location northeast of them ive got his service provider he shouted reading the information on the screen hes dialing into contracosta online in oakland he turned to stephen miller get pac bell on it now the phone company would complete the trace from contracosta online to phates machine itself miller spoke urgently to the pac bell security staff just a few more minutes nolan said her voice edgy stay on the line stay on the line please then stephen miller on the phone stiffened and his face broke into a smile he said pac bells got him hes in the bay view motel in fremont bishop pulled out his cell phone he called central dispatch and had them alert the tactical team silent roll up he ordered i want troopers there in five minutes hes probably sitting in front of the window watching the parking lot with his car running let the swat folks know that then he contacted huerto ramirez and tim morgan and directed them to the motel too tony mott saw this as one more chance to play real cop this time though bishop surprised him okay officer youre coming along on this one only you stay to the rear yessir the young cop said gravely and pulled an extra box of bullets from his desk bishop nodded at motts belt i think the two clips youve got with youll be enough sure okay though when bishop turned away mott slipped a furtive handful of bullets into his windbreaker pocket bishop said to gillette you come with me well stop by bob sheltons place pick him up its on the way then lets go catch ourselves a killer detective robert shelton lived in a modest neighborhood of san jose not far from the freeway the yards of the houses were filled with the plastic toys of youngsters the driveways with inexpensive cars toyotas and fords and chevys frank bishop pulled up to the house he didnt get out immediately but appeared to be debating finally he said just want to let you know about bobs wife their son dying in that car crash she never really got over it she drinks a bit too much bob says shes sick but thats not what it is got it they walked to the house bishop pushed the doorbell button there was no ring inside but they could hear muted voices angry voices then a scream bishop glanced at gillette hesitated a moment then tried the door it was unlocked he pushed inside his hand on his pistol gillette entered after him the house was a mess dirty dishes magazines clothes littered the living room there was a sour smell to the place unwashed clothing and liquor an uneaten meal for two sadlooking american cheese sandwiches was on the table it was lunchtime but gillette couldnt tell if the food was meant for today or leftover from yesterday or even before they couldnt see anyone but heard a crash and footsteps from a back room both bishop and gillette were startled by a shout a womans slurred voice im fucking fine you think you can control me i dont know why the hell you think that youre the reason im not fine im not bob sheltons voice said but his words were lost in another crash as something fell or maybe was flung by his wife oh jesus he shouted now look what youve done the hacker and the detective stood helplessly in the living room not sure what to do now that theyd intruded on this difficult domestic situation im cleaning it up shelton s wife muttered no ill get just leave me alone you dont understand anything youre never here how could you understand gillette happened to glance into the open doorway of a room nearby he squinted the room was dark and from it came an unpleasant musty odor what caught his attention though wasnt the smell but what sat near the doorway a square metal box look at that what is it bishop asked gillette examined it he gave a surprised laugh its an old winchester hard drive a big one nobody uses them anymore but a few years ago they were state of the art most people used them for running bulletin boards and early web sites i thought bob didnt know much about computers bishop shrugged the question as to why bob shelton had a server drive never got answered though because just then the detective stepped into the hallway and blinked in shock at the presence of bishop and gillette we rang the bell bishop said shelton remained frozen as if trying to decide how much the two intruders had heard emma okay bishop asked shes fine he responded cautiously she didnt sound bishop began just has the flu he said quickly he looked coldly at gillette whats he doing here we came by to pick you up bob we have a lead to phate in fremont weve got to move lead bishop explained about the tactical operation at the bay view motel okay the cop said with a glance toward where his wife now seemed to be crying softly ill be out in a minute can you wait in the car he then glanced at gillette i dont want him in my house okay sure bob shelton waited until bishop and gillette were at the front door before turning back into the bedroom he hesitated as if working up his courage then walked through the doorway into the dim room beyond chapter twentyfive it all comes down to this one of his mentors on the state police had shared these words with rookie frank bishop years ago on their way to kick in the door of a walkup apartment near the oakland docks inside were five or six kilos of something the tenants werent willing to part with along with some automatic weapons they were all too willing to use it all comes down to this the older cop had said forget about the backup and medevac choppers and newscasters and public affairs and the brass in sacramento and radios and computers what it comes down to is you versus a perp you kick in a door you chase somebody down a blind alley you walk up to the drivers side of a car where the guy behind the wheels staring straight ahead maybe a fine citizen maybe holding his wallet and license maybe holding his dick maybe holding a browning hammer back to single action and safety off see what im saying oh bishop saw perfectly going through that door was what being a cop was all about speeding now toward the bay view motel in fremont where phate was currently raiding the ccus computer frank bishop was thinking of what that cop had told him so many years ago he was thinking too of what hed noticed in the san ho wardens file on wyatt gillette the article the hacker had written calling the computer world the blue nowhere which was frank bishop decided a phrase that could apply to the cop world too blue for the uniform nowhere because that place on the other side of the door youre about to kick in or down that alleyway or in that front seat of the stopped car is different from anywhere else on gods good earth it all comes down to this shelton still moody from the incident at his home was driving bishop sat in the back gillette was in the front passenger seat shelton wouldnt hear of an unshackled prisoner sitting behind two officers phates still online trying to crack the ccu files gillette said the hacker was studying the screen on a laptop online via a cell phone they arrived at the bay view motel bob shelton braked hard and skidded into the parking lot where a uniformed cop directed him there were a dozen state police and highway patrol cars in the lot and a number of uniformed plainclothes and armorsuited tactical officers clustered around them this lot was next door to the bay view but was out of sight of the windows in another crown victoria were linda sanchez along with tony mott who was decked out in his oakley sunglasses despite the overcast and mist and rubberized shooting gloves bishop wondered how he could keep mott from hurting himself and anyone else during the operation stylish tim morgan today in a doublebreasted forestgreen suit whose cut was ruined by a bulletproof vest noticed bishop and shelton and ran up to the car bent down to the window catching his breath he said guy fitting holloways description checked in two hours ago under the name fred lawson paid cash he filled out the car information on the motel registration card but theres no match in the lot the tag number was fake hes in room oneeighteen the blindsre down but hes still on the phone bishop glanced at gillette he still online gillette looked at his laptop screen yep bishop shelton and gillette climbed from the car sanchez and mott joined them al bishop called to a wellbuilt black trooper alonso johnson was head of the state polices tactical team in san jose bishop liked him because he was as calm and methodical as an inexperienced officer like say tony mott was dangerously gung ho whats the scenario bishop asked the tactical cop opened a diagram of the motel weve got troopers here here here he tapped various places around the grounds and in the firstfloor corridor we dont have much leeway itll be a typical motel room takedown well secure the rooms on either side and above his weve got the passkey and a chain cutter well just go in through the front door and take him if he tries to get out the patio door therell be the second team outside snipersre ready just in case hes got a weapon bishop glanced up and saw tony mott strapping on body armor he picked up a short black automatic shotgun and studied it lovingly with his wraparound sunglasses and biker shorts he looked like a character in a bad sciencefiction film bishop motioned the young man over he asked mott whatre you doing with that gesturing at the gun i just thought i ought to have some better firepower you ever fire a scattergun before officer anybody can have you ever fired a shotgun bishop repeated patiently sure since firearms training at the academy not exactly but bishop said put it back and officer alonso johnson muttered lose the sunglasses he rolled his eyes toward bishop mott stalked off and handed the gun to a tactical officer linda sanchez on her cell phone undoubtedly with her extremely pregnant daughter hung back well to the rear she for one didnt need reminding that tactical operations werent her expertise then johnson cocked his head as he received a transmission he nodded slightly and then looked up were ready bishop said go ahead as casually as if he were politely letting someone precede him into an elevator the swat commander nodded and spoke into the tiny microphone then he motioned a half dozen other tactical officers after him and they ran through a line of bushes toward the motel tony mott followed keeping to the rear as hed been ordered bishop walked back to the car and tuned the radio to the tactical operations frequency it all comes down to this from the radio headset he heard johnson suddenly call go go go bishop tensed leaning forward was phate waiting for them with a gun bishop wondered would he be completely surprised what would happen but the answer was nothing a staticky transmission cut through the air on his radio alonso johnson said frank the rooms empty hes not here not there bishop asked doubtfully wondering if there was a mixup about which room phate was in johnson came back on the radio a moment later hes gone bishop turned to wyatt gillette who glanced at the computer in the crown victoria phate was still online and trapdoor was still trying to crack the personnel file folder gillette pointed to the screen and shrugged the detective radioed to johnson we can see him transmitting from the motel he has to be there negative frank was johnsons response rooms empty except for a computer here hooked up to the phone line a couple of empty cans of mountain dew a halfdozen boxes of computer disks thats it no suitcase no clothes bishop said okay al were coming in to take a look inside the hot close motel room a halfdozen troopers opened drawers and checked out closets tony mott stood in the corner searching as diligently as the rest the soldiers kevlar headgear looked a lot less natural on him than his bikers helmet gillette concluded bishop motioned gillette toward the computer which sat on the cheap desk on the screen he saw the decryption program he typed a few commands then frowned hell its fake the softwares decrypting the same paragraph over and over again so bishop considered he tricked us into thinking he was here but why they debated this for a few minutes but no one could come to any solid conclusion until wyatt gillette happened to open the lid of a large plastic diskstorage box and glance inside he saw an olivedrab metal box stenciled with these words us army antipersonnel charge high explosive this side toward enemy it was attached to a small black box on which a single red eye began to blink rapidly chapter twentysix phate did happen to be in a motel at the moment that motel was in fremont california and he was in front of a laptop computer however the motel was a ramada inn two miles away from the bay view where gillette the judas traitor valleyman and the cops were undoubtedly fleeing the room at the moment escaping from the antipersonnel bomb they were certain would detonate at any minute it wouldnt the box was filled with sand and the only thing the device was capable of doing was scaring the shit out of anyone who was standing close enough to it to see the madefortv blinking light on the supposed detonator phate of course would never kill his adversaries in such an inelegant way that wouldve been far too gauche a tactic for someone whose goal was like a player of the mud game access to get close enough to his victims to feel their quaking hearts as he slipped a blade into them besides killing a dozen cops would have brought in the feds in a big way and hed have been forced to give up on the game here in silicon valley no he was content to keep gillette and the cops from the ccu busy for an hour or so at the bay view while the bomb squad got the meanlooking device out of the room and giving phate a chance to do what hed planned all along use the computer crime units machine to crack into islenet he needed to log on through ccu because islenet would recognize him as a root user and give him unlimited access to the network phate had played plenty of mud games with valleyman and knew that gillette anticipated phate would break into ccus machine and would try to trace him when he did so after trapdoor had broken into ccus computer phate had driven from the bay view motel to this place where his second laptop was warmed up and waiting for him online via a virtually untraceable cell phone connection through a south carolina internet provider linked to an anonymizing net launch pad in prague phate now looked at some of the files hed copied when hed first cracked into ccus system these files had been erased but not wiped that is permanently obliterated and he now restored them easily with restores a powerful undelete program he found the ccus computer identification number and then after a bit more searching the following data system islenet login robertsshelton password blueford database california state police criminal activity archives search request wyatt gillette or gillette wyatt or knights of access or gillette w and compute or hack he then changed his own laptop computers identity number and internet address to that of ccus machine then ordered the computers modem to dial the general islenet access phone number he heard the whistle and hum of the electronic handshake this was the moment when the firewall protecting islenet would have rejected any outsiders attempt to get inside but because phates computer appeared to be ccus islenet recognized it as a superaccess trusted system and phate was instantly welcomed inside the system then asked username phate typed robertsshelton passcode he typed blueford then the screen went blank and some very boring graphics appeared followed by californiaintegrated state law enforcement network main menu department of motor vehicles state police department of vital statistics forensic services local law enforcement agencies los angeles sacramento san francisco san diego monterey county orange county santa barbara county other office of the state attorney general federal agencies fbi atf treasury us marshals irs postal service other mexican federal police tijuana legislative liaison systems administration like a lion grabbing a gazelles neck phate went straight into the systems administration file he cracked the passcode and seized root which gave him unrestricted access to islenet and to all of the systems islenet was in turn connected to he then returned to the main menu and clicked on another entry state police highway patrol division human resources accounting computer crimes violent felonies juvenile criminal activity archive data processing administrative services tactical operations major crimes legal department facilities management felony warrants outstanding phate didnt need to waste any time making up his mind he already knew exactly where he wanted to go the bomb squad had taken the gray box out of the bay view motel and dismantled it only to find that it was filled with sand what the hell was the point of that shelton snapped is this part of his fucking games messing with our minds bishop shrugged the squad had also examined phates computer with nitrogensensing probes and declared it explosivesfree gillette now scrolled through it quickly the machine contained hundreds of files he opened some at random theyre gibberish encrypted bishop asked no look just snatches of books web sites graphics its all filler gillette looked up squinting staring at the ceiling his fingers typing in the air whats it all mean the fake bomb the gibberish files tony mott whod discarded his armor and helmet said all right phate set this whole thing up to get us out of the office to keep us busy why oh jesus christ gillette snapped i know why frank bishop did too he looked quickly at gillette and said hes trying to crack islenet right gillette confirmed he grabbed the phone and called ccu computer crimes sergeant miller here its wyatt listen did you find him no listen to me call the sysadmin at islenet and have him suspend the entire network right now a pause they wont do that miller said its they have to now phates trying to crack it hes probably inside already dont shut it down make sure its suspended thatll give me a chance to assess the damage but the whole state relies on you have to do it now bishop grabbed the phone thats an order miller now okay okay ill call they arent going to like it but ill call gillette sighed we got outthought this whole thing was a setup posting the picture of lara gibson to get our address going through ccus computer sending us here man i thought we were one step ahead of him linda sanchez logged all the evidence attached chain of custody cards and loaded the disks and computer into the folding cardboard boxes shed brought with her like a mayflower mover they packed up their tools and left the room as frank bishop walked with wyatt gillette back to the car they noticed a slim man with a mustache watching them from the far end of the parking lot there was something familiar about him and after a moment gillette recalled charles pittman the santa clara county detective bishop said i cant have him poking around our operations half those county boys handle surveillance like it was a frat party he started toward pittman but the officer had already climbed into his unmarked car he started the engine and drove off bishop called the county sheriffs office he was put through to pittmans voice mail and left a message asking the cop to call bishop back as soon as he could bob shelton took a call listened and then disconnected that was stephen miller the systems administrators hopping mad but islenets suspended the cop barked at gillette you said you were making sure he couldnt get inside islenet i did make sure gillette said to him i took the system offline and then shredded every reference to usernames and passwords he probably cracked islenet because you went back online from ccu to check me out phate mustve found out the ccu machines identity number to get through the firewall and then he logged on with your username and passcode impossible i erased everything did you wipe the free space on the drives did you overwrite the temp and slack files did you encrypt the logs and overwrite them shelton was silent he broke eye contact with gillette and looked up at the fastmoving tatters of fog flowing over them toward san francisco bay gillette said no you didnt thats how phate got online he ran an undelete program and got everything he needed to crack into islenet so dont give me any crap about it well if you hadnt lied about being valleyman and knowing phate i wouldntve gone online shelton responded defensively gillette turned angrily and continued on to the crown victoria bishop fell into step beside him if he got into islenet you know what hed have access to dont you gillette asked the detective everything bishop said hed have access to everything wyatt leapt from the car before bishop had brought it to a complete stop in the ccu headquarters parking lot he sprinted inside damage assessment he asked both miller and patricia nolan were at workstations but it was nolan to whom he directed this question she replied theyre still offline but one of the sysadmins assistants walked a disk of the log files over im just going through it now log files retain information on which users have been connected to a system for how long what they do online and if they log on to another system while theyre connected gillette took over and began keying furiously he absently picked up his coffee cup from that morning took a sip and shuddered at the cold bitter liquid he put the cup down and returned to the screen pounding keys hard as he roamed through the islenet log files a moment later he was aware of patricia nolan sitting beside him she put a fresh cup of coffee next to him he glanced her way thanks she offered a smile and he nodded back holding her eye for a moment sitting this close gillette noticed a tautness to her facial skin and he supposed shed taken her makeover plan so seriously that shed had some plastic surgery he had the passing thought that if she used less of the thick makeup bought some better clothes and stopped shoving her hair off her face every few minutes shed be attractive not beautiful or demure but handsome he turned back to the screen and continued to key his fingers slammed down angrily he kept thinking about bob shelton how could somebody who knew enough about computers to own a winchester server drive be so careless finally he sat back and announced its not as bad as it could be phate was in islenet but only for about forty seconds before stephen suspended it bishop asked forty seconds thats not enough time to get anything useful to him is it no way the hacker said he mightve looked at the main menus and gotten into a couple of files but to get to anything classified hed need other passcodes andd have to run a cracking program for those thatd take him a half hour at best bishop nodded at least we got one break in the outside world it was nearly pm rainy again and a hesitant rush hour was under way but for a hacker there is no afternoon there is no morning no night there is simply time you spend in the machine world and time you do not phate was for the moment offline though he was of course still in front of his computer in his lovely façade of a house off el monte in los altos he was scrolling through page after page of data all of which hed downloaded from islenet the computer crimes unit believed phate had been inside islenet for only fortytwo seconds what they didnt know however was that as soon as hed gotten inside the system one of trapdoors clever demons had taken over the internal clock and rewritten all the connection and download logs in reality phate had spent a leisurely fiftytwo minutes inside islenet downloading gigabytes of information some of this intelligence was mundane but because ccus machine had root access some was so classified that only a handful of law enforcers in the state and federal governments were allowed to see it access numbers and passcodes to topsecret government computers tactical assault codes encrypted files about ongoing operations surveillance procedures rules of engagement and classified information about the state police the fbi the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the secret service and most other law enforcement agencies now as soft rain streaked the windows of his house phate was scrolling through one of these classified folders the state police human resource files these contained information on every individual employed by the california state police there were many many subfolders but at the moment phate was interested only in the one he was looking through now it was labeled detective division and it contained some very useful data iv access the internet is about as safe as a convenience store in east la on saturday night jonathan littman the fugitive game chapter twentyseven for the rest of the evening the computer crimes unit team pored over the reports from the bay view motel continuing to search for any leads to phate and listening in fearful anticipation to the policeband scanners for reports of more killings thered been a report that a young girl had been kidnapped from a private school that morning by a man impersonating her uncle and then released it was certainly phates mo but when huerto ramirez and tim morgan had checked out the school and interviewed the girl but they came away with no leads the hysterical student couldnt even remember the color of her abductors car other officers had canvassed most of the guests at the bay view motel and surrounding areas and had found no witnesses whod seen what kind of car or truck phate had been driving a clerk in a eleven in fremont had sold two sixpacks of mountain dew to someone fitting phates description several hours ago but the killer hadnt said anything that would help in tracing him no one inside or outside the convenience store got a look at his car either the crime scene search of the motel room had revealed nothing useful in tracing phate to a specific location wyatt gillette had helped stephen miller linda sanchez and tony mott perform the forensic analysis on the computer left in the room the hacker reported that it was indeed a hot machine loaded with just enough software for the breakin there was nothing contained in it that gave any indication where phate might be the serial number of the toshiba indicated that it had been part of a shipment to computer world in chicago six months ago the purchaser had paid cash and had never filled out the warranty registration card or registered online all of the computer disks phate had left in the room were blank linda sanchez queen of the computer archaeologists tested each one with the restores program and found that none had ever contained any data sanchez continued to be preoccupied with her daughter and called her every few hours to see how she was doing she clearly wanted to visit the poor girl and so bishop sent her home he dismissed the rest of the troops too and miller and mott the blond cop in much better spirits after his swat experience left to get some dinner and sleep patricia nolan on the other hand was in no hurry to return to her hotel she sat next to gillette and together they scrolled through islenet files trying to find out more about the trapdoor demon there was however no sign of it and gillette reported that the hot had apparently killed itself once gillette leaned back wearily cracked his knuckles and stretched bishop watched him spot a wad of pink phonemessage slips his face brightened and he picked them up eagerly he was clearly disappointed that none were for him probably upset that his exwife hadnt called as hed asked her to do last night well frank bishop knew that feelings about loved ones werent limited to upstanding citizens hed collared dozens of worthless killers whod broken into tears when they were led away in cuffs not at the thought of the hard years ahead of them in prison but because theyd be separated from their wives and children bishop noted that once again the hackers fingers had started typing no keying in the air as he stared at the ceiling was he writing something to his wife right now or maybe he was asking his father the engineer in the dusty sand fields of the middle east for some advice or support or telling his brother that once he was released hed like to spend some time with him nothing nolan muttered were not getting anywhere for a moment bishop felt the same discouragement he saw in her face but then he thought wait a minute im getting distracted here he realized that he had been pulled deep under the hypnotic addictive spell of the blue nowhere it had skewed his thoughts he now walked to the whiteboard and stared at the notations about the evidence the printouts and pictures these were part of the world he was familiar with do something with that bishop glanced at the printout of the terrible picture of lara gibson do something the detective walked closer to the picture studied it carefully look at this he said to shelton the stocky sullen cop joined him what about it what do you see shelton shrugged i dont know what do you see i see clues bishop responded the other things in the picture whats on the floor the walls they can tell us something about where phate killed her ill bet gillette scooted forward and stared at the gruesome photo the picture showed the poor girl in the foreground bishop pointed out what else the shot revealed the floor she lay on was greenish tile there was a square galvanizedmetal duct running from a beige airconditioning or furnace unit the wall was the backside of unpainted sheetrock nailed to wooden studs this was probably the furnace room in a partially finished basement you could also see part of a whitepainted door and what seemed to be a trash can next to it brimming with refuse bishop said well send the picture to the fbi let their techs look it over shelton shook his head i dont know frank i think hes too smart to piss where he eats way too traceable he nodded toward the picture he took her someplace else to kill her thats not where he lives but nolan said i dont agree youre right that hes smart but he doesnt see things the way we do whats that mean gillette seemed to understand exactly phate doesnt think about the real world hed try to cover up any computer evidence but i think hed tend to overlook physical clues bishop nodded at the picture the basement looks pretty new the furnace too or air conditioner whatever it is the fbi might be able to figure out if theres a particular builder who makes residential properties with those brands of materials we could narrow down the building shelton shrugged its a long shot but what can it hurt bishop called a friend of his in the bureau he told him about the picture and what they needed they conversed for a moment or two and the detective hung up hes going to download an original of the picture himself and send it to the lab bishop said the detective then glanced down at a nearby desk and noticed a large envelope addressed to him the routing slip indicated it had come from the california state police juvenile division central files department and must have arrived when he was at the bay view he opened it and read through the contents it was the juvenile court file hed requested on gillette when the hacker had escaped last night he dropped it on the desk then glanced up at the dusty wall clock it was i think we all need some rest he said shelton hadnt mentioned his wife but bishop sensed he was eager to return home to her the brawny detective left with a nod to his partner see you in the morning frank he smiled at nolan gillette received neither a word nor a gesture of farewell bishop said to gillette i dont feel like spending the night here again im going home and youre coming with me patricia nolans head swiveled toward the hacker when she heard this she said casually ive got plenty of room at my hotel my companys paying for a suite youre welcome to stay there if you want got a great minibar but the detective chuckled and said im running toward unemployment fast enough with this case think itd be better if he came with me prisoner in custody you know nolan took the defeat well bishop supposed she was beginning to give up on gillette as romantic material she gathered up her purse a pile of floppy disks and her laptop and left as bishop and gillette walked out the door the hacker asked you mind if we make a stop on the way a stop theres something i want to pick up gillette said oh and speaking of which can i borrow a couple of dollars chapter twentyeight here we are bishop said they pulled up in front of a ranch house small but situated in a verdant yard that looked to be about a half acre a huge lot for this part of silicon valley gillette asked what town this was and bishop told him mountain view then he added of course i cant exactly seeany mountains the only views my nextdoor neighbors dodge up on blocks and on a clear day that big hangar at moffett field he pointed north across the lights of traffic streaming along highway they walked along a winding sidewalk which was badly cracked and buckled bishop said watch your step there ive been meaning to get around to fixing that you have the san andreas fault to thank which is all of about three miles thataway say wipe your feet if you dont mind he unlocked the door and ushered the hacker inside frank bishops wife jennie was a petite woman in her late thirties her pug face wasnt beautiful but was appealing in a wholesome way while bishop with his sprayed hair sideburns and shortsleeved white shirts was a time traveler from the s his wife was very much an uptodate housewife long hair in a french braid jeans a designer work shirt she was trim and athleticlooking though to gillette now out of prison and surrounded by tanned californians she seemed very pale she didnt appear the least put out or even surprised that her husband had brought a felon home to spend the night and gillette supposed shed received a phone call earlier about their houseguest have you eaten she asked no bishop said but gillette held up the paper bag containing what theyd stopped for on the way here from ccu im fine with these jennie unabashedly took the bag from him looked inside she laughed youre not having poptarts for dinner you need real food no really with a smile on his face and sorrow in his heart gillette watched the pastry disappear into the kitchen so near yet so far bishop unlaced his shoes pulled them off and put on moccasin slippers the hacker also took his shoes off and in stocking feet stepped into the living room looking around the place reminded gillette of his own childhood homes white walltowall carpet in need of replacing furniture from jcpenney or sears an expensive tv and a cheap stereo the chipped dining room table doubled tonight as a desk this seemed to be billpaying day a dozen envelopes were carefully laid out to be mailed pacific bell mervyns mastercard visa gillette looked over some of the many framed pictures on the mantelpiece there were four or five dozen of them more on the walls tables and bookshelves the couples wedding picture revealed a young frank bishop identical to todays sideburns and sprayed hair included though the white shirt under the tuxedo jacket was held firmly in place by a cummerbund bishop saw gillette studying them jennie calls us world o frames weve got more pictures than any two families on our block combined he nodded toward the back of the house plenty more in the bedroom and bathroom too that one youre looking at thats my father and mother was he a cop wait do you mind being called a cop do you mind being called a hacker gillette shrugged nope it fits same with cop but no dad owned a printing company in oakland bishop and sons the sons part isnt exactly accurate since two of my sisters run it along with most of my brothers two of gillette said lifting an eyebrow most of bishop laughed im the eighth of nine five boys and four girls thats quite a family ive got twentynine nieces and nephews the detective said proudly gillette looked at a picture of a lean man in a shirt as baggy as bishops standing in front of a onestory building on the façade of which was a sign bishop sons printing and typesetting you didnt want to be in the business i like the idea of a company staying in the family he picked up the picture and gazed at it himself i think familys the most important thing in the world but i tell you idve been pretty bad at the printing business boring you know the thing about being a cop is that its how do i say it its like its infinite theres always something new every day as soon as you think youve figured out the criminal mind bang you find a whole new perspective there was motion nearby they turned look who we have here bishop said a boy of about eight was peeking into the living room from the corridor come on in here young man wearing pajamas decorated with tiny dinosaurs the boy walked into the living room looking up at gillette say hi to mr gillette son thiss brandon hello hi brandon gillette said youre up late i like to say good night to my dad if he doesnt get home too late mom lets me stay up mr gillette writes software for computers you write script the boy asked enthusiastically thats right gillette said laughing at the way the programmers shorthand for software tripped easily off his tongue the boy said we write programs at our computer lab in school the one we did last week made a ball bounce around the screen that sounds like fun gillette offered noting the boys round eager eyes his features were mostly his mothers naw brandon said it was totally boring we had to use qbasic im gonna learn oop objectoriented programming the latest trend exemplified by the sophisticated c language the boy shrugged then java and html for the net but like everybody oughta know that so you want to go into computers when you grow up naw im going to play pro baseball i just want to learn oop cause its where everythings happening now here was a gradeschooler who was already tired of basic and had his eyes set on the cutting edge of programming why dont you go show mr gillette your computer you play tomb raider the boy asked or earthworm jim i dont play games much ill show you come on gillette followed the boy into a room cluttered with books toys sports equipment clothes the harry potter books sat on the bedside table next to a game boy two n sync cds and a dozen floppy disks well heres a snapshot of our era gillette thought in the center of the room was an ibmclone computer and dozens of software instruction manuals brandon sat down and with lightningfast keystrokes booted up the machine and loaded a game gillette recalled that when he was the boys age the state of the art in personal computing was the trash hed selected when his father had told him he could pick out a present for himself at radio shack that tiny computer had thrilled him but it was of course just a rudimentary toy compared with even this cheap mailorder machine he was now looking at at that time just a few years ago only a handful of people in the world had owned machines as powerful as the one on which brandon bishop was now directing a beautiful woman in a tight green top through caverns with a gun in her hand you want to play but this brought to mind the terrible game of access and phates digital picture of the murdered girl her name lara was the same as that of the heroine of this game of brandon s he wanted nothing to do with violence even twodimensional at the moment maybe later he watched the boys fascinated eyes dance around the screen for a few minutes then the detective stuck his head in the door lights out son dad look at the level im at five minutes nope its bedtime aw dad bishop made sure the boys teeth were brushed and his homework was in his book bag he kissed his son good night powered down the computer and shut out the overhead light leaving a star wars spaceship nightlight as the only source of illumination in the room he said to gillette come on ill show you the back forty the what follow me bishop led gillette through the kitchen where jennie was making sandwiches and out the back door the hacker stopped abruptly on the back porch surprised at what he saw in front of him he gave a laugh yep im a farmer bishop announced rows of fruit trees probably fifty altogether filled the backyard we moved in eighteen years ago just when the valley was starting to take off i borrowed enough to buy two lots this one had some of the original farm on it thesere apricot and cherry what do you do sell it give it away mostly at christmas if you know the bishops youre going to get preserves or dried fruit people we really like get brandied cherries gillette examined the sprinklers and smudge pots you take it pretty seriously the hacker observed keeps me sane i come home and jennie and i come out here and tend to the crop it kind of shuts out all the bad stuff i deal with during the day they walked through the rows of trees the backyard was filled with plastic pipes and hoses the cops irrigation system gillette nodded at them you know you could make a computer that ran on water you could oh you mean a waterfalld run a turbine for the electricity no i mean instead of current going through wires you could use water running through pipes with valves to shut the flow on or off thats all computers do you know turn a flow of current on or off is that right bishop asked he seemed genuinely interested computer processors are just little switches that let bits of electricity through or dont let them through all the pictures you see on a computer all the music movies word processors spreadsheets browsers search engines the internet math calculations viruses everything a computer does can be boiled down to that its not magic at all its just turning little switches on or off the cop nodded then he gave gillette a knowing look except that you dont believe that do you how do you mean you think computersre pure magic after a pause gillette laughed yeah i do they remained standing on the porch for a few minutes looking out over the glistening branches of the trees then jennie bishop summoned them to dinner they walked into the kitchen jennie said im going to bed ive got a busy day tomorrow nice meeting you wyatt she shook his hand firmly thanks for letting me stay i appreciate it to her husband she said my appointments at eleven tomorrow you want me to go with you i will bob can take over the case for a few hours no youve got your hands full ill be fine if dr williston sees anything funny ill call you from the hospital but thats not going to happen ill have my cell phone with me she started to leave but then she turned back with a grave look oh but there is something you have to do tomorrow whats that honey the detective asked concerned the hoover she nodded toward a vacuum cleaner sitting in the corner the front panel off and a dusty hose hanging from the side several other components lay nearby on a newspaper take it in ill fix it bishop said theres just some dirt in the motor or something she chided youve had a month now its time for the experts bishop turned toward gillette you know anything about vacuum cleaners nope sorry the detective glanced at his wife ill get to it tomorrow or the next day a knowing smile the address of the repair place is on that yellow sticky tab there see it he kissed her night love jennie disappeared into the dim hallway bishop rose and walked to the refrigerator i guess i cant get into any more trouble than im already in if i offer a prisoner a beer gillette shook his head thanks but i dont drink no thats one thing about hackers we never drink anything thatll make us sleepy go to a hacking newsgroup sometime like althack half the postings are about taking down pac bell switches or cracking into the white house and the other half are about the caffeine content of the latest soft drinks bishop poured himself a budweiser he glanced at gillettes arm the tattoo of the seagull and the palm tree thats mighty ugly i have to say that bird especially whyd you have it done i was in college at berkeley id been up hacking for about thirtysix hours straight and i went to this party and what you did it on a dare no i fell asleep and woke up with it never did find out who did it to me makes you look like some kind of exmarine the hacker glanced around to make sure jennie was gone and then walked to the counter where shed left the poptarts he opened them up and took four of the pastries offered one to bishop not for me thanks ill eat the roast beef too gillette said nodding at jennies sandwiches its just i dream about these in prison theyre the best kind of hacker food full of sugar and you can buy em by the case and they dont go bad he wolfed down two at once they probably even have vitamins in them i dont know thisd be my staple when i was hacking poptarts pizza mountain dew and jolt cola after a moment gillette asked in a low voice is your wife all right that appointment she mentioned he saw a faint hesitation in the detectives hand as he lifted the beer and took a sip nothing serious a few tests then as if to deflect the course of this conversation he said im going to check on brandon when he returned a few minutes later gillette held up the empty box of poptarts didnt save any for you thats okay bishop laughed and sat down again hows your son asleep did you and your wife have children no we didnt want to at first well i should say didnt want to by the time i did want to well id been busted and then we were divorced so youd like kids oh yeah he shrugged brushed the pastry crumbs into his hand and deposited them on a napkin my brothers got two a boy and a girl we have a lot of fun together your brother bishop asked ricky gillette said he lives in montana hes a park ranger believe it or not he and carole thats his wife have this great house sort of a log cabin a big one though he nodded toward bishops backyard youd appreciate their vegetable patch shes a great gardener bishops eyes dipped to the tabletop i read your file my file gillette asked your juvenile file the one you forgot to have shredded the hacker slowly rolled up his napkin then unrolled it i thought those were sealed from the public they are not from the police whyd you do that gillette asked coolly because you escaped from ccu i ordered a copy when we found youd skedaddled i thought we might get some information thatd help track you down the detectives imperturbable voice continued the social workers report was included about your family life or lack of family life so tell me whyd you lie to everybody gillette said nothing for a long moment whyd you lie he thought you lie because you can you lie because when youre in the blue nowhere you can make up whatever you want and nobody knows that what youre saying isnt true you can drop into any chat room and tell the world that you live in a big beautiful house in sunnyvale or menlo park or walnut creek and that your father is a lawyer or doctor or pilot and your mother is a designer or runs a flower store and your brother rick is a state champion track star and you can go on and on to the world about how you and your father built an altair computer from a kit six nights straight after he got home from work and thats what got you hooked on computers what a great guy he is you can tell the world that even though your mother died of a tragic and unexpected heart attack youre still real close to your dad he travels all over the world as a petroleum engineer but he always gets home to visit you and your brother for the holidays and when hes in town you go over to his house every sunday for dinner with him and his new wife whos really nice and you and he sometimes go into his den and debug script together or play a mud game and guess what the world believes you because in the blue nowhere the only thing people have to go by are the bytes you key with your numb fingers the world never knows its all a lie the world never knows youre the only child of a divorced mother who worked late three or four nights a week and went out with her friends always male the other nights and that it wasnt her failed heart that killed her but her liver and her spirit which both disintegrated at about the same time when you were eighteen the world never knows that your father a man of vague occupation fulfilled the only potential hed ever seemed destined for by leaving your mother and you on the day you entered third grade and that your homes were a series of bungalows and trailers in the shabbiest parts of silicon valley that your only treasure was a cheap computer and that the only bill that ever got paid on time was the phone bill because you paid it yourself out of paperdelivery money so that youd be able to stay connected to the one thing that kept you from going mad with sorrow and loneliness the blue nowhere okay bishop you caught me no father no siblings an addictive selfish mother and me wyatt edward gillette alone in my room with my companions my trash my apple my kaypro my pc my toshiba my sun sparcstation finally he looked up and did what hed never done before not even to his wife he told this entire story to another human being frank bishop remained motionless looking intently at gillettes dark hollow face when the hacker had finished bishop said you social engineered your whole childhood yep i was eight when he left gillette said hands around his cola can callused fingertips pressing the cold metal as if he were keying the words i was eight when he was exair force my dad hed been stationed at travis and when he got discharged he stayed in the area well he stayed in the area occasionally mostly he was out with his service buddies or well you can figure out where he was when he didnt come home at night the day he left was the only time we ever had a serious talk my mother was out somewhere and he came into my room and said he had some shopping to do why didnt i come along with him that was pretty weird because we never did anything together gillette took a breath tried to calm himself his fingers keyed a silent storm against the soda can peace of mind peace of mind we were living in burlingame near the airport and my father and i got in the car and drove to this strip mall he bought some things in a drugstore and then took me to the diner next to the railroad station the food came but was too nervous to eat he didnt even notice all of a sudden he put his fork down and looked at me and told me how unhappy he was with my mother and how he had to leave i remembered how he put it he said his peace of mind was jeopardized and he needed to move on for his personal growth peace of bishop shook his head he was talking to you like you were some buddy of his in a bar not a little boy not his son that was really bad he said it was a tough decision to leave but it was the right thing to do and asked if i felt happy for him he asked you that gillette nodded i dont remember what i said then we left the restaurant and we were walking down the street and maybe he noticed i was upset and he saw this store and said tell you what son you go in there and buy anything you want a consolation prize gillette laughed and nodded i guess thats exactly what it was the store was a radio shack i just walked in and stood there looking around i didnt see anything i was so hurt and confused trying not to cry i just picked the first thing i saw a trash a what a trs one of the first personal computers anything you want i took it home and started playing with it that night then i heard my mother come home and she and my father had a big fight and then he was gone and that was it the blue no gillette smiled briefly fingers tapping that article i wrote the blue nowhere i remember bishop said it means cyberspace but it also means something else gillette said slowly nowhere what my father was air force like i said and when i was really young hed have some of his military buddies over and theyd get drunk and loud and a couple of times theyd sing the air force song the wild blue yonder well after he left i kept hearing that song in my head over and over only i changed yonder to nowhere the wild blue nowhere because he was gone he was nowhere gillette swallowed hard he looked up pretty stupid huh but frank bishop didnt seem to think there was anything stupid about this at all with his voice filled with the sympathy that made him a natural family man he asked you ever hear from him or hear what happened to him nope have no clue gillette laughed every once in a while i think i should track him down youd be good at finding people on the net gillette nodded but i dont think i will fingers moving furiously the ends were so numb because of the calluses that he couldnt feel the cold of the soda can he was tapping them against off we go into the it gets even better i learned basic the programming language when i was nine or ten and id spend hours writing programs the first ones made the computer talk to me id key hello and the computerd respond hi wyatt how are you then id type good and it would ask what did you do in school today i tried to think of things for the machine to say thatd be what a real father would ask anything you want all those emails supposedly from my father to the judge and those faxes from my brother about coming to live with him in montana all the psychologists reports about what a great family life i had about my dad being the best i wrote them all myself im sorry bishop said gillette shrugged hey i survived it doesnt matter it probably does bishop said softly they sat in silence for a few minutes then the detective rose and started to wash the dishes gillette joined him and they chatted idly about bishops orchard about life in san ho when theyd finished drying the plates bishop drained his beer then glanced coyly at the hacker he said why dont you give her a call call who your wife its late gillette protested so wake her up she wont break doesnt sound to me like youve got a lot to lose anyway bishop pushed the phone toward the hacker what should i say he lifted the receiver uncertainly youll think of something i dont know the cop asked you know the number gillette dialed it from memory fast before he balked thinking what if her brother answers what if her mother answers what if hello his throat seized hello elana repeated its me a pause while she undoubtedly checked a watch or clock no comment about the lateness of the hour was forthcoming however why wasnt she saying anything why wasnt he just felt like calling did you find the modem i left in it the mailbox she didnt answer for a moment then she said im in bed a searing thought was she alone in bed was ed next to her in her parents house but he pushed the jealousy aside and asked softly did i wake you up is there something you want wyatt he looked at bishop but the cop merely gazed at him with an eyebrow raised in impatience i elana said im going to sleep now can i call you tomorrow id rather you didnt call the house christian saw you the other night and he wasnt very happy about it her twentytwoyearold brother an honors marketing student with a greek fishermans temperament had actually threatened to beat up gillette at the trial then you call me when youre alone ill be at that number i gave you yesterday silence have you got it he asked the number ive got it then good night dont forget to call a lawyer about that the phone clicked silent and gillette hung up i didnt handle that too well at least she didnt hang up on you right away thats something bishop put the beer bottle in the recycling bin i hate working late i cant have supper without my beer but then i have to wake up a couple times during the night and pee thats cause im getting old well weve got a tough day tomorrow lets get some shuteye gillette asked you going to handcuff me somewhere escaping twice in two daysd be bad form even for a hacker i think well forgo the bracelet guest rooms in there youll find towels and a fresh toothbrush in the bathroom thanks we get up at sixfifteen around here the detective disappeared down the dim hallway gillette listened to the creak of boards the sound of water in pipes a door closing then he was alone surrounded by the particularly thick silence of someone elses house late at night his fingers spontaneously keying a dozen messages on an invisible machine but it wasnt sixfifteen when his host woke him it was just after five must be christmas the detective said clicking on the overhead light he was wearing brown pajamas we got a present gillette like most hackers felt that sleep should be avoided like the flu but he wasnt at his best upon waking eyes still closed he muttered a present triplex called me on my cell phone five minutes ago hes got phates real email address its deathknellmolcom mol never heard of an internet provider with that name gillette rolled from bed fighting the dizziness bishop continued i called everybody on the team theyre on their way to the office now which means us too the hacker muttered sleepily which means us too twenty minutes later they were showered and dressed jennie had coffee ready in the kitchen but they passed on food they wanted to get to the ccu office as soon as possible bishop kissed his wife he took her hands in his and said about that appointment thing of yours all you have to do is say the word and ill be at the hospital in fifteen minutes she kissed his forehead im having a few tests done honey thats all no no no you listen he said solemnly if you need me ill be there if i need you she conceded ill call i promise as they were heading out the door a sudden roaring filled the kitchen jennie bishop rolled the reassembled hoover back and forth over the rug she shut it off and gave her husband a hug works great jennie said thanks honey bishop frowned in confusion i gillette interrupted quickly a job like that mustve taken half the night and he cleaned up afterward jennie bishop said with a wry smile thats the miraculous part well bishop began we better be going gillette interrupted jennie waved them off and started making breakfast for brandon glancing affectionately at her resurrected vacuum as the two men walked outside bishop whispered to the hacker so did it take you half the night to fix the vacuum gillette replied naw only ten minutes i couldve done it in five but i couldnt find any tools i had to use a dinner knife and a nutcracker the detective said i didnt think you knew anything about vacuum cleaners i didnt but i was curious why it didnt work so now i know all about vacuum cleaners gillette climbed into the car then turned to bishop say any chance we could stop at that eleven again as long as its on the way chapter twentynine but despite what triplex had told bishop in his phone call phate in his new incarnation as deathknell continued to remain out of reach once gillette was back at the computer crimes unit he booted up hypertrace and ran a search for molcom he found that the full name of the internet service provider was monterey internet online its headquarters were in pacific grove california about a hundred miles south of san jose but when they contacted pac bell security in salinas about tracing the call from mol to phates computer it turned out that there was no monterey internet online and the real geographic location of the server was in singapore oh thats smart a groggy patricia nolan muttered sipping a starbucks coffee her morning voice was low it sounded like mans she sat down next to gillette she was as disheveled as ever in her floppy sweater dress green today obviously not an early riser nolan wasnt even bothering to brush her hair out of her face i dont get it shelton said whats smart whats it all mean gillette said phate created his own internet provider and hes the only customer well probably shawn is too and the server theyre connecting through is in singapore theres no way we can trace back to their machines like a shell corporation in the cayman islands said frank bishop who even if hed had little prior knowledge of the blue nowhere was good at coming up with apt real world metaphors but gillette added seeing the discouraged faces of the team the address is still important why bishop asked because it means we can send him a love letter linda sanchez walked through the front door of ccu toting a dunkin donuts bag blearyeyed and moving slow she looked down and noticed that her tan suit jacket was buttoned incorrectly she didnt bother to fix it and set the food out on a plate any new branches on your family tree bishop asked she shook her head so what happens is this i get this scary movie okay my grandmother told me you can induce labor by telling ghost stories you heard about that boss news to me bishop said anyway we figure a scary moviell work just as good so i rent scream okay what happens my girl and her husband fall asleep on the couch but the movie scares me so much i cant get any sleep i was up all night she disappeared into the coffee room and brought the pot out wyatt gillette gratefully took the coffee his second cup that morning but for breakfast he stuck with poptarts stephen miller arrived a few minutes later with tony mott right behind him sweating from the bike ride to the office gillette explained to the rest of the team about triplexs sending them phates real email address and his plans to send phate a message whats it going to say nolan asked dear phate gillette said having a nice time wish you were here and by the way heres a picture of a dead body what miller asked gillette asked bishop can you get me a crime scene photo a picture of a corpse i suppose the detective replied gillette nodded toward the whiteboard im going to imp that im that hacker in bulgaria he used to trade pictures with vlast ill upload a picture for him nolan laughed and nodded and hell get a virus along with it youll take over his machine im going to try to why do you need to send a picture shelton asked he seemed uneasy with the idea of sending evidence of gruesome crimes into the blue nowhere for all to see my virus isnt as clever as trapdoor with mine phate has to do something to activate it so i can get into his system hell have to open the attachment containing the picture for the virus to work bishop called headquarters and had a trooper fax a copy of a crime scene photo in a recent murder case to ecu gillette glanced at the picture of a young woman bludgeoned to death but looked away quickly stephen miller scanned it into digital form so they could upload it with the email the cop seemed immune to the terrible crime depicted in the picture and matteroffactly went through the scanning procedure he handed gillette a disk containing the picture bishop asked what if phate sees an email from vlast and writes him to ask if its really from him or sends him a reply i thought about that im going to send vlast another virus one thatll block any emails from the us gillette went online to get his tool kit from his cache at the air force lab in los alamos from it he downloaded and modified what he needed the viruses and his own anonymizing email program he wasnt trusting stephen miller anymore he then sent a copy of the mailblocker virus to vlast in bulgaria and to phate gillettes own version of backdoorg this was a wellknown virus that let a remote user take over someone elses computer usually when theyre both on the same computer network for instance two employees working for the same company gillettes version though would work with any two computers they didnt need to be connected through a network ive got an alert on our machine if phate opens the picture my virusll go active and a tone sounds here ill get into his computer and well see if we can find anything thatll lead us to him or shawn or to the next victim the phone rang and miller answered he listened and said to bishop for you its charlie pittman bishop pouring milk in his coffee hit the speaker button on the phone thanks for calling back officer pittman not a problem detective the mans voice was distorted by the cheap speaker what can i do for you well charlie i know you have that peter fowler investigation open but next time we have an operation underway im going to have to ask that you or somebody at the county police comes to me first so we can coordinate silence then hows that im speaking of the operation at the bay view motel yesterday the uh what the voice in the tinny speaker was perplexed jesus bob shelton said turning his troubled eyes toward his partner he doesnt know about it the guy you saw wasnt pittman officer bishop asked urgently did you introduce yourself to me two nights ago in sunnyvale we got a misunderstanding going on here sir im in oregon fishing ive been on vacation for a week and ill be here for another three days i just called the office to get messages i heard yours and called you back thats all i know tony mott leaned toward the speaker you mean you werent at the state police computer crimes unit headquarters yesterday uh no sir like i said oregon fishing mott looked at bishop this guy claiming to be pittman was outside yesterday said hed had a meeting here i didnt think anything of it no he wasnt here miller said bishop asked pittman officer was there some kind of memo about your vacation sure we always send one around on paper or was it on email we use emails for everything nowadays the officer said defensively people think the countys not as uptodate as everybody else but thats not so bishop explained well somebodys been using your name with a fake shield and id damn why probably has to do with a homicide investigation were running what should i do call your commander and get a report on the record but for the moment wed appreciate it if youd keep this to yourself otherwise itd be helpful if the perp doesnt know were on to him dont send anything by email only use the phone sure ill call my hq right now bishop apologized to pittman for the dressingdown and hung up he glanced at the team social engineered again he said to mott describe him the guy you saw thin mustache wore a dark raincoat same one we saw in sunnyvale what was he doing here looked like he was leaving the office but i didnt actually see him come out the door maybe he was snooping around gillette said its shawn has to be bishop concurred he said to mott lets you and me come up with a picture of what he looks like he turned to miller you have an identikit here this was a briefcase containing plastic overlays of different facial attributes that could be combined so witnesses could reconstruct an image of a suspect essentially it was a police artist in a box but linda sanchez shook her head we dont usually do much with facial ids bishop said ive got one in the car ill be right back in his dining room office phate was typing contentedly away when a flag rose on screen indicating that he had an email one sent to his private screen name deathknell he noticed that itd been sent by vlast his bulgarian friend an attachment was included theyd traded snuff pictures regularly at one time but hadnt for a while and he wondered if thats what his friend had sent him phate was curious what the man had sent but hed have to wait until later to find out at the moment he was too excited about his latest hunt with trapdoor after an hour of serious passcode cracking on borrowed supercomputer time phate had finally seized root in a computer system not far away from his house in los altos he now scrolled through the menu stanfordpackard medical center palo alto california main menu administration personnel patient admissions patient records departments by specialty cms facilities management tylerkresge rehabilitation center emergency services critical care unit he spent some time exploring and finally chose number a new menu appeared computerized medical services surgical scheduling medicine dosage and administration scheduling oxygen replenishment oncological chemoradiation scheduling patient dietary menus and scheduling he typed and hit enter in the parking lot of the computer crimes unit frank bishop on his way to fetch the identikit sensed the threat before he actually looked directly at the man bishop knew the intruder fifty feet away half hidden through the earlymorning mist and fog was dangerous the way you know somebody is carrying a weapon just because of the way he steps off the curb the way you know that a threat awaits you behind the door down the alley in the front seat of the stopped car bishop hesitated for only a moment but then he continued on his way as if he suspected nothing he couldnt see the intruders face clearly but he knew it had to be pittman well shawn hed been staking out the place yesterday when tony mott had seen him and he was staking it out again only today the detective had a sense that shawn might be doing more than surveillance maybe he was hunting and frank bishop veteran of the trenches guessed that if this man was here then hed know what kind of car bishop drove and that he was going to cut bishop off on the way to his vehicle that hed already checked angles and shooting zones and backgrounds so the detective continued on his way toward the car patting his pockets as if looking for the cigarettes that hed given up smoking years ago and gazing up at the rain with a perplexed frown on his face trying to fathom the weather nothing makes perps more skittish and likely to flee or attack than unpredictability and sudden motion by cops he knew he could sprint back inside ccu for help but if he did that shawn would vanish and they might never get this chance again no bishop would no more miss this opportunity to nail the killers partner than hed ignore his sons tears keep walking keep walking it all comes down to this a bit of dark motion ahead as shawn now hiding beside a large winnebago camper peeked out to gauge bishops position and then ducked back again the detective continued strolling over the asphalt pretending that he hadnt seen when he was nearly to the winnebago the detective ducked to the right pulling his wellworn gun from his holster and sprinted as fast as he could around the corner of the camper he raised his weapon but he stopped fast shawn was gone in the few seconds that it had taken him to circle behind the vehicle phates partner had vanished to his right across the parking lot a car door slammed bishop spun toward the sound crouching and raising his weapon but he saw that the noise had come from a delivery van a heavyset black man was carrying a box from the vehicle to a nearby factory well where could shawn have gotten to then he found out the door to the camper behind him flew open and before he could turn bishop felt a pistol barrel nestle itself against the back of his head the detective had a fast glimpse of the slight mans mustachioed face as shawn leaned forward and his hand shot out like a snake to rip bishops weapon away bishop thought of brandon and then of jennie he sighed it all comes down to this frank bishop closed his eyes chapter thirty the chime on the ccu computer was merely an offtheshelfwav sound but to the team it blared like a siren wyatt gillette ran to the workstation yes he whispered phates looked at the picture the virus is in his machine on the screen flashed these words configsys modified thats it but we dont have much time all he has to do is check his system once and hes going to see that were inside gillette sat down at the computer lifted his hands to the keyboard feeling the unparalleled excitement he always did just before he started a journey into an uncharted part an illicit part of the blue nowhere he started to key gillette a mans voice shouted as the front door of the ccu crashed open the hacker turned to see someone striding into the dinosaur pen gillette gasped it was shawn the man whod pretended to be charles pittman jesus shelton called startled tony mott moved fast reaching for his large silver pistol but shawn had his own weapon out of his holster and before mott could even draw shawns was cocked and aimed at the young cops head mott lifted his hands slowly shawn motioned sanchez and miller back and continued on toward gillette pointing the gun at him the hacker stood and backed away his arms up there was nowhere to run but wait what was going on frank bishop grimfaced walked through the front door he was flanked by two large men in suits so he wasnt shawn an id appeared in the mans hand im arthur backle with the department of defense criminal investigation division he nodded at his two partners thesere agents luis martinez and jim cable youre cid whats going on here shelton barked gillette said to bishop were linked to phates machine but weve only got a few minutes ive got to go in now bishop started to speak but backle said to one of his partners cuff him the man stepped forward and ratcheted handcuffs on gillette no mott said you told me you were pittman backle shrugged i was working undercover i had reason to suspect you might not cooperate if i identified myself fucking right we wouldntve cooperated bob shelton said backle said to gillette were here to escort you back to the san jose correctional facility you cant bishop said i talked to the pentagon wyatt its legit we got busted he shook his head mott said but the director approved his release dave chambers is out the detective explained peter kenyons acting director of cid he rescinded the release order kenyon gillette recalled was the man whod overseen the creation of the standard encryption program the man who was the most likely to end up embarrassed if not unemployed if it was cracked what happened to chambers financial impropriety narrowfaced backle said prissily insider trading offshore corporations i dont know and i dont care backle then said to gillette we have an order to look through all the files youve had access to and see if theres evidence related to your improper accessing of department of defense encryption software tony mott said desperately to bishop were online with phate frank right now bishop stared at the screen he said to backle please we have a chance to find out where this suspect is wyatts the only one who can help us let him go online in your dreams shelton snapped you need a warrant if the bluebacked paper appeared in the hands of one of backles partners bishop read it quickly and nodded sourly they can take him back and confiscate all his disks and any computers hes used backle looked around saw an empty office and told his partners to lock gillette inside while they searched for the files dont let them do it frank gillette called i was just about to seize root of his machine this is his real machine not a hot one it could have addresses in it it could have shawns real name it could have the address of his next victim shut up gillette backle snapped no the hacker protested struggling against the agents who easily dragged him toward the office get your fucking hands off me we they pitched him inside and closed the door can you get inside phates machine bishop asked stephen miller the big man looked at the screen of the workstation uneasily i dont know maybe its just if you hit one key wrong phatell know were inside bishop was in agony this was their first real break and it was being stolen away from them because of pointless infighting and government bureaucracy this was their only chance to look inside the electronic mind of the killer wherere gillettes files backle asked and his disks no one volunteered the information the team gazed defiantly at the agent backle shrugged and said in a cheerful tone well confiscate everything doesnt matter to us well just take it and youll see it in six months if youre lucky bishop nodded at sanchez that workstation there she muttered pointing backle and the other agents started looking over threeandahalfinch floppy disks as if they could see through the colorful plastic coverings and identify the data inside with their naked eyes as miller stared at the screen uneasily bishop turned to patricia nolan and mott can either of you run wyatts program nolan said i know how it works in theory but ive never cracked into somebodys machine with backdoorg all ive done is try to find the virus and inoculate against it mott said same with me and wyatts program is a hybrid he hacked together himself its probably got some unique command lines bishop made the decision he picked the civilian saying to patricia nolan do the best you can she sat down at the workstation wiped her hands on her bulky skirt and shoved her hair out of her face staring at the screen trying to understand the commands on the menu which were to bishop as incomprehensible as russian the detectives cell phone rang he answered yes he listened for a moment yessir who agent backle the agent looked up bishop continued into the phone hes here sir but no this isnt a secure line ill have him call you on one of the landlines in the office yessir ill do it right now sir the detective scribbled a number and hung up he lifted an eyebrow at backle that was sacramento youre supposed to call the secretary of defense at the pentagon he wants you to call on a secure line heres his private number one of his partners glanced at backle uncertainly secretary metzger he whispered the reverent tone ii suggested that calls like this were unprecedented backle slowly took the phone that bishop pushed toward him you can use this one the detective said the agent hesitated then punched the number into the phone after a moment he came to attention this is cid agent backle sir im on a secure line yessir backle nodded broadly yessir it was on peter kenyons orders the california state police kept it from us sir they got him out on a john doe yessir well if thats what youd like but you understand what gillettes done sir he more nodding sorry i didnt mean to be insubordinate ill handle it sir he hung up and said to his partners somebodys got friends in fucking high places he nodded at the whiteboard your suspect holloway one of the men he killed in virginia was related to some big white house contributor so gillettes supposed to stay out of jail until you collar the perp he hissed a disgusted sigh fucking politics a glance toward the partners you two stand down go on back to the office to bishop he said you can keep him for the time being but im babysitting till the case is over with i understand sir bishop said running to the office where the agents had thrown gillette and unlocking the door without even asking why hed been sprung gillette sprinted to the workstation patricia nolan gratefully yielded the chair to him gillette sat down he looked up at bishop who said youre still on the team for the time being thats good the hacker said formally scooting closer to the keyboard but out of earshot of backle bishop gave a laugh and whispered to gillette how on earth dyou pull that off for it hadnt been the pentagon calling bishop it was wyatt gillette himself hed rung bishops cell phone from one of the phones in the office where hed been locked up the real conversation had been a bit different from the apparent bishop had answered yes gillette frank its wyatt im on a phone in the office pretend im your boss tell me that backles there yessir who agent backle good the hacker had replied hes here sir now tell him to call the secretary of defense but make sure he calls from the main phone line in the ccu office not his cellphone or anybody elses tell him thats a secure line but gillette had reassured its okay just do it and give him this number hed then dictated to bishop a washington dc phone number no this isnt a secure line ill have him call you on one of the landlines in the office yessir ill do it right now sir gillette now explained in a whisper i cracked the local pac bell switch with the machine in there and had all calls from ccu to that number i gave you transferred to me bishop shook his head both troubled and amused whose number is it oh it really is the secretary of defenses it was just as easy to crack his line as anybody elses but dont worry i reset the switch he began keying gillettes variation of the backdoorg program launched him right into the middle of phates computer the first thing he saw was a folder named trapdoor gillettes heart began to pound and he sizzled with a mixture of agitation and exhilaration as his curiosity took over his soul like a drug here was a chance to learn about this miraculous software maybe even glimpse the source code itself but he had a dilemma although he could slip into the trapdoor folder and look at the program because he had root control he would be very vulnerable to detection the same way that gillette had been able to see phate when the killer had invaded the ccu computer if that happened phate would immediately shut down his machine and create a new internet service provider and email address theyd never be able to find him again certainly not in time to save the next victim no he understood that as powerfully as he felt his curiosity hed have to forgo a look at trapdoor and search for clues that might give them an idea of where they might find phate or shawn or who that next victim might be with painful reluctance gillette turned away from trapdoor and began to prowl stealthily through phates computer many people think of computer architecture as a perfectly symmetrical and antiseptic building proportional logical organized wyatt gillette however knew that the inside of a machine was much more organic than that like a living creature a place that changes constantly whenever the user adds a new program installs new hardware or even does something as simple as turning the power off or on each machine contains thousands of places to visit and myriad different paths by which get to each destination and each machine is unique from every other examining someone elses computer was like walking through the local silicon valley tourist attraction the nearby winchester mystery house a rambling room mansion where the widow of the inventor of the winchester repeating rifle had lived it was a place filled with hidden passages and secret chambers and according to the eccentric mistress of the house ghosts the virtual passageways of phates computer lead finally to a folder labeled correspondence and gillette went after it like a shark he opened the first of the subfolders outgoing this contained mostly emails to shawnmolcom from holloway under both of his usernames phate and deathknell gillette murmured i was right shawns on the same internet provider phate is monterey online theres no way to track him down either he flipped open some of the emails at random and read them he observed right away that they used only their screen names phate or deathknell and shawn the correspondence was highly technical software patches and copies of engineering data and specifications downloaded from the net and various databases it was as if they were worried that their machines might be seized and had agreed never to refer to their personal lives or who they were outside of the blue nowhere there wasnt a shred of evidence as to who shawn might be or where he or phate lived but then gillette found a somewhat different email it had been sent from phate to shawn several weeks ago at am which is considered the witching hour by hackers the time when only the most hardcore geeks are online check this one out gillette said to the team patricia nolan was reading over gillettes shoulder he felt her brush against him as she reached forward and tapped the screen looks like theyre a little more than just friends he read the beginning to the team last night id finished working on the patch and lay in the bed sleep was far far away and all i could do was think about you the comfort you give me i started touching myself i really couldnt stop gillette looked up the entire team dod agent backle too was staring at him should i keep going is there anything in it thatll help track him down bishop asked the hacker skimmed the rest of the email quickly no its pretty xrated maybe you could just keep looking frank bishop said gillette backed out of outgoing and examined the incoming correspondence file most were messages from list servers which were emailing services that automatically sent bulletins on topics of interest to subscribers there were some old emails from vlast and some from triplex technical information about software and warez it wasnt helpful all the others were from shawn but they were responses to phates requests about debugging trapdoor or writing patches for other programs these emails were even more technical and less revealing than phates he opened another from shawn to phate re fwd cellular phone companies shawn had found an article on the net describing which mobile phone companies were the most efficient and forwarded it to phate bishop looked at it and said might be something in there about which phones theyre using can you copy it the hacker hit the printscreen also called the screendump button which sent the contents on the monitor to the printer download it miller said thatll be a lot faster i dont think we want to do that the hacker went on to explain that a screen dump does nothing to affect the internal operations of phates computer but simply sends the images and text on the ccus monitor to the printer phate would have no way of knowing that gillette was copying the data a download however would be far easier for phate to notice it might also trigger an alarm in phates computer he continued searching through the killers machine more files scrolled past opening closing a fast scan then on to another file gillette couldnt help but feel exhilarated and overwhelmed by the sheer amount and brilliance of the technical material on the killers machine can you tell anything about shawn from his emails tony mott asked not much gillette replied he gave his opinion that shawn was brilliant matteroffact cold shawns answers were abrupt and assumed a great deal of knowledge on phates part which suggested to gillette that shawn was arrogant and would have no patience for people who couldnt keep up with him he probably had at least one college degree from a good school even though he rarely bothered to write in complete sentences his grammar syntax and punctuation were excellent much of the software code sent back and forth between the two was written for the east coast version of unix not the berkeley version so bishop speculated shawn mightve known phate at harvard the detective noted this on the whiteboard and had bob shelton call the school to see if anyone named shawn had been a student or on the faculty in the past ten years patricia nolan glanced at her rolex watch and said youve been inside for eight minutes he could check on the system at any time bishop nodded lets move on see if we can find out something about the next victim keying softly now as if phate could hear him gillette returned to the main directory a tree diagram of folders and subfolders a c operating system correspondence trapdoor business games tools viruses pictures d backup games gillette and bishop shouted simultaneously and the hacker entered this directory games eniac week ibm pc week univac week apple week altair week next years projects the fuckers got it all laid out there neat and organized bob shelton said and more killings lined up gillette touched the screen the date the first apple was released the old altair computer and jesus next year too check out this week univac bishop said gillette expanded the directory tree univac week completed games lara gibson st francis academy next projects there tony mott called next projects gillette clicked on it the folder contained dozens of files page after page of dense notes graphics diagrams pictures schematics newspaper clippings there was too much to read quickly so gillette started at the beginning scrolled through the first file hitting the screendump button every time he jumped to the next page he moved as quickly as he could but screen dumps are slow it took about ten seconds to print out each page its taking too much time he said i think we should download it patricia nolan said thats a risk gillette said i told you but remember phates ego nolan countered he thinks theres nobody good enough to get inside his machine so he might notve put a download alarm on it it is awfully slow stephen miller said weve only got three pages so far its your call gillette said to bishop the detective leaned forward staring at the screen while gillettes hands hung in the empty space in front of him furiously pounding on a keyboard that didnt exist phate was sitting comfortably at his laptop in the immaculate dining room of his house though he wasnt really here at all he was lost in the machine world roaming through the computer hed hacked earlier and planning his attack for later that day suddenly an urgent beeping sounded from his machines speakers simultaneously a red box appeared in the upperright corner of his screen inside the box was a single word access he gasped in shock someone was trying to download files from his machine this had never happened stunned sweat bursting out on his face phate didnt even bother to examine the system to discover what was happening he knew instantly the picture supposedly sent by vlast had in fact been emailed to him by wyatt gillette to implant a backdoor virus in his computer the fucking judas valleyman was prowling through his system right now phate reached for the power switch the way a driver instinctively goes for the brake when he sees a squirrel in the road but then like some drivers he smiled coldly and let his machine keep running at full speed his hands returned to the keyboard and he held down the shift and control keys on his computer while simultaneously pressing the e key chapter thirtyone on the monitor in front of wyatt gillette the words flashed in hot type begin batch encryption a moment later another message encrypting department of defense standard no gillette cried as the download of phates files stopped and the contents of the next projects file turned to digital oatmeal what happened bishop asked phate did have a download alarm nolan muttered angry with herself i was wrong gillette scanned the screen hopelessly he aborted the download but he didnt log off he hit a hot key ands encrypting everything thats on his machine can you decode it shelton called agent backle was watching gillette carefully not without phates decryption key the hacker said firmly even fort meade running parallel arrays couldnt decrypt this much data in a month shelton said i wasnt asking if you had the key i was asking if you can crack it i cant i told you that i dont know how to crack standard fuck muttered shelton staring at gillette peoplere going to die if we cant find out whats in his computer dod agent backle sighed gillette noticed his eyes straying to the picture of lara gibson on the whiteboard and he said to gillette go ahead if itll save lives go ahead and do it gillette turned back to the screen for once his fingers dangling in front of him refrained from airkeying as he saw the streams of dense gibberish flow past on the screen any one of these blocks of type could have a clue as to who shawn was where phate might be what the address of the next victim was do it for christs sake shelton muttered backle whispered i mean it ill turn my back on this one gillette watched the data flow past hypnotically his hands went to the keys he felt everyones eyes on him but then bishop asked in a troubled voice wait why didnt he just go offline why did he encrypt that doesnt make sense oh jesus gillette said and he knew the answer to that question immediately he swiveled around and pointed to a gray box on the wall a red button rose prominently from the middle of it hit the scram switch now he cried to stephen miller who was closest to it miller glanced at the switch then back to gillette why the hacker leapt up sending his chair flying behind him he made a dive for the button but it was too late before he could push it there was a grinding sound from the main box of the ccu computer and the monitors of every machine in the room turned solid blue as the system failed the notorious blue screen of death bishop and shelton leapt back as sparks shot from one of the vents on the box choking smoke and fumes began to fill the room christ almighty mott stepped clear of the machine the hacker slapped the scram switch with his palm and the power went off halon gas shot into the computer housing and extinguished the flames what the hell happened shelton asked gillette muttered angrily thats why phate encrypted his data but stayed online so he could send our system a bomb whatd he do bishop asked the hacker shrugged id say he sent a command that shut down the cooling fan and then ordered the hard drive head to a sector on the disk that doesnt exist that jammed the drive motor and it overheated bishop surveyed the smoldering box he said to miller i want to be up and running again in a half hour take care of that will you miller said doubtfully i dont know what kind of hardware central services has in inventory theyre pretty backlogged last time it took a couple of days to get a replacement drive let alone a machine the thing is no bishop said furious a half hour the pearshaped mans eyes scanned the floor he nodded toward some small personal computers we could probably do a mininetwork with those and reload the backup files then just do it bishop said and lifted the sheets of paper out of the printer what theyd managed to steal from phates computer via the screen dump before he encrypted the data to the rest of the team he said lets see if weve got anything gillettes eyes and mouth burned from the fumes of the smoldering computer he noticed that bishop shelton and sanchez had paused and were staring at the smoking machine uneasily undoubtedly thinking the same thing he was how unnerving it was that something as insubstantial as software code mere strings of digital ones and zeros could so easily caress your physical body with a hurtful even lethal touch under the gaze of his faux family watching him from the pictures in the living room phate paced throughout the room nearly breathless with anger valleyman had gotten inside his machine and worse hed done this with a simpleminded backdoor program the kind that a high school geek could hack together hed immediately changed his machines identity and his internet address of course there was no way gillette could break in again but what troubled phate now was this what had the police seen nothing in this machine would lead them to his house in los altos but it had a lot of information about his present and future attacks had valleyman seen the next projects folder had he seen what phate was about to do in a few hours all the plans were made for the next assault hell it was already under way should he pick a new victim but the thought of giving up on a plan that hed spent so much effort and time on was hard for him more galling than the wasted effort however was the thought that if he abandoned his plans it would be because of a man whod betrayed him the man whod turned him in to the massachusetts police exposed the great social engineering and in effect murdered jon patrick holloway forcing phate underground forever he sat at the computer screen once more rested his callused fingers on plastic keys smooth as a womans polished nails he closed his eyes and like any hacker trying to figure out how to debug some flawed script he let his mind wander where it wished jennie bishop was wearing one of those terrible openuptheback robes they give you in hospitals and what exactly she thought is the point of those tiny blue dots on the cloth she propped up the pillow and looked absently around the yellow room as she waited for dr williston it was elevenfifteen and the doctor was late she was thinking about what she had to do after the tests here were completed shopping picking up brandon after school shepherding him to the tennis courts today the boy would be playing against linda garland who was the cutest little thing in fourth grade and a total brat whose only strategy was to rush the net every chance she got in an attempt jennie was convinced to break her opponents noses with a killer volley thinking about frank too of course and deciding how vastly relieved she was that her husband wasnt here he was such a contradiction chasing bad men through the streets of oakland unfazed as he arrested killers twice his size and chatted happily with prostitutes and drug dealers she didnt think shed ever seen him shaken up until last week when a medical checkup had shown that jennies white blood cell count was out of whack for no logical reason as she told him the news frank bishop went sheet white and had fallen silent hed nodded a dozen times his head rising and falling broadly shed thought he was going to cry something shed never seen and jennie wondered how exactly shed have handled that so what does it all mean frank had asked in a shaky voice might be some kind of weird infection she told him looking him right in the eye or it might be cancer okay okay hed repeated in a whisper as if speaking more loudly or saying anything else would pitch her into imminent peril theyd talked about some meaningless details appointment times dr willistons credentials and then shed booted him outside to tend his orchard while she got supper ready might be some kind of weird infection oh she loved frank bishop more than shed ever loved anyone more than she ever couldlove anyone but jennie was very grateful that her husband wasnt here she wasnt in any mood to hold somebody elses hand at the moment might be cancer well shed know soon enough what it was she looked at the clock where was dr williston she didnt mind hospitals didnt mind having unpleasant tests but she hated waiting maybe there was something on tv when did the young and the restless come on or she could listen to the radio maybe a squat nurse wheeling a medical cart pushed into the room morning the woman said in a thick latino accent hello you jennifer bishop thats right the nurse hooked jennie up to a vital functions monitor mounted to the wall above the bed a soft beep began to sound rhythmically then the woman consulted a computer printout and looked over a wide array of medicines you dr willistons patient right thats right she looked at jennies plastic wrist bracelet and nodded jennie smiled didnt believe me the nurse said always doublecheck my father he was carpenter you know he always say measure twice cut once jennie struggled to keep from laughing thinking that this probably wasnt the best expression to share with patients in a hospital she watched the nurse draw some clear liquid into the hypodermic and asked dr williston ordered an injection thats right im only in for some tests checking the printout again the woman nodded this is what he ordered jennie looked at the sheet of paper but it was impossible to make sense out of the words and numbers on it the nurse cleaned her arm with an alcohol wipe and injected the drug after she withdrew the needle jennie felt an odd tingle spread through her arm near the site of the injection a burning coldness the doctor be with you soon she left before jennie could ask her what the injection was it troubled her a little the shot she knew you had to be careful with medicines in her condition but then she told herself there wasnt anything to worry about the fact that she was pregnant was clearly shown in the records jennie knew and surely no one here would do anything to jeopardize the baby chapter thirtytwo all i need is the numbers of the cell phone hes using and oh about one square mile to call my own and i can walk right up this fellows backside this reassurance came from garvy hobbes a blond man of indeterminate age lean except for a seriously round belly that suggested an affection for beer he was wearing blue jeans and a plaid shirt hobbes was the head of security for the main cellular phone service provider in northern california mobile america shawns email on cellular phone service which gillette had found in phates computer was a survey of companies that provided the best service for people wishing to use their mobile phones to go online the survey listed mobile america as number one and the team assumed that phate would follow shawns recommendation tony mott had called hobbes with whom the computer crimes unit had often worked in the past hobbes confirmed that many hackers used mobile america because to go online with a cellular phone you needed a consistently highquality signal which mobile america provided hobbes nodded toward stephen miller who was hard at work with linda sanchez getting the ccu computers hooked up and online again steve and i were just talking about that last week he thought we should change our companys name to hackers america bishop asked how they could track down phate now that they knew he was a customer though probably an illegal one all you need is the esn and the min of the phone hes using hobbes said gillette whod done his share of phone phreaking knew what these initials meant and he explained every cell phone had both an esn the electronic serial number which was secret and an min the mobile identification number the area code and sevendigit number of the phone itself hobbes went on to explain that if he knew these numbers and if he was within a mile or so of the phone when it was being used he could use radio direction finding equipment to track down the caller to within a few feet or as hobbes repeated right up his backside how do we find out what the numbers of his phone are bishop asked ah thats the hard part mostly we know the numbers cause a customer reports his phones been stolen but this fellow doesnt sound like the sort to pickpocket one however you find out though we need those numbers otherwise we cant do a thing for you how fast can you move if we do get them me licketysplit even faster if i get to ride in one of those cars with the flashing lights on top of it he joked he handed them a business card hobbes had two office numbers a fax number a pager and two cell phone numbers he grinned my girlfriend likes it that im highly accessible i tell her its cause i love her but fact is with all the call jacking going on the company wants me available believe you me stolen cellular service is gonna be the big crime of the new century or one of them linda sanchez muttered her eyes on the desktop photo of andy anderson and his family hobbes left and the team went back to looking over the few documents theyd had a chance to print out from phates computer before he encrypted the data miller announced that ccus improvised network was up and running gillette checked it out and supervised the installation of the most current backup tapes he wanted to make sure there was still no link to islenet from this machine hed just finished running the final diagnostic check when the machine started to beep gillette looked at the screen wondering if his hot had found something else but no the sound was announcing an incoming email it was from triplex reading the message out loud gillette said heres a phile with some good stuff on our phriend he looked up file phie friend phriend its all in the spelling bishop mused then said i thought triplex was paranoid and was only going to use the phone he didnt mention phates name and the file itselfs encrypted gillette noticed the department of defense agent stir and he added sorry to disappoint you agent backle its not standard its a commercial public key encryption program then he frowned but he never sent us the key to open it did anybody get a message from triplex no one had taken any calls from the hacker do you have his number gillette asked bishop the detective said no that when triplex had called earlier with phates email address the caller id on bishops phone indicated the hacker was calling from a pay phone but gillette examined the encryption program he laughed and said ill bet i can crack it without the key he slipped the disk containing his hacker tools into one of the pcs and loaded a decryption cracker hed hacked together a few years ago linda sanchez tony mott and shelton had been looking over the few pages of material that gillette had managed to screen dump out of phates next projects folder before the killer stopped the download and encrypted the data mott taped the sheets up on the whiteboard and the team stood in a cluster in front of them bishop noted therere a lot of references to facilities management janitorial parking security and food services personnel payroll it sounds like the target is a big place mott said the last page look medical services a hospital bishop said hes going after a hospital shelton added makes sense high security lots of victims to choose from nolan nodded it fits his profile for challenges and game playing and he could pretend to be anybody a surgeon or nurse or janitor any clue which one hes thinking of but no one could find any reference to a specific hospital on the pages bishop pointed to a block of type on one of the printouts csgei claims id numbers unit something about that looks familiar below the words was a long list of what seemed to be social security numbers csgei shelton said nodding also trying to place it yeah ive heard that before suddenly linda sanchez said oh sure i know its our insurer the california state government employees insurance company those must be the social security numbers of patients bishop picked up the phone and called csgeis office in sacramento he told a claims specialist what the team had found and asked what the information designated he nodded as he listened and then looked up theyre recent claims for medical services by state employees bishop then spoke into the phone again whats unit he listened then a moment later he frowned he glanced at the team unit s the state police the san jose office thats us that informations confidential how did phate get it jesus gillette muttered ask if the records for that unit are on islenet bishop did he nodded they sure are goddamn gillette spat out when he broke into islenet phate wasnt online for only forty seconds shit he changed the log files just to make us think that he mustve downloaded gigabytes of data we should oh no a mans voice gasped filled with wrenching alarm the team turned to see frank bishop mouth open stricken pointing at the list of numbers taped to the whiteboard whats wrong frank gillette asked hes going to hit stanfordpackard medical center the detective whispered how do you know the second line from the bottom that social security number its my wifes shes in the hospital right now a man walked into the doorway of jennie bishops room she looked away from the silent tv set on which shed been absently watching the melodramatic closeups on a soap opera and checking out actresses hairstyles she was expecting dr williston but the visitor was somebody else a man in a dark blue uniform he was young and had a thick black mustache which didnt quite match his sandy hair apparently the facial hair was an attempt to give some maturity to a youthful face mrs bishop he had a faint southern accent rare in this part of california thats right my names hellman im with the hospital security staff your husband called and asked me to stay in your room why he didnt tell us he just said to make sure nobody comes into your room except him or policemen or your doctor why he didnt say is my son all right brandon havent heard that he isnt why didnt frank call me directly hellman toyed with the can of mace on his belt the phones at the hospital went down about a half hour ago repairmenre working on it now your husband got through on the radio we use for talking to you know our ambulances jennie had her cell phone in her purse but shed seen a sign on the wall warning that you couldnt use mobiles in hospital that the signal sometimes interfered with heart pacemakers and other equipment the guard looked around the room and then pulled a chair close to the bed and sat down she didnt look directly at the young man but she sensed him studying her scanning her body as if he were trying to look into the armholes of the dotted gown and see her breasts she turned to him with a stern glare but he looked away just before she caught him dr williston a round balding man in his late fifties walked into the room hello jennie howre you this morning okay she said uncertainly then the doctor noticed the security guard and glanced at him with raised eyebrows the man answered detective bishop asked me to stay with his wife dr williston looked the man over and then asked youre with hospital security yessir jennie said sometimes we run into a little trouble with the cases franks working on he likes to be cautious the doctor nodded and then put on his reassuring face okay jennie these tests wont take too long today but id like to talk to you about what were going to be doing and what were going to be looking for he nodded at the bandage on her arm from the injection theyve already taken blood i see and no that was from the shot the you know the injection hows that he asked frowning about twenty minutes ago the injection you ordered there was no injection scheduled but she felt the ice of fear run through her as cold and stinging as the medicine spreading up her arm from the shot the nurse who did it she had a computer printout it said youd ordered an injection what was the medication do you know breathing fast now in panic she whispered i dont know doctor the baby dont worry he said ill find out who was the nurse i didnt notice her name she was short heavy black hair hispanic she had a cart jennie started to cry the security guard leaned forward something happened here something i can do they both ignored him the doctors face scared the absolute hell out of her he too was panicked he leaned forward and pulled a flashlight from his pocket he shone it into her eyes and took her blood pressure he then looked up at the hewlettpackard monitor pulse and pressure are a little high but lets not worry yet ill go find out what happened he hurried out of the room lets not worry yet the security guard rose and shut the door no she said leave it open sorry he responded calmly your husbands orders he sat down again pulled the chair closer to her pretty quiet in here how bout we turn up that tv jennie didnt respond lets not worry yet the guard picked up the remote control and turned the volume up high he clicked the channel selector to a different soap opera and leaned back she sensed him looking at her again but jennie was hardly thinking about the guard at all there were only two things in her mind the horrible memory of the stinging injection and her baby she closed her eyes praying that everything would be all right and cradling her belly where her twomonthold child lay perhaps sleeping perhaps floating motionless as it listened to the fierce frightened drumming of its mothers troubled heart a sound that surely filled the tiny creatures entire dark world chapter thirtythree feeling stiff feeling irritated department of defense agent arthur backle moved his chair to the side so that he could get a better view of wyatt gillettes computer the hacker glanced down at the scraping sound the agents chair made on the cheap linoleum floor then back to the screen and continued keying his fingers flew across the keyboard the two men were alone in the computer crimes unit office when hed learned that his wife might be the killers next target bishop had sped to the hospital everyone else had followed except gillette whod stayed to decode the email theyd received from that guy with the weird name triplex the hacker had suggested backle might be more useful at the hospital but the agent had merely offered the inscrutable half smile that he knew infuriated suspects and pulled his chair closer to gillettes backle couldnt get over the speed with which the hackers blunt callused fingertips danced over the keys curiously the agent was someone who could appreciate talented computer keying for one thing his employer the department of defense was the federal agency thatd been involved in the computer world the longest of any and was as dod public affairs was quick to remind one of the creators of the internet also as part of his regular training the agent had attended various computer crimes courses hosted by the cia the justice department and the department of defense hed spent hours watching tapes of hackers at work watching gillette type now brought to mind a recent course in washington dc sitting at cheap fiberboard tables in one of the pentagons many conference rooms the criminal investigation division agents had spent hours under the tutelage of two young men who werent your typical army continuing ed instructors one had shoulderlength hair and wore macramé sandals shorts and a rumpled tshirt the other was dressed more conservatively but did have extensive body piercings and his crewcut hair was green the two had been part of a tiger team the term for a group of former badboy hackers whod turned from the dark side generally after realizing how much money there was to be made by protecting companies and government agencies from their former colleagues skeptical at first about these punks backle had nonetheless been won over by their brilliance and their ability to simplify the otherwise incomprehensible subjects of encryption and hacking the lectures had been the most articulately delivered and understandable of any that hed attended in his six years with the criminal investigation division of the dod backle knew he was no expert but thanks to the class he was following in general terms what gillettes cracking program was now doing it didnt seem to have anything to do with the dods standard encryption system but mr green hair had explained how you could camouflage programs you could for instance put a shell around standard to make it look like some other kind of program even a game or word processor and that was why he was now leaning forward noisily sharing his irritation gillettes shoulders tensed once again and he stopped keying he looked at the agent i really need to concentrate here and you breathing down my necks a little distracting whats that program youre running again theres no again about it i never told you what it was in the first place the faint smile again well tell me would you im curious an encryptiondecryption program i downloaded from the hackermart web site and modified myself its freeware so i guess im not guilty of a copyright violation which isnt your jurisdiction anyway hey you want to know the algorithm it uses backle didnt answer just stared at the screen making sure the halfsmile was annoyingly lodged on his face gillette said tell you what backle i need to do this how bout if you go get some coffee and a bagel or whatever they have in the canteen up the hall there and let me do my job he added cheerfully you can look through it when im done and then arrest me on some more bullshit charges if you want my were a little touchy here arent we backle said scraping the chair legs loudly im just doing my job and im trying to do mine the hacker turned back to the computer backle shrugged the hackers attitude didnt do a thing to diminish his irritation but he did like the idea of a bagel he stood up stretched and walked down the corridor following the smell of coffee frank bishop skidded the crown victoria into the parking lot of the stanfordpackard medical center and leapt from the car forgetting to shut the engine off or close the door halfway to the front entrance he realized what hed done and stopped abruptly turned back but he heard a womans voice call go ahead boss i got it it was linda sanchez she bob shelton and tony mott were in the unmarked car right behind bishops because hed been in such a hurry to get to his wife hed left ccu without waiting for the rest of the team patricia nolan and stephen miller were in a third car he continued breathlessly on to the front door in the main reception area he sped past a dozen waiting patients at the signin desk three nurses were huddled around the receptionist staring at a computer screen no one looked at him right away something was wrong they were all frowning taking turns at the keyboard excuse me this is police business he said flashing his shield i need to know which room jennie bishop is in a nurse looked up sorry officer the systems haywire we dont know whats going on but theres no patient information available i have to find her now the nurse saw the agonized look on his face and walked over to him is she an inpatient what is she staying overnight no shes just having some tests for an hour or two shes dr willistons patient oncology outpatient the nurse understood okay thatd be the third floor west wing that way she pointed and started to say something else but bishop was already sprinting down the hall a flash of white beside him he glanced down his shirt was completely untucked he shoved it back into his slacks never breaking stride up the stairs through the corridor which seemed to be a mile long to the west wing at the end of the hallway he found a nurse and she directed him to a room the young blonde had an alarmed expression on her face but whether that was because of something she knew about jennie or because of his concerned expression bishop didnt know he ran down the hall and burst through the doorway nearly knocking into a trim young security guard sitting beside the bed the man stood up fast reaching for his pistol honey jennie cried its okay bishop said to the guard im her husband his wife was crying softly he ran to her and enfolded her in his arms a nurse gave me a shot she whispered the doctor didnt order it they dont know what it is whats going on frank he glanced at the security guard whose name badge read r hellman the man said happened before i got here sir theyre looking for that nurse now bishop was thankful the guard was here at all the detective had had a terrible time getting through to the hospital security staff to have someone sent to jennies room phate had crashed the hospital phone switch and the transmissions on the radio had been so staticky he hadnt even been sure what the person on the other end of the radio was saying but apparently the message had been received all right bishop was further pleased that the guard unlike most of the others hed seen at the hospital was wearing a sidearm what is it frank jennie repeated that fellow were after he found out you were in the hospital we think he might be here someplace linda sanchez jogged into the room fast the guard looked at her police id dangling from a chain around her neck and motioned her in the women knew each other but jennie was too upset to nod a greeting frank what about the baby she was sobbing now what if he gave me something that hurts the baby whatd the doctor say he doesnt know its going to be all right honey youll be okay bishop told linda sanchez what happened and the stocky woman sat on jennies bed she took the patients hand leaned forward and said in a friendly but firm voice look at me honey look at me when jennie did sanchez said now were in a hospital right jennie nodded so if anybody did anything he shouldntve they can fix you up just fine in no time the officers dark stubby fingers rubbed jennies arms vigorously as if the woman had just come inside from a freezing rainstorm therere more doctors here per square inch here than anywhere in the valley right look at me am i right jennie wiped her eyes and nodded she seemed to relax a bit bishop did too glad to partake in this reassurance but that bit of relief sat right beside another thought that if his wife or the baby were harmed in any way neither shawn nor phate would make it into custody alive tony mott jogged through the door not the least winded from his sprint to the room unlike bob shelton who staggered into the doorway leaning against the jamb gasping for breath bishop said phate mightve done something with jennies medicine theyre checking on it now jesus shelton muttered for once bishop was glad that tony mott was at the front lines and that he carried that big chromeplated colt on his hip his opinion now was that you couldnt have too many allies or too much firepower when you were up against perps like phate and shawn sanchez kept her comforting grip on jennies hand whispering nonsense telling her how good she looked and how terrible the food here would probably be and man oh man wasnt that orderly up the hall a hunk bishop thought what a lucky woman sanchezs daughter was to have a mother like this who would surely be stationed just like this right beside her during labor when the girl finally brought her own lazy baby into the world mott had had the foresight to bring photocopies of holloways massachusetts booking picture hed handed these to some guards downstairs he explained and they were distributing them to hospital personnel so far though no one had seen the killer the young cop added to bishop patricia nolan and millerre in the hospitals computer department trying to figure out how bad the hack was bishop nodded and then said to shelton and mott i want you to suddenly the vital signs monitor on the wall began to buzz with a loud sound the diagram showing jennies heart rate was jumping frantically up and down then a message popped up on the screen in glowing red type warning fibrillation jennie gasped and tilted her head up staring at the monitor she screamed jesus bishop cried and grabbed the call button he began pushing it frantically bob shelton ran into the hallway and started shouting we need help here here now then the lines on the screen suddenly went flat the warning tone changed to a piercing squeal and a new message burned onto the monitor warning cardiac arrest honey jennie sobbed bishop hugged her hard feeling utterly helpless sweat poured from her face and she shivered but she remained conscious linda sanchez ran to the door and cried get a goddamn doctor in here now a moment later dr williston ran into the room he glanced at the monitor and then at his patient and reached up shut off the machine do something bishop cried williston listened to her chest then took her blood pressure then he stepped back and announced shes fine fine mott asked sanchez looked as if she was about to grab the doctor by the jacket and drag him back to his patient check her again theres nothing wrong with her he told the policewoman but the monitor bishop stammered malfunction the doctor explained something happened in the main computer system every monitor on this floors been doing the same thing jennie closed her eyes and pressed her head back in the pillow bishop held her tightly and that injection the doctor continued i tracked it down somehow central pharmaceutical got an order for you to receive a vitamin shot thats all it was a vitamin bishop trembling with relief fought down the tears the doctor said it wont hurt you or the fetus in any way he shook his head it was strange the order went out under my name and whoever did it got my passcode to authorize it i keep that in a private file in my computer i cant imagine how anybody got it cant imagine tony mott said with a sardonic glance at bishop a man in his fifties with a military bearing walked into the room he wore a conservative suit he introduced himself as les allen he was head of security at the hospital hellman the guard in the room nodded to allen who didnt respond he asked bishop whats going on here detective bishop told him about what had happened with his wife and the monitors allen said so he got into our main computer ill bring that up with the security committee today but at the moment what should we do you think this guys here someplace oh yeah hes here bishop waved at the dark monitor above jennies head he did this as a diversion to get us to focus on jennie and this wing which means hes targeting a different patient or patients bob shelton said mott added or somebody on the staff bishop said this suspect likes challenges what would be the hardest place in the hospital to break into dr williston and les allen considered this what do you think doctor the operating suites they all have controlledaccess doors thatd be my guess and where are they in a separate building you get to them through a tunnel from this wing and most doctors and nurses there would be masked and gowned right linda sanchez asked yes so phate could roam his killing grounds freely bishop then asked is there anyone being operated on right now dr williston laughed anyone weve got probably twenty procedures going on id say he turned to jennie ill be back in ten minutes well get those tests over with and get you home he left the room lets go hunting bishop said to mott sanchez and shelton he hugged jennie again as he left the young security guard pulled his chair closer to the bedside once they were in the corridor the guard swung the door shut bishop heard it latch they walked down the hall quickly mott keeping his hand near his automatic looking around as if he were about to draw and shoot anybody who bore the least resemblance to phate bishop too felt unnerved recalling that the killer was a chameleon and with his disguises could be walking past them right now and they might never know it they were at the elevator when something occurred to bishop alarmed he looked back toward the closed door of jennies room he didnt go into the details of phates social engineering skills but said to allen the thing about our suspect is that were never quite sure what hell look like next i didnt pay much attention to that guard in my wifes room hes about the perps age and build youre sure he works for your department who dick hellman back there allen answered nodding slowly well what i can tell you for sure is that hes my daughters husband and ive known him for eight years as far as the work part of your question goes if putting in a fourhour day during an eighthour shift is work then i guess the answers yes in the tiny canteen at the computer crimes unit agent art backle rummaged futilely through the refrigerator for milk or halfandhalf since starbucks had arrived in the bay area backle hadnt drunk any other kind of coffee and he knew that the boileddown burntsmelling brew here would taste vile without something to take the edge off with some disgust he poured a large dose of coffeemate into the cup the liquid turned gray he took a bagel from the plate and bit down into what turned out to be rubber goddamn he flung the phony bagel across the room realizing of course that gillette had sent him back here as a practical fucking joke he decided that when the hacker went back to prison hed what was that noise he started to turn toward the doorway but by the time he identified the sound as sprinting footsteps his attacker was already on top of him he slammed into the slim agents back pitching him into the wall and knocking the wind out of his lungs the attacker flicked the lights out the windowless room went completely black then the man grabbed backle by the collar and flung him facedown to the floor his head slammed into the concrete with a quiet thud gasping for breath the agent groped for his pistol but another hand got there first and lifted it away who do you want to be phate walked slowly down the main corridor of the state polices computer crimes unit offices he was wearing a worn stained pacific gas and electric uniform and a hard hat hidden just inside the coveralls was his kabar knife and a large automatic pistol a clock with three clips of ammunition he carried another weapon as well but it was one that might not be recognized as such not in the hands of a repairman a large monkey wrench who do you want to be someone the cops here would trust someone they wouldnt think twice about seeing in their midst thats who phate looked around surprised that the ccu had picked a dinosaur pen for their headquarters had it been a coincidence that theyd set up shop here or had it been intentional on the part of the late andy anderson he paused and oriented himself then continued slowly and quietly toward a cubicle on the shadowy edge of the pens central control area from inside the cubicle he could hear furious keying surprised too that ccu was this empty hed expected at least three or four people here hence the large pistol and the extra ammunition but everyone was apparently at the hospital where mrs frank bishop was probably suffering quite a bit of trauma as a result of the nutrientrich vitamin b shot hed ordered for her that morning phate had considered actually killing the woman he couldve done so easily by ordering central medication to administer a large dose of insulin say but that wouldntve been the best tactic for this segment of the game alive and screaming in panic she was valuable in her role as the diversionary character if she died the police mightve concluded that she was his intended target and returned here to headquarters immediately now the police were scurrying through the hospital trying to find the real victim in fact this victim was elsewhere only that person was neither a patient nor a staff member at stanfordpackard medical center he was right here at ccu and his name was wyatt gillette who was now only twenty feet away from phate in that dingy cubicle in front of him phate listened to the astonishing staccato of valleymans fast and powerful keyboarding his touch was relentless as if his brilliant ideas would vanish like smoke if he didnt pound them instantly into the central processing unit of his machine he slowly moved closer to the cubicle gripping the heavy wrench in the days when the two young men had been running knights of access gillette had often said that hackers must become adept at the art of improvising it was a skill phate too had developed and so today he had improvised hed decided there was too great a risk that gillette had found out about the attack at the hospital when hed broken into phates machine so hed changed the plans slightly instead of killing several patients in one of the operating suites as hed intended hed pay a visit to ccu thered been a chance of course that gillette would go with the police to the hospital so hed sent some encrypted gibberish a message that appeared to come from triplex to make sure hed remain here and try to decrypt it this was he decided a perfect round not only would it be a real challenge for phate to get into ccu worth a solid points in the access game but if he was successful it would finally give him the chance to destroy the man hed been after for years he looked around again listened not a soul in the huge room other than judas valleyman and the defenses were much less stringent here than hed expected still he didnt regret going to so much trouble the pg e uniform the faked work order to check some circuit boxes the laminated badge hed painstakingly made on his id machine the timeconsuming lock picking when youre playing access against a true wizard you cant be too careful especially when that wizard happens to be ensconced in the police departments own dungeon he was now only feet away from his adversary a man whose painful death phate had idled away so very many hours imagining but unlike the traditional game of access where you pierce the beating heart of your victim phate had something else in mind for gillette an eye for an eye a fast blow to the mans head with the wrench to stun him and then gripping valleymans head hed go to work with the kabar knife hed taken the idea from his young trapdoor at st francis academy jamie turner as the young man had once written in an email to his brother jamiett man can you think of anything scarier than going blind if youre a hacker no jamie i sure cant phate now answered him silently he paused beside the cubicle and crouched listening to the steady clatter of the keys taking a deep breath he stepped inside fast drawing back the wrench for good leverage chapter thirtyfour phate stepped into the center of the empty cubicle the wrench raised above his head no he whispered the sounds of keyboarding werent coming from wyatt gillettes fingers at all the source was the speaker connected to the workstations computer the cubicle was empty but as he dropped the wrench and started to pull his pistol from the coverall gillette stepped out from the cubicle next to this one and pressed the gun hed just lifted off poor agent backle into phates neck he pulled the killers pistol from his hand dont move jon gillette told him and went through his pockets he lifted out a zip disk a portable cd player and headset a set of car keys and a wallet then he found the knife he placed everything on the desk that was good phate said nodding at the computer gillette hit a key and the sound stopped you recorded yourself on awav file so id think you were in here thats right phate smiled bitterly and shook his head gillette stepped back and the wizards surveyed each other this was their first facetoface meeting theyd shared hundreds of secrets and plans and millions of words but those communications had never been in person theyd all been in the miraculous incarnation of electrons coursing through copper wire or fiberoptic cables phate gillette concluded seemed trim and healthy looking for a hacker he had a mild tan but gillette knew that the color was from a bottle no hacker in the world would trade machine time for even ten minutes at the beach the mans face seemed amused but his eyes were hard as chips of stone nice tailor gillette said nodding at the pg e uniform he picked up the zip disk that phate had brought and lifted an eyebrow my version of hide and seek phate explained this was a powerful virus that would sweep through every machine at ccu and encode the data files and operating system the only problem was that there was no key to decode them he asked gillette howd you know i was coming i figured you really were going to kill somebody at the hospital until you started to worry that i mightve seen some of your notes when i got inside your machine so you changed your plans you led everybody else off and came after me thats pretty much it you made sure id stay here by sending us that encrypted email supposedly from triplex thats what tipped me off that you were coming he wouldntve sent an email to us he wouldve called with trapdoor around he was too paranoid youd find out he was helping us well i found out anyway didnt i phate then added hes dead you know triplex what i made a stop on the way here a nod toward the knife thats his blood on there his real world name was peter c grodsky lived alone in sunnyvale worked as a code cruncher for a credit bureau during the day hacked at night he died next to his machine for what thats worth how did you find out that you two were sharing information about me phate scoffed do you think theres a single fact in the world i cant find if i want to you son of a bitch gillette thrust the gun forward and waited for phate to cringe or cry out in fear he did neither he simply looked back unsmiling into gillettes eyes and continued anyway triplex hadto die he was the betraying character the what in the game were playing our mud game triplex was the turncoat they all have to die like judas or boromir in the lord of the rings your characters part is pretty clear too you know what it is characters gillette remembered the message that had accompanied the picture of the dying lara gibson all the worlds a mud and the people in it merely characters tell me youre the hero with the flaw the flaw usually gets them into trouble oh youll do something heroic at the end and save some lives and the audiencel cry for you but youll still never make it to the final level of the game so whats my flaw dont you know your curiosity gillette then asked and what character are you im the antagonist whos better and stronger than you and im not held back by moral compunction but i have the forces of good lined up against me that makes it a bitch for me to win lets see who else andy anderson he was the wise man who dies but whose spirit lives on obiwan kenobi frank bishop is the soldier gillette was thinking hell we couldve had a police guard protecting triplex we couldve done something amused again phate looked down at the pistol in gillettes hand they let you have a gun i borrowed it gillette explained from a guy who stayed here to babysit me and hes what knocked out bound and gagged something like that phate nodded and he didnt see you do it so youre going to tell them that it was me prelty much a bitter laugh id forgotten what a fucking good mud tactician you were you were the quiet one in knights of access you were the poet but damn you played a good game gillette pulled a pair of handcuffs out of his pocket these too hed lifted off backles belt after he body slammed the agent in the coffee room he felt far less guilty about the assault than he supposed he ought to he tossed the cuffs to phate and stepped back put them on the hacker took them but didnt ratchet them around his wrists he simply stared at gillette for a long moment then let me ask you a question whyd you go over to the other side the handcuffs gillette muttered gesturing toward them put them on but with imploring eyes phate said passionately come on man youre a hacker you were born to live in your blue nowhere whatre you doing working for them im working for them because i am a hacker gillette snapped youre not youre just a goddamn loser who happens to use machines to kill people thats not what hackings about access is what hackings about getting as deep as you can into someones system but you dont stop with somebodys c drive jon you have to keep going to get inside their body too he waved angrily at the whiteboard where the pictures of lara gibson and willem boethe were taped youre killing people theyre not characters theyre not bytes theyre human beings so i dont see a bit of difference between software code and a human being theyre both created they serve a purpose then people die and codes replaced by a later version inside a machine or outside inside a body or out cells or electrons theres no difference of course theres a difference jon is there he asked apparently perplexed by gillettes comment think about it how did life start lightning striking the primordial soup of carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen phosphate and sulfate every living creature is made up of those elements every living creature functions because of electrical impulses well every one of those elements in one form or another youll find in a machine which functions because of electrical impulses save the bogus philosophy for the kids in the chat rooms jon machinesre wonderful toys theyve changed the world forever but theyre not alive they dont reason since when is reasoning a prerequisite for life phate laughed half the people on earth are fools wyatt trained dogs and dolphins reason better than they do for christs sake what happened to you did you get so lost in the machine world that you cant tell the difference phates eyes grew wide with anger lost in the machine world i dont have any other world and whose fault is that what do you mean jon patrick holloway had a life in the real world he lived in cambridge he worked at harvard he had friends hed go out to dinner hed go on dates his was as real as anybody elses fucking life and you know what he liked it he was going to meet somebody he was going to have a family his voice broke but what happened you turned him in and destroyed him and the only place left for him to go was the machine world no gillette said evenly the real you was cracking into networks and stealing code and hardware and crashing nineoneone jon holloways life was totally fake but it was something it was the closest i ever came to having a life phate swallowed and for a moment gillette wondered if he was going to cry but the killer controlled his emotions fast and smiling glanced around the dinosaur pen he noticed the two broken keyboards sitting in the corner youve only busted two of them he laughed gillette himself couldnt help but smile ive only been here a couple of days give me time i remember you saying you never developed a light touch i was hacking one time mustve been five years ago and i broke my little finger i didnt even know it i kept keying for another couple of hours until i saw my hand start to turn black what was your endurance record phate asked him gillette thought back once i keyed for thirtynine hours straight mine was thirtyseven phate responded wouldve been longer but i fell asleep when i woke up i couldnt move my hands for two hours man we did some serious shit didnt we gillette said remember that guy the air force general we saw him on cnn he said that their recruiting web site was tighter than fort knox and that no punks would ever hack it and we got inside their vax in what about ten minutes the young hackers had uploaded kimberlyclark advertisements onto the site all the exciting pictures of jet fighters and bombers were replaced by product shots of kotex boxes that was a good hack phate said oh and how bout when we turned the white house press office main line into a pay phone gillette mused they fell silent for a moment finally phate said oh man you were better than me you just got derailed you married that greek girl what was her name ellie papandolos right he looked gillette over closely as he mentioned her name you got divorced but youre still in love with her right i can see it gillette said nothing phate continued youre a hacker man youve got no business being with a woman when machinesre your life you dont need a lover theyll only hold you back gillette countered what about shawn a darkness crossed phates face thats different shawn understands exactly who i am there arent many people who do who is he shawns none of your business phate said ominously then a moment later he smiled come on wyatt lets work together i know you want the scoop on trapdoor wouldnt you give anything to know how it works i do know how it works you use a packetsniffer to divert messages then you use steganography to embed a demon in the packets the demon selfactivates as soon as its inside the target machine and resets the communications protocols it hides in a game program and selfdestructs when somebody comes looking for it phate laughed but thats like saying oh that man flaps his arms and flies how did i do it thats what you dont know thats what nobody knows dont you wonder what the source code looks like wouldnt you love to see that code mr curious itd be like getting a look at god wyatt you know you want to for an instant gillettes mind scrolled through line after line of software programming what he himself would write to duplicate trapdoor but when he got to a certain point the screen in his minds eye went blank he could see no further and he felt the terrible lust of curiosity consuming him oh yes he did want to see the source code so very badly but he said just put the cuffs on phate glanced at the clock on the wall remember what i used to say about revenge when we were hacking hacker revenge is patient revenge what about it i just want to leave you with that thought oh one other thing you ever read mark twain gillette frowned and didnt answer phate continued a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court no well its about this man in the s whos transported back in time to medieval england theres this totally moby scene where the hero or somebody is in some kind of hot water and the knightsre going to kill them or whatever jon put the cuffs on gillette extended the gun only what happens this is pretty good what happens is he has an almanac with him and he looks up the date in whatever year it is and he sees that there was a total eclipse of the sun then so he tells the knights if they dont back off hell turn day to night and of course they dont believe him but then the eclipse happens and everybody freaks and the heros saved so i was worried i might get into some kind of hot water here whats your point phate said nothing but the point became evident a few seconds later when the clock hit exactly twelvethirty and the virus phate must have loaded in the electric companys computer shut off the power to the ccu office the room was plunged into blackness gillette leapt back raising backles gun and squinting into the dark for a target phates powerful fist slammed into his neck and stunned him then he shouldered gillette hard into the cubicle wall knocking him to the floor he heard a jangling as phate grabbed his keys and other things on the desk gillette reached up trying for the mans wallet but phate already had that and all gillette could save was the cd player he felt another stunning pain as the monkey wrench slammed into his shin gillette staggered to his knees lifted backles gun toward where he thought phate was and pulled the trigger but nothing happened apparently the safety was on as he started to fiddle with it a foot slammed into his jaw the gun fell from his hand and he went down onto the floor once again v the expert level there are only two ways to get rid of hackers and phreakers one is to get rid of computers and telephones the other way is to give us what we want which is free access to all information until one of those two things happen we are not going anywhere a hacker known as revelation quoted in the ultimate beginners guide to hacking and phreaking chapter thirtyfive are you all right patricia nolan asked looking at the blood on gillettes face neck and pants im fine he said but she didnt believe him and played nurse anyway disappearing into the canteen and returning with damp paper towels and liquid soap she bathed his eyebrow and cheek where hed been cut in the fight with phate he smelled fresh nail conditioner on her strong hands and wondered when in light of phates assault on the hospital and here shed found time for cosmetics she made him tug his pants cuff up and she cleaned the small gash on his leg holding his calf firmly she finished and offered him an intimate smile forget it patty he thought once more im a felon im out of work im in love with another woman really dont bother that doesnt hurt she asked touching the damp cloth to the cut it seared like a dozen bee stings just itches a little he said hoping to discourage the relentless mothering tony mott ran back inside ccu bolstering his massive weapon no sign of him shelton and bishop walked inside a moment later all three men had returned to ccu from the medical center and had spent the last half hour scouring the area looking for any signs of phate or witnesses whod seen him arrive at or flee the ccu but the homicide partners faces revealed that theyd had no more luck than mott bishop sat wearily in an office chair so what happened he asked the hacker gillette briefed them about phates attack on ccu he say anything thats helpful no not a thing i almost got his wallet but just ended up with that he nodded at the cd player a tech from the crime scene identification unit had printed it and found that the only prints were phates and gillettes then the hacker delivered the news that triplex was dead oh no frank bishop said looking heartsick that a civilian whod taken a risk to help them had been killed bob shelton sighed angrily mott walked to the evidence board and wrote the name triplex next to lara gibson and willem boethe but gillette stood unsteadily thanks to his wounded shin and walked to the board he erased the name whatre you doing bishop asked gillette took a marker and wrote peter grodsky he said thats his real name he was a programmer who lived in sunnyvale he looked at the team i just think we should remember that he was more than a screen name bishop called huerto ramirez and tim morgan and told them to find grodskys address and run the crime scene gillette noticed a pink phone message slip he said to bishop i took a message for you just before you got back from the hospital your wife called he read the note something about the test results coming back and its good news uhm im not sure i got this right i thought she said shes got a serious infection im not sure why thats good news but the look of immense joy in bishops face a rare beaming smile told him that yes the message was right he was happy for the detective but felt his own personal disappointment that elana hadnt called him he wondered where she was right now wondered if ed was with her gillettes palms sweated with angry jealousy agent backle walked into the office from the parking lot his fastidiously tidy hair was mussed and he walked stiffly hed had his own medical treatment but his had been administered by professionals with the emergency medical services whose ambulance was outside in the parking lot hed suffered a slight concussion when hed been attacked in the coffee room he now wore a large white bandage on the side of his head how you feeling gillette asked blithely the agent didnt respond he noticed his gun sitting on a desk near gillette and snatched up the weapon he checked it with exaggerated care then slipped it into his belt holster what the hell happened he asked bishop said phate broke in blindsided you and got your weapon and you took it away from him the agent asked gillette skeptically yep you knew i was in the coffee room backle snapped the perp didnt but i guess he did know didnt he gillette responded otherwise how could he blindside you and get your weapon it seems to me the agent said slowly that you somehow got this idea he was going to come here you wanted a weapon and helped yourself to mine well thats not what happened gillette said then glanced at bishop who cocked an eyebrow in a way that suggested that the agent might not be completely wrong the detective though said nothing if i find out that it was you bishop said hey hey hey i think you ought to be a little more grateful sir theres a good argument to be made that wyatt here saved your life the agent tried to stare down the cop but gave up walked to a chair and sat down in it gingerly im still watching you gillette bishop took a phone call he hung up then reported that was huerto again he said they got a report from harvard there were no records of anybody named shawn who was a student or working at the school around the same time holloway was he checked the other places holloway worked too western electric apple and the rest of them negative on an employee named shawn he glanced at shelton he also said its getting hot and heavy with the marinkill case the perps were spotted in our backyard santa clara just off the bob shelton gave an uncharacteristic laugh doesnt matter whether you wanted a piece of that case or not frank looks like its dogging you bishop shook his head maybe but i sure dont want it around here not for the time being its going to pull off resources and we need all the help we can get he looked at patricia nolan whatd you find at the hospital she explained how she and miller had looked through the medical centers network and while they found signs that phate had cracked into the system she couldnt find any indication of where hed been hacking in from the sysadmin printed these out she handed gillette a large stack of printouts the log in and log out activity reports for the past week i thought you might be able to find something gillette began poring over the hundred or so pages then bishop looked around the dinosaur pen and frowned say where is miller nolan said he left the hospital computer center before me he said he was coming straight back here without looking up from the printouts gillette said i havent seen him he mightve gone over to the computer center at stanford mott said he books supercomputer time there a lot maybe he was going to check out a lead he tried the cops cell phone but there was no answer and he left a message on millers voice mail gillette was scanning through the printouts when he came to a particular entry and his heart thudded with alarm he read it again to make sure no hed spoken softly but everyone on the team stopped talking and looked toward him the hacker looked up once he seized root at stanfordpackard phate logged into other systems that were connected with the hospitals thats how he shut the phone system off but he also jumped from the hospital to an outside computer it recognized stanfordpackard as a trusted system so he waltzed right though the firewalls and seized root there too whats the other system bishop asked northern california university in sunnyvale gillette looked up he got files on security procedures and personnel information on every security guard who works for the school the hacker sighed he also downloaded the files of twentyeight hundred students so hes got his next pool of victims all lined up bishop said and dropped heavily into a shabby office chair someone was following him who was it phate looked in his rearview mirror at the cars behind him on the freeway as he fled from ccu headquarters he was badly shaken that valleyman had outmaneuvered him again and was desperate to get home he was already thinking of his next attack on northern california university it was less challenging than some targets he mightve picked but the security at the dorms was high and the school had a computer system that the chancellor of the school had once declared in an interview was hackerproof one of the more interesting features of this system was that it controlled the stateoftheart fire alarm and sprinkler systems throughout the twentyfive dorms that provided the bulk of student housing an easy hack not as challenging as either the lara gibson or st francis one but at the moment phate needed a victory he was losing this level of the game and that was shaking his confidence and fueling his paranoia another glance in the rearview mirror yes someone was there two men in the front seat staring at him eyes back to the road then he looked again but the car hed seen or thought hed seen was just a shadow or reflection no wait it was back but now it was being driven by a woman alone when he looked a third time there was no driver at all my god it was a creature of some sort a ghost a demon yes no you were right valleyman when computers are the only life that sustains you when theyre the only totems that ward off the deadly curse of boredom then sooner or later the borderline between the two dimensions vanishes and characters from the blue nowhere begin to appear in the real world sometimes those characters are your friends and sometimes not sometimes you see them driving behind you sometimes you see their shadows in alleyways youre approaching you see them hiding in your garage your bedroom your closet you see them in a strangers gaze you see them in the reflection of your monitor as you sit in front of your machine at the witching hour sometimes theyre just your imagination another glance in the rearview mirror but sometimes of course they really are there bishop pushed end on his cell phone the dorms on the northern california u campus have typical university security which means its pretty easy to get through i thought he wanted challenges mott said gillette said id guess hes going for an easy kill this time hes probably pissed off weve gotten so close to him the last few times and wants blood nolan added this might also be another diversion gillette agreed that that was a possibility bishop said i told the chancellor they should cancel classes and send everybody home but he wasnt inclined to the students start finals in two weeks so well have to blanket the campus with troopers and county police but thatll just mean more strangers on campus and more of a chance for phate to social engineer his way into a dorm what do we do mott asked bishop said some more oldfashioned police work he picked up phates cd player the detective opened it up inside was a recording of a play a performance of othello he turned the machine over and jotted down the serial number maybe phate bought it in the area ill call the company and see where this unit was shipped to bishop started making phone calls to the akisha electronic products companys various sales and distribution centers around the country he was transferred and put on hold for an interminable period of time and was having trouble getting through to someone who could or was willing to help as the detective argued with someone on the other end of the line wyatt gillette spun around in a swivel chair to a nearby computer terminal and began keyboarding a moment later he stood and pulled a piece of paper from the printer as bishops irritated voice was saying into the phone we cant wait two days for that information gillette handed the sheet to the detective akisha electronic products shipped first quarter model hb heavy bass portable compact disc player unit serial shipping numbers date recipient hb mountain view music electronics hb rio verde mountain view ca the phone sagged in the detectives hand and he said into the receiver never mind and hung up howd you get this bishop asked gillette then held up a hand on second thought id rather not know he chuckled oldfashioned police work like i said bishop picked up the phone and called huerto ramirez again he told him to send somebody else to run the scene at triplexs house and then directed him and tim morgan to mountain view music with a picture of phate to see if they could find out if he lived in the area also tell the clerk that our boy seems to like plays hes got a recording of othello that might help jog their memories a trooper from the state police headquarters in san jose dropped off an envelope for bishop he opened it and summarized for the team fbi report on the details from the picture of lara gibson that phate posted they said its a truheat gas furnace model gst the model was introduced three years ago and its popular in new developments because of its btu capacity that model is usually used in detached houses thatre two or three stories high not town houses or ranches the techs also computer enhanced the information stamped on the sheetrock in the basement and found a manufacturing date january of last year new house in a recently developed tract mott said and wrote these details on the evidence board two to three stories high bishop gave a faint laugh and raised an eyebrow in admiration our federal tax dollars are being well spent boys and girls those folks in washington know what theyre doing listen to this the agents found significant irregularities in the grouting and placement of tiles on the floor and think that suggests the house was sold with an unfinished basement and the homeowner himself laid the tile mott added on the board sold with unfinished basement were not through yet the detective continued they also enhanced a portion of a newspaper that was in the trash bin and found out that it was a giveaway shopper the silicon valley marketeer its home delivered and only goes to houses in palo alto cupertino mountain view los altos los altos hills sunnyvale and santa clara gillette asked can we find out about new developments in those towns bishop nodded just what i was about to do he looked at bob shelton you still have that buddy of yours at santa clara county p and z sure do shelton called the planning and zoning commission he asked about permits for tract developments of two and threestory singlefamily homes with unfinished basements built after january of last year in the towns on their list after five minutes on hold shelton cocked the phone under his chin grabbed a pen and began writing he kept at it for some time the list of developments was discouragingly long there must have been forty of them throughout those seven towns he hung up and muttered he said they cant build em fast enough to supply the demand dotcorn you know bishop took the list of developments and walked to the map of silicon valley circled those locations shelton had written down as he was doing this his phone rang and he answered he listened and nodded then hung up that was huerto and tim a clerk at the music store recognized phate and said hes been in there a halfdozen times in the past few months always buys plays never music death of a salesman was the last one but the guy has no idea where he lives he circled the location of the music store he tapped this then the circle around ollies costume shop on el camino real where phate had bought the theatrical glue and other disguises these stores were about three quarters of a mile apart the locations suggested that phate was in the central and western part of silicon valley still there were twentytwo new housing developments spread out over what must have been seven or eight square miles way too big for a doortodoor search theystared at the map and the evidence board for a discouraging ten minutes or so offering largely useless suggestions about narrowing down the search officers called from the apartment of peter grodsky in sunnyvale the young man had died from a stab wound to the heart like the other victims in this reallife game of access the cops were running the scene but had not found any helpful leads hell said bob shelton as he kicked a chair aside expressing the frustration they all felt there was silence for a long moment as the team stared at the whiteboard silence that was interrupted unexpectedly by a timid voice behind them excuse me a chubby teenage boy wearing thick glasses stood in the doorway accompanied by a man in his twenties it was jamie turner gillette recalled the student from st francis and his brother mark hello young man frank bishop said smiling at the boy how you doing okay i guess he looked up at his brother who nodded encouragement jamie walked up to gillette i did what you wanted he said swallowing uneasily gillette couldnt remember what the boy was talking about but he nodded and said go on jamie continued well i was looking at the machines at school down in the computer room like you asked and i found something that might help you catch him the man who killed mr boethe i mean chapter thirtysix i keep this notebook when im online jamie turner told wyatt gillette usually disorganized and slovenly in many ways all serious hackers kept pens and battered steno pads or big chief tablets any type of deadtree stuff beside their machines every minute they were online in these they recorded in precise detail the urls the universal resource locators addresses of web sites theyd found names of software the handles of fellow hackers they wanted to track down and other resources that would help them hack this is a necessity because most of the information floating about in the blue nowhere is so complicated that no one can remember the details correctly and yet they have to be correct a single typographic error would mean a failure in running a truly moby hack or connecting to the most awesome web site or bulletin board ever created it was early afternoon and everyone on the ccu team was feeling relentless desperation that phate might be making his move against his next victim at northern california at any moment still gillette let the boy talk at his own pace jamie continued i was looking through what id written before mr boethe before what happened to him you know whatd you find gillette encouraged frank bishop sat down next to the boy and nodded smiling go on okay see the machine i was using in the library the one you guys took was fine until about two or three weeks ago and then something really weird started happening id get these fatal conflict errors and my machined like freeze fatal errors gillette asked surprised he glanced at nolan who was shaking her head she pulled a mass of hair away from her eye and twined it absently around her fingers bishop looked from one to the other whats that mean nolan explained usually you get errors like that when your machine tries to do a couple of different tasks at once and cant handle it like running a spreadsheet at the same time youre online reading email gillette nodded in confirmation but one of the reasons companies like microsoft and apple developed their operating systems is to let you run multiple programs at the same time you hardly ever see fatal error crashes anymore i know the boy said thats why i thought it was so weird then i tried running the same programs on other machines at school and i couldnt you know duplicate the errors tony mott said well well well trapdoor has a bug gillette nodded at the boy thiss great jamie i think its the break weve been looking for why bishop asked i dont get it we needed the serial and phone numbers of phates mobile america phone in order to trace him i remember if were lucky thiss how were going to get them gillette said to the boy you know the times and dates when some of the conflicts shut you down the boy looked through his notebook he showed a page to gillette the crashes were carefully noted good gillette nodded and said to tony mott call garvy hobbes get him on the speakerphone mott did this and a moment later the security chief from mobile america was connected howdy garvy hobbes said you got a lead to our bad boy gillette looked at bishop who deferred to the hacker with a wave of his hand and said thiss newfashioned police work its all yours the hacker said try this on garvy if i give you four specific times and dates that one of your cell phones went down for about sixty seconds then went back on calling the same number could you identify that phone hmmm thats a new one but ill give it a shot gimme the times and dates gillette did and hobbes said stay on the line ill be back the hacker explained to the team what he was doing when jamies computer froze the boy would have to reboot the machine again to get back online thatd take about a minute this meant that phates cell phone call was interrupted for the same period of time while the killer also restarted his machine and reconnected by crosschecking the exact times jamies computer froze and then went back online against the times a particular mobile america cell phone disconnected and reconnected theyd know that cell phone was phates five minutes later the security cowboy came back on the line thiss fun hobbes said cheerfully i got it then he added with some troubled reverence in his voice but whats weird is the numbers of his phone are unassigned gillette explained what garvys saying is that phate hacked into a secure nonpublic switch and stole the numbers nobodys ever cracked our main board yet this boy is something else ill tell you but we know that muttered frank bishop is he still using the phone shelton asked hasnt since yesterday the typical profile for a call jacker is if they dont use a stolen unit for twentyfour hours that means theyve switched numbers so we cant trace him when he goes online again bishop asked discouraged right hobbes confirmed but gillette shrugged and said oh i figured hed changed the numbers once he found out we were on to him but we can still narrow down where he was calling from in the past couple of weeks right garvy you betcha hobbes offered we have records of what cells all of our calls originate from most of the calls on that phone came from our cell thats los altos and i narrowed it down further from the mitso data the what gillette said the mobile telephone switching office theyve got sector capability that means they can tell what part of the cell hes located in down to about one square kilometer hobbes laughed and asked warily mr gillette how is it you know as much about our system as we do i read a lot gillette said wryly then he asked give me the coordinates of the location can you give us the information by street he walked to the map sure thing hobbes rattled off four intersections and gillette connected the dots it was a trapezoid covering a large portion of los altos hes in there someplace the hacker tapped the map within this perimeter were six new housing developments whose addresses santa clara planning and zoning had given them it was better than twentytwo but was still discouraging six asked a dismayed linda sanchez must be three thousand people living there can we narrow it down any more i think so bishop said because we know where he shops on the map bishop tapped the development that fell halfway between ollies costume store and mountain view music and electronics its name was stonecrest a flurry of activity ensued bishop told garvy to meet them in los altos near the development then he called captain bernstein and briefed him they decided to use plainclothes officers to canvass doortodoor throughout the development with holloways picture bishop came up with the idea of buying small plastic buckets and handing them out to the troopers whod pretend to be soliciting money for some childrens cause in case holloway saw them on the street he then alerted the tactical troopers the ccu team got ready to roll bishop and shelton checked their pistols gillette his laptop tony mott of course did both patricia nolan would remain here in case the team needed to access the ccu computer as they were leaving the phone rang and bishop took the call he was quiet for a moment then glanced at gillette and with raised eyebrows handed the receiver to him frowning the hacker lifted the receiver to his ear hello silence for a moment then elana papandolos said its me well hi gillette watched bishop shepherd everyone out the door i didnt think youd call i didnt either she said why did you because i thought i owed it to you owed what to me to tell you that im still going to new york tomorrow with ed yes the words struck him harder than phates knuckles had not long before hed really hoped that shed delay her departure dont another cumbersome silence followed wyatt i love you i dont want you to go well we are going gillette said just do me one favor let me see you before you go why what good will it do please just for ten minutes you cant change my mind he thought oh yes i can she said i have to go goodbye wyatt i wish you luck whatever you do in life no ellie hung up without saying anything else gillette stared at the silent phone wyatt bishop called he closed his eyes wyatt the detective repeated we have to go the hacker looked up and dropped the receiver in the cradle numb he followed the cop down the corridor the detective muttered something to him gillette looked at him vacantly then he asked what bishop had just said i said its like what you and patricia were saying before about this being one of those mud games what about it i think we just hit the expert level el monte road connects el camino real to the parallel backbone of silicon valley the freeway a few miles away as you make the trip south the view from el monte changes from retail stores to the classic california ranch homes of the s and s and finally to newer residential developments intended to harvest some of the abundant dotcorn money being strewn throughout the neighborhood not far from one of these developments stonecrest were parked sixteen police cars and two california state police tactical services vans they were in the parking lot of the first baptist church of los altos hidden from el monte road by a high stockade fence which is why bishop had chosen the lot beside this house of god as a staging area wyatt gillette was in the passenger seat of the crown victoria beside bishop shelton sat silently in the back staring at a palm tree waving in the wet breeze in the car beside them were linda sanchez and tony mott bishop seemed to have given up trying to rein in the aspiring eliot ness and mott now hurried from the car to join a cluster of tactical and uniformed police who were suiting up in body armor the head of the tactical team alonso johnson was back again he stood by himself head down nodding as he listened to his radio department of defense agent arthur backle had trailed bishops car here and he was now standing beside it under an umbrella leaning against the car picking at the bandage on his head nearby stonecrest was being scoured by a number of troopers the socialengineered fundraisers brandishing yellow buckets and flashing pictures of jon holloway the moments passed however and no one reported any success doubts crept in maybe phate was in a different development maybe mobile america s analysis of the phone numbers was wrong maybe the numbers had been his but after the runin with gillette hed fled the state then bishops cell phone buzzed and he answered he nodded and smiled then said to shelton and gillette positive id a neighbor recognized him hes at alta vista drive yes shelton said making a joyous fist with his hand he climbed out of the car ill tell alonso the burly cop disappeared into the crowd of troopers bishop called garvy hobbes and gave him the address in his jeep the security man had a cellscope hooked up a combination computer and radio direction finder he would drive past phates house scanning for mobile america cell phone frequencies and see if the man was transmitting a moment later he called bishop back and reported hes inside on a mobile phone its a data transmission not voice hes online gillette said bishop and gillette climbed out of the car found shelton and alonso johnson and gave them this news johnson sent a surveillance van disguised as a courier truck to the street in front of phates house the officer reported that the blinds were down and the garage door was open a beatup ford was in the driveway there were no interior lights visible from outside a second surveillance team perched near a thick jacaranda gave a second similar report both teams added that all exits and windows were covered even if phate happened to see the police he wouldnt be able to escape johnson then opened a detailed map encased in plastic of the streets in stonecrest he circled phates house with a grease pencil and then examined a catalogue of model homes in the development he looked up and said the house hes in is a troubadour model he flipped to the floor plan of this model in the catalogue and showed it to his second in command a young crewcut trooper with a humorless military attitude wyatt gillette glanced at the catalogue and saw an advertising slogan printed beneath the diagram troubadour the dream house that you and your family will enjoy for years to come johnsons assistant summarized okay sir weve got front and back doors at ground level another door opens onto a deck in back no stairs but its only ten feet high he could jump it no side entrance the garage has two doors one leading inside to the kitchen the other leading to the backyard id say we go with a threeteam dynamic entry linda sanchez said separate him from his computer immediately dont let him type anything he could destroy the contents of the disk in seconds well need to look at it and see if hes targeted any other vies roger that the assistant said johnson said team able goes through the front baker in the back charlie through the garage hold back two from charlie team and post them near the deck in case he goes for a dive he looked up and tugged the gold earring in his left lobe all right lets go catch ourselves a beast gillette shelton bishop and sanchez jogged back to one of the crown victorias and drove into the development itself parking just out of sight of phates house next to the tactical vans their shadow agent backle followed they all watched the troops deploy quickly crouching low and moving under cover behind bushes bishop turned to gillette and surprised the hacker by reaching forward formally and shaking his hand whatever happens wyatt we couldntve gotten this far without you not many people wouldve taken the risks you have and worked as hard as this yeah linda sanchez said hes a keeper boss she turned her wide brown eyes on gillette hey you want a job when you get out maybe you oughta apply to ccu gillette tried to think of something to say by way of acknowledging this he was embarrassed though and unable to think of anything he nodded for once bob shelton seemed on the verge of echoing their sentiments but then he climbed out of the car and disappeared into a cluster of plainclothes troopers he seemed to know alonso johnson walked up to them bishop rolled down the window surveillance still cant see inside and the subjects got his air conditioner on full tilt so the infrared scanners arent picking up a thing is he still on his computer bishop called garvy hobbes and asked the question yep was the cowboys response the cellscope is still picking up his transmission good johnson said we want him nice and distracted when we come acalling he then spoke into his microphone clear the street officers turned back several cars driving along alta vista they flagged down one of phates neighbors a whitehaired woman pulling out of her garage and directed her ford explorer down the street away from the killers house three young boys were ignoring the rain and happily doing acrobatics on noisy skateboards two troopers disguised in shorts and izod shirts casually walked up to them and ushered them out of sight the pleasant suburban street was clear looks good johnson said then ran in a crouch toward the house it all comes down to this bishop muttered linda sanchez overheard him and said aint that the truth boss then she gave a thumbsup to tony mott who was kneeling along with a halfdozen tactical troopers behind a hedge bordering phates property he nodded at her and turned back to phates house she said in a soft voice that boy better not hurt himself bob shelton returned and dropped heavily into the seat of the crown victoria gillette didnt hear any commands given but all at once the swat troopers emerged from their hiding places and raced toward the house suddenly there were three loud bangs gillette jumped bishop explained special shotgun shells theyre shooting the locks out of the doors gillette his palms sweating found himself holding his breath waiting for gunshots explosions screaming sirens bishop remained motionless keen eyes on the house if he was tense he didnt show it come on come on linda sanchez muttered whats happening long long moments of silence except for the hollow tapping of the rain on the cars roof when the cars radio cackled to life the sound was so abrupt that everyone jumped alpha team leader to bishop you there bishop grabbed the microphone go ahead alonso frank the voice reported hes not here what the detective asked in dismay were scouring the place now but it looks like hes gone just like at the motel fucking hell shelton snapped johnson continued im in the dining room its his office theres a can of mountain dew thats still cold and the bodyheat detector shows he was in the chair in front of the computer as of five to ten minutes ago in a desperate voice bishop said hes in there al hes got to be hes got a hideyhole somewhere check in the closets check under the bed frank the infrareds arent picking up anything except his ghost in the chair but he cantve gotten outside sanchez said well keep at it bishops body sagged against the door as despair eased into his hawklike face ten minutes later the tactical commander came back on the radio the whole house is secure frank johnson said hes not here if you want to run the scene you can chapter thirtyseven inside the house was immaculate completely different from what gillette had expected most hacker lairs were filthy impacted with computer parts wires books tech manuals tools floppy disks encrusted food containers dirty glasses books and just plain junk the living room of phates house looked as if martha stewart had just finished decorating the ccu team looked around them gillette wondered at first if they had the wrong house but then he noticed the framed pictures and saw holloways face in many of them look linda sanchez said pointing at one framed snapshot that woman must be shawn then she glanced at another and theyve got kids shelton said we can send the pictures to the feds and but bishop shook his head whats the matter alonso johnson asked theyre fake arent they bishop glanced at gillette with a raised eyebrow the hacker picked up one frame and slipped a picture out they werent on photo lab glossy paper but had been printed out on a color computer printer he downloaded em from the net or scanned them from a magazine and added his face on the mantel next to a picture of the happy couple sitting in beach chairs beside a pool was an oldfashioned grandmother clock showing the hour as the loud ticking was a reminder that phates next victim or victims at the university might die at any minute gillette looked over the room which smacked of affluent suburban living troubadour the dream house that you and your family will enjoy for years to come huerto ramirez and tim morgan had canvassed the neighbors but nobody offered anything that suggested any leads to other locations he might have a connection to ramirez said according to the neighbor across the street he was going by the name warren gregg and telling people that his familyd be moving out here to join him after his kids were out of school bishop said to alonso we know his next targets probably a student at northern california university but we dont know who exactly make sure your people look for anything that might give us a clue about who hes going to hit johnson shook his head and said but now we busted his hideyhole dont you think hell go to ground and forget about other victims for the time being bishop looked at gillette and said thats not my take on him the hacker agreed phate wants a win here one way or another hes going to kill somebody today ill give them the word the swat cop said and went off to do so the team examined the other rooms but found them virtually empty hidden from the outside by drawn blinds the bathroom contained minimal products genericbrand razors and shaving cream shampoo and soap they also found a large box of pumice stones bishop picked one up frowning with curiosity his fingers gillette reminded he uses the stones to sand down the callus so he can key better they walked into the dining room where phates laptop was set up gillette glanced at the screen shook his head in disgust look bishop and shelton read the words instant message from shawn code issued for alta vista drive thats the tactical assault code a ten eightyseven if he hadnt gotten that message we wouldve collared him bishop said we were that close fucking shawn shelton snapped a trooper called from the basement ive got the escape route its down here gillette went downstairs with the others but on the last step he paused recognizing the scene from the picture of lara gibson the clumsy tiling job the unpainted sheetrock and the swirls of blood on the floor the sight was wrenching he joined alonso johnson frank bishop and the other troopers who were examining a small door in the side wall it opened into a threefootwide pipe like a large storm drain one of the troopers shone his flashlight into the pipe it leads to the house next door gillette and bishop stared at each other the detective said no the woman with the white hair in the explorer the one who pulled out of the garage it was him johnson grabbed his radio and ordered troopers into the house he then sent out an emergency vehicle locator for the fourbyfour a moment later a trooper called in the house next door is completely empty no furniture nothing he owned both houses goddamn social engineering bishop snapped uttering the firstcuss word gillette had heard leave the detectives mouth in five minutes the report came back that the explorer had been found in a shopping center parking lot not a quarter of a mile away a white wig and dress were in the backseat nobody canvassed at the shopping center had seen anyone swap the ford for another vehicle the state police crime scene unit went through both houses thoroughly but found very little that was helpful it turned out that phate as warren gregg had actually bought both of these houses using cash they called the realtor whod sold them to him she hadnt thought it strange that hed paid cash for two houses in the valley of the hearts delight wealthy young computer executives often bought one house to live in and one for investment she added though that there appeared to be one odd thing about this particular transaction when shed looked up the credit reports and application a few moments ago at the polices request all the records of sale were gone isnt that curious they were accidentally erased yeah curious bishop said wryly yeah accidentally gillette added bishop then said to the hacker lets get his machine back to ccu if were lucky there might be some reference to his victim at the college lets move on this fast johnson and bishop released the scene then linda sanchez filled out the chain of custody cards and she bundled up phates computer and disks the team returned to their cars and sped back to ccu headquarters gillette broke the news to patricia nolan that the arrest had been unsuccessful shawn tipped him off again she asked angrily sanchez handed phates laptap to gillette and nolan and then took a phone call how did he know we were assaulting the house tony mott asked i dont get it i only want to know one thing shelton muttered who the hell is shawn though he undoubtedly didnt expect an answer just then one was forthcoming i know who linda sanchez said in a horrified choked voice she stared at the team then hung up the woman flicked her redpolished nails together then said that was the systems administrator in san jose ten minutes ago he found someone cracking into islenet and using it as a trusted system to get into the us state department database the user was shawn he was instructing the state department system to issue two predated passports in fake names the sysadmin recognized the pictures shawn was scanning into the system one was holloways she took a deep breath the other was stephens stephen who tony mott asked not understanding stephen miller sanchez said starting to cry thats who shawn is bishop mott and sanchez were in millers cubicle searching his desk i dont believe it mott said defiantly its phate again hes fucking with our minds but then where is miller bishop asked patricia nolan said shed been at ccu the entire time the team had been at phates house and miller hadnt called shed even tried to track him down at various local college computer departments but he hadnt been at any of them mott booted up millers computer on the screen came the prompt to enter a password mott tried the hard way a few guesses at the most obvious ones birthday middle name and so on but access was denied gillette stepped into the cubicle and loaded his crackit program in a few minutes the password was cracked and gillette was inside millers machine he soon found dozens of messages sent to phate under millers screen name shawn logged onto the internet through the monterey online company the messages themselves were encrypted but the headers left no doubt about millers true identity patricia nolan said but shawns brilliant stephen was an amateur next to him social engineering bishop said gillette agreed he had to look stupid so we wouldnt suspect him meanwhile he was feeding information to phate mott snapped hes the reason andy andersons dead he set him up shelton muttered and every single time we got close to phate millerd warn him did the sysadmin get a sense of where miller was hacking in from asked bishop nope boss sanchez said he was using a bulletproof anonymizer bishop asked mott those schools he books computer time at would northern california be one of them mott replied i dont know probably so hes been helping phate set up the next victims bishops phone rang he listened and nodded when he hung up he said that was huerto bishop had sent ramirez and morgan over to millers house as soon as linda sanchez had gotten the call from the islenet sysadmin millers cars gone his den at homes empty except for a bunch of cables and spare computer parts hes taken all his machines and disks with him he asked mott and sanchez does he have any summer houses family nearby no his whole life was machines mott said working here in the office and working at home bishop said to shelton get millers picture out on the wire and send some troopers over to northern california with copies of it he glanced at phates computer and said to gillette the data on there isnt encrypted anymore is it no gillette said he nodded at the screen scrolling over which was phates screen saver the motto of the knights of access access is god ill see what i can find he sat down in front of the laptop he still could have plenty of booby traps inside linda sanchez warned ill go nice and slow ill just shut the screen saver off and well take it from there i know the logical places where hed plant trip wires gillette sat down in front of the computer he reached for the most innocuous key on a computer keyboard the shift key to shut off the screen saver since the shift key alone doesnt issue commands or affect the programs or data stored on a machine hackers never hook a trip wire to that key but of course phate wasnt just any hacker the instant gillette tapped the key the screen went blank then these words appeared begin batch encryption encrypting department of defense standard no gillette cried and hit the off switch but phate had overridden the power controls and there was no response he flipped the laptop over to remove the battery but the release button had been removed within three minutes the entire contents of the hard drive were encrypted damn damn gillette slapped the tabletop in disgust its all useless he said department of defense agent backle stood and walked slowly to the machine he looked from gillette to the screen which was now a dense block of gibberish then the agent glanced again at the victims pictures taped to the whiteboard he asked gillette you think theres something on there thatll save some lives nodding at the laptop probably i meant what i said before if you can crack the encryption ill forget i saw you do it all ill ask is that you give us any disks youve got with the cracking program on it gillette hesitated finally he asked you mean that backle gave a grim laugh and touched his head that prick gave me one hell of a headache i want to add assaulting a federal agent to his list of charges gillette glanced at bishop who nodded his own acknowledgment that hed back gillette up the hacker sat down ata workstation and went online he returned to his account in los alamos where hed cached his hacker tools and downloaded a file named pacman nolan laughed pacman gillette shrugged id been up for twentytwo hours when i finished it i couldnt think of a better name he copied it onto a floppy disk which he inserted into phates laptop the screen came up encryptiondecryption enter username gillette typed lukeskywalker enter password the letters numbers and symbols gillette typed turned into a string of eighteen asterisks mott said thats one hell of a passcode this appeared on the screen select encryption standard privacy online inc defense encryption standard department of defense standard nato international computer systems inc patricia nolan echoed mott thats one hell of a hack you wrote script that can crack all of those encryption standards usually itll decrypt about ninety percent of a file gillette said hitting key then he began feeding the encrypted files through his program howd you do it mott asked fascinated gillette couldnt keep the enthusiasm out of his voice pride too as he told them basically i input enough samples of each standard so that the program begins to recognize patterns that the algorithm used in encrypting them then it makes logical guesses about agent backle suddenly reached past bishop grabbed gillette by the collar and pulled him roughly to the ground wyatt edward gillette youre under arrest for violation of the computer fraud and abuse act theft of classified government information and treason bishop you cant do that tony mott started toward him you son of a bitch backle pulled his jacket aside revealing the butt of his pistol careful there id think long and hard about what youre doing officer mott backed off and backle almost leisurely handcuffed his prisoner bishop said heatedly come on backle you heard us phates targeted somebody at the college he could be on campus right now patricia nolan said you told him it was okay but the unflappable backle ignored her pulled gillette to his feet and shoved him into a chair the agent then pulled out a radio clicked it on and said backle to unit i have the suspect in custody you can pick him up roger came the clattering response you set him up nolan shouted furious you assholesve been waiting all along for this im calling my captain bishop snapped pulling out his own phone and walking briskly to the front door call whoever you want hes going back to prison shelton said heatedly weve got a killer whos after another victim right now this could be our only chance to stop him backle responded nodding toward gillette and the code he broke could mean a hundred other people might die sanchez said you gave us your word doesnt that count for anything no catching people like him counts for everything gillette said desperately just give me one hour but backle merely slipped that snide smile on his face and began to read gillette his rights it was then that they heard gunshots from outside and the huge crash of falling glass as bullets shattered the ccus outside door chapter thirtyeight mott and backle drew their weapons and looked toward the doorway sanchez dropped to her knees digging in her purse for her weapon nolan crouched under a desk frank bishop on the floor crawled back from the outside door down the short corridor that led to the dinosaur pen sanchez called you hit boss im okay the detective took cover against the wall and stood unsteadily he drew his pistol and called hes outside phate i was standing in the lobby he took a couple of shots at me hes still there backle ran past him calling on his radio to alert his partners about the perp he crouched by the door glancing at the bullet holes in the wall and the shattered glass tony mott joined the dod agent where is he backle called taking a fast look outside and ducking back to cover behind that white van the detective shouted over to the left he mustve been coming back to kill gillette you two go right keep him pinned down im going to flank him from the back keep low hes a good shot he missed me by inches the agent and the young cop looked at each other and then nodded together they burst through the front door bishop watched them go then stood up and bolstered his gun he tucked his shirt in pulled out keys and undid gillettes handcuffs he slipped them into his pocket whatre you doing boss sanchez asked picking herself up off the floor patricia nolan laughed figuring out what had just happened its a jailbreak right yep but the shots sanchez asked that was me you gillette asked astonished i stepped outside and fired a couple of rounds through the front door he grinned this social engineering stuff i think im starting to get the hang of it the detective then nodded at phates computer and said to gillette well dont just stand there get his machine and lets get out of here gillette rubbed his wrists are you sure you want to do this bishop answered what im sure about is that phate and miller could be on the northern california campus right now and i am not going to let anyone else die so lets move the hacker scooped up the machine and started after the detective wait patricia nolan called im parked in back we can take my car bishop hesitated she added well go to my hotel i can help you with his machine the detective nodded he started to say something to linda sanchez but she waved him quiet with a pudgy hand all i know is i turned around and saw wyatt gone and you running after him for all i know hes on his way up to napa with you hot on his trail good luck finding him boss have a glass of wine for me good luck but it seemed that bishops heroics had been futile in patricia nolans hotel room by far the nicest suite wyatt gillette had ever seen the hacker had quickly decrypted the data on phates computer it turned out however that this was a different machine from the one gillette had broken into earlier it wasnt exactly a hot machine but it contained only the operating system trapdoor and some files of downloaded newspaper clippings shawn had sent to phate most of them were about seattle which would have been the location of phates next game but now that he knew they had this machine of course hed go elsewhere there were no references to northern california university or any potential victims bishop dropped into one of the plush armchairs and hands together stared at the floor discouraged not a thing can i try nolan asked she sat down next to gillette then scrolled through the directory he mightve erased some files did you try to recover anything with restore no i didnt gillette said i figured hed shred everything he might not have bothered she pointed out he was pretty confident that nobodyd get into his machine and if they did then the encryption bomb would stop them she ran the restore program and in a moment data that phate had erased over the past few weeks appeared on the screen she read through it nothing on the school nothing about any attacks all i can find are bits of receipts for some of the computer parts he sold most of the datare corrupted but heres one you can kind of make out mach eerrxshipped to san jose com produuuzaawe winchster ooulke san jog attn jseph mcgonagle bishop and gillette read the screen the hacker said but that doesnt do us any good thats a company that bought some of his parts we need phates address where they were shipped from gillette took over for nolan and scanned through the rest of the deleted files they were just digital garbage nothing but bishop shook his head wait a minute he pointed to the screen go back up gillette scrolled back to the semilegible text of the receipt bishop tapped the screen and said this company san jose computer products theyd have to have some record of who sold them the parts and where they were shipped from unless they knew they were stolen patricia nolan said then theyd deny knowing anything about phate gillette said ill bet when they find out phates been killing people theyll be a little more cooperative or less nolan said skeptically bishop added receiving stolen goods is a felony avoiding san quentins a pretty good reason to be cooperative the detective touched his sprayed hair as he leaned forward and picked up the phone he called the ccu office praying that one of the team not backle or one of the feds would pick up he was relieved when tony mott answered the detective said tony its frank can you talk how bad is it there they have any leads no i mean leads to us okay good listen do me a favor run san jose computer products winchester in san jose no ill hold on a moment later bishop cocked his head he nodded slowly okay got it thanks we think phates been selling computer parts to them were going to have a talk with somebody there ill let you know if we find anything listen call the chancellor and the head of security at northern california u and tell them the killer might be on his way to the school now and get more troopers over there he hung up and said to nolan and gillette the companys clean its been around for fifteen years never any trouble with the irs epa or state taxation department paid up on all its business licenses if theyve been buying anything from phate they probably dont know its hot lets go over there and have a talk with this mcgonagle or somebody gillette joined the detective nolan though said you go on ill keep looking through his machine for any other leads pausing at the door wyatt gillette glanced back and saw her sit down at the keyboard she gave him a faint smile of encouragement but it seemed to him that it was slightly wistful and that there might be another meaning in her expression perhaps the inevitable recognition that there was little hope of a relationship blossoming between them but then as had happened so often with the hacker himself her smile vanished and nolan turned back to the glowing monitor and began to key furiously instantly with a look of utter concentration on her face she slipped out of the real world and into the blue nowhere the game was no longer fun sweating furious desperate phate slouched at his desk and looked absently around him at all of his precious computer antiquities he knew that gillette and the police were close on his trail and it was no longer possible to keep playing his game here in lush santa clara county this was a particularly painful admission because he considered this week univac week a very special version of his game it was like the famous mud game the crusades silicon valley was the new holy land and hed wanted to win big on every level but the police and valleyman had proved to be a lot better than hed expected so no options he now had yet another identity and would leave immediately moving to a new city with shawn seattle had been his planned destination but there was a chance that gillette had been able to crack the standard encryption code and find the details about the seattle game and potential targets there maybe hed try chicago the silicon prairie or route north of boston he couldnt wait that long for a kill though he was consumed by the lust to keep playing so hed make a stop first and leave the gasoline bomb in a dorm at northern california university a farewell present one of the dorms was named after a silicon valley pioneer but because that made it the logical target hed decided that the students in the dorm across the street would die it was named yeats hall after the poet who undoubtedly wouldve had little time for machines and what they represented the dorm was also an old wooden structure making it quite vulnerable to fire especially now that the alarms and sprinkler system had been deactivated by the schools main computer there was however one more thing to do if hed been up against anybody else he wouldnt have bothered but his adversary at this level of the game was wyatt gillette and so phate needed to buy some time to give him a chance to plant the bomb and then escape east he was so angry and agitated that he wanted to grab a machine gun and murder a dozen people to keep the police occupied but that of course wasnt the weapon closest to his soul and so he now simply sat forward at his computer terminal and began quietly keyboarding a familiar incantation chapter thirtynine in the santa clara county department of public works command center located in a barbedwiresurrounded complex in southwest san jose was a large mainframe computer nicknamed alanis after the pop singer this machine handled thousands of tasks for the dpw scheduling maintenance and repair of streets regulating water allocation during dry spells overseeing sewers and waste disposal and treatment and coordinating the tens of thousands of stoplights throughout silicon valley not far from alanis was one of her main links to the outside world a sixfoothigh metal rack on which sat thirtytwo highspeed modems at the moment pm a number of phone calls were coming into these modems one call was a data message from a veteran public works repairman in mountain view hed worked for the dpw for years and had only recently agreed reluctantly to start following the department policy of logging in from the field via a laptop computer to pick up new assignments learn the location of trouble spots in the public works systems and report that his team had completed repairs the chubby fiftyfiveyearold who used to think computers were a waste of time was now addicted to machines and looked forward to logging on every chance he got the email he now sent to alanis was a brief one about a completed sewer repair the message that the computer had received however was slightly different embedded in the repairmans chunky huntandpeck prose was a bit of extra code a trapdoor demon now inside unsuspecting alanis the demon leapt from the email and burrowed deep into the machines operating system seven miles away sitting at his own computer phate seized root then scrolled quickly through alanis locating the commands he needed he jotted them down on a yellow pad and returned to the root prompt he consulted the sheet of paper then typed permitgsegment and hit enter like so many commands in technical computer operating systems this one was cryptic but would have a very concrete consequence phate then destroyed the manual override program and reset the root password to zzya which no human being could ever guess and which a supercomputer would take at best days to crack then he logged off by the time he rose to start packing his belongings for his escape from silicon valley he could already hear the faint sounds of his handiwork filling the afternoon sky the maroon volvo went through an intersection on stevens creek boulevard and began a howling skid straight toward bishops police car the driver stared in horror at the impending collision oh man look out gillette cried throwing up his arm instinctively for protection turning his head to the left and closing his eyes as the famous diagonal chrome stripe on the grille of the car sped directly toward him got it bishop called calmly maybe it was instinct or maybe it was his police tactical driving instruction but the detective chose not to brake he jammed the accelerator to the floor and skidded the crown victoria toward the oncoming car the maneuver worked the vehicles missed by inches and the volvo slammed into the front fender of the porsche behind the police car with a huge bang bishop controlled his skid and braked to a stop idiot ran the light bishop muttered pulling his radio off the dash to report the accident no he didnt gillette said looking back look both lightsre green a block ahead of them two more cars sat in the middle of the intersection sideways smoke pouring from their hoods the radio crackled jammed with reports of accidents and trafficlight malfunctions they listened for a moment the lightsre all green the detective said all over the county its phate right he did it gillette gave a sour laugh he cracked public works its a smokescreen so he and miller can get away bishop started forward again but because of the traffic theyd slowed to a few miles an hour the flashing light on the dash had no effect and bishop shut it off he shouted over the sound of the horns what can they do at public works to fix it he probably froze the system or put in an unbreakable passcode theyll have to reload everything from the backup tapes thatll take hours the hacker shook his head but the traffics going to keep him trapped too whats the point bishop said no his placell be right on the freeway probably next to an entrance ramp northern california university is too hell kill the next victim jump back on the freeway and head who knows where smooth sailing gillette nodded and added at least nobody at san jose computer products is going anywhere either a quarter mile from their destination traffic was at a complete standstill and bishop and gillette had to abandon the car they leapt out and began jogging prodded forward by a sense of desperate urgency phate wouldnt have created the traffic jam until just before he was ready for his assault on the school at best even if someone at san jose computer could find the shippers address they might not get to phates place until after the victim was dead and phate and miller were gone they came to the building that housed the company and paused leaning against a chainlink fence gasping for breath the air was filled with a cacophony of horns and the whump whump whump of a helicopter that hovered nearby a local news station recording the evidence of phates prowess and santa clara county s vulnerability for the rest of the country to witness the men started forward again hurrying toward an open doorway next to the companys loading dock they climbed the steps to the dock and walked inside a chubby grayhaired worker stacking cartons on a pallet glanced up excuse me sir police bishop said and showed his badge we need to ask you a few questions the man squinted through thickrimmed glasses as he examined bishops id yessir can i help you were looking for joe mcgonagle thats me he said is this about an accident or something whats with all the horns traffic lightsre out thats a mess near rush hour too bishop asked you own the company with my brotherinlaw what exactlys the problem officer last week you took delivery of some supercomputer parts we do that every week thats our business we have reason to believe that somebody mayve sold you some stolen parts stolen youre not under investigation sir but its important that we find the man who sold them to you would you mind if we looked through your receiving records i swear i didnt know anything was stolen jim hes my brother wouldnt do that either hes a good christian all we want is to find this man who sold them we need the address or phone number of the company the parts were shipped from all the shipping filesre in here he started down the hallway but if i needed a lawyer or anything fore i talk to you youd tell me yessir i would bishop said sincerely were only interested in tracking down this man whats his name mcgonagle asked he was probably going by warren gregg doesnt ring a bell he has a lot of aliases mcgonagle stepped into a small office and walked to a filing cabinet pulled it open you know the date when this shipment came in bishop consulted his notebook we think it was march twentyseventh lets see mcgonagle peered into the cabinet began rummaging through it wyatt gillette couldnt help but smile to himself it was pretty ironic that a computer supply company kept deadtree records in file cabinets he was about to whisper this to bishop when he happened to glance at mcgonagles left hand which rested on the handle of the file cabinet drawer as he dug inside with the other hand the fingers very muscular were blunt and tipped with thick yellow calluses a hackers manicure gillettes smile vanished and he stiffened bishop noticed and glanced at him the hacker pointed to his own fingers and then looked once again at mcgonagles hand bishop too saw mcgonagle looked up into bishops revealing eyes only his name wasnt mcgonagle of course beneath the dyed gray hair the fake wrinkles the glasses the body padding this was jon patrick holloway the fragments scrolled through gillettes mind like software script joe mcgonagle was just another of his identities this company was one of his fronts hed hacked into the states business records and created a fifteenyearold company and made himself and stephen miller coowners of it the receipt theyd found was for a computer part phate had bought not sold none of them moved then gillette ducked and phate sprang back pulling his gun from the filing cabinet drawer bishop had no time to draw his own gun he simply leapt forward and slammed into the killer who dropped his weapon bishop kicked it aside as phate grabbed the cops shooting arm and seized a hammer which rested on top of a wooden crate he swung the tool hard into bishops head it connected with a sickening thud the detective gasped and collapsed phate hit him again in the back of the head then dropped the hammer and made a grab for his pistol on the floor chapter forty gillette instinctively jumped forward seizing phate by the collar and arm before the man could snag the pistol the killer repeatedly swung his fist at gillettes face and neck but the two men were so close that the blows didnt do any damage together they tumbled through another door out of the office and into an open area another dinosaur pen just like ccu headquarters the fingertip pushups hed done for the past two years let gillette keep a fierce grip on phate but the killer was very strong too and gillette couldnt get any advantage like grappling wrestlers they stumbled over the raised floor gillette glanced around him looking for a weapon he was astonished at the collection of old computers and parts here the entire history of computing was represented we know everything jon gillette gasped we know stephen millers shawn we know about your plans the other targets theres no way youre getting out of here but phate didnt respond grunting he shoved gillette onto the floor groping for a nearby crowbar groaning with the effort gillette managed to pull phate away from the metal rod for five minutes the hackers traded sloppy blows growing more and more tired then phate broke free he managed to get to the crowbar and snatched it up he started toward gillette who looked desperately for a weapon he noticed an old wooden box on a table nearby and ripped off the lid then pulled out the contents phate froze gillette held what looked like an antique glass lightbulb in his hand it was an original audion tube the precursor to the vacuum tube and ultimately the silicon computer chip itself no phate cried holding up his hand he whispered be careful with it please gillette backed toward the office where frank bishop lay phate came forward slowly the crowbar held like a baseball bat he knew he should crush gillettes arm or head he could have done so easily and yet he couldnt bring himself to endanger the delicate glass artifact to him the machines themselvesre more important than people a human death is nothing a crashed hard drive well thats a tragedy be careful phate whispered please drop it gillette snapped gesturing at the crowbar the killer started to swing but at the last minute the thought of hurting the fragile glass bulb stopped him gillette paused judged distances behind him then tossed the audion tube at phate who cried out in horror and dropped the crowbar trying to catch the antique but the tube hit the floor and shattered with a hollow cry phate dropped to his knees gillette stepped quickly into the office where frank bishop lay breathing shallowly and very bloody and grabbed his pistol he stepped out and pointed it at phate who was looking over the remains of the tube the way a father would stare at the grave of a child gillette was shocked by the mans expression of mournful horror it was far more chilling than his fury a moment ago you shouldntve done that the killer muttered darkly wiping his wet eyes with his sleeve and slowly standing up he didnt even seem to notice that gillette was armed phate picked up the crowbar and started forward howling madly gillette cringed lifted the gun and started to pull the trigger no a womans voice cried startled gillette jumped at the sound he looked behind him to see patricia nolan hurrying into the dinosaur pen her laptop case over her shoulder and what looked like a black flashlight in her right hand phate too paused at her commanding entrance gillette started to ask how shed gotten here and why when she lifted the dark cylinder she held and touched his tattooed arm with the tip the rod it turned out wasnt a flashlight gillette heard a crackle of electricity saw a flash of yellowgray light as astonishing pain swept from his jaw to his chest gasping he dropped to his knees and the pistol fell to the floor thinking shit wrong again stephen miller wasnt shawn at all he groped for the pistol but nolan touched the stun wand to his neck and pushed the trigger once more chapter fortyone unable to move more than his head and fingers wyatt gillette returned to painful consciousness he had no idea how long hed been out he could see bishop still in the office the bleeding seemed to have stopped but his breathing was very labored gillette also noticed that the old computer artifacts which phate had been packing up when he and bishop had arrived were still here he was surprised theyd left them all behind a million dollars worth of computer memorabilia theyd be gone by now of course this warehouse was right next to the winchester onramp to the freeway as he and bishop had predicted phate and shawn would have bypassed the traffic jams and were probably at northern california university right now killing the final victim in this level of the game they but wait gillette considered through his fog of pain why was he still alive there was no reason for them not to kill him what did they the mans scream came from behind him very close gillette gasped in shock at the raw sound and managed to turn his head toward it patricia nolan was crouching over phate who was cringing in agony as he sat against a metal column that rose to the murky ceiling her hair was pulled back into a taut bun the defensive geekgirl façade was gone she gazed at phate with the eyes of a coroner he wasnt tied up either his hands were at his side and gillette supposed shed zapped him too with the stun wand shed exchanged the hightech weaponry though for the hammer phate had struck bishop with so she wasnt shawn then who was she you understand im serious now she said to the killer leveling the hammer at him like a professor holding a pointer i have no problem hurting you phate nodded sweat poured down his face she mustve seen gillettes head move she glanced at him but concluded he was no threat she turned back to phate i want the source code to trapdoor where is it he nodded toward a laptop computer on the table behind her she glanced at the screen the hammer rose and dropped viciously with a soft sickening thud on his leg he screamed again you wouldnt carry around the source code on a laptop thats fake isnt it the program named trapdoor on that machine what is it really she drew back with the hammer shredder he gasped a virus that would destroy all the data in any computer you loaded it onto thats not helpful jon she leaned closer to him her misshapen sweater and knit dress stretched even further now listen i know bishop didnt call in a request for backup because hes on the run with gillette and even if he did theres nobody coming here because thanks to you the roads are useless ive got all the time in the world to make you tell me what i want to know and believe me im the woman who can do it thiss old hat to me fuck you he gasped calmly she gripped his wrist and slowly pulled his arm outward resting his hand on the concrete he tried to resist but he couldnt he stared at his splayed fingers the iron tool floating above them i want the source code i know you dont have it here youve uploaded it into a hiding place a passcodeprotected ftp site right an ftp site file transfer protocol was where many hackers cached their programs it could be on any computer system anywhere in the world unless you had the exact ftp address username and passcode youd be as likely to get the file as youd be to find a dot of microfilm in a rain forest phate hesitated nolan said soothingly look at these fingers she caressed the blunt digits after a moment she whispered where is the code he shook his head the hammer flashed downward toward phates little finger gillette didnt even hear it strike he heard only phates ragged scream i can do this all day she said evenly it doesnt bother me and its my job a sudden dark fury crossed phates face a man used to control a master mud player he was now completely helpless why dont you go fuck yourself he gave a weak laugh youll never find anybody else wholl want to youre a luser youre a geek spinster youve got a pretty shitty life ahead of you the flicker of anger in her eyes vanished fast she lifted the hammer again no no phate cried he took a deep breath all right he gave her the numbers of an internet address the username and the passcode nolan pulled out a cell phone and hit one button it seemed that the call connected immediately she gave the details on phates site to the person on the other end of the phone then said ill hold on check it out phates chest rose and fell he squinted the tears of pain from his eyes then he looked toward gillette here we are valleyman act three he sat up slightly and his bloody hand moved an inch or two he winced the game didnt quite work out the way i thought weve got ourselves a surprise ending looks like quiet nolan muttered but phate ignored her and continued speaking to gillette in a gasping voice ive got something i want to tell you are you listening to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man he coughed for a moment then i love plays thats from hamlet one of my favorites remember that line valleyman thats advice from a wizard to thine own self be true nolans face curled into a frown as she listened to her phone her shoulders sagged and she said into the mouthpiece stand by she set the phone aside and gripped the hammer again glaring at phate who though he seemed consumed by the pain was laughing faintly they checked out the site you gave me she said and it turned out to be an email account when they opened the files the communications program sent something to a university in asia was it trapdoor i dont know what it was he whispered staring at his bloody shattered hand a brief frown on his face gave way to a cold smile maybe i gave you the wrong address well give me the right one whats the hurry he asked cruelly got an important date with your cat at home a tv show a bottle of wine youll share with yourself again her anger broke through momentarily and she slammed the hammer down on his hand phate screamed again tell her gillette thought for gods sake tell her but he kept silent for an interminable five minutes of this torture the hammer rising and falling the finger bones snapping finally phate could stand it no more all right all right he gave her another address name and passcode nolan picked up the phone and relayed this information to her colleague on the other end waited a few minutes she listened said go through it line by line then run a compiler make sure its real while she waited she looked around the room at the old computers her eyes occasionally sparked with recognition and sometimes affection and delight as they settled on particular items five minutes later her colleague came back on the line good she said into the phone apparently satisfied the source code was real now go back to the ftp site and grab root check the upload and download logs see if hes transferred the code anywhere else who was she speaking to gillette wondered to review and compile a program as complicated as trapdoor would normally take hours gillette supposed a number of people were working on this and using dedicated supercomputers for the analysis after a moment she cocked her head and listened okay burn the ftp site and everything its connected to use infekt iv no i mean the whole network i dont care if its linked to norad and air traffic control burn it this virus was like an uncontrollable brushfire it would methodically destroy the contents of every file in the ftp site where phate had stored the source code and of any machine connected to it infekt would turn the data of thousands of machines into unrecognizable chains of random symbols so that it would be impossible to find even the slightest reference to trapdoor let alone the working source code phate closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the column nolan stood and still holding the hammer walked toward gillette he rolled onto his side and tried to crawl away but his body still wouldnt work after the electric jolts and he collapsed to the floor again patricia leaned close gillette stared at the hammer then he looked more closely at her and observed that her hair roots were a slightly different color from the strands that she wore green contact lenses looking beneath the blotchy makeup which gave her face that thick doughy appearance he could see lean features which meant that perhaps she too had been wearing body padding to add thirty pounds to what was undoubtedly a taut muscular body then he noticed her hands her fingers the pads glistened slightly and seemed opaque and he understood all that time shed been putting on fingernail conditioner she was adding it to the pads as well to obscure her fingerprints shes social engineered us too from day one gillette whispered youve been after him for a while havent you nolan nodded a year ever since we heard about trapdoor whos we she didnt answer but she didnt need to gillette supposed that shed been hired not by horizon online or by horizon alone but by a consortium of internet service providers to find the source code for trapdoor the ultimate voyeurs software which gave complete access to the lives of the unsuspecting nolans bosses wouldnt use trapdoor but would write inoculations against it and then destroy or quarantine the program which was a huge threat to the trilliondollar online industry gillette could just imagine how fast subscribers to internet providers would cancel their service and never go online again if they knew that hackers could roam freely through their computers and learn every detail about their lives steal from them expose them even destroy them and shed used andy anderson bishop and the rest of the ccu just as shed probably used the police in portland and northern virginia where phate and shawn had struck earlier just as shed used gillette himself she asked did he tell you anything about the source code anywhere else he cached it no it would have made no sense for phate to do so and after studying him carefully she seemed to believe gillette then she stood slowly and looked back at phate gillette saw her eyes examine the hacker in a certain way and he felt a jolt of alarm like a programmer who knows how software moves from beginning to end with no deviation no waste or digression gillette suddenly understood clearly what nolan had to do next he pleaded urgently dont i have to no you dont hell never be out in public again hell be in prison for the rest of his life you think prison would keep somebody like him offline it didnt stop you you cant do it trapdoors too dangerous she explained and hes got the code in his head probably a dozen other programs too thatre just as dangerous no gillette whispered desperately theres never been a hacker as good as him there may never be again he can write code that most of us cant even imagine yet she walked back to phate dont gillette cried but he knew his protest was futile from her laptop bag she took a small leather case extracted a hypodermic syringe and filled it from a bottle of clear liquid without hesitating she leaned down and injected it into phates neck he didnt struggle and for a moment gillette had the impression that he knew exactly what was happening and was embracing his death phate focused on gillette then on the wooden case of his apple computer which sat on a table nearby the early apples were truly hackers computers you bought only the guts of the machine and had to build the housing yourself phate continued to gaze at the unit as if he were trying to say something to it he turned to gillette to his words vanished into a whisper gillette shook his head phate coughed and continued in a feeble voice to thine own self be true then his head dipped forward and his breathing stopped gillette couldnt help but feel a sense of loss and sorrow sure jon patrick holloway deserved his death he was evil and could take the life of a human being as easily as hed lift a fictional characters digital heart from his body in a mud game yet within the young man was another person someone who wrote code as elegant as a symphony in whose keystrokes could be heard the silent laughter of hackers and could be seen the brilliance of a unbound mind which had it been directed on a slightly different course years ago could have made jon holloway a computer wizard admired around the world hed also been someone with whom gillette had carried out some yes truly moby hacks whatever direction life takes you never quite lose the bond that develops among fellow explorers of the blue nowhere then patricia nolan stood and looked at gillette he thought im dead she drew some more liquid into the needle sighing thismurder at least was going to bother her no he whispered shaking his head i wont say anything he tried to scrabble away from her but his muscles were still haywire from the electrical charges she crouched beside him pulled his collar down and massaged his neck to find the artery gillette looked across the room to where bishop lay still unconscious the detective would be the next victim he understood nolan leaned forward with the needle no gillette whispered he closed his eyes his thoughts on ellie no dont do it then a mans voice shouted hey hold up there without a seconds pause nolan dropped the hypodermic pulled a pistol from her laptop case and fired toward tony mott who stood in the doorway jesus the young cop cried cringing what the hellre you doing he dropped to the floor nolan lifted her gun once more but before she could fire several huge explosions shook the air and she fell backward mott was firing at her with his glitzy silver automatic none of the bullets had struck her and nolan rose fast again firing her own pistol a much smaller one at mott the ccu cop wearing his biking shorts a nike shirt and with his oakley sunglasses dangling from his neck crawled farther into the warehouse he fired again keeping nolan on the defensive she fired several times but missed as well what the hells going on whats she doing she killed holloway i was next nolan fired again then eased toward the front of the warehouse mott grabbed gillette by the pants cuff and dragged him to cover then emptied the clip of the automatic in the womans direction for all his love of swat team operations the cop seemed panicked to be in a real shootout he was also a really bad shot as he reloaded nolan disappeared behind some cartons are you hit motts hands were shaking and he was breathless no she got me with a stun gun or something i cant move what about frank hes not shot but weve got to get him to a doctor how did you know we were here frank called and told me to check the records on this place gillette remembered bishops making the call from nolans hotel room scanning the warehouse for nolan the young cop continued that prick backle knew frank and you took off together he had a tap on our phones he heard the address and called some of his people to pick you up here i came over here to warn you but howd you get through all the traffic my bike remember mott crawled to bishop who was starting to stir then from across the dinosaur pen nolan rose and fired a halfdozen shots in their direction she fled out the front door mott reluctantly started after her gillette called be careful she cant get away through the traffic either shell be outside waiting but his voice faded as he heard a distinctive sound growing closer he realized that like hackers people with jobs like patricia nolan must be experts at improvising a countywide traffic jam wasnt going to interfere with her plans the noise was the roar of the helicopter undoubtedly the one disguised as a press chopper that hed seen before the one that had delivered her here in less than thirty seconds the craft had picked her up and was in the air again speeding away the chunky sound of the rotors soon replaced by the curiously harmonic orchestra of car and truck horns filling the lateafternoon sky chapter fortytwo gillette and bishop were back at the computer crimes unit the detective was out of the urgentcare facility a concussion a fierce headache and eight stitches were the only evidence of his ordeal along with a new shirt to replace the bloody one this one fit somewhat better than its predecessor but it too seemed largely tuckresistant the time was pm and public works had managed to reload the software that controlled the traffic lights much of the congestion in santa clara county was gone a search of san jose computer products turned up a gasoline bomb and some information about the fire alarm system of northern california university aware of phates love of diversion bishop was concerned that the killer had planted a second device on the campus but a thorough search of the dormitories and other school buildings revealed nothing to no ones surprise horizon online claimed theyd never heard of a patricia nolan the company executives and the head of corporate security in seattle said theyd never contacted california state police headquarters after the lara gibson killing and no one had sent andy anderson any emails or faxes about nolans credentials the horizon online number that anderson had called to verify her employment was a working horizon phone line but according to the phone company in seattle all calls going into that number were forwarded to a mobile america cell phone with unassigned numbers which was no longer in use the security staff at horizon knew of no one fitting her description either the address under which shed registered at her hotel in san jose was fake and the credit card was phony too all the phone calls shed made from the hotel were to that same hacked mobile america number not a soul at ccu believed horizons denial of course but proving a connection between hol and patricia nolan was going to be difficult as was finding her in the first place a picture of the woman lifted from a security tape in ccu headquarters went out on islenet to state police bureaus around the country and to the feds for posting to vicar bishop however had to include the embarrassing disclaimer that even though the woman had spent several days in a state police facility they had no samples of her fingerprints and that her appearance was probably considerably different from what the tape showed at least the whereabouts of the other coconspirator had been discovered the body of shawn stephen miller had been found in the woods behind his house hed shot himself with his service revolver after he learned that theyd caught on to his identity his remorseful suicide note had naturally been in the form of an email ccus linda sanchez and tony mott were trying to piece together the extent of millers betrayal the state police would have to issue a statement that one of their officers had been an accomplice in the hacker murder case in silicon valley and internal affairs wanted to find out how much damage miller had done and how long hed been phates partner and lover department of defense agent backle was still intent on collaring wyatt gillette for a laundry list of offenses involving the standard encryption program and now wanted to arrest frank bishop as well for breaking a federal prisoner out of custody as for the charges against gillette for the standard hack bishop explained to captain bernstein its pretty clear sir that gillette either seized root at one of holloways ftp sites and downloaded a copy of the script or just telneted directly into holloways machine and got a copy that way what the hell does that mean the grizzled crewcut cop had snapped sorry sir bishop had said then had translated the technospeak what im saying is i think it was holloway who broke into the dod and wrote the decryption program gillette stole it from him and used it because we asked him to you thinkbernstein had muttered cynically well i dont understand all this computer crap thats been going around but he picked up the phone and called the us attorney who agreed to review whatever evidence ccu could offer supporting bishops theory before proceeding with charges against either gillette or bishop both of whose stock was pretty high at the moment for having nailed the silicon valley kracker as the local tv stations were describing phate agent backle grudgingly returned to his office in san francisco s presidio at the moment however the attention of all the law enforcers had turned from phate and stephen miller to the marinkill case several bulletins reported that the killers had been spotted again this time right next door in san jose apparently staking out several other banks bishop and shelton had been conscripted into the joint fbistate police taskforce theyd spend a few hours with their families for dinner and then report to the bureaus san jose office later tonight bob shelton was home at the moment his only farewell to gillette had been a cryptic glance whose meaning was completely lost on the hacker bishop however had delayed his own departure home and was sharing a poptart and coffee with the hacker while they waited for the troopers to arrive to transport him back to san ho the phone rang bishop answered computer crimes he listened for a moment hold on he looked at gillette lifted an eyebrow handed the receiver to him its for you he took it hello wyatt elanas voice was so familiar to him that he could almost feel it beneath his compulsively keying fingers the timbre of her voice alone had always revealed to him the entire range of her soul and he needed to hear only a single word to know whether she was playful angry frightened sentimental passionate today he could tell from her greeting that shed called very reluctantly and that her defenses were up like the shields on the spacecrafts of the scifi movies theyd watched together on the other hand she had called she said i heard that hes dead jon holloway i heard it on the news thats right are you all right fine a long pause as if looking for something to fill the silence she added im still going to new york with ed thats right he closed his eyes and sighed then with an edge in his voice he asked so whyd you call i guess just to say that if you wanted to come you could gillette wondered why bother what was the point he said ill be there in ten minutes they hung up he turned to find bishop looking at him cautiously gillette said give me an hour please i cant take you the detective said let me borrow a car the detective debated looked around the dinosaur pen considering he said to linda sanchez you have a ccu car he can use reluctantly she handed him the keys this isnt procedure boss ill take responsibility bishop tossed the keys to gillette then pulled out his phone and called the troopers whod be transporting him back to san ho he gave them elanas address and said hed okayed gillettes being there the prisoner would be returning to ccu in one hour he hung up ill come back i know you will the men faced each other for a moment they shook hands gillette nodded and started for the door wait bishop asked frowning you have a drivers license gillette laughed no i dont have a drivers license bishop shrugged and said well just dont get stopped the hacker nodded and said gravely right they might send me to jail the house smelled of lemons as it always had this was thanks to the deft culinary touch of irene papandolos ellies mother she wasnt the traditional wary silent greek matron but a sharp businesswoman who owned a successful catering company and still managed to find the time to cook every meal for her family from scratch it was now dinnertime and she wore a stained apron over a rosecolored business suit she greeted gillette with a cool unsmiling nod and gestured him into the den he sat on a couch beneath a picture of the waterfront at piraeus family being ever important in greek households two tables were filled with photographs in a variety of frames some cheap some heavy silver and gold gillette saw a picture of elana in her wedding dress he didnt recognize the shot and he wondered if it had originally shown the two of them and had been cropped to remove him elana entered the room youre here by yourself she asked not smiling no other greeting how do you mean no police babysitters honor system i saw a couple of police cars go past i wondered if they were with you she nodded outside no gillette said though he supposed that troopers might in fact be keeping tabs on him she sat and picked uneasily at the cuff of the stanford sweatshirt she wore im not going to say goodbye he said she frowned and he continued because i want to talk you out of leaving i want to keep seeing you seeing me youre in prison wyatt ill be out in a year she laughed in surprise at his effrontery he said i want to try again you want to try again what about what i want i can give you what you want i will ive done a lot of thinking i can make you love me again i dont want you out of my life you chose machines over me you got what you wanted thats in the past my lifes different now im happy are you yes elana said emphatically because of ed hes part of it come on wyatt what can you offer me youre a felon youre addicted to those goddamn computers of yours you dont have a job and the judge said that even when you get out of jail you cant go online for a year and eds got himself a good job is that it i didnt know that a good income was important to you its not a question of support gillette its about responsibility and youre not responsible i wasnt responsible i admit that but i will be he tried to take her hand but she eased away he said come on ellie i saw your emails when you talk about ed it doesnt exactly sound like hes perfect husband material she stiffened and he saw hed touched a nerve here leave ed out of this im talking about you and me me too thats exactly who im talking about i love you i know i made your life hell it wont be that way again you wanted children a normal life ill find a job well have a family another hesitation he pressed forward why are you leaving tomorrow whats the hurry im starting a new job next monday why new york because its as far away from you as i can get wait a month just one month i get two visits a week come see me he smiled we can hang out eat pizza her eyes swept the floor and he sensed that she was debating did your mother cut me out of that picture he grinned and nodded at the snapshot of her in her wedding gown she gave a faint smile no that was the one alexis took on the lawn it was just of me remember the one where you cant see my feet he laughed how many brides lose their shoes at the wedding she nodded we always wondered what happened to them oh please ellie just postpone it for a month thats all im asking her eyes studied some of the pictures she began to say something but her mother stepped into the doorway suddenly her dark face was even darker than before theres a call for you me gillette asked its somebody named bishop he says its important frank whats the detectives voice was raw with urgency listen to me carefully wyatt we could lose the line any minute shawn isnt dead what but miller no we were wrong stephen miller isnt shawn its somebody else im at ccu linda sanchez found a message for me on the main ccu voice mail before he died miller called and left it remember when phate broke into ccu and went after you right miller was just coming back from the medical center then he was in the parking lot and saw phate run out of the building and jump in a car he followed him why to collar him by himself gillette asked the message said he wanted to bring the killer in on his own he said hed screwed up so many times that he wanted to prove that he could do something right then he didnt kill himself nope they havent done the autopsy yet but i had a medical examiner check for traces of powder burns on his hands there werent any if hed killed himself there wouldve been plenty of trace phate mustve seen miller following and then killed him then he pretended to be miller and intentionally got caught cracking into the state department he hacked into millers workstation at ccu and planted those fake emails and took his machines and disks out of his house were sure the suicide note was false too it was all to stop us from looking for the real shawn well who is he i dont have a clue all i know is weve got a real problem tony motts here shawn hacked the fbis tactical command computers in washington and san jose he got in through islenet and hes got root access in a low voice bishop continued now listen carefully shawns issued arrest warrants and rules of engagement for the suspects in the marinkill case were looking at the screen right now i dont understand gillette said the warrants say that the suspects are at abrego avenue in sunnyvale but thats here elanas house i know hes ordered the tactical troops to attack the house in twentyfive minutes vi its all in the spelling code segment assume dsicodesscodecscodeescode org h vcode jmp virus push cx mov dxoffset virdat cld mov sidx add sifirst mov cx mov dioffset h repz movsb mov sidx mov ahh int h cmp al jnz dosok jmp quit portions of the actual source code of the virus violator strain ii chapter fortythree elana stepped forward seeing gillettes alarmed expression what is it whats going on he ignored her and said to bishop call the fbi tell them whats happening call washington i tried bishop responded bernstein did too but the agents hung up on us the rules of engagement that shawn issued say that the perps will probably try to impersonate state cops and try to countermand or delay the attack order only computer codes are authorized nothing verbal not even from washington if we had more time maybe we could convince them but jesus frank how had shawn found out he was here then he realized that bishop had called the troopers to say that gillette would be at elanas place for an hour he remembered that phate and shawn had been monitoring radio and phone transmissions for keywords like triplex and holloway and gillette shawn mustve heard bishops conversation bishop said theyre near the house now at a staging area thedetective added i just dont understand why shawns doing this but gillette did hackers revenge is patient revenge gillette had betrayed phate years ago destroyed the carefully socially engineered life hed made for himself and earlier today hed helped end the hackers life altogether now shawn would destroy gillette and those he loved he looked out the window thought he saw some motion wyatt elana asked whats going on she started to look out the window but he pulled her back roughly what is it she cried stay back stay away from the windows bishop continued shawns issued level rules of engagement that means that the swat teams dont make any surrender demands they go in assuming theyll be met with suicidal resistance theyre the rules of engagement they use when theyre up against terrorists willing to die so theyll shoot tear gas inside gillette muttered kick the doors in and anybody who moves is going to get killed bishop paused it could go like that wyatt elana asked whats going on tell me he turned shouted tell everybody to get down on the living room floor you too now her black eyes burned with anger and fear whatve you done im sorry im sorry just do it now get down he turned back looked out the window he could see two large black vans easing through an alley fifty feet away in the distance a helicopter fluttered a hundred feet in the air listen wyatt the bureau wont go ahead with the assault if theres no final confirmation thats part of the rules of engagement is there any way to shut down shawns machine put tony on im here mott said are you in the fbi system yeah we can see the screen shawns imping that hes the tactical operations center in washington issuing codes the tactical agent in the fields responding like its business as usual can you trace the call back to where shawn is mott said we dont have a warrant but ill pull some strings at pac bell give me a minute or two outside the sound of heavy trucks the helicopter was closer gillette could hear the hysterical sobbing of elanas mother and her brothers angry words coming from the living room elana herself said nothing he saw her cross herself glance once at him hopelessly and bury her head in the carpet beside her mother oh jesus whatve i done a few minutes later bishop came back on the line pac bells running the trace its a landline theyve narrowed down the central office and exchange hes somewhere in western san jose near winchester boulevard where phates warehouse was gillette asked you think hes in the san jose computer products building maybe he got back inside after you finished going through it or maybe hes someplace nearby therere dozens of old warehouses around there im ten minutes away the detective said ill go over there now brother i wish we knew who shawn was something occurred to gillette as when he was writing code he applied this hypothesis against the known facts and rules of logic he came to a conclusion he said i have a thought about that shawn yeah wheres bob shelton at home whyre you asking call and find out if hes really there okay ill call you back from the car a few minutes later the papandolos phone rang and gillette grabbed the receiver frank bishop was calling back as he sped down san carlos toward winchester bob should be home bishop said but theres no answer youre wrong if youre thinking bobs shawn though looking out the window seeing another police car cruise by followed by a militarytype truck gillette said no frank listen shelton claimed he hated computers didnt know anything about them but remember he had that hard drive in his house the what that disk we saw its the kind of hardware only people who did serious hacking or ran bulletin boards a few years ago would use i dont know bishop said slowly maybe it was evidence or something has he ever worked a computer case before this well no gillette continued and he disappeared for a while before they raided phates house in los altos he had time to send that message about the assault code and give phate a chance to get away and think about it it was because of him that phate got inside islenet and got the fbi computer addresses and tactical codes shelton said he went online to check me out but what he was really doing was leaving the password and address of the ccu computer for phate so he could crack islenet but bobs not a computer person he says he isnt but do you know for sure do you go over to his house much no whats he do at night usually stays at home never goes out bishop reluctantly replied no thats hacker behavior but ive known him for three years social engineering bishop said impossible hold on theres another call coming in while he was on hold gillette peeked through the curtain he could see what looked like a military troop carrier parked not far away there was motion in the bushes across the street policemen in camouflage clothing ran from one hedgerow to another it seemed that there were a hundred officers outside bishop came back on the line pac bells got the location where shawns cracking into the fbi from he isin san jose computer products im almost there ill call you when im inside frank bishop called for backup and then parked the car out of sight in the lot across the street san jose computer seemed to be windowless but he wasnt going to take the chance that shawn would get a look at him crouching moving as fast as he could despite the terrible pain in his temple and the back of his skull bishop made his way to the warehouse he didnt believe gillettes conclusion about bob shelton and yet he couldnt help but consider it of all the partners bishop had had he knew the least about shelton the big cop did spend all his nights at home he didnt socialize with other cops and while bishop himself for instance had a basic knowledge of islenet he wouldnt have been able to get inside the system and track down that information about gillette the way shelton had done he recalled too that shelton had volunteered for this case bishop remembered wondering why hed wanted to take this one rather than marinkill but none of this mattered at the moment whether shawn was bob shelton or someone else bishop had only about fifteen minutes before the federal tactical team began their attack drawing his pistol he flattened himself against the wall beside the loading dock and paused listening he could hear nothing inside okay go ripping the door open bishop ran down the corridor through the office and into the dank warehouse itself it was dark and seemed unoccupied he found a bank of overhead lights and flipped the switches on with his left hand holding his pistol out in front of him the stark illumination shone down on the entire space and he could see clearly that it was empty he ran outside again to look for another building that shawn might be using but there were no other structures connected to the warehouse as he was about to turn back though he noticed that the warehouse looked considerably larger from the outside than it had on the inside hurrying back into the building he saw that a wall appeared to have been added at one end of the warehouse it was a more recent construction than the original building yes phate mustve added a secret room thats where shawn would be in a dim corner of the pen he found a door and tested the knob quietly it was unlocked he inhaled deeply dried the sweat from his hand on his billowing shirt and gripped the knob again had his footsteps or flipping on the lights warned shawn of the intrusion did the killer have a weapon trained on the doorway it all comes down to this frank bishop pushed inside gun up he dropped into a crouch squinting for a target scanning the dark room chill from the airconditioning he saw no sign of shawn only machinery and equipment packing crates and pallets tools a handoperated hydraulic forklift empty there was then he saw it oh no bishop realized then that wyatt gillette and his wife and her family were doomed the room was only a telephone relay station shawn was hacking in from someplace else reluctantly he called gillette the hacker answered and said desperately i can see them frank theyve got machine guns thiss going to be bad you found anything wyatt im at the warehouse but im sorry shawns not here its just a phone relay or something he described the large black metal console its not a phone relay gillette muttered his voice hollow with despair its an internet router but it still wont do us any good itd take an hour to trace the signal back to shawn well never find him in time bishop glanced at the box therere no switches on it and the wirings under the floor this is one of those dinosaur pens like at ccu so i cant unplug it wont do any good anyway even if you shut that one down shawns transmissionsll automatically find a different route to the fbi maybe theres something else here thatll tell us where he is desperately bishop began searching through the desk and packing boxes therere lots of papers and books what are they the hacker asked but his voice was a monotone filled with helplessness his childlike curiosity long gone manuals printouts worksheets computer disks mostly technical stuff from sun microsystems apple harvard western electric all the places where phate worked bishop ripped through boxes scattering pages everywhere no theres nothing here bishop looked around helplessly ill try to make it to ellies house in time convince the bureau to send a negotiator in before they start the assault youre twenty minutes away frank gillette whispered youll never make it ill try the detective said softly listen wyatt get into the middle of the living room and get down keep your hands in plain sight pray for the best he started for the door then he heard gillette shout wait what is it the hacker asked those manuals that he was packing up what were the companies again bishop looked over the documents the places phate worked harvard sun apple western electric and nec gillette shouted right its an acronym what do you mean bishop asked gillette said remember all the acronyms hackers use the initials of those places he worked s for sun h for harvard a for apple western electric nec s h a w n the machine there in the room with you its not a router at all the box thats shawn he created it from the code and hardware he stole bishop scoffed impossible no thats why the trace ended there shawns a machine hes its generating the signals before he died phate mustve programmed it to crack the bureau system and arrange the assault and phate knew about ellie he mentioned her by name when he broke into ccu he seemed to think i betrayed him because of her bishop shivering fiercely from the raw cold turned toward the black box theres no way a computer couldve done all this but gillette interrupted no no no why wasnt i thinking better a machine is the only way he couldve done it a supercomputers the only thing that could crack scrambled signals and monitor all of the phone calls and radio transmissions in and out of ccu a human being couldnt do it thered be way too much to listen to government computers do it everyday listen for key words like president and assassinate in the same sentence thats how phate found out about andy anderson going to hackers knoll and about me shawn mustve heard backle call the department of defense and sent phate that portion of the transmission and it heard the assault code when we were about to nail him in los altos and sent the message to phate to warn him the detective said but shawns emails in phates computer they sounded like a human actually wrote them you can communicate with a machine any way you want emails work just as well as anything else phate programmed them to sound like somebodyd written them it probably made him feel better seeing what looked like a humans words like i was telling you i did with my trash shawn its all in the spelling what can we do the detective asked theres only one thing youve got to the line went dead we took their phone out a communications tech said to special agent mark little the tactical commander for the bureaus marinkill operation and the cells down nobodys mobilesll work for a mile around good little along with his second in command special agent george steadman was in a panel van that was serving as the command post in sunnyvale the vehicle was parked around the corner from the house on abrego where the perps in the marinkill case were reportedly hiding taking the phones down was standard procedure five or ten minutes before an assault you had the subjects phone service suspended that way nobody could warn them of the impending attack little had done a number of dynamic entries into barricaded sites mostly drug busts in oakland and san jose and hed never lost an agent but this operation was especially troubling to the thirtyoneyearold agent hed been working marinkill from day one and had read all the bulletins including the one just received from an anonymous informant which reported that the killers felt they were being persecuted by the fbi and police and planned to torture any law enforcement officers they captured appended to this was another report that theyd rather die fighting than be taken alive man its never easy but this everybody locked and loaded and in armor little asked steadman yeah three teams and snipers ready the streetsre secure medevacs from travis are in the air fire trucksre around the corner little nodded as he listened to the report well everything seemed fine but what the hell was bothering him so much he wasnt sure maybe it had been the desperation in that guys voice the one claiming to be from the state police bishop was his name or something like that yammering on about somebody hacking into the bureaus computers and issuing phony assault codes against some innocents but the rules of engagement issued by washington had warned that the perps would impersonate fellow officers and would claim that the whole operation was a misunderstanding the perps might even pretend to be state police besides little reflected hacking into the bureaus computers impossible the public web site was one thing but the secure tactical computer never he looked at his watch eight minutes to go he said to one of the techs sitting at a computer monitor get the yellow confirmation the man keyed from tactical commander doj northern district california to doj tac op center washington dc re doj northern district california operation yellow code confirm he hit enter there were three levels of tactical operational codes green yellow and red a goahead green code approved the agents movement to the staging site of the operation this had happened a halfhour ago yellow goahead meant for them to get ready for the assault and move into position around their target red controlled the actual assault itself a moment later this message came up on the screen from doj tac op center washington dc to tactical commander doj northern district california re doj northern district california operation yellow code oaktree print it out little commanded the communications tech yessir little and steadman checked the code word and found that oaktree was correct the agents were approved to deploy around the house still he hesitated hearing the voice of that guy claiming to be frank bishop over and over in his head he thought of the children killed at waco despite the level rules of engagement which stated that negotiators were not appropriate for tactical operations involving perps like these little wondered if he should call san francisco where the bureau had a topnotch siege negotiator hed worked with before maybe agent little the communications officer interrupted nodding at his computer screen message for you little leaned forward and read urgent urgent urgent from doj tag op center washington dc to tactical commander doj northern district california re doj northern district california operation us army reports marinkill suspects broke into san pedro military reserve at hours today and stole large cache of automatic weapons hand grenades and body armor advise tactical agents of said situation man alive little thought his pulse skyrocketing the message knocked any suggestion of a negotiator right out of his thoughts he glanced at agent steadman and said calmly nodding at the screen pass the word on this george then get everybody into position we go in six minutes chapter fortyfour frank bishop walked around shawn the housing was about fourfeet square and made of thick metal sheets on the back was a series of ventilation slats from which hot air poured the white wisps visible like breath on a winter day the front panel consisted of nothing except three green eyes glowing indicator lights that flickered occasionally revealing that shawn was hard at work carrying out phates posthumous instructions the detective had tried to call wyatt gillette back but the phone was out of service he called tony mott at the ccu he told him and linda sanchez about the machine and then explained that gillette seemed to think there was something specific he could do but the hacker hadnt had time to tell him any ideas they debated bishop thought he should try to shut the machine down and stop the transmission of the confirmation code from shawn to fbi tactical commander tony mott however thought that if that happened there might be a second machine somewhere else that would take over for it send the confirmation and after learning that shawn had been taken down might be preprogrammed to do even more damage like jam an fa a air traffic control computer somewhere he thought it would be better to try to hack into shawn and seize root bishop didnt disagree with mott but he explained there was no keyboard here to use to crack into shawn besides with only a few minutes to go until the assault there was no time to crunch passcodes and try to take control of the machine im going to shut it down he said but the detective could find no obvious way to do that he searched again for a power switch and couldnt locate one he looked for an access panel that would let him get to the power cables under the thick wooden floor but there was none he looked at his watch three minutes until the assault no time to go outside again and look for power company transformer boxes and so just as hed done six months ago in an alley in oakland when tremain winters lifted a remington twelvegauge to his shoulder and aimed it at bishop and two city cops the detective calmly drew his service weapon and fired three wellgrouped bullets into his adversarys torso but unlike the slugs that sent the gang leader to his death these copperjacketed rounds flattened into tiny pancakes and bounced to the floor shawns skin was hardly dented bishop walked closer stood at an angle to avoid ricochets and emptied the clip at the indicator lights one green light shattered but steam continued to pour from the vents into the cold air bishop grabbed his cell phone and shouted to mott i just emptied a clip at the machine is it still online he had to cram the phone against his ear halfdeafened from the gunshots to hear the young cop at ccu tell him that shawn was still operational and on line damn he reloaded and poked the gun into one of the back vents and emptied this clip as well this time a ricochet a bit of hot lead struck the back of his hand and left a ragged stigmata in his skin he wiped the blood on his slacks and grabbed the phone again sorry frank mott replied hopelessly its still up and running the cop looked in frustration at the box well if youre going to play god and create new life he thought bitterly you might as well make it invulnerable sixty seconds bishop was wracked with frustration he thought of wyatt gillette somebody whose only crime was stumbling slightly as hed tried to escape an empty childhood so many of the kids bishop had collared kids in the east bay in the haight were remorseless killers and were now walking around free and wyatt gillette had simply followed the fairly harmless path that god and the young mans own brilliance had jointly directed him down and as a result he and the woman he loved and her family were going to suffer terribly no time left shawn would be sending the confirmation signal at any moment was there anything he could do to stop shawn maybe burn the damn thing he could start a fire next to the vents he ran to the desk and threw the contents of the drawers onto the floor looking for matches or a cigarette lighter nothing then something clicked in his mind what he couldnt remember exactly a thought from what seemed like ages ago something gillette had said when hed walked into ccu for the first time the subject had been fires in a computer room do something with that he glanced at his watch it was the deadline for the assault shawns two remaining eyes flickered passionlessly do something fire with that yes bishop suddenly turned from shawn and looked frantically around the room there it was he ran to a small gray box with a red button in the middle the dinosaur pens scram switch he slammed his palm against the button a braying alarm sounded from the ceiling and with a piercing hiss streams of halon gas shot from pipes above and below the machine enveloping the rooms occupants one human one not in a ghostly white fog tactical agent mark little looked at the screen of the computer in the command van red code mapleleaf this was the goahead code for the assault print it out little said to the tech agent then he turned to george steadman confirm that mapleleaf greenlights us for an assault with level rules of engagement the other agent consulted a small booklet with a department of justice seal on the front cover under the word classified written in large block letters confirmed little radioed to the three snipers covering all the doors were going in any targets presenting through the windows they each reported that there were none all right if anyone comes through the door armed take them out drop em with a head shot so they wont have time to push any detonator buttons if they seem to be unarmed use your own judgment but ill remind you that rules of engagementve been set at level understand what im saying five by five one of the snipers said and the others confirmed that they understood too little and steadman left the command van and ran through the hazy dusk to their teams little slipped into a side yard to join the eight officers he was leading alpha team steadman went to his bravo little listened as the search and surveillance team reported in alpha team leader infrared shows body heat in the living room and parlor the kitchen too but that might just be cooking heat from the stove roger then little announced into his radio im taking alpha up the operationside right of the house well saturate with stun grenades three in the parlor three in the living room three in the kitchen thrown at fivesecond intervals on the third bang bravo goes in the front charlie in the back well set up crossfire zones from the side windows steadman and the leader of the other team confirmed theyd heard and understood little pulled on his gloves hood and helmet thinking about the stolen cache of automatic weapons hand grenades and body armor okay he said alpha team forward go slow use all available cover get ready to light the candles chapter fortyfive inside the papandolos home the house of lemons the house of photographs the house of family wyatt gillette pressed his face against lace curtains that he remembered elanas mother sewing together one autumn from this nostalgic vantage point he saw the fbi agents start to move in a few feet at a time crouching cautious he glanced into the other room behind him and saw elana lying on the floor her arm around her mother christian her brother was nearby but his head was up and he looked with bottomless anger into gillettes eyes nothing he could say to them by way of apology would even approach adequacy and he remained silent turned back to the window hed decided what he would do decided some time before actually but hed been content to savor these last few minutes of his life in proximity to the woman he loved ironically the idea had come from phate youre the hero with the flaw the flaw that usually gets them into trouble oh youll do something heroic at the end and save some lives and the audiencell cry for you hed walk outside with his arms up bishop had said they wouldnt trust him and think that he was a suicide bomber or had a hidden gun phate and shawn had seen to it that the police were expecting the worst but the officers were human too they might hesitate and if they did they might trust him to call elana and the others out but you ll still never make it to the final level of the game and even if he didnt if they shot and killed him theyd search his body and find that he was unarmed and might think that the others would be willing to surrender peaceably too then theyd discover that this was all just a terrible mistake he glanced at his wife even now he thought shes so very beautiful she didnt look up and he was glad for that he couldnt have borne the burden of her gaze wait until theyre close he told himself so they can see youre not a threat as he stepped into the hall to wait beside the door he noticed on a desk in the den an old ibmclone computer wyatt gillette reflected on the dozens of hours hed spent online in the past few days thinking if he couldnt take elanas love to his death at least hed have those memories of his hours in the blue nowhere to accompany him the tactical agents of alpha team crawled slowly toward the stuccoed suburban house hardly a likely setting for an operation of this sort mark little signaled the team to take cover behind a bed of spiny rhododendrons about twenty feet from the west side of the house he gave a hand signal to three of his agents from whose belts dangled the powerful stun grenades they ran into position beneath the parlor living room and kitchen windows then pulled the pins of the grenades three others joined them and gripped billy clubs with which theyd shatter the glass so their partners could pitch the grenades inside the men looked back at little awaiting the goahead hand signal then a crackle in littles headset alpha team leader one we have an emergency patch from a landline its the sac from san francisco special agent in charge jaeger what was he calling for go ahead he whispered into the stalk mike there was a click agent little came the unfamiliar voice its frank bishop state police bishop it was that fucking cop whod called before put henry jaeger on hes not here sir i lied i had to get through to you dont disconnect you have to listen to me bishop was the one theyd decided might be a perp inside the house trying to distract them except little now reflected the phone lines to the house and the cell were down which meant that the call couldnt be coming from the killers bishop what the hell do you want you know what kind of trouble youre going to be in for impersonating an fbi agent im hanging up no dont ask for reconfirmation i dont want to hear any of this hacker crap little examined the house everything was still moments like this summoned a curious sensation exhilarating and frightening and numbing all at the same time you also had the queasy sense that one of the killers had itchy crosshairs on you picking out a target of flesh two inches off the vest the cop said i just nailed the perp who did the hacking and shut his computer down i guarantee you wont get a reconfirmation send the request thats not procedure do it anyway youll regret it for the rest of your life if you go in there under level rules of engagement little paused how had bishop known they were operating at level only someone on the team or with access to the bureau computer could have known that the agent noticed his second in command steadman tap his watch impatiently then nod toward the house bishops voice was pure desperation please ill stake my job on it the agent hesitated then muttered you sure as hell just did bishop he slung his machine gun over his shoulder and switched back to the tactical frequency all teams stay in position repeat stay in position if youre fired upon full retaliation is authorized he sprinted back to the command post the communications tech looked up in surprise whats up on the screen little could still see the confirmation code okaying the attack confirm the red code again why we dont need to reconfirm if now little snapped the man typed from tactical commander doj northern district california to doj tac op center washington dc re doj northern district california operation red code confirm a message popped up on the screen please wait these few minutes could give the killers inside a chance to prepare for an assault or to rig the house with explosives for a group suicide that

extend your arms now now now no information the agent then called in hes down sir should we frisk and restrain little thought of his wife and two children and said no ill do it myself he said into the mike all teams pull back to cover he turned to the communications officer get me the deputy director in washington then he pointed a blunt finger at the conflicting messages the goahead printout and the no information message on the computer screen and let me know exactly how the hell this happened chapter fortysix lying on the grass smelling dirt rain and the faint scent of lilac wyatt gillette blinked as the searing spotlights focused on him he watched an edgy young agent move cautiously toward him pointing a very large gun at his head the agent cuffed him and frisked him thoroughly relaxing only when gillette asked him to call a state trooper named bishop who could confirm that the fbis computer system had been hacked and that the people in the house werent the marinkill suspects the agent then ordered elanas family out of the house she her mother and her brother walked slowly out onto the lawn arms raised they were searched and handcuffed and though they werent treated roughly it was clear from their grim faces that they were suffering nearly as much from indignity and terror as if theyd been physically injured gillettes ordeal though was the worst and that had nothing to do with his treatment at the hands of the fbi it was that he knew that the woman he loved was now gone from him forever shed seemed to be wavering on her decision to move to new york with ed but now the machines that had driven them apart years ago had almost killed her family and that was of course unforgivable she would now flee to the east coast with responsible gainfully employed ed and ellie would become to gillette nothing more than a collection of memories likejpg andwav files visual and sound images that vanished when you powered down at night the fbi agents huddled and made a number of phone calls and then huddled some more they concluded that the assault had indeed been illegally ordered they released everyone except gillette of course though they helped him stand and loosened the cuffs a bit elana strode up to her ex he stood motionless in front of her making not a sound as he took the full force of the powerful slap against his cheek the woman sensuous and beautiful even in her anger turned away without a word and helped her mother up the stairs into the house her brother offered a twentytwoyearolds inarticulate threat about a lawsuit and worse and followed them slamming the door as the agents packed up bishop arrived and found gillette being guarded by a large agent he walked up to the hacker and said the scram switch a halon dump gillette nodded thats what i was going to tell you to do when they cut the phone line bishop nodded i remembered you mentioned it at ccu when you first saw the dinosaur pen any other damage gillette asked to shawn he hoped not he was keenly curious about the machine how it worked what it could do what operating system made up its heart and mind but the machine wasnt badly hurt bishop explained i emptied two full clips at the box but it didnt do much damage he smiled just a flesh wound a stocky man walked toward them through the blinding spotlights when he got closer gillette could see it was bob shelton the pockfaced cop greeted his partner and glanced at gillette with his typical disdain bishop told him what had happened but said nothing about suspecting shelton himself as being shawn the cop shook his head with a bitter laugh shawn was a computer jesus somebody oughta throw every fucking one of em into the ocean why do you keep saying that gillette snapped im getting a little tired of it of what shelton shot back no longer able to control his anger at the cops harsh treatment of him over the past few days the hacker muttered youve been dumping on me and machines every chance you get but its a little hard to believe coming from somebody with a thousanddollar winchester drive sitting in his house a what when we were over at your house i saw that server drive sitting in your living room the cops eyes flared that was my sons he growled i was throwing it out i was finally cleaning out his room getting rid of all that computer shit he had my wife didnt want me to throw out any of his things thats what we were fighting about he was into computers your son gillette asked recalling that the boy had died several years ago another bitter laugh oh yeah he was into computers hed spend hours online all he wanted to do was hack only some cybergang found out he was a cops kid and thought he was trying to snitch em out they went after him posted all kinds of shit about him on the internet that he was gay that he had a record that he molested little kids they broke into his schools computer and made it look like he changed his own grades that got him suspended then they sent some girl hed been dating this filthy email in his name she broke up with him because of it the day that happened he got drunk and drove into a freeway abutment maybe it was an accident maybe he killed himself either way it was computers that killed him im sorry gillette said softly the fuck you are shelton stepped closer to the hacker his anger undiminished thats why i volunteered for this case i thought the perp might be one of the kids in that gang and thats why i went online that day to see if you were one of em too no i wasnt i wouldntve done something like that to anybody thats not why i hacked oh you keep saying that but youre as bad as any of them making my boy believe that those goddamn plastic boxesre the whole world well thats bullshit thats not where life is he grabbed gillettes jacket the hacker didnt resist just stared at the enraged mans face shelton snapped life is here flesh and blood human beings your family your children his voice choked tears filled his eyes thats whats real shelton shoved the hacker back wiped his eyes with his hands bishop stepped forward and touched his arm but shelton pulled away and disappeared into the crowd of police and agents gillettes heart went out to the poor man but he couldnt help but think machinesre real too shelton theyre becoming more and more a part of that fleshandblood life every day and thats never going to change the question we have to ask ourselves isnt whether this transformation is in itself good or bad but simply this who do we become when we step through the monitor into the blue nowhere the detective and the hacker alone now stood facing each other bishop noticed his shirt was untucked he shoved the tail into his slacks then nodded at the palm tree tattoo on gillettes forearm you might want to get that removed you know i dont think it does a lot for you the pigeon at least the trees not too bad its a seagull the hacker replied but now that you bring it up frank why dont you get one what a tattoo the detective started to say something then lifted an eyebrow you know maybe i just will then gillette felt his arms being gripped from behind the state troopers had arrived right on schedule to return him to san ho chapter fortyseven a week after the hacker returned to prison frank bishop made good on andy andersons promise and over the wardens renewed objections delivered to wyatt gillette a battered secondhand toshiba laptop computer when he booted it up the first thing he saw was a digitized picture of a fat darkcomplected baby a few days old the caption beneath it read greetings from linda sanchez and her new granddaughter maria andie harmon gillette made a mental note to send her a letter of congratulations a baby present would have to wait federal prisons not having gift shops as such there was no modem included with the computer of course gillette could have gone online simply by building a modem out of devon franklins walkman bartered to gillette for some apricot preserves but he chose not to it was part of his deal with bishop besides all he wanted now was for the last year of his sentence to roll by and to get on with his life which isnt to say that he was completely quarantined from the net hed been allowed onto the librarys dogslow ibm pc to help with the analysis of shawn whose new foster home was stanford university gillette was working with the schools computer scientists and with tony mott frank bishop had emphatically denied motts request to be transferred to homicide and had placated the young cop by recommending that he be named acting head of the computer crimes unit which sacramento agreed to what gillette had found within shawn had astonished him to give phate access to as many computers as possible via trapdoor hed endowed his creation with its own operating system it was unique incorporating all existing operating systems windows msdos apple unix linux vms and a number of obscure systems for scientific and engineering applications his operating system which he called protean reminded gillette of the elusive unified theory that explains the behavior of all matter and energy in the universe only phate unlike einstein and his progeny had apparently succeeded in his quest one thing that shawn didnt disgorge was the source code to trapdoor or the location of any sites where it might be hidden the woman calling herself patricia nolan had it seemed been successful in isolating and stealing the code and destroying all other copies she hadnt been found either it used to be easy to disappear because there were no computers to trace you gillette had told bishop when learning this news now it was easy to disappear because computers can erase all the traces of your old identity and create brandnew ones bishop reported that stephen miller had been given a fulldress policemans funeral linda sanchez and tony mott were still apparently troubled that theyd believed miller was the traitor when in fact he was only a sad holdout from the elder days of computing a hasbeen on a futile search for the next big thing in silicon valley wyatt gillette could have told the cops though that they neednt have felt any guilt the blue nowhere tolerates deceit far more than it does incompetence the hacker had been given further dispensation to go online for another mission to look into the charges against david chambers the suspended head of the department of defenses criminal investigation division frank bishop captain bernstein and the us attorney had concluded that the mans personal and business computers had been hacked by phate to get chambers removed and to have kenyon or one of his lackeys appointed as his replacement to get gillette off the case it took the hacker only fifteen minutes to find and download proof that indeed the mans files had been cracked and brokerage trades and offshore accounts had been faked by phate the charges against him were dropped and he was reinstated no charges were ever brought against wyatt gillette for his standard hack or against frank bishop for helping gillette escape from the ccu the us attorney decided to drop the investigation not because he believed the story that it had been phate whod hacked together the cracking program that busted standard but because of a department of defense audit committee investigation looking into why million had been spent on an encryption program that was essentially unsecure gillette was also being asked to help track down a particularly dangerous computer virus known as polonius which had made its first appearance in the past week the virus was a demon that would make your computer go online by itself and transmit all of your past and current emails to everyone in your electronic address book not only did this create major internet traffic jams around the world but it resulted in a lot of embarrassment when people received emails not intended for their eyes several people attempted suicide when affairs cases of sexually transmitted diseases and shady business practices were revealed what was particularly frightening though was how the computers were infected aware that firewalls and virus shields will stop most viruses the perpetrator had cracked into the networks of commercial software manufacturers and instructed their diskmaking machines to insert the virus into the disks included in the software packages sold by retail stores and mailorder companies the feds were running the case and all they could determine was that the virus had originated from a university in singapore about two weeks before they had no other leads until one of the fbi agents on the case wondered aloud polonius thats the character from hamlet right gillette recalled something phate had told him hed dug up a copy of shakespeares plays and learned that yes it was polonius whod said to thine own self be true gillette had them check to find the time and date of the first occurrence of the virus it was late on the afternoon of the day that patricia nolan killed phate when her colleagues had called the first ftp site hed given her theyd unwittingly unleashed the polonius virus on the world a farewell present from phate the code was very elegant and proved to be extremely difficult to eradicate manufacturers would have to completely rewrite their disk manufacturing systems and users would have to wipe the entire contents of their hard drives and start over with virusfree programs remember that line valleyman thats advice from a wizard to thine own self be true on a tuesday in late april gillette was sitting at his laptop in his cell analyzing some of shawns operating system when the guard came to the door visitor gillette it would be bishop he guessed the detective was still working the marinkill case spending a lot of time north of napa where the suspects were reportedly hiding out theyd never been in santa clara county at all phate himself it seemed had sent most of the advisories about the killers to the press and to the police as more diversions bishop though stopped by san ho occasionally when he was in the area last time hed brought gillette some poptarts and some apricot preserves jennie had made from bishops own orchard not his favorite condiment but the jam made excellent prison currency this batch in fact had been traded for the walkman that could be turned into a modem but would not be well in all likelihood wouldnt be the visitor however wasnt frank bishop he sat down in the cubicle and watched elana papandolos walk into the room she was wearing a navy blue dress her dark wiry hair was pulled back it was so thick that the golden barrette holding it together seemed about to burst apart noticing her short nails perfectly filed and colored lavender he thought of something thatd never occurred to him that ellie a piano teacher made her way in the world with her hands too just as he had done yet her fingers were beautiful and unblemished by even a hint of callus she sat down scooted the chair forward youre still here he said lowering his head slightly to speak through the holes in the plexiglas i never heard from you i assumed youd left a couple of weeks ago she said nothing in response looked at the divider they added that the last time shed been to visit him several years ago theyd sat at a table without a divider a guard hovering over them with the new system there was no guard you gained privacy but you lost proximity he would rather have had her close gillette decided remembering during her visits how hed loved to brush fingertips with her or press his shoe against the side of her foot the contact producing an electric frisson that was akin to making love gillette now found as he sat forward that he was airkeying furiously he stopped and slipped his hands into his pockets he asked did you talk to somebody about the modem elana nodded i found a lawyer she doesnt know if itll sell or not but if it does the way im handling it is ill pay myself back for your lawyers bill and my half of the house we lost the rest is yours no i want you to have she interrupted him by saying i postponed my plans to go to new york he was silent processing this finally he asked her for how long im not sure what about ed she glanced behind her hes outside this stung gillettes heart nice of him to chauffeur her to see her ex the hacker thought bitterly inflamed by jealousy so whyd you come he asked ive been thinking about you about what you said to me the other day before the police showed up he nodded for her to continue would you give up machines for me she asked gillette took a breath he exhaled and then answered evenly no id never do that machines are what im meant to do in life to thine own self be true he expected her to stand up and walk out it would have killed a portion of him maybe most of him but hed vowed that if he had a chance to talk to her again hed never lie he added but i can promise you that theyll never come between us the way they did never again elana nodded slowly i dont know wyatt i dont know if i can trust you my dad drinks a bottle of ouzo a night he keeps swearing hes going to give up drinking and he does about six times a year youll have to take a chance he said that mightve been the wrong thing to say but its the honest thing reassurances gillette i need reassurances before i even begin to think about it gillette didnt respond he couldnt present her with much compelling evidence that hed change here he was in prison having nearly gotten this woman and her family killed because of his passion for a world completely alien to the one that she inhabited and understood after a moment he said theres nothing more i can say except that i love you and i want to be with you have a family with you ill be in town for a while at least she said slowly why dont we just see what happens what about ed whats he going to say why dont you ask him me gillette asked alarmed elana rose and walked to the door what on earth was he going to say gillette wondered in panic he was about to come facetoface with the man whod stolen his wifes heart she opened the door and gestured a moment later elanas staunch unsmiling mother walked into the room she was leading a small boy about eighteen months old by the hand jesus lord gillette was shocked elana and ed had a baby his exwife sat down in the chair once again and hauled the youngster up on her lap thiss ed gillette whispered him thats right but you assumed ed was my boyfriend but hes my son actually i should say hes our son i named him after you your middle name edward isnt a hackers name ours he whispered she nodded gillette thought back to the last few nights theyd been together before hed surrendered to the prison authorities to start his sentence lying in bed with her pulling her close he closed his eyes lord lord lord he remembered the surveillance at elanas house in sunnyvale the night he escaped from ccu hed assumed that the children the police saw were her sisters but one of them must have been this boy i saw your emails when you talk about ed it doesnt exactly sound like hes perfect husband material he gave a faint laugh you never told me i was so mad at you i didnt want you to know ever but you dont feel that way now im not sure he gazed at the boys thick curly black hair that was his mothers hed gotten her beautiful dark eyes and round face too hold him up would you she helped her son stand on her lap his quick eyes studied gillette carefully then the boy became aware of the plexiglas he reached forward with his fat baby fingers and touched it smiling fascinated trying to understand how he could see through it but not be able to touch something on the other side hes curious gillette thought thats what he got from me then a guard appeared and announced that visiting hours were over and elana eased the boy to the floor and stood her mother took the childs hand and ed and his grandmother walked out of the room elana and gillette faced each other across the plexiglas divide well see how it goes she said hows that thats all im asking she nodded then they turned in separate directions and as elana disappeared out the visitors door the guard led wyatt gillette back into the dim corridor toward his cell where his machine awaited authors note in writing this book ive taken some significant liberties with the structure and operation of federal and california state law enforcement agencies i wish i could say the same for my depiction of computer hackers ability to invade our private lives but ive got bad news it happens with alarming frequency some of the computer specialists i spoke with felt that a program like trapdoor probably couldnt be written at this time but im not completely convinced upon hearing their opinions i couldnt help but think of the senior researcher for one of the worlds biggest computer companies who in the s recommended that his company stick with vacuum tubes because there was no future for the microchip and of the head of another international hardware and software manufacturer who stated in the s that thered never be a market for a personal computer for the moment we can assume that a trapdoorlike program doesnt exist probably and oh yes the chapter numbers are in binary form dont feel bad i had to look them up too acknowledgements as ones career in this business lengthens so does the list of those for whom a novelist feels undying gratitude for their
