stephen r lawhead tuck king raven prologue wintan cestre saint swithuns day king william stood scratching the back of his hand and watched as another bag of gold was emptied into the ironclad chest one hundred solid gold byzants that added to fifty pounds in silver and another fifty in letters of promise to be paid upon collection of his tribute from normandie brought the total to five hundred marks more money than god muttered william under his breath what do they do with it all sire asked one of the clerks of the justiciars office glancing up from the wax tablet on which he kept a running tally nothing grumbled the king parting with money always made him itch and this time there was no relief in vain he scratched the other hand are we finished here having counted the money the clerks began locking and sealing the strongbox the king shook his head at the sight of all that gold and silver disappearing from sight these blasted monks will bleed me dry he thought a kingdom was a voracious beast that devoured money and was never ever satisfied it took money for soldiers money for horses and weapons money for fortresses money for supplies to feed the troops and as now even more money to wipe away the sins of war the gold and silver in the chest was for the abbey at wintan cestre to pay the monks so that his father would not have to spend eternity in purgatory or worse frying in hell all is in order majesty said the clerk shall we proceed william gave a curt nod two knights of the kings bodyguard stepped forward took up the box and carried it from the room and out into the yard where the monks of saint swithuns were already gathered and waiting for the ceremony to begin the king a most reluctant participant followed in the yard of the red palacethe name given to the kings sprawling lodge outside the city wallsa silken canopy on silver poles had been erected beneath the canopy stood bishop walkelin with his hands pressed together in an attitude of patient prayer behind the bishop stood a monk bearing the gilded cross of their namesake saint while all around them knelt monks and acolytes chanting psalms and hymns the king and his attendantshis two favourite earls a canon and a bevy of assorted clerks scribes courtiers and officials both sacred and secularmarched out to meet the bishop the company paused while the kings chair was brought and set up beneath the canopy where bishop walkelin knelt in the holy name intoned the bishop when william rufus had taken his place in the chair all blessing and honour be upon you and upon your house and upon your descendants and upon the people of your realm yes yes of course said william irritably get on with it god save you sire replied walkelin on this holy day we have come to receive the beneficium ecclesiasticus sanctus swithinius as is our right under the grant of privilege created and bestowed by your father king william for the establishment and maintenance of an office of penitence perpetual prayer and the pardon of sins so you say remarked the king bishop walkelin bowed again and summoned two of his monks to receive the heavy strongbox from the kings men in what had become an annual event of increasing ceremony in honour of saint swithun on whose day the monks determined to suck the lifeblood from the crown and william rufus resented it but what could he do the payment was for the prayers of the monks for the remission of sins on the part of william conqueror prayers which brought about the muchneeded cleansing of his besmirched soul for each and every man that william had killed in battle the king could expect to spend a specified amount of time in purgatory eleven years for a lord or knight seven years for a manatarms five for a commoner and one for a serf by means of some obscure and complicated formula william had never understood the monks determined a monetary amount which somehow accorded to the number of days a monk spent on his knees praying as william had been a very great war leader his purgatorial obligation amounted to well over a thousand yearsand that was only counting the fatalities of the landed nobility no one knew the number of commoners and serfs he had killed either directly or indirectly in his lifetimebut the number was thought to be quite high still a wealthy king with dutiful heirs need not actually spend so much time in purgatoryso long as there were monks willing to ease the burden of his debt through prayer all it took was money thus the benefice of saint swithun necessary though it might be was a burden the conquerors son had grown to loathe with a passion that he himself would have need of this selfsame service was a fact that he could neither deny nor escape and while he told himself that paying monks to pray souls from hell was a luxury he could ill afford deep in his heart of hearts he knew only too well thatowing to the debauched life he ledit was also a necessity he could ill afford to neglect much longer even so paying over good silver for the ongoing service of a passel of mumbling clerics rubbed rufus rawespecially as that silver became each year more difficult to find his taxes already crushed the poor and had caused at least two riots and a rebellion by his noblemen little wonder then that the forever needy king dreaded the annual approach of saint swithuns day and the parting with so much of his precious treasury the ceremony rumbled on to its conclusion and following an especially longwinded prayer adjourned to a feast in honour of the worthy saint the feast was the sole redeeming feature of the entire day that it must be spent in the company of churchmen dampened williams enthusiasm somewhat but did not destroy it altogether the red king had surrounded himself with enough of his willing courtiers and sycophants to ensure a rousing good time no matter how many disapproving monks he fed at his table this year the revel reached such a height of dissipation that bishop walkelin quailed and excused himself claiming that he had pressing business that required his attention back at the cathedral william forcing himself to be gracious wished the churchmen well and offered to send a company of soldiers to accompany the monks back to the abbey with their money lest they fall among thieves walkelin agreed to the proposal and as he bestowed his blessing leaned close to the king and said we must talk one day soon about establishing a benefice of your own your majesty he paused and then like the flick of a knife warned death comes for us all and none of us knows the day or time i would be remiss if i did not offer to draw up a grant for you we will discuss that said william when the price is seen to fall rather than forever rise you will have heard it said replied walkelin that where great sin abounds great mercy must intercede the continual observance and maintenance of that intercession is very expensive my lord king so is the keeping of a bishop answered william tartly and bishops have been known to lose their bishoprics he paused regarding the cleric over the rim of his cup heaven forbid that should happen i know i would be heartily sorry to see you go walkelin if my lord is displeased with his servant began the bishop he has only to something to consider eh bishop walkelin tried to adopt a philosophical air i am reminded that your father always no need to speak of it any more just now said william smoothly only think about what i have said you may be sure answered walkelin he bowed stiffly and took a slow step backwards your servant my lord the clerics departed leaving the king and his courtiers to their revel but the feast was ruined for william try as he might he could not work himself into a festive humour because the bishops rat of a thought had begun to gnaw at the back of his mind his time was running out to die without arranging for the necessary prayers would doom his soul to the lake of everlasting fire however loudly he might rail against the expenseand condemn the greedy clerics who held his future for ransomwas he really prepared to test the alternative at the forfeit of his soul part one come listen a while you gentlefolk alle that stand this bower within a tale of noble rhiban the hud i purpose now to begin young rhiban was a princeling fayre and a gladsome heart had he delight took he in games and tricks and guiling his fair ladye a bonny fine maide of noble degree merian called by name this beauty soote was praised of alle men for she was a gallant dame rhiban stole through the greenwoode one night to kiss his dear merian late but she boxed his head till his nose turnd red and orderd him home full straight though rhiban indeed speeded home fayrlie rathe that night he did not see his bed for in flames of fire from the rooftops eaves he saw all his kinsmen lay dead ay the sheriff s low men had visited there when the household was slumbering deepe and from room to room they had quietly crept and murthered them all in their sleepe rhiban cried out weylawey but those fiends still lingered close by so into the greenwoode he quickly slipt for they had heard his cry rhiban gave the hunters goode sport full lange a swift chase he led but a spearman threw his shot full well and he fell as one that is dead chapter tuck shook the dust of caer wintan off his feet and prepared for the long walk back to the forest it was a fine warm day and all too soon the friar was sweltering in his heavy robe he paused now and then to wipe the sweat from his face falling farther and farther behind his travelling companions these legs of mine are sturdy stumps he sighed to himself but fast they ent he had just stopped to catch his breath a little when on sudden impulse he spun around quickly and caught a glimpse of movement on the road behinda blur in the shimmering distance and then gone so quick he might have imagined it only it was not the first time since leaving the royal lodge that tuck had entertained the queer feeling that someone or something was following them he had it again now and decided to alert the others and let them make of it what they would squinting into the distance he saw bran far ahead of the grellon striding steadily shoulders hunched against the sun and the gross injustice so lately suffered at the hands of the king in whom he had trusted the main body of travellers unable to keep up with their lord was becoming an everlengthening line as heat and distance mounted they trudged along in small clumps of two or three heads down talking in low sombre voices how like sheep thought tuck following their impetuous and headstrong shepherd a more melancholy man might himself have succumbed to the oppressive gloom hanging low over the cymry dragging at their feet pressing their spirits low though summer still blazed in meadow field and flower it seemed to tuck that they all walked in winters drear and dismal shadows rhi bran and his grellon had marched into caer wintan full of hopethey had come singing had they noteager to stand before king william to receive the judgement and reward that had been promised in rouen all those months ago now here they were slinking back to the greenwood in doleful silence mourning the bright hope that had been crushed and lost no not lost they would never let it out of their grasp not for an instant it had been stolensnatched away by the same hand that had offered it in the first place the grasping deceitful hand of a most perfidious king tuck felt no less wounded than the next man but when he considered how bran and the others had risked their lives to bring red william word of the conspiracy against him it fair made his priestly blood boil the king had promised justice the grellon had every right to expect that elfaels lawful king would be restored instead william had merely banished baron de braose and his milksop nephew count falkes sending them back to france to live in luxury on the barons extensive estates elfael that small bone of contention had instead become property of the crown and placed under the protection of abbot hugo and sheriff de glanville well that was putting wolves in charge of the fold was it not where was the justice a throne for a throne bran had declared that day in rouen williams had been savedat considerable cost and risk to the cymrybut where was brans throne struth thought tuck wait upon a norman to do the right thing and youll be waiting until your hair grows white and your teeth fall out how long o lord how long must your servants suffer he muttered and lord does it have to be so blasted hot he paused to wipe the sweat from his face running a hand over his round saxon head he felt the suns fiery heat on the bare spot of his tonsure sweat ran in rivulets down the sides of his neck and dripped from his jowls drawing a deep breath he tightened his belt hitched up the skirts of his robe and started off again with quickened steps soon his shoes were slapping up the dust around his ankles and he began to overtake the rearmost members of the group thirty souls in all women and children included for bran had determined that his entire forest clansave for those left behind to guard the settlement and a few others for whom the long journey on foot would have been far too arduousshould be seen by the king to share in the glad day the friar picked up his pace and soon drew even with siarles slim as a willow wand but hard and knotty as an old hickory root the forester walked with his eyes downcast chin outthrust his mouth a tight grim line every line of him bristled with fury like a riled porcupine tuck knew to leave well enough alone and hurried on without speaking next he passed will scatlockeor scarlet as he preferred the craggy forester limped along slightly as he carried his newly acquired daughter nia against every expectation will had endured a spear wound the abbots prison and the threat of the sheriff s rope and survived his pretty darkeyed wife noin walked resolutely beside him the pair had made a good match and it tore at his heart that the newly married couple should have to endure a dark hovel in the forest when the entire realm begged for just such a family to settle and sink solid roots deep into the landanother small outrage to be added to the evergrowing mountain of injustices weighing on elfael a few more steps brought him up even with odo the norman monk who had befriended will scarlet in prison at scarlets bidding the young scribe had abandoned abbot hugo to join them odo walked with his head down his whole body droopingwhether with heat or the awful realization of what he had done tuck could not tell a few steps more and he came up even with iwanthe great hulking warrior would crawl on hands and knees through fire for his lord it was from iwan that the friar had received his current christening when the effort of wrapping his untrained tongue around the simple saxon name aethelfrith proved beyond him fat little bag of vittles that he is i will call him tuck the champion had said friar tuck to you boyo the priest had responded and the name had stuck god bless you little john thought tuck and keep your arm strong and your heart stronger next to iwan strode merian just as fierce in her devotion to bran as the champion beside her oh but shrewd with it she was smarter than the others and more cunningwhich always came as something of a shock to anyone who did not know better because one rarely expected it from a lady so fair of face and form but the impression of innocence beguiled in the time tuck had come to know her she had shown herself to be every inch as canny and capable as any monarch who ever claimed an english crown merian held lightly to the bridle strap of the horse that carried their wise hudolion who was so far as tuck could tell surely the last banfaith of britain angharad ancient and ageless there was no telling how old she was yet despite her age whatever it might be she sat her saddle smartly and with the ease of a practiced rider her quick dark eyes were trained on the road ahead but tuck could tell that her sight was turned inward her mind wrapped in a veil of deepest thought her wrinkled face might have been carved of dark welsh slate for all it revealed of her contemplations merian glanced around as the priest passed and called out but the friar had bran in his eye and he hurried on until he was within hailing distance my lord wait he shouted i must speak to you bran gave no sign that he had heard he strode on eyes fixed on the road and distance ahead for the love of jesu bran wait for me bran took two more steps and then halted abruptly he straightened and turned his face a smouldering scowl dark eyes darker still under lowered brows his shock of black hair seemed to rise in feathered spikes thank the good lord gasped the friar scrambling up the dry rutted track i thought id never catch you we there is something he gulped down air wiped his face and shook the sweat from his hand into the dust of the road well demanded bran impatiently i think we must get off this road tuck said dabbing at his face with the sleeve of his robe truly as i think on it now i like not the look that abbot hugo gave me when we left the kings yard i fear he may try something nasty bran lifted his chin the jagged scar on his cheek livid now twisted his lip into a sneer within sight of the kings house he scoffed his voice tight he wouldnt dare would he not dare what said iwan striding up siarles came toiling along in the big mans wake our friar here replied bran thinks we should abandon the road he thinks abbot hugo is bent on making trouble iwan glanced back the way they had come oh aye agreed iwan that would be his way to tuck he said have you seen anything whats this then inquired siarles as he joined the group why have you stopped tuck thinks the abbot is on our tail iwan explained i maybe saw something back there and not for the first time tuck explained i dont say it for a certainty but i think someone is following us it makes sense siarles looked to the frowning bran what do you reckon i reckon i am surrounded by a covey of quail frightened of their own shadows bran replied we move on he turned to go but iwan spoke up my lord look around you there is little enough cover hereabouts if we were to be taken by surprise the slaughter would be over before we could put shaft to string merian joined them then having heard a little of what had passed the little ones are growing weary she pointed out they cannot continue on this way much longer without rest and water we will have to stop soon in any event why not do as tuck suggests and leave the road nowjust to be safe so be it bran said relenting at last he glanced around and then pointed to a grove of oak and beech rising atop the next hill up the road we will make for that wood iwanyou and siarles pass the word along then take up the rear guard he turned to tuck and said you and merian stay here and keep everyone moving tell them they can rest as soon as they reach the grove but not before he turned on his heel and started off again iwan stood looking after his lord and friend its the vile kings treachery he observed thats put the black dog on his back no mistake siarles as always took a different tone thats as may be but theres no need to bite off our heads we ent the ones who cheated him out of his throne he paused and spat stupid bloody king and stupid bloody cardinal all high and mighty continued iwan priest of the church my arse give me a good sharp blade and id soon have him saying prayers he never said before he cast a hasty glance at tuck sorry friar id do the same tuck said now off you go if i am right we must get these people to safety and that fast the two ran back down the line urging everyone to make haste for the wood on the next hill follow bran they shouted pick up your feet we are in danger here hurry there is safety in the wood merian assured them as they passed and tuck did likewise follow bran hell lead you to shelter it took a little time for the urgency of their cries to sink in but soon the forestdwellers were moving at a quicker pace up to the wood at the top of the next rise the first to arrive found bran waiting at the edge of the grove beneath a large oak tree his strung bow across his shoulder keep moving he told them youll find a hollow just beyond that fallen tree he pointed through the wood hide yourselves and wait for the others there the first travellers had reached the shelter of the trees and tuck was urging another group to speed and showing them where to go when he heard someone shouting up from the valley he could not make out the words but as he gazed around the sound came again and he saw iwan furiously gesturing towards the far hilltop he looked where the big man was pointing and saw two mounted knights poised on the crest of the hill the soldiers were watching the fleeing procession and for the moment seemed content to observe then one of the knights wheeled his mount and disappeared back down the far side of the hill bran had seen it too and began shouting run he cried racing down the road to the grove he told merian and tuck the ffreinc are going to attack he flew to meet iwan and siarles at the bottom of the hill id best go see if i can help tuck said and leaving merian to hurry the people along he fell into step behind bran just the two of them bran asked as he came running to meet siarles and iwan so far replied the champion no doubt the ones gone to alert the rest siarles and i will take a stand here he said bending the long ashwood bow to string it that will give you and tuck time to get the rest of the folk safely hidden in the woods bran shook his head it may come to that one day but not today his tone allowed no dissent we have a little time yet get everyone into the woodcarry them if you have to well dig ourselves into the grove and make gysburne and his hounds come in after us i make it six bows against thirty knights siarles pointed out good odds that bran gave a quick jerk of his chin good as any he agreed fetch along the stragglers and follow me iwan and siarles darted away and were soon rushing the last of the lagging grellon up the hill to the grove what do you want me to do tuck shouted pray answered bran pulling an arrow from the sheaf at his belt and fitting it to the string pray god our aim is true and each arrow finds its mark bran moved off calling for the straggling grellon to find shelter in the wood tuck watched him go pray he thought aye to be surethe good lord will hear from me but i will do more will i not then he scuttled up the hill and into the wood in search of a good stout stick to break some heads chapter swift and furtive as wild things the women and children disappeared into the deepshadowed grove bran called all the men together at the edge of the wood we have six bows he said iwan siarles tomas rhoddi he paused eyeing the men gathered around him assessing their abilities his gaze lit on one of the eager young men who had joined the grellon following the loss of his familys home to the ffreinc you owain will join me i want a guard with each bowman to watch his back and retrieve any arrows that fall within easy reach so now archers and guards come with me the rest of you go with tuck and help protect the others if any of the ffreinc get in behind us bran told him youll have your hands full right enough tuck will tell you what to do as bran turned to lead his small group of archers to their places at the edge of the grove a hand reached out and halted him lend me a bow i can draw we want to fight too said one of the men speaking up bran turned and shook his head i know willwhen youre healed and practiced even crippled as i am id wager i can still draw better than anyone heresaving only yourself my lord no doubt bran allowed placing a hand on the mans shoulder but let be today will brans eyes slid past will to noin and nia and the young roundshouldered wheyfaced ffreinc monk hovering a few steps away look after your family and your friend hereand take care of angharad see that none of them come to harm that will be help enough bran hurried away to join the archers and will turned to the worried young monk behind him come along odo he said follow noin and help her see to the old woman and her horse and look sharp unless you want abbot hugo to get his hands on you again they hurried to join the others in the hollow and tuck gathered the rest this way he called and led his crew of seven unarmed warriors to a small glade midway between the archers and the hollow where the rest of the grellon had found their hiding places we will stand here he told them then raising his stubby oak branch lengthwise he held it high saying get one of these to hand quick as you can and hurry back well make ourselves scarce behind the trees there and therehe pointed out the nearby boles of massive oaksand over there if any ffreinc get past bran and the others well do for em the last words were still hanging in the air when there came a cry from the edge of the wood where bran and the bowmen were waiting as the shout echoed through the grove they heard the fizzing whir of an arrow as it sped from the string almost instantly there followed a short sharp scream and a crash a heartbeat later a riderless horse careered into the wood bless me remarked tuck turning to his company he said get some wood in your hands lads and make a good account of yourselves go as the forestdwellers scattered two knights burst into the grove in full gallop one of them had an arrow sticking out of his shield and the other had a shaft buried deep in his thigh both turned their horses and prepared to attack the archers from behind but even as the great steeds slowed and came around the soldiers seemed to crumple upon themselves their weapons fell from slack hands and both plunged from the saddle with arrows jutting from their backs like feathered quills tuck heard a call from beyond the grove and suddenly the attack was finished they waited a few moments and when no other riders appeared the grellon darted out to retrieve the arrows pulling them from the dead knights here said tuck gathering the shafts ill take those the rest of you get back out of sight the friar quickly made his way to the edge of the grove where the archers were hidden amongst the trees he hurried to the first one he saw siarles he called softly whats happened have we turned them away no brother replied the forester theyre down the valley he pointed down the slope where a body of knights was milling about on horseback theyre just regrouping theyll charge again when they get their courage banked up he cast a glance behind him into the grove the two that broke throughwhat of them dead i think or as good as he handed over the retrieved arrows that makes three then said siarles sticking the shafts in the soft earth at his feet god with you tuck said and with your bow he made a hasty sign of the cross and hurried back to his place behind the tree to await the next attack in a little while he heard the hard drumming of horses hooves the sound grew and when it seemed the riders must be on top of them he heard the thin singing whine of arrows streaking to their marksfollowed by the awful clatter of horses and heavily armoured men crashing to earth the second attack faltered and broke off as quickly as the first and for a moment all was quiet in the grove again save for the agonized whinny of a dying horse again tuck waited a little space and when nothing else seemed about to happen out he crept and ran to speak to siarles is that the last of them maybe siarles gestured with his bow toward the valley theyve gone away again but i cant see what theyre up to this time pray theyve had enough and decided to go home and lick their wounds tuck peered around the trunk of the tree to the near hillside taking in the corpses of four more horses and men lying in the grass but for the arrows sticking out of their bodies they might have been napping in the sun the guards of the archers were already at work pulling arrows from the bodies looks like theyve gone the friar concluded just to be sure you and yours best stay hid until bran says its safe to come out the friar returned to his crew of defenders to find that they had stripped the weapons from the fallen knights one of the grellon offered him a sword thanks but no he replied you keep it im at my best with a staff in my hand i wouldnt know what to do with an awkward long blade like that now get back to your places and stay alert the third attack was long in coming but when it came the ffreinc struck as before charging straight for the groveand as before the arrows sang and horses screamed but this time three knights succeeded in getting past the archers arrows sprouting from shield and hauberk they pounded into the grove swivelling this way and that looking for something to slash with their swords the ffreinc charge carried them past the tree where tuck was hiding gripping his branch he lunged out as the nearest horse passed thrusting the sturdy length of oak in amongst its churning hooves the resulting jolt nearly yanked his arm from his shoulder the makeshift staff was torn from his grip and went spinning across the ground but his aim succeeded for the horse stumbled to its knees pitching its rider over its broad neck as it went down the knight landed with a grunt on the soft earth arms flailing weapons scattering tuck ran for his staff and snatched it up the unhorsed knight made to rise but the stalwart priest gave him a sharp rap on the back of the skull which sent his potshaped metal hat rolling a second tap put him to sleep two of the grellon were on the unconscious knight instantly they rolled him over one relieved the soldier of his sword and belt and the other took his dagger and shield they pulled his mail shirt up over his head and tied it there then quickfooted it back to the shelter of the trees god have mercy breathed tuck and looked around to see what had become of the other two knights one had quit his saddle owing to the wounds he had received and was lying on his side on the ground wheezing like a broken bellows the other was in the grip of three cymry who were taking turns bashing him with their clubs while he slashed wildly with his sword the nimble welshmen dodged the strokes and succeeded in hauling the knight from the saddle while one of the cymry seized the reins of the horse the other two pounded the enemy into dazed submission one of them wrested his sword from an unresisting hand and with a swift downward stroke dispatched the ffreinc with it three more knights appearedcharging in hard from the wood to the right their sudden appearance so surprised the grellon that they were thrown into a momentary confusion but as the foremost knight passed beneath the lowhanging branch of an oak one of the grellon dropped onto the rear of the horse as it passed beneath him throwing his arms around the soldiers neck the forestdweller hurled himself from the horse dragging his enemy with him the horse careened on and as the knight squirmed in the grasp of the welshman two more of the grellon rushed to help subdue the armoured soldier before the two remaining knights could rally to the aid of their fallen comrade they too were under assault by screaming swordwielding cymry more horses were crashing through the woodthey had circled around and were attacking through the grove tuck cursing the duplicity of the norman race ran to find bran rhi bran he shouted making for the edge of the grove rhi bran here tuck came the reply and bran appeared from behind a tree a few hundred paces away over here the priest scrambled to him fast as he could his short legs stumbling over the uneven ground were attacked he shouted pointing with his staff theyve come round to take us from behind the devils shouted bran already running to head off the assault iwan siarles to me the rest of you stay where you are and keep them busy make every arrow count the three archers reached the glade to find five mounted knights in a deadly clash with four grellon the knights were stabbing with spears and slashing with swords and the cymry danced just out of reach darting in quickly to deliver clout after clout with their makeshift staffs iwanthe two on the left ordered bran nocking an arrow to the string siarlesthe one on the right ill take the two in the centre he grasped the string in his twofingered grip pressing the belly of the longbow forward until it bent full and round now the word was hardly spoken when it was overtaken by a buzzing whine as brans arrow streaked across the shadowdappled distance before it had reached its mark two more arrows were sizzling through the air there was a sound like cloth ripping in the wind and the knight in the centre of the swarm was thrown back over the cantle of his saddle and off the rear of his mount two more knights followed the first to the ground and as the two remaining ffreinc soldiers swerved to meet this new threat they were set upon by the cymry who pulled them down from their horses and slew them with their own weapons more knights were pounding into the glade now charging in force they came crashing through the underbrush in twos and threes tuck held his breath and tightened his grip on his staff it seemed that bran and the others must surely be overwhelmed but the three bows sang as one sending flight after flight of arrows streaking through the glade horses screamed and reared throwing their riders who were then set upon by the grellon other soldiers pierced by multiple shafts simply dropped from the saddle dead before they reached the ground four knights just coming into the grove were met by three others fleeing the slaughter the four newcomers glimpsed the carnage then wheeled their mounts and joined their comrades in quick retreat get the weapons shouted bran already racing back to rejoin those at the front line iwan stay here and give a shout if any come back but the ffreinc did not return to the attack one long moment passed and then another no more knights entered the glade from behind and none dared challenge the archers on the front line again the lowering sun deepened the shadows in the grove and began to fill up the valleys and still the attack did not come the grellon watched and waited and asked themselves if they had beaten the enemy back finally when it appeared the assault had foundered tuck joined iwan and the two ran to find bran at the edge of the grove what do you reckon my lord asked iwan have we turned them aside so it would appear bran concluded i dearly hope so sighed tuck all this rushing about is hard on an old fat man like me but they may be waiting for us to show ourselves bran suggested or for nightfall iwan said so they can take us under cover of darkness either way said bran making up his mind they will not find us here get everyone up and ready to move on the grellon assembled once more and like ghosts drifting away on the vapours of night faded silently into the depths of the wood the men had stripped the weapons from the enemy soldiersswords and lances mostly but also daggers helmets belts and shields arrows were retrieved and three uninjured horses led away leaving the heavy saddles and tack behind by the time the setting sun had turned the sky the colour of burnished bronze the grove was abandoned to the dead who lay still and quiet in the soft green grass may god have mercy on their vile and wretched souls tuck whispered hastening away and grant them the peace they have denied to others thinking better of this crabbed prayer he added welcome them into your eternal kingdombut not for my sake good lord nobut for the sake of your own dear son who always remembered to forgive his enemies amen chapter hereford baron bernard neufmarche unexpectedly found himself in complete agreement with lady agnes who was determined to make the wedding of her daughter sybil splendid in every way possible much to his amazement and delightfor the baron had long ago resigned himself to a wife he considered little more than a frail ghost of a womanthe baroness was now a creature transformed gone were the headaches vapours and peculiar lingering maladies she had endured since coming to britain she was energetic and enthusiastic tireless in her work at organizing the wedding major military campaigns received less attention in his experience what is more the tooslender agnes had gained weight her previously skeletal figure had begun filling out to a more robust shape and a wholesome glow of ruddy good health had replaced her customary sickly pallor this change in the woman he had known fully half his life was as surprising as it was welcome he had never before seen anyone altered so utterly and he revelled in it indeed the renewal of his wife affected him far more deeply than he could have imagined his own outlook had altered as well something like gratitude had come over him he looked at the world around him with a warm and pleasant feeling of contentment for the first time in a very long time he was happy for all this and more he had his welsh minions to thank on reflection the baron thought he knew almost to the precise moment when the changeno the transformationof agnes began it was in the churchyard of the little welsh church where they had laid to rest the body of his vassal king cadwgan of eiwas something had touched his wife at the funeral and when the three days of observance drew to a close the rebirth had begun perhaps nowhere was the change more evident than in her view of the welsh themselves where before lady agnes had considered them subhuman savages a nation of brutish barbarians at best now she viewed them more as unfortunates as children who had survived an infancy of deprivation and neglectwhich she was now intent on redressing sybils wedding was just the beginning once she and prince garranno the young man was king now it must be rememberedonce the two young people were married lady agnes planned nothing less than the rehabilitation of the entire realm and all its people they only want a town or two and markets agnes had informed him a few weeks ago some proper churchesgood stone mindand a monastery of course yes and a better road then farms would flourish i do believe it would be one of the finest cantrefs in the land they are cattle herders mostly the baron had pointed out as he skimmed through a list of provisions he was amassing for the wedding that i suspect is because they know little else she concluded we shall show them how to husband the land teach them to farm bien sur she replied lightly why not then they will have things to trade in the markets with the money that brings they can begin making something of themselves in agness view the pitiful welsh holdings were to be built up and made productive the wasteland tilled and the wildwood managedas in her fathers prosperous estates in normandie with the considerable aid and support of the neufmarche nobility eiwas would become a dazzling jewel a bright and shining star leading all of wales into a glorious new day of abundance and prosperity this was in the future thank heavenjust thinking about the work involved made the baron tired nevertheless he had to admit that he liked this new industrious spirited farthinking wife much better than the frail sharptongued sickly old one and truth be told her plans for the cantref were not so very different from his own now that she was of similar mind accomplishing his will in eiwas and establishing himself more firmly in wales would be that much easier yes forging a lasting alliance through the marriage of his daughter to a welsh king was a match that made good sense in more ways than one for his part bernard had assembled all the necessary supplies for a feast the like of which he was sure no one beyond the march had ever seen it was his intention that the occasion should be spoken of in awed tones by his welsh vassals for years to come he wanted to cow them with a spectacle of such stunning opulence that they would fight one another to be next in line to receive such largess from his hand there was also the matter of a house after all as the doting father of the bride he could not allow his precious daughter to live in the tumbledown wooden fortress that was caer rhodl she would have a proper house of stone with solid stone walls to keep her and his grandchildrenwhen they came alongsafe from the buffeting winds of war and strife not that he expected trouble since his defeat of king rhys ap tewdwr in the lightning conquest of deheubarth things were much more peaceful in the region he was he felt succeeding in winning over the inhabitants of that southern cantref just as he had won over the people of eiwas still in wales one never knew what to expect it was better to be ready for whatever martial crisis might arisenot to mention the fact that it would eventually become a convenient base from which to extend his power deeper into wales to that end he had his master builder draw up plans for a castle with stout ramparts a high donjon garrison stables flagstone yard and surrounding all a steepsided moat the house and its castle would be his wedding gift to the couple king garran proud welshman that he was would no doubt have rejected outright the suggestion that his stronghold was inadequate in any aspect but if the fortress came as a wedding gift for himself and his new bridewell the young king could hardly refuse it baron neufmarche would have his way in the end thus as the days drew down toward the celebration the baron put the finishing touches on his elaborate preparations and on a bright summer day he and the baroness and their daughter broke fast on a bit of bread and watered wine and then walked out into the yard where a covered carriage drawn by two chestnut horses awaited as the ladies were helped up into the carriage the baron issued final instructions to the servants who were staying behind then climbed into the carriage himself they proceeded out through the castle gate and down into the town and out onto the kings road at the edge of hereford they were met by a bodyguard of twenty knights and menatarms accompanied by nine wagons piled high with provisions dishes and utensils clothes and personal belongings and four wagons filled with cooks kitchen helpers musicians and sundry servants all under the supervision of remey the barons aged seneschal god with you sire said the barons masteratarms god with you marshal orval returned the baron is all well this morning all is well and in order and awaiting your command replied the marshal making a small bow from the saddle if you will give the order we will be on our way the baron glanced at the double rank of knights arrayed at the edge of the field beside the road is this all you have mustered wondered the baron i thought there would be more indeed sire yes replied marshal orval there are as many more as you see here i thought best to send the others on ahead to make certain the way is clear we should encounter no trouble on the way very good marshal agreed neufmarche satisfied at last then you may give the signal and move out we have a wedding to attend with this last he reached over and gave his daughters hand a squeeze for her part the young lady was suitably demure beneath a cap of pale blue silk with a veil that rested lightly over her long dark hair in her lap she carried a posy of tiny white flowers bound in a bit of green cloth she smiled at her father as the carriage lurched into motion and said you have gone to far too much troubleas i feared you might nonsense replied the baron only what was necessarynothing more nine wagonsnecessary she laughed not at all put out by her fathers extravagance im not marrying the entire realm au contraire cheri but you are insisted bernard you will be queen and ruler of the realmthe woman all your male subjects will admire and all female subjects emulate your father is right offered the baroness a future queen cannot be seen to hold herself too low or she will lose the respect of those who must live beneath her rule nor would we care to be thought closefisted on such an important occasion continued the baron we must by all means demonstrate the prosperity we intend to cultivate in the realm the people must see what it is that we intend for them not all the people surely said sybil in mild derision i doubt i will have any dealings with the serfs do you not think so replied her mother each and every one of your vassals will benefit from your ruleserfs as well as nobility you must not allow yourself to become distant from those you rule this is something that happens far too often in france and i do not think it altogether a good thing this last pronouncement surprised the baron into silence coming from a bishop or cardinal such a sentiment would not seem out of place but thisfrom the lips of a woman who after fourteen years still did not know the names of the cook or any of the kitchen servants and had yet to meet the porter stabler and groomsit fair took his breath away lady agnes turned to him ce nest pas mon mari she inquired with a lift of her eyebrow it took him a moment to realize she was speaking to him oh indeed indeed yes he agreed hurriedly sadly it is much the way of things in france but we have the opportunity to do better now he smiled at the grave expression on his daughters face but do not worry mon coeur it will soon be second nature to you he glanced from his daughter to his wife and added why youll be surprised at how naturally it grows and you will have your handmaids and servants to helpas well as a seneschal agnes continued a good seneschal is worth his weight in goldand we shall make it a matter of some urgency to find one who knows what hes about your grandfather will have some ideas i think i will write to him and ask him to send two or three and you can choose the one that suits you best a welsh seneschal would be better surely ventured sybil because of the language tch her mother countered that would never do you would soon fall into the errors of their ways as i said it will be your dutythe duty of us allto teach them they talked of this and other things and the day passed with the countryside juddering slowly by because of all the wagons they could not move with any speed and as the sun dropped lower and ever lower in the west marshal orval searched for and found a suitable place to make camp for the night while the servants prepared a meal for all the entourage the baron and baroness walked up to the top of the nearest hill to stretch their legs after riding in the carriage all day in the distance they could see the dark closecrowded hills of wales misty with the coming of night what do you see asked agnes the baron was thoughtful for a moment then said i see wealth and power and a throne to rival englands his naked declaration embarrassed him a little he could feel agness eyes on him so he shrugged and added at least it is closer now than it has ever been the wedding will make a glorious beginning she returned his smile and took his hand that mon amour is exactly what i was thinking chapter it was five days of anxious travel before bran and the grellon reached coed cadw footsore weary and disheartened beyond measure they sought the safety of their forest keep as they moved into the lush greenshadowed solitude of the guardian wood the heat of the day dropped away and they walked a little easier and lighter of step there among the trees the weary heartsick band began to heal the wounded memories of the last daysthe betrayal of the ffreinc king the treachery of the black abbot the fierce and bloody battle and their anxious flight though they had escaped the battle without fatalitya few of the men suffered cuts and bruises one a broken arm and another a deep sword wound to the thighthe carnage had exacted a toll that only became apparent in the days that followed for most of the grellon the panic and horror of that day was a plague that worked away on their souls and they were infected with it thus soulsick and exhausted they crept back into the solace of the greenwood to heal the raw inflamed wounds of their memories arriving at cel craidd to the great relief of those who had been left to look after the settlement in their absence the watchers had seen them on the road and hastened back to prepare a welcome jars of cool water flavoured with elderflower blossoms and honey seed cakes to restore their strength but the travellers were in no mood to rejoice and their stark response to what should have been a glad homecoming soon dashed any notions of celebration something is amiss my lord observed henwydd delicately an older man he had been given the care of cel craidd in brans absence forgive me if i speak in error but the faces i see around me would be better suited to a funeral party not a homecoming how can it be otherwise said bran his voice thick with bitterness the blackhearted english king broke his promise the realm belongs to the ffreinc and we are outlaws still sooner have milk from a stone grumbled iwan following bran than get satisfaction from a norman angharad arranged her wrinkled face into a sad smile she thanked henwydd and the others for their thoughtfulness and accepted a drink from the welcome cup then taking her leave of bran and the others she shuffled slowly to her hut did red william not redeem your throne asked another pressing forward he did not answered bran count falkes is banished to normandie with his uncle the baron de braose and elfael is claimed by the king bloody black abbot hugo and his gutless marshal gysburne are placed over us for our care and protection growled siarles then we wont be going home said henwydd no bran replied we stay herefor now at least are we to remain in the forest forever asked teleri another who had remained behind an older woman she had lost all she had to the ffreinc when the count took her house for the new church there were tears in her eyes as the meaning of brans words broke upon her merian had come to stand beside bran she reached out and put her arm around the womans shoulders to comfort her we have endured the forest this long merian said what is another season or two season or two said henwydd growing angry why not ten or twenty if you have something to say bran replied sternly go on say it speak your mind we believed in you my lord we trusted you i have suffered this outlaw life for the hope of the deliverance you promised but i cannot abide another season scrabbling hand to mouth in the greenwood it is no fit life and i am too old others too spoke out against the desperate life in the forest with its darkness and dangersexposure privation and the constant fear of discovery if the ffreinc didnt kill them they said the wolves would they had followed bran this far but now that there was no hope of justice to be had from the ffreinc it was time to think what was best for themselves william the red commands armies beyond number one man said we cannot fight them all and only a fool would try bran glowered but held his tongue i am sorry my lord continued henwydd but you see how it is i beg leave to quit the forest i have never asked anything of you but im asking you now to grant me leave to depart and where will you go asked merian well considered the old man i have kinsmen still in dyfed it may be they will take me in but whether they do or dont makes no matter cause anywhere is better than here there we have it bran said eyes alight and voice cold he turned and addressed the rest of the settlement who else feels this way who else wants to leave the forest he swung around his voice attacking iwan will scarlet siarles what about you meriangod knows youve wanted to leave often enough why not go now he glared around at the ring of grim faces none would meet his ferocious stare merian standing beside tuck grasped the friars hand oh no she breathed tears starting to her eyes tuck grasped her hand and gave it a squeeze who else is for leaving demanded bran if you would go speak up all who wish to leave may go with my blessing i do not force anyone to stay who would not do so gladly and of their own accord there was an instant commotion at this and the forestdwellers began arguing it over amongst themselves some were for leaving others for staying and all shouting to be heard and convince the rest bran let this continue until most had had a chance to speak out then said well what say you anyone else want to go step up and take your place with henwydd for all saints bear witness i do not care to stand with anyone who does not care to stand with me at first no one moved and then one by one others joined henwydd until a group of seventeen men and women some with children stood together in a dismal clump so now bran his face hard addressed those who had chosen to leave gather your things and make ready to departtake whatever you need for your journey if you would have my advice wait until the sun goes down and make your way by night you should avoid any ffreinc and reach the borders of elfael before sunrise tomorrow i bid you gods speed and may you all fare well with that he turned and strode to his hut a shocked and dismayed cel craidd watched him go iwan and siarles looked on aghast and scarlet and merian began to persuade those who had decided to leave that they were making a mistakebut thought better of it the tight bond between king raven and his proud grellon was broken the settlement was divided and there was nothing anyone could do later as twilight deepened the shadows in the wood friar tuck called the people together for a prayer of thanks for their deliverance from the hands of the enemy and for a safe return and for the future of the realm he then led his discouraged flock in a hymn he sang the first verses alone but soon everyone joined in lifting their voices and singing loudly as the moon rose in the pale blue sky neither bran nor angharad attended the prayer service but the banfaith appeared after sundown when the first of those leaving the forest settlement were setting off gripping her staff she offered blessings for the journey and safe arrivals for all who would travel that night the next morning after breaking fast the remaining grellon resumed their chores there was more work now that a fair number of the most ablebodied had gone as those who remained took stock of their numbers it was clear that others unwilling to be seen by their friends had departed silently during the night taking a silent tally they soon realized that fewer than half their number remained with heavy hearts they set to and were just discussing how to divide the duties of the day and the days to come when angharad called all cel craidd to gather at the council oak in the centre of the settlement as the forestdwellers assembled beneath the spreading boughs of the great grey giant they found bran seated in his chair made of ash branches lashed together and covered by a bearskin bran looked like a celtic king of oldan impression only strengthened by the longbeaked mask of king raven that lay at his feet angharad stood behind her king wearing the bird spirit cloak and holding a long thin rodlike staff in her right hand as soon as everyone had settled themselves close about this primitive throne the banfaith raised the staff and said heed the head of wisdom and attend her counsel you are summoned here to uphold your king in his deliberations with strong consideration therefore make keen your thoughts and carefully attend your words for the course we determine here among us will be the life and death of many she paused and bran said if anyone here does not wish to bear this burden you may leave now in peace but if you stay you will agree to abide by the decisions we shall make and pledge life strength and breath to fulfil them whatever they shall be iwan grim and deeply aggrieved spoke for them all when he said those who wanted to leave have gone my lord and god bless em but those you see before you are with you to the endand that end is to see you take your rightful throne and lead your people in peace and plenty hear him said scarlet hear him struth added siarles and others shouted god wills it bran nodded to angharad who struck the bare earth three times with the end of her staff to silence the commotion then raising her hand palm outward she tilted her face to the light slanting down through the leafladen branches goodly wise strong upholder swift sure hand she said in a queer chanting voice draw near to us enter into our minds and hearts be to us the voice that speaks the true word be to us our rock and fortress our shield and defender our strength and courage go before us lord of hosts bare your mighty arm set your face against our enemies and as you destroyed the army of the wicked pharaoh in the sea let fear swallow up those who raise their hands against us these things we ask in the name of blessed jesu our hope and redeemer and michael militant the terrible sword of your righteousness her mouth moved silently for a moment longer then she said amen all gathered in the solemn assembly echoed amen bran turned his head and thanked his wise banfaith for her prayer to the people gathered before him he said we are here to decide how the war with the ffreinc shall be pursued on my most solemn vow there will be an end to their rule in this realm or there will be an end to me for i will not tolerate their presence in the land of my fathers while there is yet a single breath in my body i am with you my lord cried iwan slapping his knee we will drive them from this realmor die in the attempt bran gave a downward jerk of his chin by way of acknowledgement of iwans pledge and continued let us speak freely now holding nothing back as we must stand together in the days to come let us share our hearts and minds he paused to let his listeners gather their thoughts so now he spread his hands who will begin tuck was first to find his voice to speak plain i am grieved in heart soul and mind since the attack in the groveand any man who said otherwise is a liar our king william has proven himself a greedy grasping rogue and a stranger to all honour if that was not a bitter enough brew to swallow our ffreinc overlords have shown us that they will attack with impunity little respecting women and children devil take them all muttered siarles nevertheless the friar continued raising a hand for silence i have bethought myself time and time again and it seems to me that if our enemies have any tender feelings within reach of their cold hearts it may be that they are even now sorely regretting that rash act what are you saying tuck asked bran softly it would be well to send abbot hugo an offer of peace peace scoffed bran on my fathers grave a moments peace they will not have from me i know my lord i knowthey have earned damnation ten times over is there anyone here who does not know it but i pray you do not dismiss the notion outright tuck turned to appeal to those gathered beneath the oak boughs see here it is not for our enemies that i make this pleait is for us and for our good the pursuit of war is a dire and terrible wasteof life and limb blood and tears it maims all it touches maybe we gain justice in the end maybe not no one knows how it will end but know you we will lose much that we hold dear long ere we reach the end and of that we can be more than certain we have little to lose it seems to me remarked iwan true enough tuck allowed but it is always possible to lose even that little is it not think you nowif war could be avoided we might be spared that loss by pursuing peace as readily as war we might even gain the outcome we seekand is that not a thing worth the risk of trying tucks plea fell into silence even as he implored the others to at least consider what he had said no one so it appeared shared his particular sentiment our priest is right to speak so said merian moving to stand beside the little cleric war with the ffreinc will mean the deaths of manymaybe all of us but if death and destruction can be avoided we must by all means tryfor the sake of those who will be hurt by what we decide today we must make an offer of peace offer peace wondered scarlet aloud thats begging for trouble with a dog and bowl aye trouble and worse growled siarles if you have no stomach for the fight ahead maybe you should both join henwydd and his band of cowards theyre not so far ahead that you couldnt catch em up coward is that what you think asked tuck voicing the question to the whole gathering is that what everyone thinks i dont say it is i dont say it ent replied siarles but the shoe fits him who made it enough both of you courage is not at issue here bran pointed out i was willing to swear fealty to william rufus indeed i encouraged my father to do so and we would not be here now if he had listened to me and acted before it was too late do you not see said merian youre in danger of becoming just like your fathertoo proud and stubborn for the good of your people and like your father you will die at the end of a norman spear she put out a slender hand and softened her tone red william is a false king that is true his decision was the ruin of all our hopes and now everything has changed look around my lordonly half of cel craidd remains even if we were mighty warriors champions each and every one we could not take back elfael by force of arms alone bran glared at her his brow low and furrowed judging from the expressions on the faces around him merian had won solid support for her opinion what do you suggest he said at last merian glanced at tuck that is not for me to say my lord it seems to me you have said a great deal already my lady why stop now he lifted his head to include the rest of the gathering come speak up your lord is asking for your counsel what do you advise if i may speak freely my lord began tuck i doubt anything in heaven or earth could prevent you remarked bran speak priest hardheaded saxon that i am i have always thought it a good thing that the clerics rule the church and kings rule the realm that is the way god has ordained it has he not render unto caesar the things that are caesars to be sure but give to god the things that are gods like it or not the ffreinc is there a point to this sermon friar interrupted bran only that we must be prepared to compromise if we are to persuade the abbot and sheriff to accept the peace compromise repeated bran dully what sort of compromise asked siarles that any ffreinc who have settled should be allowed to remain in elfael under your rule and that hugo will remain in charge of the spiritual concerns of the abbey let hugo keep the abbey and i take the fortressis that what youre saying said bran in a word yes my lord why in heavens name would hugo agree to that because suggested tuck it would allow him to put his efforts into saving his abbey which he will certainly lose if he continues to pursue this war lose the abbey and he has lost his place in the churchand i heartily doubt hell ever get another one whod have him indeed said bran you know what i mean tuck continued if he agrees to the peace he will survive and keep much that he will lose if the war continues my lord you would have to swear fealty to william will scarlet pointed out he has offered to do that already iwan reminded him twice what about the king he has given the realm to hugo then he can take it away again and give it back to its rightful ruler said tuck adding of course the abbot would have to agree to support you before the king hed never do it said siarles share my realm with that rank ffreinc butcher wondered bran shaking his head my stomach churns at the very thought he glanced to angharad for support but the old woman admonished him saying what the friar suggests has merit lord king think you force has availed us nothing nor has any other remedy offered a cure for this wasting blight we hurt them in the grove mind our enemies may be ready to listen to such an offer it would be well to ponder the matter further i bow to your judgment allowed bran grimly turning to the assembly he said let us suppose for the moment that we send an offer of peace to the abbot what then then it is for the ffreinc to decide is it not replied tuck either they accept and proceed according to your decree and if they dont wondered siarles we will be no worse off suggested merian but whatever happens will be on their heads added tuck at all events it is our christian duty to try for peace if it lays in our power bran chewed his lip thoughtfully for a moment tuck thought he could see a chink of light shining in the darkness of brans bleak mood lord bran the friar said i would like to take the message to hugo myself and alone why alone said bran priest to priest replied tuck that is how i mean to approach himtwo men of god answerable to the almighty blessed are the peacemakers are they not as angharad suggests put in merian the abbot may welcome the opportunity to be rid of this bloodshed hugo will welcome the opportunity to carve him like a christmas ham observed scarlet to tuck he said hell roast your rump and feed it to his hounds nay said tuck hell do no such thing i am a brother cleric and a minister of the church a rogue he may be but he will receive me as he must while i do not expect the abbot to honour any offer we put before him said iwan i agree with our man tuckwe should do what we can to avoid another bloodletting as it may well be our blood next time instead of theirs try as i might however i can think of no other way to avoid itour choices are that few it is worth a try there was more talk then as others added their voices to the discussionsome for the idea others against in the end however tucks proposition carried the day then it is decided declared bran when everyone had had their say in observance of our christian duty and for the sake of our people we will make this offer of peace to hugo and urge him by all means to accept it and to support me before king william it is the right decision my lord said merian pressing close if hugo will listen to reason then youll have reclaimed what is rightfully yours without risking the lives of any more of your people right or wrong it makes no difference bran told her we are too weak to pursue the war further on our own he declared the council at an end and said i will frame a message for tuck to deliver to the abbot if he accepts my offer we will soon be out of the forest and back in our own lands ill believe it when it happens grumbled siarles youre not alone there scarlet said give em a year o sundays and a angel choir to show em the way the bloody ffreinc will never shift an english inch then pray god to change their hearts tuck said do not think it impossible just because it has never happened chapter the council concluded and as everyone dispersed tuck lingered in angharads presence a little longer close to her he was aware once again of a curious sensationlike that of standing beneath one of the venerable giants of the forest an oak or elm of untold age it was he decided the awareness that he was near something so large and calm and rooted to depths he could scarcely imagine with her face a web of wrinkles and her thinning hair a haze of wisp on her head she seemed the very image of age yet commanded all she beheld with the keen intelligence of her deepset dark eyes i hope i have served him wisely he told the old woman so hope we all she replied i am afraid siarles is rightoffering peace is just begging for trouble trouble have we in abundance the banfaith pointed out it is a most hardy crop too true the friar agreed hear me friend priest she said holding him with her deepset dark eyes this war began long ago we merely join it now the trouble is not of our making but it is our portion and ours to endure that does not cheer me much sighed tuck regrets have you no never he answered that is the duty of any christian then trust god with it and that which is given you do you are right of course he said at last angharad regarded the friar with a kindly expression the little priest with his rotund bandylegged form his shaggy tonsure his stained and tattered robesmelling of smoke and sweat and who knows what elsethere was that much like a donkey about him and like the humble beast of burden he was loyal and longsuffering able to bear the heavy load of responsibility placed upon him now as god is our lord and leader she said it is our portion to obey and follow we trust him to lead us aright as with our heavenly lord so with bran more we cannot do just now but we must do that at least ah but earthly vessels are all too fragile are they not we trust them at our peril the old woman smiled gently yet it is all we have too true tuck agreed so we trust and praynever knowing which is the more needful tuck accepted her counsel and made his way to the edge of the forest settlement where he found bran and merian sitting knee to knee on stumps facing one another as if in contest while will noin and odo stood looking on they know we will fight merian was saying if ever there was the smallest doubt we showed them in the grove but you must give them some assurance that we will not seek revenge if they accept your offer bran nodded conceding the point they have to know that they are not simply cutting their own throats she insisted i understand bran replied and i agree go on it must be something they can trust she continued even if they dont trust you granted merian said bran exasperation edging into his voice what do you suggest wellshe bit her lipi dont know maybe we could get the abbot at saint dyfrigs to oversee the truce suggested noin he is a good man and they know him after what happened in the square on twelfth night i cannot think they would trust any of us any farther than they could spit a mouthful of nails scarlet said shaking his head it must be someone they know someone they can rely on to be fair merians face clenched in thought i know she said glancing up quickly we could ask my father your fatherwhat possible reason could hugo have for trusting him because he is a loyal vassal of king william as is the abbot himself no said bran jumping up quickly this is absurd he began stalking around the stump it wont work whybecause you did not think of it your father hates me bran said and that was before i abducted you god alone knows what he thinks of me now if that was not enough lord cadwgan answers to baron neufmarche his liege lordand if the baron were to get wind of this there is no way we could keep him out of it the ffreinc would trust the baron merian said they might but could we wondered scarlet have you forgotten neufmarche tried to kill me last time i went to him for help said bran if it is all the same to you id rather not give him another chance merian frowned that was unfortunate unfortunate cried bran woman the man is a twofaced judas he betrayed me outright indeed he betrayed us both your own life was none too secure if youll recall what you say is true she conceded ill not argue still he is a ffreinc nobleman and iftogether with my father of coursewe could convince him that it was in his own best interest to help us i know hed agree oh hed agree bran retorted agree to help empty elfael of his rivals so he could have it all to himself wed just be exchanging one tyrant for an even bigger more powerful tyrant bran gave a sharp chop of his hand dismissing the suggestion no if the ffreinc require assurance that we will hold to our word we will appeal to abbot daffyd to swear for us and they will have to accept that he sat back down now then what do we want tuck to tell them they fell to discussing the substance of the message and soon hammered out a simple straightforward appeal to meet and discuss the proposed offer of peace by the time siarles came to say that the horse was ready the ffreinc scribe odo had schooled and corrected tucks creaky latin so there would be no mistake i have some of the norman tongue too tuck pointed out in french picked up a fair bit in my years in hereford not enough god knows snipped odo i understand far more than i can speak said tuck even so allowed the scribe it is not what you understand that will lead you to difficulty but what you are likely to say perhaps you should come with me then suggested tuck to keep a poor friar from stumbling over the rocky places the colour drained from the already pasty face of the young cleric i thought not replied tuck tis better i go alone ah said odo i will write it down for you so the abbot can read it for himself if you go astray he bustled off to find his writing utensils and a scrap of something to carry the ink all is well asked bran seeing the scribe depart on the run right as rain in merry may replied tuck odo is going to write it for me so if all else fails i have something to push under the abbots nose scarlet is rightthis is dangerous hugo could seize you and have you hung or worse you dont have to go we can find another way to get a message through the lord is my shield and defender replied tuck of whom shall i be afraid well then bran concluded god with you tuck siarles and i will see you to the edge of the forest at least a short while later the wouldbe peacemakers paused at the place where the kings road crossed the ford and started down into the valley bran and siarles were each armed with a bow and bag of arrows and tuck carried a newmade quarterstaff in the distance they could see caer cadarn on its hump of rock guarding the vale of elfael i do not expect the abbot will have let the fortress stand abandoned for long bran surmised he would have moved men into it as soon as count falkes had gone if any should see me they will only see a poor fat friar on a skinny horse making for townnothing to alarm anyone and if they should take exception and stop you asked siarles i will tell them i bring a word of greeting and hope to abbot hugo replied tuck and that is gods own truth then off with you said bran and hurry back well wait for you here it took tuck longer to reach the town than he had reckoned and the sun was already beginning its descent as he entered the market squareall but empty with only a few folk about and no soldiers that he could see always before there had been soldiers indeed the town had a tired deserted air about it he tied his mount to an iron ring set in a wall drew a deep breath hitched up his robe and strode boldly across the square to stand before the whitewashed walls of the abbey he pounded on the timber door with the flat of his hand and waited a few moments later the door opened and the whitehaired old porter peered out nous avons un message pour labbe tuck intoned politely prier lamene tout de suite brother porter ducked his head respectfully and hurried away thank you lord said tuck breathing a sigh of relief to have passed the first test tuck waited growing more and more uneasy with each passing moment finally the door in the abbey gate opened once more and the porter beckoned him to come inside where he was led across the yard to the abbots lodge a few of the monks stopped to stare as he passedperhaps thought tuck recognizing him from their previous encounter in king williams yard not too many days ago once inside he was conducted through a dark corridor and brought to stand before a panelled door the porter knocked and received the summons to enter he pushed open the door and indicated that tuck should go in the abbot was standing over a table on which was spread a simple supper he was spearing a piece of cheese with a long fork as tuck entered glancing up hugo stopped his mouth agape then collecting himself he said in a low voice vous devez etre fou venir ici comme ceci que voulezvous tuck understood this to mean that the abbot thought he must be insane to come there and demanded to know what he wanted at this tuck speaking in measured tones and with many haltings as he searched for the words began his prepared speech he appealed to abbot hugo as a brother in their common calling as priests of the church and thanked the abbot for allowing him to speak he then said that he had come with an offer of peace from the forestdwellers when words began to fail he took out the little scrap of parchment odo had prepared for him listing the central stipulations of the plan the abbots face grew red as he listened but he held his tongue tuck concluded saying you have until midday tomorrow to give your answer if you accept brans offer you will ring the abbey bell nine timesthree peals of three then come to the edge of the forest where you will be told what to do next do you understand to which the abbot replied i do not know which offends me the moreyour uncouth speech or the crudeness of your appearance he waved a hand in front of his nose you smell worse than a stable hound tuck bore the insult with a smile hed not expected an easy ride through enemy territory but you understand what i am saying oh i understand confirmed hugo however i fail to see why i should dignify this ridiculous idea of sharing the governance of elfael with a vile outlaw and rebel bran ap brychan is neither outlaw nor rebel tuck replied evenly hoping he had got the words right in truth his family has ruled this realm for a hundred years or more if you agree you would be sharing the dominion of the cantref with the rightful heir to the throne of elfael whono fault of his ownhas been deprived of his kingship and if i do not agree then there will be a bloody price to pay is that supposed to frighten me asked hugo arching an eyebrow if so forgive me if i refuse to take this threat of retribution seriously it seems to me that if your lord bran could take this town by force he would have done so long ere now no he is giving you one last chance said tuck one last chance yes abbotthis is the last and best chance you will receive so i am supposed to simply abandon the town and fortress to the outlaws and imprison myself in the abbey hereis that it you would not be held captive said tuck struggling to make himself understood bran would rule the realm as a liegeman of the king and you would support him in this and ah confine your activities to the work of the abbey non roared the abbot throwing down the longhandled fork cest impossible the king has given me elfael to rule as i see fit i will in no wise share the governance of this realm with a low brigand hugo leaned on the table with his fists his anger mounting i may not have enough men to drive your king raven from his forest perch but if he has the might to defeat me then let him try tuck stared at the abbot his mind whirling as he tried to decipher this last outburst but you will consider the offer i think our talk is finished the abbot made a dismissive gesture with his hand you may go but if you ever come here again i will have you arrested to stand trial as a traitor to the crown you can tell your friends that if i ever catch you or any of them your lives are forfeit tuck stiffened at the insult i came here in good faith abbot as a christian priest even so i dont expect youll see me again out i am going tuck said stepping towards the door but i urge you to seriously consider the offer of peacepray discuss it with your marshal and the sheriff you have until midday tomorrow to decide and if you accept porter shouted the abbot take this man away outside once more tuck returned to his mount untied it and heaved himself up into the saddle as he lifted the reins he cast a backward look at the abbey and saw a monk flitting along the front of the church towards the guard tower he did not linger but departed quickly lest the abbot betray his word and arrest him he urged his mount to a trot and left the town hastening back to the forest with the curious sensation that he had been given a valuable prize but could not remember what it wassomething abbot hugo had said but what in any event he was satisfied that as a priest of the church he had done his duty blessed are the peacemakers he murmured to himself and the good lord help us all chapter saint martins as long as those outlaws hold the kings roadcomplained marshal guy swirling the wine in his cup nothing enters or leaves the forest without their notice we lost good men in that illadvised attack at winchester and you need not whip that dead horse any longer marshalgrowled abbot hugo slamming down the pewter jar wine splashed out and spattered the table linen leaving a deep crimson stain i am only too aware of the price we are paying to maintain this accursed realm my point abbot was that without hope of raising any more soldiers the cantref is lost already sooner or later the rogues will discover how few men we have and when they do they will attack and we will not be able to repel them that or they will simply wear us down either way they win possibly hugo shook the wine from his hand raised his cup and drank their raven king has made us an offer of peacetake it i say and let us be done with this godforsaken realm i wish to heaven id never heard of it be that as it may hugo said staring into his cup king william has given the governance of the realm to me and i will not suffer that ridiculous king raven and his scabrous minions to hold sway over it they will be defeated have you heard a single word ive said i heard marshal but i do not think you understand the depth of my resolve for i propose we root out king raven and his brood for once and all then just you tell me how do you propose we do that guy de gysburne glared at the abbot daring him to put up something that could not be knocked down with a single blow as many times as we have gone against them we have been forced to retreat swords and spears are no use against those infernal longbows because we cannot get close enough to use them pitched battle is no good they will not stand and fight they hide in the woods where our horses cannot go they know the land hereabouts far better than we do so they can sit back and slaughter us at will abbot hugo was in no mood to listen to yet another litany of guys complaints they never advanced the cause and always fell back on the tired observation that unless they found a powerful patron to supply men and weapons and provisions the realm would fall the battle in the grove had cost them more than either one of them cared to contemplatethough guy had not allowed anyone within hearing distance to forget it of the thirtythree knights and menatarms left to them after the departure of the exiled baron de braose only twentyone remained and elfael nestled in its valley and surrounded by forest on three sides was far too vulnerable to the predation of bran and his outlaw band who had proven time and again that they could come and go as they pleased if we cannot get to them replied hugo adopting a more conciliatory air then we will bring the socalled raven and his flock to us easier said than done muttered guy our raven is a canny bird not easy to trick not easy to catch nor am i an adversary easily defeated hugo raised his cup to his mouth and took a deep draught before continuing simply put we will entice them draw them out into the open where they cannot attack us from behind trees and such their bows will be no good to them at close quarters guy stared at the abbot in amazement and shook his head the forest is their fortress they will not leave itnot for any enticement you might offer but i need offer nothing the abbot remarked dont you see they have outwitted themselves this time under pretence of accepting the peace we will lure them into the open once they have shown themselves we will slice them to ribbons just like that scoffed the marshal shaking his head if you have a better plan let us hear it snapped the abbot growing weary of arguing with gysburne at every turn he decided to end the discussion count falkes was no match for the welsh as we all know he paid the price for his mistakes and he is gone i rule here now and our enemies will find in me a more ruthless and cunning adversary than that de braose ninny clearly they had reached an impasse and marshal guy could think of nothing more to say so he simply dashed the wine from his cup and took his leave if all goes well marshal said the abbot as guy reached the door we will have that vipers nest cleaned out in three days time how very optimistic observed sheriff de glanville when the marshal told him what the abbot had said so far in all our encounters with these brigands weve always come off the worsewhile they get away with neither scratch nor scrape putting more men in the field only gives them more targets for their accursed arrows guy pointed out precisely granted the sheriff he removed the leather hood from his falcon and blew gently on the birds sleek head with his free hand he picked up a gobbet of raw meat from a bowl on the table and flipped it to the keeneyed bird on his glove still the abbot has a pointwe might fare better if we could lure the outlaws from the wood have you any idea what the abbot has planned the outlaws have sent a message offering a truce of some kind have they indeed they have confirmed gysburne and the abbot thinks to use that to draw them out he didnt say how it would be done the sheriff lifted a finger and gently stroked the falcons head well i suppose there is no point in trying to guess what goes on in our devious abbots mind i have no doubt hell tell us as soon as he is ready they did not have long to wait at sundown just after compline the abbot summoned his two commanders to his private chambers where he put forth his plan to rid the realm of king raven and his flock when the abbey bell goes abbot hugo explained for the third time i want everyone in place we dont know we dont know how many will come so we must be ready for anything grumbled marshal gysburne irritably for the love of peter there is no need to hammer us over the head with it the abbot arched an eyebrow if i desire to lay stress upon the readinessor lack of itof your men he replied tartly be assured that i think it necessary the point is taken abbot offered the sheriff entering the fray and after what happened in the grove at winchester i think a little prudence cannot go amiss marshal guy flinched at the insinuation you werent there sheriff were you were you there you know very well that i was not then i will thank you to shut your stinking mouth you dont know a thing about what happened that day au contraire mon ami answered de glanville with a cold superior smile i know that you left eight good knights in that grove and four more along the way twelve men died as a result and we are no closer to ridding ourselves of these outlaws than we ever were the marshal regarded the sheriff from beneath lowered brows you smug swine he muttered you dare sit in judgement of me judge you inquired de glanville innocently i merely state a fact if that stings then perhaps enough said abbot hugo slapping the arm of his chair with his palm save your spite for the enemy sheriff de glanville gave the abbot a curt nod and said forgive me abbot as i was about to say we will never have a better chance to take the enemy unawares if the outlaws escape into the forest it will be just like the massacre in the grove we cannot allow that to happen this is i fear our last best chance to take them we must succeed this time or all is lost i agree of course replied the abbot that goes without saying i beg your pardon abbot remarked the sheriff but in matters of war nothing ever goes without saying well then sniffed gysburne we have no worries there youve seen to thatmost abundantly get out of hereboth of you said the abbot rising abruptly he flapped his hands at them as if driving away bothersome birds go on just remember i want you to have your men ready to attack the moment i draw the rogues out of hiding and strike swiftly i will not be made to stand waiting out there alone you will not be alone abbot far from it said de glanville gysburne and i will be hidden in the forest and some of my men will be among your monks we have thought of everything i assure you just you match deed to word sheriff and i will consider myself assured the two commanders left the abbey each to look after his own preparations sometime later when the moon was low and near to setting but dawn was still a long way off a company of soldiers departed saint martins moving like slow shadows across the valley ten mounted knights in two columnstheir armour and horses tack muffled with rags to prevent the slightest sound their weapons dulled with sooted grease so that no glint or shine could betray themrode in silence to the edge of the forest upon reaching the dark canopy of the trees they dismounted and walked a short distance into the wood hid their horses and themselves in the thick underbrush then settled back to wait chapter coed cadw with the approach of dawn the forest awakened around the hidden soldiersfirst with birdsong and then with the furtive twitching and scratching of squirrels and mice and other small creatures a light mist rose in the low places of the valley pale and silvery in the earlymorning light it vanished as the sun warmed the ground leaving a spray of glistening dew on the deep green grass a family of wild pigsa sow and six yearling piglets under the watchful eye of a hulking great boarappeared at the margin of the trees to snuffle along the streambed and dig among the roots the world began another day while the hidden soldiers dozed with their weapons in their hands slowly the sun climbed higher in a cloudruffled sky and they waited some little while before midday there came a sound of movement further back in the forestthe rustling of leaves where there was no breeze the slight creak of low branches a sudden flight of sitting birdsand the soldiers who were awake clutched their weapons and nudged those still sleeping beside them the ghosts of the greenwood were coming king raven would soon appear but the sounds died away nothing happened the sun continued its climb until it soared directly overhead the soldiers awake now and ready strained their ears in the drowsy quiet of the wood as above the whir and buzz of insects the first faint chimes of a church bell sounded across the valleyfar off but distinct three peals then silence they listened and they heard the signal repeated after another lengthy pause the sequence of three peals sounded for the third and last time after the second sequence had sounded marshal gysburne pressing himself to the ground craned his neck from his hiding place behind an ash tree and looked down the long slope and into the bowl of the valley where he saw a faint glimmering abbot hugo and his whiterobed monks making their way toward the forest they came on slow as snails it seemed to an increasingly impatient gysburne who like the other knights was sweating and stiff inside his armour he inched back behind the tree and listened to the greenwood hoping to catch any telltale sign of the outlaws presence when at last the abbots party came within arrowflight of the edge of the wood a call like that of a raven sounded from the upper branches of a massive elm tree the party of whiterobed monks surrounding the abbot heard it too and as if acting upon a previously agreed signal stopped at once the raucous croak sounded twice morenot quite a birds cry gysburne thought but certainly not human either he scanned the upper branches for the source of the sound and when he looked back there poised at the edge of the tree line stood the slender young man known as bran ap brychan ah gasped gysburne in surprise where the devil did he come from muttered sergeant jeremias from his place on the other side of the ash tree dressed all in black his dark hair lifting in the breeze for an instant it seemed to the soldiers that he might indeed have been a raven dropped out of the sky to assume the form of a man he stood motionless clutching a longbow in his left hand at his belt hung a bag of dark arrows had i one of those bows jeremias whispered id take him now and save us all a load of bother shh hissed gysburne in a tense whisper hell hear you when the outlaw made no move to approach the group of monks the abbot called out mentendre nous avons fait comme vous avez ordonne quel est pour arriver maintenant marshal gysburne heard this with a sinking heart you old fool he thought the outlaws dont speak french hell have no idea what youre saying but to the marshals surprise the young man answered attenteun moment he turned and gestured toward the wood behind him and there was a rustling of leaves in the brush like a bear waking up and out from the greenwood stepped the slumpshouldered norman scribethe one called odo the two advanced a few more paces into the open and then halted at a nod from bran the scribe called out have you come to swear peace i have come as requested replied abbot hugo to hear what this man has proposed regarding the young scribe he said greetings odo i suppose i should not be surprised to see you heretraitors and thieves flock together eh odo cringed at his former masters abuse but turned and explained to bran what the abbot had said received his lords answer and replied the proposal is simple lord bran says that you will agree to the terms put to you or he will pursue the war he has begun even if i were to agree replied the abbot we must still discuss how the rule of elfael is to be divided and how we are to conduct the peace come let us sit down together and talk as men odo and bran exchanged a quick word then odo replied first my lord would have you swear a truce you must promise to cease all aggression against himself and his people then he will parlera with you the abbot and his monks held a quick consultation and the abbot replied come closer if you please my throat grows raw shouting like this i am close enough bran replied swear to the truce abbot hugo took a step forward spreading his arms wide come he said let us be reasonable let us sit down together like reasonable men and discuss how best to fulfil your demands first you must swear to the truce answered bran through odo there will be no peace unless you pledge a sacred vow to uphold the truce frowning the abbot drew himself up and said in the name of our lord i swear to uphold the truce ceasing all aggression against the people of elfael from this day hence then it is done said bran through odo you may come forwardalone your monks are to stay where they are a moment pray called the abbot there is more i wish to bran halted one of the monks behind hugo dropped his hand to his side and bran caught the movement and glimpsed a solid shape beneath the folds of the monks robe grabbing odo by the arm bran whispered something and the two began backing away hes onto them whispered sergeant jeremias from his hiding place among the roots i see that spat gysburne what do you expect me to do stop him urged the sergeant stop him now before he reaches the wood wait cried abbot hugo from the clearing we need safe conduct back to the village send some of your men to guard us when odo had relayed these words to bran the young man called over his shoulder and said you came here under guardyou can leave the same way there is no truce the two outlaws started for the wood again and again hugo called out but bran took no further notice of him blast his cursed bones muttered gysburne stop him urged jeremias with a nudge in the marshals ribs with a growl between his teeth guy rose from his hiding place and stepping out from behind the ash tree called out halt we would speak to you at the sudden appearance of the marshal bran shoved odo toward the nearest tree dropping to one knee he raised his bow the arrow already on the string gysburne had time but to throw himself to the ground as the missile streaked toward him in the same moment the nine knights hidden since midnight in anticipation of this moment rose with a shout charging up out of the undergrowth odo gave out a yelp of fright and stumbled backwards to where bran was drawing aim on the wriggling figure of gysburne as he snaked through the grass toward the safety of the bracken swinging away from the marshal bran drew and let fly at the soldiers just then bolting from the wood to his left his single arrow was miraculously multiplied as five more joined his single shaft in flight hidden since dawn in the upper branches of the great oaks and elms the grellon took aim and released a rain of whistling death on the knights scrambling below shields before them the ffreinc soldiers tried to keep themselves protected from the falling shafts one knight stumbled momentarily dropping his guard an arrow flashed and the knight slewed wildly sideways as if swatted down by a giant unseen hand a second arrow found its mark before the wounded man stopped rolling on the ground three more knights were down just that quick and the five remaining soldiers moved surprisingly fast in their mail and padded leather tunics ten running paces carried them across the open ground between the wood and the lone kneeling archer swords drawn they roared their vengeance and fell upon him in the instant the soldiers raised their arms to strike there came a sound like that of a hard slap of a gauntleted fist smashing into a leather saddle arrows streaked down from the upper branches of the surrounding trees and the cracking thump was repeated so quickly the individual sounds merged to become one the foremost knight seemed to rise and dangle on his tiptoes as if jerked upright by a rope only to crumple when his feet touched earth again he collapsed in the grass three arrows in his back a second knight threw his arms wide his sword spinning from his grasp as he crashed to his knees and flopped facefirst to the ground a third knight paused in midstroke and glanced down at his chest where he saw a rosecoloured stain spreading across his pale tunic in the centre of the crimson stain the steel tip of an arrowhead protruded with a cry of pain and disbelief he threw down his sword grabbed at the lethal missile and tried to pull it free even as he toppled the fourth knight took an arrow on his shield and was thrown onto his back as two more arrows ripped the autumn air one of them striking the soldier a step or two ahead of him the knight faltered his legs tangling in midstep as the missile jolted into him twisting his shoulders awkwardly his shield banged against his knees and he plunged onto his side at brans feet the sole remaining knight still on the ground covered his helmeted head with his shield and lay unmoving as the dead around him nocking another arrow to the string bran surveyed the battleground with a rapid sweep to the right and left several of the monks with abbot hugo had thrown off their robes to reveal mail shirts and swords and othersfive mounted soldiers including sheriff richard de glanvillecharged out from the nearest trees stooping swiftly bran picked up odo dragging the frightened monk to his feet and driving him headlong into the safety of the greenwood there came the sound of leaves rustling and branches thrashing in the forest nearby and they were gone the mounted knights galloped to the edge of the wood and halted listening all that could be heard were the groans of the wounded and dying the marshal and sergeant jeremias ventured slowly out from behind their shields see to those men sergeant ordered gysburne to the knight who lay unharmed among the bodies he called get up and find the horses are we going after the outlaws sire inquired the knight why by the bloody rood cried the marshal to let them continue to practice their cursed archery on us think man theyre hiding in the trees but i thought the abbot said began the knight obey your orders de tourneau snapped the marshal irritably forget what the abbot said just do as youre toldand take racienne with you the two knights clumped off together and gysburne turned to see sheriff de glanville and his bailiff turning back from the edge of the wood have no fear called the marshal the outlaws have gone you are safe now the sheriff stiffened at the insinuation it was not for fear that we held back no granted the marshal of course not why would i think that you merely mislaid your sword perhaps or i am certain you would have been in the fore rank leading the charge enough gysburne snarled the sheriff the last time i looked you were crawling on your hands and knees like a baby the abbot shouted from the clearing cutting short what promised to be a lively discussion de glanville gysburne did you get him is he dead no answered the marshal he got away he promptly amended this adding they got away it was a trap they were waiting for us abbot hugo turned his gaze to the bodies lying in the long grass his face darkened are you telling me youve lost four men and the outlaws have escaped again he swung around to face the marshal how did this happen he shouted you ask the wrong man abbot replied gysburne coolly we did our part it was the sheriff who failed to attack you were supposed to draw them from hiding abbot remember said the sheriff darkly since you failed in the first order no good purpose would be served by pursuing the second he pointed to the bodies on the ground you can see what that accomplished if i had attacked it would have been at the cost of more men and more lives wasted if you had attacked as planned the marshal said his voice rising we could have taken him and wed not be standing here now heaping blame on each other there is plenty of blame to go around it seems to me retorted de glanville angrily but ill not own more than my share the plan was flawed from the beginning we should have anticipated that they would not be drawn out so easily and now they know we have no intention of accepting their ridiculous peace offer weve gained nothing turning away from the other two he shouted for his men to load the bodies of the dead onto the backs of their horses and return to saint martins he climbed into the saddle then called gysburne i turn my duties over to you while i am away bailiff will assist you de glanville wheeled his horse where are you going demanded the marshal to londein came the answer i am the kings man and i require soldiers and supplies to deal with these outlaws we should discuss this gysburne objected there is nothing to discuss we need more soldiers and im going to get them i should return within the fortnight marshal guy looked to the abbot let him go said hugo he is right i would not linger here any longer if i were you called the sheriff we are finished and it is not safe he snapped the reins and the big horse bounded off do not underestimate me sheriff muttered abbot hugo watching him go i am far from finished very far from finished marshal guy de gysburne walked over to where a knight had been slain there was blood in the grass he picked up the dead mans sword and stuck it in his belt you can stay if you like abbot but they are probably watching from the forest casting a hasty glance over his shoulder the abbot hurried to rejoin his bodyguard and scuttled back to the abbey in undignified retreat part two came little john through the forest that morn and chancd upon poor rhiban hud so high on his back he carries him to a priest on the edge of the woode god save you fryer tuck quod john a handsome fish ive here his lengths as longe from snout to tail as any ive seen this yere then dont delay friend john quod tuck but lay him here on the hearthe lets get him skinned and then get him cleaned and warmed up quick and smart young rhiban quickly mended himself at fryer tucks strong healing hands and when he had sense the two hearde account of the change that had passed in those lands for twenty long summers quoth rhiban by god my arrows i here have let fly methinks it quite strange that within the march a reeve has more power than i this forest and vale i consider my own and these folk a king think of me i therefore declareand so solemnly swear i will live to see each of them free by trood this is a most noble sport john little did him proclaim ill stand with thee and fight til death and i quod tuck the same then send you bold captains to head up our men and meet in the greenwoode hereon merian llechley and alan adale thomas and much millers son chapter two riders picked their way carefully along the rocklined riverbed one in front of the other silent vigilant dressed in drab faces hidden beneath widebrimmed shapeless hats they might have been hunters hoping to raise some game along the river or more likely a party of merchants making for a distant market strange merchants howeverthey shunned the nearby town going out of their way to avoid it it was brans idea to appear as wayfarers simply passing through in the hopes of attracting as little notice as possible he watched the hilltops and ridgeways on either side of the valley while tuck remained alert to anyone approaching from the rear overhead a brown buzzard soared through the empty air its shadow rippling over the smooth clouddappled slopes ahead the river forked into two branches one wide and shallow one little more than a rill snaking through a narrow brushchoked defile upon reaching the place where the two streams divided bran paused which way tuck said reining in beside him odo halted a few paces behind you ask me that replied bran with a grin and still you call yourself a priest i am a priest affirmed tuck and i do ask youfor all evidence to the contrary i cannot read the minds of men only their hearts he regarded the two courses which way do we go the narrow way of course answered bran narrow is the way and hard the road that leads to salvation isnt that the way it goes straight is the gate and narrow the way that leadeth to life and there be few that find it the friar corrected you should pay better attention when the holy script is read well have to walk from here bran said climbing down from the saddle but when we reach the end we will be beyond the borders of elfael and out of reach of de glanvilles soldiers he glanced at odo the young priest had maintained a gloomy silence since climbing into the saddle do either of you want to rest a little before we move on my thanks but noa chance to quit this saddle is all i need just now tuck said easing himself down from the saddle come odo a change is as good as a rest is it not he wiped the sweat from his face although to be sure a jar of ale would not go amiss when day is done said bran starting into the gorge this way you two they had left the forest before dawn crossing the open ground to the south of the caer while it was still dark quickly losing themselves in the seamed valleys of elfael they proceeded ever north ward keeping out of sight of the fortress and town until both were well behind themand even then bran continued with all caution a chance encounter with a wayward ffreinc party was to be avoided at all costs leading the horses they resumed their trek picking their way along the stream it was slow going because rocks brush and nettles filled the defile making each step a small ordeal the bowlegged priest struggled to keep up with his longlegged companions scrambling over the rocks and dodging thorny branches all the while ruing the turn of events that had made this journey necessary they had left the forest before dawn crossing the open ground to the south of the caer while it was still dark quickly losing themselves in the seamed valleys of elfael keeping out of sight of the fortress and town until both were well behind themand even then bran continued with all caution a chance encounter with a wayward ffreinc party was to be avoided at all costs we acted in good faith bran had declared in the council following the abbots misguided ambush but hugo sought to betray usonce again it is only by gods favour that odo and i escaped unharmed and none of our men were killed or wounded bran and his archers had just returned from their encounter with the ffreinc and one glance at their scowling faces gave everyone to know that all was not well tuck with merian a close step behind was there to meet the returning peace party god love you iwan what happened tuck asked snagging hold of the big mans arm as he came through the blasted oak did they fail to ring the bell nay friar answered the champion shaking his head slowlythey rang the bell for all to hearbut then attacked us anyway they were lying in wait for us said siarles joining them hiding in the forest gysburne and his men showed themselves for the black devils they are said scarlet aye and the sheriff too added siarles dressed up as monks some of em even so we honoured our part said iwan we did not draw on them until they attacked bran was anyone hurt tuck glanced quickly at the other archers trooping into the settlement there was no blood showing all seemed to be in ruddy good health no hurt to anyone but themselves scarlet pointed out a fellad a thought theyd have learnt a little respect for a welsh bowman by now seems they are a thick lot these ffreinc say what you will the friar heard these words and his heart fell like a stone dropped into a bottomless well the slender hope that the abbot would accept the offered peace sank instantly swallowed in the knowledge that abbot hugo would never be appeased in light of this new outrage he felt the fool for even imagining such a thing possible you did what christian duty required and it will be accounted to your credit tuck assured them lamely god will yet reward you for remaining true to your part no doubt friar replied siarles the same way he helps them who help themselves methinks i do not blame you for being disappointed tuck said but you should not place the failure at the almightys feet when it spare us tuck snapped bran he and odo the last to arrive passed the others as they stood talking i am not of a mind to hear it addressing the men he said get something to eat all of you then i want my advisors to come to me and we will hold council againthis time it is a council of war the six archers moved off to find some food leaving tuck merian and the others looking on in dismay i feared this might happen said merian still we had to try she looked to the friar for assurance we did have to try we did confirmed the priest and we were right he glanced at the young woman beside him how lovely she was how noble of face and form and how determined a pang of regret pierced him to see her oncefine clothes now stained and growing threadbare from their hard use in the greenwood she was made for finer things to be sure but had cast her lot with the outlaw band and her fate like all who called the forest home was that of a fugitive ah my soul he sighed feeling the weight of their failure settle upon him so much hardship and sadness could have been avoided if only that blasted abbot had agreed i had my hopes too friar offered merian my father has ruled under baron neufmarche these many yearsto the benefit of both i think it can be donei know it can but hugo de rainault is a wicked man and there is no reasoning with him he will never leave never surrender an inch of ground until he is dead alas i fear youve struck to the heart of it confessed tuck shaking his head sadly no doubt that is where the trouble lies where friar in the hearts of eversinful men my lady he told her in the alltoowicked human heart after the men had eaten those who were counted among king ravens advisors joined their lord in his hut as they took their places around the fire ring bran said we need more men and i am going to more men thought tuck and remembered what it was that he had learned from the abbot good lord he cried starting up at the memory forgive me he said quickly as all eyes turned towards him but i have just remembered something that might be useful bran regarded him waiting for him to continue it is just that glancing around he said to iwan how many soldiers did you say the abbot and sheriff had with them no moren twenty replied the champion at most confirmed siarles then that is all they have said tuck twenty menthat is all that are left to them following the two attacks he went on to explain about meeting with the abbot and how hugo had let slip that he no longer had enough men to defend the town so unless i am much mistaken those who attacked you are all that remain of the troops baron de braose left here and there are fewer now siarles pointed out maybe by four or five he can have no more than fifteen or sixteen under his command he turned wondering eyes towards bran my lord we can defeat them we can drive them out we can take back control of the cantref echoed iwan one more battle and it would be ours they fell to arguing how this might be accomplished then but arrived always at the same place where the discussion had begun gysburne may have only sixteen left bran pointed out but you can believe he wont be drawn into open battle with us nor can we take the town or the fortress for all we are only six ablebodied bowmen so it comes to this we need more men and i am going to raise them he paused first things first iwan i want you and owain and rhoddi to watch the roadday and night nothing is to pass through the forest without our leave all travellers are to be stopped any goods or weapons they carry will be taken from them and if they refuse asked the champion use whatever force you deem necessary bran replied but only that and no more all who comply willingly are to be sent on their way in peace nothing will get past us my lord i know what to do siarles said bran you and tomas are to begin making arrows well need as many as we can getand well need bows too and where will we be getting the wood for all these bows and arrows asked siarles wood for bows i know and where to find it angharad said speaking up from her place behind brans chair we will bring all you need gwion bach and i bran nodded the rest of the grellon are to be trained to the longbow women too asked merian yes confirmed bran women too he turned to will scarlet until your hand is healed you will teach others what you know about the bow that much is easily done said scarlet its the trainin that takes the time then start at once today owain one of the newer members of the council asked you said you meant to raise more men what is in your mind my lord if you dont mind my asking i have kinsmen among my mothers people in gwynedd replied bran i mean to start there once the word spreads that we are gathering a force to overthrow the ffreinc i have no doubt well soon get all the warriors we need there are warriors nearby that are yours for the asking merian pointed out i have but to go to my father and no said bran firmly the fact is my father your father is a vassal of baron neufmarche bran said in a pained tone a fact you seem determined to ignore merian opened her mouth to object but bran cut her off saying that is the end of it merian glared at him from under lowered brows but gave in without another word well then said bran declaring himself satisfied with the preparations be about your work everyone if all goes well tuck and i will return with a war band large enough to conquer the ffreinc and force their surrender as the others shuffled out bran called tuck to him i will see to the horses and you take care of the provisionsenough for four days i make it the friar spent the rest of the day assembling the necessary provisions for their journey while he was scraping together the few items they would need for making camp scarlet came to him i am worried about odo he said sitting down on a nearby stump that scrape this morning has pitched the poor fella into the stew oh i am sorry to hear it replied tuck has he said anything not so much said will he wouldnt but if there was ever a creature ill fashioned for the wildwood thats odo through and through tuck paused considering what scarlet was telling him what do you think we should do well seeing as you are heading north i was wondering if it might be best for everyone if you took odo along to gwynedd aye said scarlet but only as far as that monastery with the old bishop saint tewdrigs thats the one i know hed fare better there and no doubt the way things are with the folk so hardpressed everywhere hereabouts hed be a better help there than here if you see what i mean hes suffering you say ive seen whipped dogs more cheerful well then said tuck ill speak to bran and see what we can do he paused then asked why did you bring this to me i deemed it a priest thinglike confession replied scarlet rising and odo would never be able to lift his head again if he thought bran reckoned him a coward tuck smiled youre a good friendwilliam scatlocke consider it done and bran will think no ill of brother odo the travellers spent a last night in the forest departing early enough to cross the vale of elfael before dawn only angharad was awake to see them off which she did in her peculiar fashion raising her staff she held it aloft and blessed them with a prayer that put tuck in mind of those he had heard as a child in the north country the three climbed into their saddlesbran swinging up easily odo taking a bit more effort and tuck with the aid of a stump for a mounting blockand with a final farewell quickly disappeared into the gloaming by the time the sun was showing above the horizon the riders had passed the ffreincheld saint martins and were well on their way now as the sun sailed high over head they eked their way over bare rocks along the edge of the rill and a little while later passed beyond the borders of elfael and into the neighbouring cantref of builth it was well past midday when they came within sight of the monastery and in a little while stood in the yard of saint tewdrigs introducing the young ffreinc priest to bishop asaph who professed himself overjoyed to receive an extra pair of hands as you see he told them we are run off our feet day and night caring for the souls who come to us we will put him to work straightaway never fear he fixed bran with a look of deepest concern what is this i am hearing about you declaring war on abbot hugo it is true bran allowed and explained how the english king had reneged on his promise to restore brans throne appointing the abbot and sheriff as his regents instead we are on our way north to rally the tribes the ageing bishop shook his head sadly is there no other way if there was bran conceded we are beyond recalling it now he went on to tell how the black abbot had rebuffed his offer of peace that was tucks idea we had to try offered the friar for jesus sake we had to try indeed sighed the bishop they stayed with the monks that night and bidding odo farewell they departed early the next morning they rode easily passing the morning in a companionable silence until they came to a shady spot under a large outcrop of stone where bran decided to stop to rest and water the horses and have a bite to eat before moving on once more the going was slow and the sun was disappearing beyond the hill line to the west when they at last began to search for a good place to make camp for the nightfinding a secluded hollow beside a brook where an apple tree grew the apples were green still and tart but hard to resist and there was good water for the horses while bran gathered wood for the fire tuck tethered the animals so they could graze in the long grass around the tree and then set about preparing a meal we should reach arwysteli tomorrow bran said biting into a small green apple the two had finished a supper of pork belly and beans and were stretched out beneath the boughs bending with fruit and powys the day after oh tuck queried we are not stopping perhaps on the way back bran said i am that keen to get on to bangor i know no one in these cantrefs and it might be easier to get men if on our return we are accompanied by a sizeable host already this sounded reasonable to the friar how long has it been since youve seen your mothers people he asked bran gnawed on his sour apple for a moment then said quite a long timea year or two after my mother died it must have been my father wanted to return some of her things to her kinfolk so we went up and i met them then you werewhat eight nine years old tuck ventured something like that he allowed but it will make no difference once they have heard what we intend they will join us never fear they spent a quiet night and moved on at dawn passing through builth without seeing another living soul and pressing quickly on into arwysteli and powys where they stopped for the night in a settlement called llanfawydden tuck was happy to see that the hamlet had a fine wooden church and a stone monks cell set in a grove of beeches though the village consisted of nothing more than a ring of wattleandmud houses encircling a common grazing area after a brief word from the local priest the chief of the village took them in and fed them at his table and gave them a bed for the night the chieftain and his wife and three sons slept on the floor beside the hearth the travellers found the family amiable enough they fed them well entertained them with news of local doings and asked no questions about who their guests were or what their business might be however when they were preparing to leave the next morning one of the younger ladsupon learning that they had travelled from elfaelcould not help asking whether they knew anything about king raven i might have heard a tale or two bran allowed smiling the boy persisted in his questions despite the frowns from his mother and brothers is it true what they say is he a very bad creature bad for the ffreinc it would seem bran said by all accounts king raven does seem a most mysterious bird do you know him hereabouts nay replied the middle lad shaking his head sadly only what folk say one of his older brothers spoke up we heard he has killed moren two hundred ffreinc swoops on em from the sky and spears em with his beak added the one who had raised the subject in the first place boys said the mother embarrassed by her sons forthright enthusiasm you have said enough no harm chuckled bran much amused by this i dont know about spearing knights with his beak but at least the ffreinc are afraid of himand thats good enough for me they say he helps the cymry continued the younger one gives em all the treasure that he does tuck agreed or so ive heard the travellers took their leave of their hosts shortly after that resuming their journey northward the day was bright and fair the breeze warm out of the south and the track good bran and tuck rode easily along talking of this and that your fame is spreading tuck observed if they know king raven here theyll soon enough know him everywhere bran dismissed the comment with a shrug children are readily persuaded not at all the friar insisted where do children hear these things except from their elders people know about king raven they are talking about him for all the good it does bran pointed out king raven may be better liked than william the red but it is the red kings foot on our neck all the same the ffreinc may be wary of the phantom of the wood but it hasnt changed a blessed thing perhaps not tuck granted but i was not thinking of the ffreinc just now i was thinking of the cymry bran gave an indifferent shrug king raven has given them hope insisted tuck he has shown them that the invaders can be resisted you must be proud of your feathered creation he had his uses bran admitted but like all things that usefulness has reached its end truly king raven has done what he can do now it is time to take up bows and strap on swords and join battle with the enemy openly in the clear light of day perhaps tuck granted but do not think to hang up your feathered cloak and longbeaked mask just yet there will be no more skulking around the greenwood like a ghost bran declared that is over certain of that are you tuck said just you mark my words bran ap brychan king raven will fly again before our cause is won chapter long before rome turned its eyes toward the isle of the mighty bangor in the far north of gwynedd was an ancient and revered capital of kings there among the heavy overhanging boughs of venerable oaks the druids taught their varied and subtle arts establishing the first schools in the west that was long ago the druids were gone but the schools remained and now those aged trees sheltered one of the oldest monasteries in britain and for all anyone knew all of christendom indeed the proud tribes of gwynedd had sent a bishop and some priests to emperor constantines great council half a world away in niceaas the inhabitants of north wales never tired of boasting when brans fatherbrychan ap tewdwr a prince of the southfound himself in want of a wife it was to gwynedd that he had come looking and in bangor he had discovered his queen rhian a muchloved princess of her tribe while she had lived ties between the two kingdoms north and south had remained strong thus bran expected to find a hearty welcome among his mothers kinsmen after three days on the road the two travellers drew near the town and the pathways multiplied and diverged so they stopped to ask directions from the first person they meta squinteyed shepherd sitting under a beech tree at the foot of a grassy hill youll be wanting to see your folk i expect observed the shepherd it is the reason we came bran told him a hint of exasperation colouring his tone having already explained that his mother had been the daughter of a local chieftain he had asked if the fellow knew where any of her people might be found well replied the shepherd he craned his neck around to observe his sheep grazing on the hillside behind him you wont find any of em in town yonder no wondered bran why not they ent there hooted the man whistling through his few snaggled teeth and why would that be wondered bran if you know perhaps i could persuade you to tell me no mystery there brother replied the shepherd theyve all gone over to aberffraw ent they have they indeed said bran and why is that its all to do with that ffreinc earl n tryin to stay out o his reach dye ken i think so replied bran doubtfully and where might this aberffraw be might be anywhere the shepherd replied his tanned weatherbeaten face cracked into a smile as he tapped his nose knowingly just what i was thinking remarked bran even so ill wager that you know and could tell me if you had a mind to youd win that wager brother i do declare and will you yet tell me the shepherd became sly how much would you have wagered a penny then ill be havin o that the man replied bran dug in his purse and brought out a silver coin he held it up this for the benefit of your wide and extensive knowledge done cried the shepherd delighted with his bargain he snatched the coin from brans fingertips and said aberffraw is on the holy isle ent it just across the narrows there and hidden round tother side o the headland you wont see it this side for it is all hidden away neatlike bran thanked the shepherd and wished him good fortune but tuck was not yet satisfied when was the last time you went to church my friend the shepherd scratched his grizzled jaw well now difficult to say that difficult no doubt because it has been so long you dont remember ventured tuckwithout waiting for a reply he said no matter kneel down and bow your head quickly now ill not spend all day at it the shamefaced shepherd complied readily enough and tuck said a prayer for him blessed his flock and rode on with the stern admonition for the herdsman to get himself to church next holy day without fail at bangor they stopped to rest and eat and gather what information they could about the state of affairs in the region there was no tavern in the town much less an inn and tuck was losing hope of finding a soothing libation when he glimpsed a clay jar hanging from a cord over the door of a house a few steps off the square there he cried to his great relief and made for the place which turned out to be the house of a widowed alewife who served the little town a passing fair brew and simple fare tuck threw himself from his saddle and ducked inside returning a moment later with generous bowls of bubbly brown ale in each hand and a round loaf of bread under his arm god is good he said passing a bowl to bran amen the two travellers established themselves on the bench outside the door too early for the alewifes roast leg of lamb they dulled their appetites with a few lumps of soft cheese fried in a pan with onions into which they dipped their bread while they ate and drank they talked to some of the curious townsfolk who came along to greet the visitorsquickly informing them that theyd arrived at a bad time owing to the overbearing presence of the earl of cestre a ffreinc nobleman by the name of hugh davranches wolf hugh is a rough pile said the ironsmith from the smithy across the square he had seen the travellers ride in and had come to inquire if their horses needed shoeing or any tack needed mending that he is agreed his neighbour you call him wolf observed tuck how did he come by that you ever see a wolf that wasnt hungry said the smith ravening beast like thatll devour everything in sightsame as the earl hes a rough one right enough agreed his friend solemnly a rogue through and through as you say replied bran heres to hoping we dont meet up with him he offered his bowl to the smith the smith nodded and raised the bowl heres to hoping he took a hearty draught and passed the bowl to his friend who drained it when they had finished bran and tuck made their way down to the small harbour below the town a fairsized stretch of timber and planking the wharf was big enough to serve seagoing ships and boats plying the coastal waters between the mainland and ynys mon known as holy island just across the narrow channel they found a boatman who agreed to ferry them and their horses to the island it was no great distance and they were soon on dry land and mounted again they followed the rising path that led up behind the promontory over the headland and down to a very pleasant little valley on the other side aberffraw and tucked into a fold between the encircling hills the settlement of celyn garth less a town than a large estate consisting of an enormous timber fortress and half a dozen housesalong with barns cattle pens granaries and all surrounded by apple orchards and bean turnip and barley fields scraped from the everencroaching forest which blanketed the hills and headlandsit had become the royal seat of the northern welsh and was as the shepherd had suggested perfectly suited to keeping out of the voracious earls sight bran and tuck rode directly to the fortress and made themselves known to the short thicknecked old man who appeared to serve the royal household as gateman and porter with a voice like dry gravel he invited them to enter the yard and asked them to wait while he informed his lord of their arrival whatever life the kings of north wales had known in earlier times it was clear that it was much reduced now as in england the arrival of the normans meant hardship and misery in draughts too great to swallow the cymry of the noble houses suffered along with the rest of the country and celyn garth was proof of this the yard was lumpy rutted and weedy the roof of the kings hall sagged its thatch ratty and mildewed the gates and every other door on the nearly derelict outbuildings stood in need of hingeing and rehanging i hope we find the king well said bran doubtfully i hope we find him at his supper said tuck what they found was llewelyn ap owain a swarthy nimble welshman who received them graciously and prevailed upon them to stay the night but he was not the king its gruffydd youre looking for is it he said aye who else it pains me friend to inform you that our king is a captive llewelyn explained over a hot supper of roast pork shanks and baked apples they were seated at the hearth end of the nearempty hall their host sat at table with his guests while his wife and daughters served the meal hes held prisoner by earl hugh may god rot his teeth wolf hugh asked bran is that the man aye cousin thats the fellowhugh davranches earl of cestredevious as the devil and cruel as cain with a toothache hes a miserable old spoiler is our hugh with a heart full of torment for each and all he meets how long has gruffydd been captive wondered tuck llewelyn tapped his teeth as he reckoned the tally must be eight years or more i guess he said maybe nine already has anyone seen him since he was taken prisoner tuck asked oh aye replied llewelyn we send a priest most high holy days the earl allows our gruffydd to receive food and clothing and such since it whittles down the cost of keeping an expensive captive we use those visits for what benefit we can get bran nodded he and tuck shared a glance and each could sense the sharp disappointment of the other whos ruling in gruffydds place asked bran swallowing his frustration llewelyn paused to consider it was a simple enough question and tuck wondered at their hosts hesitation you must be looking at him i reckon llewelyn confessed at last although i make no claim myself you understand he spread his hands as if to express his innocence i merely keep the boards warm for gruffydd so to speak i am loyal to my lord while he lives and would never usurp his authority which is why the ffreinc keep him alive no doubt observed bran as long as gruffydd drew breath no one else could occupy his empty throne much less gather his broken tribe but people do come to me for counsel and guidance llewelyn offered and i see it my duty to oblige however i can i understand said bran he fell silent contemplating the depth of his difficulty the kingdom of gwynedd leaderless and adrift was in no shape to supply a war host to help fight a war beyond its borders he realized with increasing despair that he had come all this way for nothing so then ill be sending for your relations said llewelyn breaking the silence theyll be that glad to see you and i them replied bran and complimented his host on his thoughtfulness thank you llewelyn i am in your debt they finished supper and the guests were given their own quarters so they would not have to share with the rest of llewelyns household who mostly slept on benches and reed mats in the hall the next morningon the counsel and guidance of their hostbran and tuck rode out to get the measure of the land and people of the northern part of gwynedd and to speak frankly without being overheard this is going to be more difficult than i thought bran admitted when after riding for a goodly time they stopped to water the horses at a stream flowing down a rocky gorsecovered hill and into mor iwerddon the sea of ireland gleaming blue under a fine early autumn sky raising an army of kings men with the king in an enemy prison tuck queried what is difficult about that i dont think he even has an army well that would make it slightly more tricky i suppose remarked tuck yes mused bran tricky he walked a few paces away then back glancing up suddenly he grinned that twisted roguish smile that tuck knew meant trouble more than that however it was the first time in many many days that tuck had seen him smile and the friar had almost forgotten the magic of that lopsided grintruly it was as if a slumbering spirit had awakened in that instant to reanimate a young man only halfalive until now he was once again himself rhi bran y hud alive with mischief and alert to possibility thats it friend friara trick eh to raise a kings army from a king who is in prison tuck caught his meaning at once gathering up the reins bran stepped quickly to his horse raised his foot to the stirrup and swung up into the saddle come tuck why are you dragging your feet why indeed tuck walked stiffly to his horse and after leading it to a nearby rock big enough to serve as a mounting block struggled into the saddle youll get us killed you know the priest complained me most of all bran laughed a little more faith would become you friar i have faith enough for any threeand ill thump the man who says me nay but you go jumping into a bear trap with both feet and itll not be faith you feel chomping on your leg bones grabbing up the reins he raised his eyes towards heaven is there no rest for the weary he sighed by the time he regained the path bran was already racing away on their return to celyn garth bran secluded himself in his quarters and set tuck to finding certain items that he needed when they had assembled everything necessary bran went to work and the change was swiftly effected it was nearly time for the evening meal when he emerged and tuck accompanied him to the hall where llewelyn was waiting with some of brans relations he had invited especially to meet their longlost kinsman there were seven of them three young men in the blueandred checked tunics of the north country three of middling age in tall boots and leather jackets over their linen shirts and one old man bald as a bean in a pale robe of undyed wool lead the way tuck bran murmured and remember i speak no cymry oh ill remember tuck retorted its yourself you should be reminding stepping into the hall the little friar approached the long table where the men were already gathered over their welcome cups llewelyn took one look at the cleric and his companion and rose quickly friar aethelfrith he said i did not know you brought a guest come sit down to the unexpected visitor he said be welcome in this house pray sit and share a cup with us tuck kept his eyes on llewelyn who seemed to recognize something familiar in the young man beside him but if the long black robes did not fully disguise him then the sallow sombre expression the slightly hunched shoulders and inwardly bending frame the closeshorn hair and gleaming white scalp of his tonsure the large sad eyes hesitant step and almost timid way he held his headtaken all together the appearance was so unlike bran ap brychan that llewelyn did not trust his first impression and withheld judgement on the newcomers identity for his part bran inclined his head in humble acceptance and offered as it seemed to those looking on a somewhat melancholy smileas if the slender young man carried some secret grief within and it weighed heavily on his heart he turned to tuck and the others also looked to the priest as for an explanation my lords said tuck allow me to present to you my dear friend father dominic chapter speaking with the humble yet confident authority that one would expect of a papal envoy the slender young man introduced as father dominic charmed his listeners with tales of his travels in the service of the holy father and his dealings with kings and cardinals it fell to tuck of course to translate his stories for the benefit of his listeners since bran spoke in the curious chiefly meaningless jibberjabber of broken latin that passed for the language of the italian nobility among folk who had never heard it tuck was able to keep one step ahead of his listeners by his many sudden consultationsto clarify some word or thoughtwhere bran as father dominic would then whisper the bare bones of what his struggling translator was to say next such was father dominics winsome manner that tuck found himself almost believing in the charming lies even knowing them to be spun of purest nonsense and embellished by his own ready tongue father dominic revealed that he was on a mission from rome and explained that he had come to the region to make acquaintance with churchmen among the tribes of britain who remained outside norman influence this was announced in a casual way but the subtlety was not lost on his listeners father dominic speaking through tuck told them that because of the delicate nature of his inquiry he was pleased to travel without his usual large entourage to enable him to go where he would unnoticed and unannounced the mother church was reaching out to all her children in britain he said the silent and suffering as well their noisier more overbearing and belligerent brothers all the while their distracted host would glance towards the empty doorway finally when brans absence could no longer be comfortably ignored llewelyn spoke up forgive me for asking friar aethelfrith but i begin to worry about our cousin is he well perhaps he has fallen ill and requires attention bran ap brychans kinsmen had done him the honour of travelling a considerable distance to greet their cousin from the south and although beguiled by the unexpected arrival of a genuine emissary of the pope in rome they could not help but wonder about their cousins puzzling absence father dominic heard llewelyns question too and without giving any indication that he knew what had been said he smiled raised his hands in blessing to those who sat at the table with him then begged to be excused as he was feeling somewhat tired from his journey certainly we understand said llewelyn jumping to his feet i will have quarters prepared for you at once if you will kindly wait but a moment father dominic waved off his host saying through tuck pray do not trouble yourself i shall find my own way with that he turned and despite llewelyns continued protests walked to the door of the hall where he paused with his hand on the latch he stood there for a moment then with the others looking on stepped back from the door shook himself around andwonder of wondersseemed to grow both larger and stronger before the startled eyes of his audience when he turned around it was no longer father dominic who stood before them but bran himself once morealbeit berobed as a priest and with a shorn and shaven pate llewelyn was speechless and all around the board stared in astonishment at the deception so skilfully executed under their very noses they looked at one another in baffled bemusement when llewelyn finally recovered his tongue he contrived to sound angrythough his tone fell short by a long throw how now cousin what is this devilment forgive me if i have caused offence said bran finding his own true voice at last but i knew no better way to convince you all convince wondered llewelyn and what pray are we to be convinced of cousin bran shrugged off the black robe resumed his place at the board and poured himself a cup of ale saying that i will tell and gladly smiling broadly he raised his cup to the men around the board first i would know these kinsmen of mine a little better as soon said as done replied llewelyn some of his former goodwill returning indicating the elder man sitting beside him he said this is hywel hen bishop of bangor and the granduncle of young brocmael beside him hywel was brother to your mothers father next is cynwrig from aberffraw and his son ifor then we have trahaern meurig and llygad from ynys mon meurig is married to your mothers younger cousin myfanwy god with you all said bran i know your names and i see my dear mother in your faces i am pleased to meet you all weve met before my boy said hywel hen though i dont expect you to remember you were but a barebottomed infant in your mothers arms at the time i well remember your mother of courseand your father fares the king well does he if it lay in my power to bring you greetings from lord brychan trust that nothing would please me more replied bran but such would come to you from beyond the grave the others took this in silence my father is dead bran continued and all his war band with him killed by the ffreinc who have invaded our lands in elfael then it is true said meurig we heard that the ffreinc are moving into the southlands he shook his head i am sorry to hear of king brychans death as are we all said trahaern whose dark hair rippled across his head like the waves of a wellordered sea as are we all but tell us young bran why did you put on the robes of a priest just now i cannot think it was for amusement offered meurig but if it was let me assure you that i am not amused nor i said cynwrig your jest failed my friend in truth my lords it was no jest replied bran i wanted you to see how easily men defer to a priests robe and welcome him that wears it you said it was to convince us llewelyn reminded him indeed hands on the table bran leaned forward if i had come to you saying that i intended to fetch king gruffydd from earl hughs prison what would you have said that you were softheaded chuckled trahaern or howling mad our king is held behind locked doors in a great rock of a fortress guarded by wolf hughs own war band declared llygad a thickset man with the ruddy face of one who likes his ale as much as it likes him it cannot be done not by bran ap brychan perhaps granted bran amiably but father dominicwho you have just seen and welcomed at this very tablehas been known to prise open doors barred to all others he looked to tuck for confirmation of this fact it is true the friar avowed with a solemn shaking of his round head i have seen it with my own eyes have i not why should you want to see our rhi gruffydd freed from prison asked hywel fingering the gold bishops cross upon his chest what is that to you despite the bluntness of the question the others looked to bran for an answer and the success of king ravens northern venture seemed to balance on a knife edge what is it to me repeated bran his tone halfmocking in truth it is everything to me i came here to ask your king to raise his war band and return with me to help lead them in the fight unless of course you would care to take the throne in his absence he regarded hywel pointedly and then turned his gaze to the others around the board no one volunteered to usurp the kings authority prisoner though he was i thought not continued bran it is true that i came here to ask your king to aid me in driving the ffreinc from our homeland and freeing elfael from the tyranny of their rule but now that i know that my best hope lies rotting in a ffreinc prisonfor all he is my kinsman tooi will not rest until i have freed him brans kinsmen stared at him in silence that was finally broken by trahaerns sudden bark of laughter you dream big the dark welshman laughed slapping the table with the flat of his hand i like you the tension eased at once and tuck realized he had been holding his breathnor was he the only one the two younger cymry silent but watchful sighed with relief and relaxed in their elders pleasure it will take more than a priests robe to fetch gruffydd from wolf hughs prison meurig observed god knows if that was all it took hed be a free man long since the others nodded knowingly and looked to bran for his response you have no idea replied bran that slow dangerous smile sliding across his scarred lips how much more there is to me than that chapter caer rhodl the wedding was all baroness neufmarche hoped it would be conducted in regal pomp and elegance by father gervais who had performed the marriage ceremony for herself and the baron all those years ago lady sybilresplendent in a satin gown of eggshell blue her long brown hair plaited with tiny white flowersmade a lovely bride and king garran his broad shoulders swathed in a longsleeved grey tunic falling to the knees and a golden belt around his lean waist looked every inch a king worthy of the name it was to agness mind a fine match they made a handsome couple and seemed unusually happy in one anothers company garrans french was not good though better than sybils welsh but neither seemed to care they communicated with smiling glances and flitting touches of fingers and hands the final prayer caught lady agnes somewhat by surprise when sybils attendantsseveral of the grooms young female cousinsstepped forward to hold the carr over the couple kneeling before father gervais agnes felt tears welling up in her eyes the simple white square of cloth was the same one that had been stretched above her head the day she married the baron and which had swaddled the infant sybil at her baptism now it sheltered her daughter on her wedding day and would please god wrap sybils baby in turn this potent reminder of the continuity of life and the rich depth of family and tradition touched the baronesss heart and moved her unexpectedly she stifled a sob my love whispered the baron beside her are you well unable to speak she simply nodded never mind he said it is soon over no she thought it is only beginning it all begins again after the service in the rushstrewn hall the wedding feast began trestles and boards tables chairs and benches filled the courtyard where a pit had been dug to roast a dozen each of spring lambs and suckling pigs vats of ale sat upon stumps and tuns of wine nestled in cradles the aroma of baking bread mingled with that of the roasting meat in the warm sunwashed air as the newly wedded couple emerged from the hall the musicians began to play the bride and groom were led by their attendants in stately procession around the perimeter of the yard walking slowly in opposite directions pausing to distribute silver coins among the guests who waved hazel branches at the royal pair after the third circuit of the yard garran and sybil were brought to the high table and enthroned beneath a redandblue striped canopy where they began receiving gifts from their subjects special loaves of bread or jars of mead from humbler households and from the more welltodo households items of furniture artfully woven cloth and a matched pair of colts visitors who had made the journey from the barons holdings in france brought more exotic gifts crystal bowls engraved pewter platters a gilded cross soft leather shoes and gloves and jeweled rings with golden bands having given their gifts the celebrants took their places at the long tables when everyone was seated the servants filled the cups and bowls with wine and the first of many healths were raised to the married couple often accompanied by a word or two in welsh that none of the ffreinc understood but which brought bursts of laughter from all the britons then as the servants began carrying platters of food to the tables some of the grooms men seized the instruments from the minstrels and with great enthusiasm began playing and singing as loudly as they could their zeal though commendable was far in excess of their abilities lady agnes considered however they were soon joined by others of the wedding party and before a bite of food was touched the entire welsh gathering was up on their feet dancing some of the grooms men hoisted the bride in her chair and carried it around the yard and three of the brides maids descended on the groom and pulled him into the dance the servants attempting to bring food to the tables quickly abandoned the task since it was all but impossible to carry fully laden trenchers and platters through the gyrating crowd lady agnes at first appalled by the display quickly found herself enjoying the spectacle have you ever seen the like asked the baron smiling and shaking his head never confessed the baroness tapping her foot in time to the music is it not outrageous suggested the baron supplying the word for her glorious she corrected rising from her place she held out her hands to her husband come mon cher it is a long time since we shared a dance together baron neufmarche incredulous at his wifes eagerness to embrace the raucous proceedings regarded her with a baffled amazement she mistook for reluctance bernard said lady agnes seizing his hand if you cannot dance at a wedding when will you dance the baron allowed himself to be pulled from his chair and into the melee and was very soon enjoying himself with enormous great pleasure just one of the many revellers lost in the celebration amidst the gleeful clatter he became aware that his wife was speaking to him there it is again she said what he asked looking around where there she said pointing at his face that smile my dear he said puzzled she laughed and it was such a thrilling sound to his ears that he wondered how he had lived without it for so long i havent seen that smile for many years she declared i had all but forgotten it the music stopped and the dance ended has it been all that rare bernard asked falling breathless back into his chair as rare perhaps as my own replied the baroness he suddenly felt a little giddy although he had only had a mouthful or two of wine then we shall have to do something about that he said and reaching out pulled his wife to him and gave her a kiss on the cheek tonight mon cher she whispered her lips next to his ear we shall discover what else we have forgotten the feast resumed in earnest then and the happy celebrants sat down to their meal and the day stretched long into the twilight as the shadows began to deepen across the yard and the first pale stars winked on in the sky torches were lit and the ale vats and wine tuns replenished there was more singing and dancing and one of king garrans lords rose to great acclaim to tell a long and judging from the laughter of his listeners boisterously entertaining story lady agnes laughed too although she had not the slightest idea what the story might have been about it did not matter her laughter was merely the overflowing of an uncontainable abundance of joy from a truly happy heart as the festivities continued into the night lady agnes noticed that some of the grooms men had taken up places by the gatethree on each sideand as the musicians began another lively dance she saw two more of the grooms men creeping along the far wall she stiffened to a tingle of fear in the knowledge that something was about to happentreachery of some kind perhaps an ambush she nudged the baron with her elbow he was leaning back in his chair nodding tapping his hands on the armrests in time to the music bernard she hissed and nodded towards the gate the two grooms men had reached the gate something is happening he looked where she indicated and saw the gathered men he could make out the forms of horses standing ready just outside the gate he glanced hurriedly around for his knights all that he could see were either dancing or drinking and some had coaxed welsh girls onto their laps before he could summon them one of the men at the gate raised a horn and blew a sharp blast instantly a hush fell upon the revellers my cymbrogi the man called kinsmen and countrymen all wait thats garran said baron bernard shh whats he saying he spoke in welsh first and then again in french saying i thank you for your attendance this day and pray let the celebration continue my wife and i will join you again tomorrow you have had the day but the night belongs to us farewell the second grooms man turned and agnes saw her daughterwith a mans dull cloak pulled over her glistening gownraise her hand and fling a great handful of silver coins into the crowd with a shout the people dashed for the coins and the newly wedded couple darted through the doorway towards the waiting horses the grooms men shut the gate with a resounding thump and took up places before it so that no one could give chase the music resumed and the festivity commenced once more extraordinary remarked baron neufmarche with a laugh i wish i had thought of that on my wedding day it would have saved all that commotion you loved the commotion as i recall his wife pointed out i loved you he said raising her hand to his lips thenas i love you now perhaps it was the wine and song making him feel especially expansive or the music and contagious spirit of the celebration but it was the first time in many years that bernard had said those words to his wife yet even as he spoke them he knew them to be true he did love agnes and he wondered why he had allowed so many other concernsand womento intrude upon his love for her to wither it and debase it now in this moment all else faded in importance growing dim and inconsequential beside his life with agnes in that moment he vowed within himself to make up for those years of waste and the pain his neglect and infidelity must have caused her the baron stood come my dear the revelry will continue but i grow weary of the throng let us go to our rest he held out his hand to his wife she took it and he pulled her to her feet the celebration did continue far into the night the revellers pausing to rest only when dawnlight pearled the sky in the east for three days the wedding festivities continued on the fourth day people began taking their leave of the bride and groom paying homage to both as their king and queen before departing for home baron neufmarche well satisfied that he had done all he could to strengthen his client king and provide for his daughter turned his thoughts to hereford and the many pressing concerns waiting for him there my dear he announced on the morning of the fifth day after the wedding it is time we were away i have ordered the horses to be saddled and the wagon made ready we can depart as soon as we have paid our respects to the dowager queen and said our farewells lady agnes nodded absently i suppose she said mildly the baron caught the hesitancy in her tone yes what are you thinking i am thinking of staying she said stay here where else in wales why not she countered i am happy here and i can help sybil begin her reign she still has much to learn you know you could stay too mon cher she reached for his hand and squeezed it we could be together the baron frowned oh bernard she said taking his arm i am happy for the first time in many yearstruly happy do not take that away from me i beg you no he said you need not beg you can stay of courseif that is what you want i only wish i could stay with you id like nothing more than to see the building work on the new castle properly begun alas i am needed back in hereford i must go agnes sympathized but of course mon cher you go and tend to your affairs i will remain here and do what i can to help when you have finished you can return she smiled and kissed him on the cheek perhaps we will winter here i would like that he leaned close and kissed her gently i shall return as soon as may be so that was that lady agnes stayed at caer rhodl and the baron returned to hereford leaving behind his wife and daughter and to his own great surprise a piece of his heart chapter while bran continued to court the confidence of llewelyn and the lords of gwynedd slowly converting them to his scheme tuck was given the chore of gleaning all the information and gossip he could discover about earl hugh davranches he begged a ride across the strait in one of the local fishing boats to the busy dockyards at bangor where he spent a goodly while talking to the seamen of various stripes all had strong opinions but were weak on actual facts when he reckoned he had gleaned all that could be learned on the docks he moved on to the market square and strolled among the stalls listening to the merchants and their customers and stumping up the cost of a jar or two to share when he found someone whose opinions seemed worth his while to hear as the day began to fade toward evening he took shelter at the monastery sat with the monks at table and talked to the porter kitchener and secnab in this way tuck had collected a tidy heap of tittletattle and after sifting everything well and wisely it came to this hugh davranches had come to england with the invading forces of the duke of normandywilliam the conqueror to somewilly bastard to others father of the present king of england william rufus and although hugh did not actually fight at hastings against good king harold the norman nobleman was nevertheless granted generous swathes of land in the north of england as a reward for his loyalty and support why was this he had ships it was said that if not for hugh davranches ships the invasion of england would never have taken place the master of upwards of sixty seaworthy vessels he lent them to duke william to carry the ffreinc army across the narrow sea to britains green and pleasant shores thereby earning himself an earldom most of the cymry knew earl hugh as a fierce adversary well deserving of his wolfish nickname more extreme views considered him little more than a bootlicking toady to his bloatgut royal master and called him hw fras or hugh the fat in either case the cymry of the region had long since come to know and loathe him as a ruler who made life a torrent of misery for all who lived within his reach and a very long reach it was from his sprawling fortress at caer cestre on the northern border between england and wales earl hugh harrowed the land raiding thieving spoiling feuding burning and wreaking whatever havoc he might on any and all beyond the borders of his realm forever a thorn in the side of the local cymry he pricked them painfully whenever he got the chance it went without saying that it fell to king gruffydd of gwynedd to make a stand against this rapacious tyrant time and again gruffydds warriors and the earlsor those of the earls bloodlusting kinsman robert of rhuddlantangled and fought some times the cymry bloodied the norman noses but more often it went the other way on one disastrous day however king gruffydd ap cynan had been captured earl robert had bound his prize in chains and hauled him to caer cestre where gruffydd was cast into fat hughs hostage pit that was eight years ago and he was still there kept alive at hughs pleasure to torment and torture as whim moved him it was thought that the welsh king would rot in captivity hugh had no intention of releasing him and had refused to set either a ransom or a day of execution but the earl did allow the welsh kings kinsmen to pay their respects on high holy days when a selected few were admitted to the danksome keep with carefully inspected parcels of food clothing candles and other necessaries for their captive king the earls fortress at caer cestre was a squat square lump of ruddy stone with thick walls and towers at each corner and over the gate and the whole surrounded by a swampy stinking ditch it had been constructed on the remains of a stout saxon stronghold which was itself built on foundations the romans had erected on the banks of the river dee the town was also walled and those walls made of stone the roman masons cut from the red cliffs along the river the caer it was said could not be conquered by force these and other things tuck learned and reported it all to bran he likes his whoring and hunting our hugh he reported they were sitting in the courtyard of llewelyns house sharing a jug of cool brown ale a golden afternoon sun was slanting down warming the little yard agreeably and the air was soft and drowsy with the buzz of bees from the hives on the other side of the wall they say he likes his mistresses better than his money box his falcons better than his mistresses and his hounds better than his falcons thinks himself a mighty hunter does he mused bran with his nose in the jar he took a sip and passed it to tuck that he does the friar affirmed he spends more on his dogs and birds than he does on himselfand hes never been known to spare a penny there either does he owe anyone money wondered bran that i cannot say tuck told him but it seems he spends it as fast as he gets it musicians jugglers horses hounds clothes from spain and italy wine from francehe demands and gets the best of whatever he wants the way people talk a fellad think fat hugh was one enormous appetite got up in satin trousers bran chuckled he took back the jar and raised it a man who is slave to his appetites he said taking another drink has a brute for a master aye truly that he has the friar agreed cheerfully here now save a bit o that for me bran passed the jar to the friar who upended it and drained it in a gulp froth pouring down his chin which he wiped on a ready sleeve when tuck handed the empty jar back bran peered inside and declared somewhat cryptically it is the master we shall woo not the slave what he meant by this tuck was not to discover for several days but bran set himself to preparing his plan and acquiring the goods he needed and also pressed his two young cousins brocmael and ifor into his service he spent an entire day instructing the pair in how to comport themselves as members of his company of course tuck was given a prime part in the grand scheme as well so the bowlegged little friar was arrayed accordingly in some of bishop hywel hens best holy day vestments borrowed for the purpose at last bran declared himself satisfied with all his preparations the company gathered in llewelyns hall to eat and drink and partake of their hosts hospitality before the firebright hearth llewelyns wife and her maids tended table and two men from the tribe regaled the visitors and their host with song playing music on the harp and pipes while llewelyns daughters danced with each other and anyone else they could coax from their places at the board some of the noblemen had brought their families too swelling the ranks of the gathering and making the companys last night a glad and festive time the next morning after breaking fast on a little bread soaked in milk bran repeated his instructions to llewelyn trahaern and cynwrig then mounting their horses the four set off for the docks in search of a boat heading north caer cestre sat happily on the afon dyfrdwy which tuck knew as the river dee all told earl hughs castle was no great distanceit seemed to tuck that they could have reached it easily in three easy days of ridingbut bran did not wish to slope unnoticed into town like a fox slinking into the dove cote he would have it no other way but that they would arrive by ship and make as big an occasion of their landing as could be when bran came to caer cestre he wanted everyone from the stablehand to the seneschal to know it chapter lord love us said tuck a little breathless from his ride to the caer its an iberian trading vessel on its way to caer cestre the ships master has agreed to take us on board but they are leaving on the tide flow tuck my friend i do believe things are going our way at last declared bran happily fetch young ifor and brocmael ill give llewelyn our regards and meet you at the dock just you get yourself on board and make sure they dont leave without us the travelling party arrived wharfside just as the tide was beginning to turn and got themselves to the ship with little time to spare as the last horse was brought aboard and secured under the keen gaze of the ships mastera short swarthy man with a face burned by wind and sun until it was creased and brown as spanish leathercaptain armando gave the order to up anchor and push away from the dock a goodnatured fellow armando contented himself with the money bran paid him for their passage asking no questions and treating his passengers like the nobility they purported to be the ship itself was broad abeam and shallow drafted built for coasting and river travel it carried a cargo of olive oil and wine in an assortment of barrels and casks bags of dried beans and black pepper rolls of copper and tin and jars of coloured glass and for the noblemen of england and france swords daggers and helmets of good spanish steel and also rich garments of the finest cloth including silks and satins from the andalus and wool from the famous spanish merinos the four travellers ate well on board and their quarters though crampeda body cannot turn around for tripping over his own feet complained tuckwere nevertheless clean enough at all events it was but a short voyage and easily endured mostly the passengers just leaned on the rail and watched shoreline and riverbank slide slowly by now and again so close they could almost snatch leaves from the passing branches on the third day having skirted the north coast of wales and then proceeded inland by way of the river dee the ship and its passengers and cargo reached the wharf at caer cestre after changing their clothes for the finery bought at some expense in bangor the four prepared to disembark all during the voyage bran had laboured over the tale they were to tell and all knew well what was expected of them not a cleric this time bran had decided on the morning of the second day out he had been observing the ships master and was in thrall of a new and he considered better idea god love you man sighed tuck changing horses in the middle of the streamis this a good idea i ask myself from what you say friar replied bran wolf hugh is no respecter of the church good father dominic may not receive the welcome he so rightly deserves who would fare better wondered tuck count rexindo announced bran taking the name of a spanish nobleman mentioned by the ships master tuck moaned all very well for you my lord you can change like water as mood and whim and fits of fancy take you god knows you enjoy it i confess i do agreed bran his twisted smile widening even more i on the other hand am a very big fish out of water for all i am a poor humble mendicant whom god has seen fit to bless with a stooped back a face that frightens young uns and knees that have never had fellowship one with the other i am not used to such highflown japes and it makes me that uneasystrutting about in someone elses robes making airs like a bluefeathered popinjay no one would think you a popinjay countered bran you worry too much tuck and you not enough rhi bran all will be well youll see now as they waited for the horses to be taken off bran gathered his crew close look at youif a fella knew no better he said hed think you had just sailed in from spain is everyone ready receiving the nodded affirmation from each in turn he declared good let the chase begin and may god have mercy on us all tuck added and bidding their captain and crew farewell turned and led the landing party down the gangplank bran came on a step or two behind and the two young welshmen doing their best to look sombre and unimpressed with their surroundings came along behind leading the horses their time aboard the spanish ship had served bran well it had to be admitted the moment his feet touched the timber planks on the landing dock bran was a man transformed dressed in his fineryimproved by garments hed purchased from the trading stock captain armando carriedhe appeared every inch the spanish nobleman tuck marvelled to see him as did the two young noblemen who were inspired to adopt some of brans lofty ways so that to the unsuspecting folk of caer cestre they did appear to be a company of foreign noblemen they were marked accordingly and soon drew a veritable crowd of volunteers eager to offer their services as guides for a price french called tuck above the clamour anyone here speak french no one did it seemed despite the years of norman domination caer cestre remained an englishspeaking town the disappointed crowd began to thin as people fell away well probably have better luck in the town said bran but offer a penny or two so they proceeded up the steep street leading to the town square and tuck amended his cry accordingly a penny a penny to anyone who speaks french he called at the top of his voice a penny for a french speaker a penny at the end of the street stood two great stone pillars ancient things that at one time had belonged to a basilica or some such edifice but now served as the entrance to the market square though it was not market day there were still many people around most paying visits to the butcher or baker or ironmonger who kept stalls on the square a tired old dog lay beside the butchers hut and two plough horses stood with drooping heads outside a blacksmiths forge at the far end of the square giving the place a deceptively sleepy air tuck strode boldly out into the open square offering silver for service and his cry was finally answered here here now what are you on about looking around he saw a man in a tattered green cloak much faded and bedraggled with mud and muck he was sitting on the ground with his back against the far side of the butcher hut and his cap in his hands as if he would beg a coin from those who passed by at tucks call he jumped up and hurried towards the strangers here what for ye need a frankish man tuck regarded him with a dubious frown the fellows hair was a mass of filthy tangles hanging down in his face and his straggling beard looked as if mice had been at it the eyes that peered out from under the ropy mass were watery and red from too much strong drink the night before and he reeked of piss and vomit unshorn and unkempt he was tuck considerednot the sort of person they had in mind for this special chore we have business in this town tuck explained brusquely and we do not speak french i does the beggar boasted anglish and frenchy both alike whats yer sayin of a penny then we have a penny for anyone who agrees to bear a message of introduction for us tuck replied im tman fer ye the beggar chirped holding out a filthy hand to receive his pay all in good time friend tuck told him ive heard you speak english but how do i know you can speak french speaks it like twere me ine mither tongue he replied still holding out his hand je parler le francais et tout ye ken well said bran stepping up beside them whats he say tuck hesitated this fellow says hell help us but if his french is as poor as his english then i expect were better off asking the butchers dog over there bran looked around seeing as no one else had come forward and the day was getting on he said had we a better choice butbran shruggedhe will have to serve all the same tell him well give him an extra penny if he will wash and brush before we go tuck told the scruffy fellow what bran had said and he readily agreed go then tuck ordered and be quick about it dont make us wait too long or ill find someone else the beggar dipped his head and scampered off to find a trough in which to bathe himself tuck watched him go still nursing deep misgivings about their rough guide but since they only needed someone to make introduction he let the matter rest while they waited for the beggar to return bran rehearsed once again the next portion of his plan with the two young noblemen so they might keep in mind what to expect and how to comport themselves ifor you know some ffreinc a little admitted ifor a slender young man with dark hair and wary eyes beneath a smooth low brow he was that much like bran anyone could well see the family resemblance however distant it might have been blood tells thought tuck so it does not as much as brocmael though we hear it at the market in bangor sometimes brocmael explained slightly older than ifor he had much about him of a good badger dog you may find it difficult to pretend otherwise bran told them but you must not let on keep it to yourselves the ffreinc will not be expecting you to understand them and so you may well hear things to our advantage from time to time he smiled at their dour expressions dont worry its easyjust keep remembering who you are the two nodded solemnly neither one shared brans easy confidence and both were nearly overwhelmed by their arrival in a norman town and the deception they meant to worknot to say frightened by the prospect of delivering themselves into their chief enemys hands truth be told tuck felt much the same way the sun climbed a little higher and the day grew warmer accordingly bran decided that they should get a bite to eat and tuck never one to forego a meal if it could be helped readily agreed unless my nose mistakes me he said the baker is taking out fresh pies as we speak just what i was thinking said bran turning to his young attendants he said here is a good time to test your mettle remember who we are he pulled a leather bag from his belt and handed it to ifor get us some piesone for each and one for our guide too when he returns he looks like he could use a meal and lads see if there is any beer tuck added a jug or two would be most welcome this old throat is dry as moses in the wilderness they accepted the purse turned and with the air of men mounting to the gibbet moved off to the bakers stall theyll be all right observed bran more in hope than conviction oh aye tuck agreed with equal misgiving right as a millers scale the presence of wealthy foreign strangers in the square was attracting some interest a few of the idlers who had been standing at the well across the square were staring at them now and nodding in their direction you wanted to be noticed tuck said smiling through his teeth but i dont think those fellas like what theyre seeing you surprise me tuck this is just what we want if word of our arrival reaches the earl before we do so much the better see there he indicated two of the men just then hurrying away the news is on its way be at ease and rememberas highborn spanish noblemen it is beneath us to pay them heed you may be the king of spain for all caer cestre knows tuck declared but these rich clothes fit me ill for all i am a simple saxon monk a simple saxon worrier it seems to me bran corrected there is nothing to fear i tell you brocmael and ifor returned a short while later with pies and ale for all their errand had settled them somewhat and raised their confidence a rung or two the four ate in the shade of the pillar at the side of the square and were just finishing when three of the idlers approached from the well heres trouble muttered tuck keep your wits about you lads but before any of them could speak the beggar returned he came charging across the square and accosted the men in blunt english bran and the others watched in amazement as the idlers halted hesitated then returned to their places at the well a man after my own heart said tuck he looked their reprobate guide up and down here now i hardly know you not only had he washed himself head to toe but he had cleaned his clothes with a bristle brush cut his hair and trimmed his beard he had even found a feather to stick in his threadbare hat beaming with somewhat bleary good pleasure he strode to where bran was standing and with a low bow swept his cap from his head and proclaimed in the accent of an english nobleman alan adale at your service my lord may god bless you right well well tuck remarked bran much impressed hes brushed up a treat tell him that i mean no offence when i say that id not mark him for the same man the man laughed the sound full and easy the alan you see is the alan that is he said take im or leave im friend cause there ent no ither ye ken when tuck had translated bran smiled and said well take you at your word alan to tuck he said give him his pennies and tell him what we want him to do that is for the wash said tuck placing a silver penny in alans pinkscrubbed palm and this is for leading us to earl hughs castle now sir when we get there we want you to send for the earls seneschal and tell him to announce us to the earl do that and do it welltheres another penny for you when youre finished too kind you are my friend said alan closing his fist over the coins and whisking them out of sight and heres a pie for you tuck told him the pie was still warm its golden crust clean and unbroken for me alan was genuinely mystified by this small courtesy he looked from tuck to bran and then at the younger members of their party his hand was shaking as he reached out to take the pie for me he said again as one who could not quite believe his good fortune it seemed to mean more to him than the silver he had just been given all for you and we saved a little ale too tuck told him eat now and we will go as soon as youve finished bless you father he said grabbing tucks hand and raising it to his lips may the good lord repay your kindness a thousand times it happened so fast the little friar had no time to snatch his hand away again before the tearyeyed fellow had kissed it here now stop that bless you good gents all he said lapsing into the accents of the street once more alan adale ent one to fergit a good turn he sat down on the ground at the base of the pillar and began to eat stuffing his mouth hungrily and smacking his lips with each bite bran sent ifor and brocmael to water the horses while they waited and then asked tuck to find out what he could from their hungry guide tell him who we are tuck and lets see how he takes it my lord wants you to know that you are in the service of an esteemed and wealthy foreign nobleman in need of your aid perform your service well and you will be amply rewarded he gives you good greeting at this alan carefully laid his pie aside rose to his knees swiped off his hat and bowed his head you honour your servant mlord may god be good to you give him our thanks bran said and ask him how long hes been in the town and what news of the earl and his court turning to alan tuck relayed brans question my lord thanks you and wishes to know how long you have sojourned in this place alan raised his eyes heavenward his lips moving as he made his calculations in all three yeargive or take no more than four and how do you find the lord hereearl hugh tuck asked then added please finish your meal we will talk while you eat aye thats him replied their guide settling himself against the pillar once more he picked up the pie and bit into it fat hugh they call himaye and wellnamed he theres one hog wants the whole wallow all to himself if ye ken a greedy man greedy he mused taking another bite and chewing thoughtfully if a pig be greedy then hes the emperor o swine is he now tuck replied and translated his words for the cymry speakers who chuckled at the thought that tallies with what weve heard already replied bran ask him if he knows the castlehas he ever been inside it aye nodded alan when tuck finished i ken the bloody heap right well lord have mercy i been up there a few times he crinkled up his eyes and asked why would a bunch o god fearin folk like yerselves want to go up there anyway we have a little business with the earl explained tuck bad business then observed alan still i dont suppose you can be blamed for not knowing what goes on hereabouts he tutted to himself mark me youd be better off forgetting you ever heard of wolf davranches if its as bad as all that tuck ventured then why did you agree to take us there so quickly i didnt ken ye was godfearin gents right off did i he said i maybe thought you were like his nibs up there an yed give as good as get ye ken and now now i ken differentlike ye ent like them rascals up tcastle devil take em but even ol scratch wont have em i daresay alan gazed at the strangers with pleading eyes ye sure ye want to go up there we thank you for the warning if we had any other choice no doubt wed take your advice tuck told him but circumstances force us to go and go we must well dont ye worry said alan brushing crumbs from his clothes as he climbed to his feet ill still see ye right no matter an whats more ill say a prayer for yer safe return thank you alan tuck said thats most thoughtful hold tight to yer thanks he replied for ye might soon be athinkin otherwise with that subtle warning still hanging in the air the visitors and their rascal of a guide set off part three but where is will scadlocke quod rhiban to john when he had rallied them all to the forest one of these ten score is missing who should be stood at the fore with the best of scadlocke spoke young much sad tidings i give for i ween now in prison he lay the sherif s men fowle have set him a trap and now taken the rascal away ay and tomorrow he hanged must be as soon as ere it comes day but before the sheriff this victory could get four men did will scadlocke slay when rhiban heard this loathly report o he was grieved full sore he marshalled up his fine merrye men who one and together all swore that william scadlocke rescued should be and brought in safe once again or else should many a fayre gallant wight for his sake there would be slain our mantles and cloaks of deep lincoln green shall we behind us here leave well dress us six up as mendicant monks and i whist theyll not rhiban perceive so donned they each one of them habits of black like massepriests as such are from spayne and thus it fell out unknowingly that rhiban the reeve entertaind to the sherif bold rhiban proposed a sport for full confidence he had achievd if will could outshoot monk rhiban disguised the prisoner should earn a reprieve this sheriff was loath but at length did agree for a trick on the prisoner he planned before william scadlocke had taken his turn the sheriff had twisted wills hand chapter earl hughs castle was built on the ancient foundations of the old roman fort partly of timber and partly of the same bloodred stone the roman masons carved from the bluffs above the river so long ago it loomed over the town like a livid unsightly blemish inflamed and angry asquat its low hilltop for all the brightness of the day the place seemed to breathe a dark and doomful air and tuck shivered with a sudden chill as they passed through the gateas if the frost of bitter winter clung to the old stone refusing to warm beneath the autumn sun and although it was but a short distance from the town which carried its name caer cestre remained as remote behind its walls as any ffreinc stronghold across the sea this impression was due in part to the unseemly number of ffreinc soldiers loitering in the courtyardsome in padded armour with wooden practice weapons others standing about in clumps looking on and still others sitting or reclining in the sun there must have been twenty or more men in all and a good few women too and from the way they minced about the perimeter of the yard smirking and winking at each and all tuck did not imagine they were wives of the soldiers a heap of sleeping hounds lay in one corner of the yard dozing in the sun while nearby a group of stablehands worked at grooming four large chestnutcoloured hunting horsesbig rawboned heavyfooted beasts of the kind much favoured by the ffreinc striding along after the porter who conducted them to the hall the small procession consisting of two young foreigners a rotund priest their noble leader and a local guide caused nary a ripple of interest from anyone they passed upon entering the vestibule they were shortly brought to stand before the seneschal alan adale despite his many shortcomings performed the service of interpreter surprisingly well and they were admitted into the hall without the slightest difficulty whatever tuck breathed a prayer as they entered wolf hughs den a noisy and noisome room filled with rough board benches and tables at which men and women and even a few children appeared to be entering the final progressions of a nights debaucheven though the sun had yet to quarter the sky the roil of eating and drinking dicing and dancing flirting and fighting amidst gales of coarse laughter and musicians doggedly trying to make themselves heard above the revellers greeted the visitors like the roll and heave of a stormfretted sea in one corner dirtyfaced boys tormented a cat in another an amorous couple fumbled here a man already deep in his cups shouted for more wine there a fellow poked at a performing juggler with a fire iron hounds stalked among the benches and beneath the tables quarrelling over bones and scraps of meat there was even a young pig garlanded and beribboned wandering about with its snout in the rushes underfoot crossing the threshold bran paused to take in the tumult collected himself and then waded into the maelstrom here brans special genius was revealed for he strode into the great loud room with the look of a man for whom all that passed beneath his gaze in this riotous place was but dreary commonplace his arrival did not go unnoticed and when he judged he had gathered enough attention he paused his dark eyes scanning the ungainly crowd as if to discern which of the roisterers before him might be the earl by peters beard muttered tuck unable to believe that anyone entering the castle could experience so much as a fleeting doubt about which of the men at table was fat hugh only look for the biggest loudest most slovenly and uncouth brigand in the place he thought and thats the man and yet heres our bran standing straight and tall and searching each and every as if he could not see what was plain before his nose oh this shows a bit of sass does it not what is more tuck could tell from the curious look on the earls face that hugh was more than a little taken aback at the tall dark figure standing before him for there he was a very king in his own kingdom the infamous wolf davranches renowned and feared throughout his realm and who was this that did not know him and here was bran without so much as a word or gesture taking the overbearing lord down a peg or two showing him that he was nothing more than a wobblejowled ruffian who could not be distinguished from one of his own stablehands oh our canny king raven is that shrewd tuck considered a little courage seeping back into his own step he glanced at ifor and brocmael and saw from the frozen expressions on their faces that the two cymry appalled by what they saw were nevertheless struggling to maintain any semblance of calm and dignified detachment steady on lads tuck whispered alan adale however seemed at ease comfortable even walking easily beside tuck smiling even at the friars wondering glance he said been here before ye ken often once or twice i sing here of a time you sing alan oh aye bran silenced them with a look and turned to address the onlooking crowd qua est vir bran announced in that curious broken latin that passed for spanish among folk who knew no better qua est ut accersitus senor hugh the seneschal not understanding him looked to alan for explanation he conferred with tuck then replied my lord wishes to know where is he that is called earl hugh but he is there answered the chief servant as if that should be every whit as obvious as it was he indicated the high table where surrounded by perhaps six or eight ladies of the sort already glimpsed in the courtyard sat a huge man with a broad flat face and hanging dewlaps like a barnyard boar swathed in pale seagreen satin so well filled one could see the wavelike ripples of flesh beneath the tightstretched fabric he occupied the full breadth of a thronelike chair which was draped in red satin lined with ermine dull brown hair hung in long ropy curls around his head and a lumpy misshapen wart besmirched one cheek he held a drinking horn half raised his wide fulllipped mouth agape as he stared at the strange visitors with small inquisitive eyes i present my lord hugh davranches proclaimed the seneschal his voice striving above the commotion of the great room alan passed this along to bran who made a sour face as if he suddenly smelled something foul et et he said that even the seneschal understood him then of course he said stiffly who else without another word bran approached the table where the earl sat drinking with his women a strained silence fell at his approach as attention turned to the newcomers bran inclined his head in the slightest of bows and waved both tuck and alan to his side adveho sto hic dico lo quis ego detto he said grandly and tuck relayed his words to alan who offered his estimable lord count rexindo greets you in the name of his father ranemiro duke of navarre who wishes you well mon dieu exclaimed the earl his astonishment manifest bran looking every inch a spanish nobleman made another slight bow and spoke again when he finished he nodded at tuck who said speaking through alan count rexindo wants you to know that word of your fame has reached him in his travels and he requests the honour of a private audience with you duke of navarre eh said earl hugh never heard of him where is that it is a province in spain my lord explained alan politely the duke is brother to king carlos who is i know who king carlos is by the rood interrupted the earlheard of him he passed an appraising eye over the tall man before him then at his companions evidently finding them acceptable nephew of the king of spain eh however did you find your way to a godforsaken wilderness like this tuck and count rexindo conferred whereupon alan replied the count has been visiting the royal court and heard about the hunting here in the north eh hunting grunted the earl he seemed to remember that he held a cup in his hand and finished raising it to his mouth he guzzled down a long draught then wiped his lips on the sleeve of his green satin shirt as if this was the signal the room had been awaiting the hall lurched into boisterous life once more the earl slapped his hand on the board before him rattling the empty jars here clear him a place he began shoving his cups and companions aside to make room for his new guests sit all of you well share a drinkyou and your menand you can tell me about this hunting eh by saint mewans toe thought tuck hes done it our bran has done it earl hugh filled some empty cups from a jar and sent one of the women to fetch bread and meat for his new guests turning to regard his visitors from across the table he observed spaniard eh youre a long way from home bran gazed placidly back at him as alan translating tucks hurried whispers relayed his words that is so may it please god replied count rexindo even speaking through two interpreters his highborn courtesy was clear to see we have heard that the hunting in england is considered the best in the world this i had to see for myself he smiled and spread his hands so here i am the count drank from his cup while his words were translated for the earl smiling looking for all the world like a man at utter ease with himself and his fellows the women at the board seemed to find his dark looks attractive they vied for his notice with winks and nonetoosubtle smiles when alan finished count rexindo indicated his companions and conferred with his interpreter who said pray allow me to introduce the counts companions i present to you father balthus bishop of pamplona he said and tuck dipped his head in modest acknowledgement also i give you lord galindo of tolosaand here he indicated iforand next to him is lord ramiero of petilla brocmael solemn as the tomb inclined his head they are favourites among the counts many cousins if alan suspected that he was part of a cunning deception he did not let it show in the slightest on the contrary the further into the tale he delved the more comfortable he became and the more his admiration for the darkhaired young nobleman grew bran as count rexindo was a very marvel his manner his air his beingeverything about him had changed since entering that den of rogues even his voice had taken on a subtle quality of refinement and restraint tuck too was impressed for when bran spoke his madeup spanish it was with the light soft lisping tone of hibernia that tuck recalled in their friend from saint dyfrigs the stately brother jago slow boat that he was it finally occurred to the friar that this was where bran had got the names and titles and all the rest for them all all that time spent travelling together last spring bran had had plenty of time to learn all that and more besides from the spanish monk you like to hunt eh mused earl hugh into his cup so do i by the bloody rood so do i a brief conference between tuck alan and bran set the course for the next part of the plan give him to know that in spain i am renowned as a great hunter and that my father keeps a stable of the best horses in the realm there is nothing i have not hunted bran nodded make a good tale of it tuck but be sure to remember what you have said so you can tell me after tuck relayed to alan what bran had said and added his own warning and dont overegg the pudding boyo he said ill be listening mind so keep it pure and simple never fear replied alan who then turned to earl hugh and said my apologies lord the count is embarrassed by his lack of french but he wishes you to know that in his home country he is a very champion among hunters and has ridden to the hunt throughout spain his father the duke keeps a stable of the finest horses to be found anywhere in the realm the earl listened his interest piqued no finer horses than mine ill warrant he suggested when alan finished id like to see them did you bring any with you alas no lord answered alan without waiting to consult his master they are very valuable animals as you must imagine and could not be allowed to make a voyage however short a pity replied hugh i should like to have seen them in the flesh my own horses have been praised by those who know a good animal when they see one ill show them to you eh alan turned his head to receive the counts decision then said my lord would like nothing more than to have the pleasure of viewing your excellent animals then lets be at it said hugh hoisting himself from his chair with the aid of the board before him calling for his seneschal he motioned his visitors to follow and bowled from the hall with a lurching unsteady gait were well on our way men bran whispered to ifor and brocmael he said this next part will be in your hands are you ready both young men nodded good to tuck he added tell alan my lord said alan with a fishy grin at tuck it is not necessary as i speak a fair bit of cymry too ye ken you do amaze me bran confessed i begin to believe you were born to this just where did you learn to speak like that tuck wondered i mean no offence but you spoke like a roadside beggar before we passed through these gates alan lifted one shoulder in a halfhearted shrug it is useful for the earnin o a penny or two he said putting on the rough speech again as easily as a man putting on a hat a wanderin musician is a pitiful lump without his harp wandering musician echoed tuck a minstrel if ye like said alan how did you lose your harp the friar asked lets just say some lords appreciate a jest moren others ye ken bran laughed and clapped him on the shoulder i want you to stay with us while were herewill you do that ill reward you well perhaps when this is over we can even find you a harp i am honoured sire the beggar answered here now called earl hugh from a doorway across the way this way to the stables let the hunt begin said bran and the four spanish noblemen and their interpreter hurried to join their host chapter cel craidd merian held the long smooth length of ash between her fingers and carefully wrapped the thin rawhide strap in a tight spiral around the end placing the clipped halves of stripped feathers from a gooses wing just so as she slowly turned the rounded shaft half her mind was on her taskfletching arrows required patience and dexterity but consumed little thoughtand the other half of her mind was on the worrying news that had reached them the night before the news had come after nightfall merian and noin and two of the other women were tending to the evening meal and the rest of cel craidd was still at work some trimming and shaping branches of ash and yew for war bows or assisting siarles in splitting narrow lengths of oak for arrows two of the women were weaving hemp and linen for strings and tomas was helping angharad affix the steel points scarlet and his small host of warriorstwo of the younger women and three of the older childrenwere hard at work training to the longbowthey would practice until it was too dark to see and any who were not busy with either bows or arrows were tending the bean field the forest round about was sinking into a peaceful and pleasant autumn twilight and then they heard the long low whistle that signalled the return of the scoutsthose who had been away all day watching the kings road a few moments later rhoddi and owain tumbled breathless down the bank and into the settlement bearing the news sheriff de glanville had returned with upwards of fifty knights they came quick and they came quiet rhoddi said when he had swallowed a few mouthfuls of water and splashed a cup over his head it was already getting dark and they were on us before we knew it or we would have prepared a welcome for them wheres iwan asked siarles already halfway to flying off to his aid he stayed to watch and see if any more came along explained owain he sent us on ahead catching siarless disapproving glance the young warrior added there was nothing we could do there were just too many and we didnt have men or arrows enough to take em on we thought better to let be this once offered rhoddi rhi bran would have fought em said siarles given men enough and clear warning to get set in place aye agreed rhoddi king raven would have taken em on and no doubt won the day but we ent bran and we didnt have men enough or time iwan had returned a little while later to confirm what the others had said so now bloody hugo has fifty more knights to throw at us i hope bran and tuck fare well on their errandwell need all the help we can get i just wish there was some way to get word to them now as the sun beat down brightly upon their wildwood settlement merian looked around at the quiet industry around her iwans words circling in her mind like restless birds i might not be able to get word to bran she thought but i can do better than thati can raise troops myself in that moment she knew what she had to do she would go to her father and persuade him to join bran in the battle to drive the ffreinc out of elfael her father could command thirty perhaps forty men and each one trained to the longbow experienced archers would be more than welcome and added to however many men bran was able to raise would form the beginnings of a fair army she knew brans feelings about involving her father but he was wrong shed tried to persuade him otherwise and met with a stubbornnay pridefulresistance but in this matter of life and death she considered the outcome was just too important to allow such petty concerns to cloud good judgement they needed troops her father had them and that was that bran she knew would forgive her when he saw the men she would bring moreover if she left at once she could be back in cel craidd with the promise of warriors or better the warriors themselves before bran returned having made up her mind the urge to go reared up like a wild horse and she was borne along like a helpless rider clinging to its neck she made short work of the arrow she was fletching set it aside and rose brushing bits of feather from her lap i cant be wearing this home to meet my family she decided looking down at her stained and threadbare gown hurrying to her hut she went inside and drew a bundle down from the rafters untied it and shook out the gown she had worn as an italian noblewoman when accompanying bran on the mission to rescue will scarlet though of the finest quality the material was dark and heavy and made her look like an old woman nevertheless it was all she had and it would have to do as she changed into the gown she thought about what she would say to the family she had not seen for how long had it been two years three too long to be sure she brushed her hair and washed her face and then hurried off to prepare a little something to eat on the way and to ready a horse caer rhodl was no great distance it was still early if she left at once and did not stop on the way she could be there before nightfall are you certain my lady said noin with a frown when merian explained why she was saddling a horse while wearing her italian gown perhaps you should wait and speak to iwan tell him what you plan i am only going to visit my family replied merian lightly nothing ill can come of it then tell angharad she should merian was already shaking her head but you must tell someone i am said merian im telling you noin but i want you to promise me you wont tell anyone else until this evening when im sure to be missed promise me not even will no said merian not a word to anyoneeven will i should be at caer rhodl by the time anyone thinks to come looking for me and by then there will be no need take someone with you at least suggested noin her voice taking on a note of pleading we could tell will and he could go with you he is needed here answered merian brushing aside the offer besides i will be safe home before anyone knows it noins frown deepened a crease appeared between her lowered brows there are dangerous folk about she protested weakly i shouldnt worry replied merian a smile curving her lips the only dangerous folk here about are us she took the other womans hand and pressed it firmly ill be fine with that she took up her small cloth bag mounted quickly into the saddle and was gone she struck off along a familiar pathit seemed as if she had lived a lifetime in this forest were there any paths she didnt knowand with swift certain strides soon reached the kings road there she paused to take a drink of water from her stoppered jar and listen for anyone moving in the greenwood satisfied there was no one else about she crossed the road flitting quickly as a bird darting from one leafy shelter to another and rode quickly on just after midday the trail divided and she took the southern turning which if she remembered correctly would lead to her fathers lands in eiwas the day was warm now and she was sweating through her clothes she drank some more water and moved along once more riding a little slower now she was well away from cel craidd and there had been no sign of anyone following her except for a few stands of nettles and some brambles to be avoided the path was clear and bright and easy underfoot when she grew hungry she ate from the bag slung under her arm but she did not stop until finally reaching the forests southwestern border here at the edge of the great wood that formed the boundary of the march the land fell away to the south in gentle sloping runs of low grassy hills and wooded valleysthe land of her home as she gazed out upon it now merian was lifted up and swept away on wave after wave of guilt it was so close and all this time it had been awaiting her returnher family had been awaiting her return stepping from the forest she started down the broad face of a long hill towards the small winding track she knew would lead her homethe same track bran had used so often in the past when he came calling usually in the dead of night the thought sent another pang through her why oh why had she never tried to get home sooner it was no good telling herself that she had been taken prisoner and held against her will that had been true for only the first few moments of her captivity events had proven bran right baron neufmarche was a sly deceitful enemy and no friend of hers or her familys he had shown neither qualm nor hesitation in sending men to kill them following their escape once she understood that she had stopped trying to get away in fact she had been more than content to remain at brans side in his struggle to save elfael and after that first season the greenwood had become her home and truth be told she had rarely spared a passing thought for eiwas or her family since the reason was she decided because in her heart of hearts she knew there was nothing waiting for her at caer rhodl except marriagemost likely to an insufferable ffreinc nobleman of her fathers choosing in order to advance her familys fortunes and keep the cantref safe as true as that may have been it was still only part of the tale partly too her lack of interest in returning home was due to the fact that in the months following her abduction she had become a trusted member of king ravens council in cel craidd she was honoured and her presence esteemed by all and not merely some chattel to be packed off to the first norman with a title that her father deemed advantageous to befriend merian did not mean to condemn her father but in the precarious world her family inhabited that was the way things were in short with bran she had a placea place where she was needed valued and loved a place she did not have without him and that more than anything else had prevented her from leaving now bran needed her more than ever if he only knew it stubborn as an old plough horse bran had refused to even consider asking her father for aid they needed warriors lord cadwgan had them the solution was simple and merian was not so childish as to allow anything so inconsequential as stubbornness or pride or a misplaced sense of honour to stand in the way of obtaining the aid her people so desperately needed oh there was a question when exactly had she begun thinking of them as her people merian continued along the welltrod trail her mind ranging far and wide as her mount carried her unerringly home once she passed a farmer and his wife working in a turnip field they exchanged greetings but she did not turn aside to talk to them in fact she stopped only once for a short rest in a little shady nook beside the road she watered the horse then drank some herself and splashed some water on her face before moving on again the sun quartered the sky eventually beginning its long descent the sun was well down and the first stars were alight in the east when merian came in sight of caer rhodl the old fortress with its timber walls stood tall and upright on the hill the little wooden church quiet in the valley below the place breathed an air of peace and contentment in fact nothing about the settlement had changed that she could see everything was still just the same as she remembered it this thought gave her heart a lift as she hurried on reaching the long ramp leading to the gate which stood open as if awaiting her arrival a few more quick steps brought her through the gate and into the yard where merian paused to look around across the way two grooms were leading horses to the stables the horses were lathered lately riddenand at some distance and speed odd she had not seen them on the road and then she saw garran her brother merian had only the briefest glimpse of him as he disappeared through the entrance to the hall but she thought he was in the company of a young woman with a shout she called his name and started across the yard three men and several women stood talking near the kitchen they turned at merians cry and saw a darkhaired young woman in a long dark gown flitting across the yard here you shouted one of the men moving forward stop when merian gave no sign that she had heard him he cried out again and moved to catch her before she reached the hall here now he called stepping into her path where might you be going young miss so intent was she that it was not until the man took hold of her arm that she noticed him what she said feeling the mans hand tighten around her arm she tried to pull away let me go looking towards the door to the hall she cried garran garran its me be still said the man pulling her back you just stop that now were going to have a talk let me go she turned to face her captor and recognized him as one of her fathers men luc here now he said his eyes narrowing in suspicion how do you know my name luc its merian she said meriando you not know me a figure appeared in the doorway behind luc whats this merians gaze shifted to the hall entrance garran i warned you said her fathers man pulling her away come along youre going to release me merian wriggled in his grasp merian she turned to find herself looking into the face of her very astonished brother saints and angels merian he gasped is it really you oh garranthank god youre here ii she began and suddenly could not speak for the lump in her throat lady merian said luc forgive me on my word i didnt recognize you he turned and called to the others who stood looking on el rhys its lady merian come home the others surged forward clamouring all at once garran silenced them with a wave of his hand look at you he said lifting her face with a thumb and finger where have you been all this time father and motherare they here of course they are she said finding her voice again she started towards the hall im longing to see them come garran you can present me to the king when her brother did not move she turned to him again the solemn look on his face stopped her why what is it father is dead merian she heard what he said but did not credit the words where she asked come along im certain they merian no said garran firmly listen to me father is dead he was sick for a very long time my lady offered luc my lord cadwgan died last spring father dead her stomach tightened into a knot and her breath came in a gasp as the full weight of this new reality broke upon her it cant be garran nodded im the king now and mother she asked fearing the answer she is well replied garran although when she sees you some of the others who had gathered around spoke up where have you been they asked we were told you had been killed we thought you dead long ago i was taken captive merian explained i was not harmed who did this to you demanded luc tell us and we will avenge you my lady this outrage cannot be allowed to stand peace luc garran interrupted that is enoughwe will discuss this later now i want to take my sister inside and let her get washed you and rhys spread the news tell everyone that lady merian has come home gladly sire replied rhys who hurried off to tell the women standing a little way off rhi garran led the way into the hall and merian followed walking across the nearempty hall on stiff legs she was brought to her fathers chamber at the far end of the hall and paused to smooth her clothes and hair with her fingers before allowing garran to open the door she gave him a nod whereupon he knocked on the door lifted the latch and pushed it open the dowager queen sat alone in a chair with an embroidery frame on a stand before her with a needle in one hand and the other resting on the taut surface of the stretched fabric she hummed to herself as she bent over her work mother said merian stepping slowly into the room as if entering a dream where anything might happen dear god in heaven shrieked queen anora glancing up to see who it was that had entered the room mother i merian anora cried leaping up so quickly she overturned the embroidery frame she stretched out her arms to the daughter she had never hoped to see again oh merian come here child merian stepped hesitantly at first then ran and was gathered into her mothers embrace oh oh i she began and found she could not speak tears welled in her eyes and began to run down her cheeks she felt her mothers hands on her face and her lips on her cheek there now dear heart her mother said soothingly all is well now youre home oh mother iim so sorry she sobbed burying her face in the hollow of her mothers throat there are so many times i would have come to youso many times i should have come hush dearest one whispered queen anora stroking her daughters hair you are here now and nothing else matters she held merian for a time without speaking then said i only wish your father could have seen this day merian overcome with grief and guilt wept all the more im so sorry she murmured again so very sorry never mind anora sighed after a moment youre home now nothing else matters she held her daughter at arms length and cast her eyes over her as if at a gown or tunic she had just finished sewing youre half starved look at you merian youre thin as a wraith merian stepped back a little and looked down the length of her body smoothing her bedraggled clothing with her hands we have many mouths to feed and there is not always enough she began there was a movement behind her and a voice said quel est ceci merians shock at hearing the news of her fathers death was only slightly greater than that of seeing the women who had entered the room sybil gasped merian baroness neufmarche at the sight of merian lady agnes neufmarche put her hands to her face in amazement mon dieu merianne said sybil echoing her mothers astonishment prince garran stood to one side a half smile on his face enjoying the womens surprise at seeing one another again so unexpectedly merian saw his smile and instantly turned on him what are they doing here she hissed the baroness crossed quickly to her mon cher she cooed placing a hand on her shoulder how you must have suffered non merian reacted as if she had been burned by the touch she gave a start and shook off lady agness hand you she snarled dont touch me merian said garran have you gone mad why are they here demanded merian her voice quivering with pent rage tell me why theyre here lady agnes stepped back her expression at once worried and offended darling what do you mean asked her mother they are living here merian shook her head no she said backing away a step that cannot be it cant listen to you replied the queen gently why ever not garran is married now sybil is his queen the baroness is spending the winter here helping sybil settle in and begin her reign merians horrified gaze swung from the baroness to the slender young queen standing mute and concerned beside her garran moved to take sybils hand and she leaned toward him it is true merian said garran we were married four months ago im sorry if we failed to seek your approval he added sarcasm dripping from his voice my lord said anora her tone sharp that was not worthy of you forgive me mother garran said inclining his head i think the excitement of this meeting has put us all a little out of humour come merian you are distraught be at peace you are among friends now friends is it scoffed merian some friends the last time we met they tried to kill me chapter on your mettle my lords said alan adale glancing over brans shoulder across the yard where the earl of cestre had just appeared at the stable door everyone ready asked bran ifor and brocmael nodded their brows lowered with the weight of responsibility that had been laid upon them when we get into the forest bran continued find your place and mark it well if we should become separated go back to the head of the run and wait for us there whatever happens dont linger in the run waiting for one of hughs men to see you we know what to do said ifor speaking up for the first time since entering the ffreinc stronghold count on us added brocmael finding his voice at last we wont fail just you and alan keep the earl busy my lord the friar said let tuck and his young friends here worry about the rest if any of the earls men come looking for us ill make sure they dont twig to the lads doings here never fear bran nodded and drew a deep breath he arranged his features into the curiously emptyeyed slightly bored guise of count rexindo then turned to greet the earl with his customary short bow and pax vobiscum earl hugh waddling like a barnyard sow came puffing up already red faced and sweating with the exertion of walking across the courtyard accompanying him were two of his men rough fellows in oncefine tunics spattered with wine stains and grease spots each with a large dagger thrust into his leather beltnasty brutes by both look and smell behind these two trailed three more stout ffreinc in leather jerkins and short trows with high leather leggings they wore soft leather caps on their heads and leather gauntlets on their hands with which they grasped the leashes of three hunting hounds the dogs were grey longlegged beasts with narrow heads and chests and powerful haunches each looked fully capable of bringing down a stag or boar all on its own strength pax pax said hugh as bran stepped to meet him good day for a chase eh indeed replied bran speaking directly through alan now i am keen to see if the trails of england can match those of spain ho cried the earl in joyous derision my hunting runs are second to nonebetter even than angevin which are renowned the world over count rexindo sniffed unimpressed when the earls boast was relayed to him he turned his attention to the dogs walking to the animals and wading in amongst them his hands outstretched to let them get his scent it did not hurt that he had rubbed his palms and fingers with the meat he had filched from the supper platter the previous night the hounds nuzzled his hands with ravenous enthusiasm licking his fingers and jostling one another to get a taste bran smiled and stroked their sleek heads and silken muzzles letting the animals mark and befriend him very unusual these dogs he said through alan what breed are they ah yes said hugh rubbing his plump palms together these are my boysa breed of my own devising he declared proudly there are none like them in all england not even king william has hounds as fine as these this required a small conference whereupon the count replied through his translator no doubt your king must spare a thought for more important matters allowed count rexindo with a lazy smile but never fear my lord earl if your dogs are even half as good as you say i will not hold your boast against you the earl flinched at the slight you will not be disappointed count replied hugh he called for the horses to be brought outlarge wellmuscled beasts heavy through the chest and haunches hughs own mount was a veritable mountain of horseflesh with a powerful neck and thick solid legs with the help of a specially made mounting stool and the ready arms of his two noblemen fat hugh hefted himself into the saddle but when the earl saw bishop balthus likewise struggling to mount he called out in ffreinc you there priest tuck paused and regarded him with benign curiosity this hunt is not for you you stay here although tuck understood well enough what was said he appealed to alan giving himself time to think and alerting bran to the problem once it was explained to him bran reacted quickly my lord balthus rides today or i do not he informed the earl through alan he tossed aside the reins and made as if preparing to dismount alan softened this blunt declaration by adding pray allow me to explain my lord the earl frowning mightily now gave his permission with an irritated flick of his hand you see alan continued it seems count rexindos father required bishop balthus to make a sacred vow never to allow the count out of his sight during his sojourn in england eh wondered the earl at this odd revelation truly my lord confessed alan he leaned forward in the saddle and confided i think my lord the duke believes his son a little too ah spirited for his own good he is the dukes only heir you understand it is the bishops head if anything ill should befall the count earl hughs glower lightened somewhat as he considered the implications of what he had just been told let him come then said the earl changing his mind so long as he can keep his saddlethe same as goes for anyone who rides with me alan explained this to count rexindo who picked up the reins once more gracias senor he said the dog handlers departed from the castle first and after a few rounds of the saddle cup the riders followed hugh and count rexindo led the way followed by the earls two knights the two young spanish lords ramiero and galindo followed them and bishop balthus fell into line behind the others thinking that if he was last from the start no one would mark him dawdling along behind wish us gods speed alan he said as he kicked his mount to life godspeed you my lord replied alan raising his hand in farewell and send you his own good luck out through the castles rear gate they rode a fair number of the earls vassals were at work in his fields and from his vantage point at the rear of the procession tuck could not help noticing the looks they got from the folk they passed some glared and others spat one or two thumbed the nose or made other rude gestures behind the backs of the earl and his men it was sobering to see the naked hostility flickering in those pinched faces and tuck mindful of his bishops robes smiled and raised his hand blessing those few who seemed to expect it once beyond the castle fields the hunting party entered a rough countryside of small holdings and grazing lands hedged about by dense woodland through which wide trails had been clear cutearl hughs vaunted hunting runs wide enough to let a horse run at full gallop without getting slapped by branches either side they pursued a lazy curving pattern into the closegrown wood a few hundred paces inside the entrance the dense foliage closed in cutting off all sight and sound of the wider world this tuck considered would serve their purpose right fairif ifor and brocmael could keep their wits about them in the tangle of bramble thickets and scrub wood brush that cloaked the edges of the run the party rode deeper into the wood and tuck listened to the soft plod of the horses hooves on the damp turf and breathed the warm air deep as the sun rose and the greenwood warmed he began to sweat in his heavy robes he allowed himself to drop a little farther behind the others and noticed that the two young welshmen had likewise fallen behind the leaders the search has begun thought tuck soon the others were some distance ahead tuck picked up a little speed and drew up even with the welshmen be about your business lads he said as he passed by them ill go ahead and keep watch and give a shout if hugh or his men come back this way ifor and brocmael stopped then and tuck rode on still taking his time keeping his eye on bran and earl hugh and the others now fading into the dappled shadow of the trail far ahead when he had put enough distance between himself and the two behind him the friar reined his mount to a stop and waited listening he heard only the light flutter of the breeze lifting the leaves of the upper branches and the tiny tick and click of beetles in the long grass he had almost decided that hugh and the others had forgotten about them when he heard the sound of returning hoofbeats in a moment he saw two horses emerge from the shadowed pathway ahead the earl had sent his knights back to see what had happened to the stragglers glancing quickly behind him tuck searched for a sign of his two young comrades but saw nothing hurry lads he muttered between his teeth the wolf s pups are nosing about then as the two ffreinc knights neared tuck squirmed ungracefully from the saddle and stooping to the right foreleg of his mount lifted the animals leg and began examining the hoof there was nothing wrong with it of course but he made as if the beast might have picked up a stone or a thorn as the two hailed him in french he let them see him digging at the underside of the hoof with his fingers one of the knights directed a question at him as much as to say what goes here mon cheval est tuck began he pretended not to know the word for lame or limping either so just shrugged and indicated the hoof the two exchanged a word and then the second knight dismounted and crossed to where he stood he bent and raised the hoof to examine it tuck stole a quick glance behind the two tardy welshmen were nowhere in sight sending up a prayer for them to hurry he cleared his throat and laid his finger to the hoof in the huntsmans hand pointing to a place where he had been digging with his finger une pierre he said that the animal had picked up a pebble was perhaps the most likely explanation and the knight seemed happy with that boiteux he asked tuck shrugged and smiled his incomprehension the knight released the hoof and took hold of the bridle and walked the animal in a circle around him studying the leg all the while finally satisfied that whatever had been wrong was no longer troubling the beast he handed the reins back to tuck saying pendre seile tuck took his time gathering his bishops skirts and with the help of the knight to boost him fought his way back onto the high horse taking up the reins once more he heard the sound of hoofbeats thudding on the trail behind he turned in the saddle to see ifor and brocmael trotting towards them tuck hailed them and satisfied now that the stragglers were all together once more the ffreinc knights led them up the game run to rejoin the others they soon came to a small clearing where count rexindo and earl hugh were waiting at that moment the hounds gave voice la chasse commence cried the earl and lashing his horse galloped away followed by his knights bran wheeled his mount but lingered a moment to ask success just as we planned my lord replied ifor brocmael made a furtive gesture indicating the empty lance holder attached to his saddle and said never fear we were not seen well done said bran now we hunt and pray we sight the game before our beefy host nothing would please me more than to steal the prize from under hughs long ffreinc nose chapter three days of hunting from earliest daylight to evening dusk and each day bran having taken a great interest in the earls hounds greeted the dogs with morsels of food he had saved from the previous nights supper boardgobbets of meat he kept in a little bag tuck watched the process with fascination and admiring approval as earl hugh swallowed the bait in a manner not at all unlike his hounds and all because count rexindo let it be known that he wanted to buy three or four of the animals to take back to spain as a gift for his father the duke the evergreedy earl welcomed the sale of course fixing the price at a princely thirty marksa price that made tucks eyes water he could never have brought himself to buy three smelly hounds when he might have built an entire churchaltar to steeple and everything in betweenand had money left over having favoured the hounds they mounted their horses and all rode out to spend the day working the runsto be followed by a nights drinking and roister in the hall by the fourth day earl hughs nightly feasting began to tell on them alleveryone except bran somehow bran seemed to bear up under the strain of these allnight revels awaking the next morning none the worse for his excesses indeed tuck began to think him blessed with the fortitude of samson himself until he noticed the trick friar tuckhimself an enthusiastic consumer of the earls good wine and fortifying meathappened to discover brans secret the second night bran quaffed as readily as the next man however the instant their hosts attention wandered elsewhere quick as a blink brans cup dipped below the board and the contents were dashed onto the soiled rushes under their feet thereafter he drank from an empty vessel until it was filled again and the process was repeated from then on tuck did the same himself even though it pained him to throw away good drink wolf hugh himself was ragged and mean of a morning soreheaded stinking of stale wine and urine his eyes red and his nose running as he shuffled from his chambers bellowing for food and drink to drive the demons from head and belly still he seemed to possess unusual powers of recovery and by the time the sun had breached the castle walls the earl was ready to ride to his hounds once more steady as a stone and keen for the chase on the third day tuck freely complained that the nightly debauch was too much for him and begged bran to let him observe the hunt from the rails of his bed but bran insisted that they must go on as they had started ifor and brocmael had youth on their side and tolerated the revelry but were increasingly reticent participants alan adale fared less well and was laid low of a morning on the fourth day the earl decided to rest the horses and hounds he had business to attend to with some of his nobles leaving his guests free to take their ease and amuse themselves as they would bran let it be known that he wanted to go into the town and attend the market and so they did a hundred paces beyond sight of the castle gate he gathered his crew around him and said you are doing very well lads i beg but a little more patience and we are done we will not abide here much longer how much longer asked alan adale next time we ride that might be tomorrow brocmael pointed out bran nodded then we best make certain everything is ready today the two young men glanced at one another do you think the earl will tumble ifor wondered why not replied bran he suspects nothing if all goes well we should be far away from here before he learns what has happened regarding the solemn expressions on the faces of his two young comrades he gave them his slightly twisted smile if he ever learnsand i strongly suspect he never will bran resumed his stroll into the town with alan at his side leaving tuck and the two young lords to reckon what had just been said dont you worry lads tuck said trying to bank their courage a little higher by tomorrow night well be well on our way back to wales with our prize and beyond the claws and teeth of wolf davranches a short while later they entered a fairsized market in full cry merchants shouting for custom animals bawling dogs barking bran paused and surveyed the comely chaos for a moment good he said there are enough people about that we should not draw undue attention to ourselves you all know what to do brocmael and ifor nodded grimly bran opened his purse and fished out a few pennies this should be enough he told them we are not clothing him for his coronation mind we know what to do said ifor then off you go return here when you are finished and wait for us when they had gone bran tuck and alan commenced their own particular quest have you given any thought to my idea asked bran as they began to stroll among the stalls and booths of the busy market that i have tuck replied and oh i think it should workalthough i am no doghandler it seems a simple enough matter does it not we will require a little oil and perhaps an herb or two to mix with itsomething strong but not too offensive no doubt if angharad were here she would know better but she is not here so we look to you now bran said what do you suggest essence of angelica for the oil tuck answered after a moments consideration it is light yet easily stains a cloth get it on your skin and it lingers long even after you wash excellent just the thing said bran he gazed around at the seething crowd of people and animals what do you say alan will we find what we need here i expect so my lord i know of a pothecary who comes to market most days and the herbs he asked what are we looking for there are severalany one of which will suffice tuck mused aloud lavender is strong but not unpleasant it is distinctive and not to be mistaken for anything else there is also thyme marjoram or sage any of those i think or all of them come to that bran commended his cleric happily splendid one day alan here will laud your native saxon cunning from one end of this island to the other lord help us i dont want to be lauded tuck told him id as soon settle for a month of peace and quiet in my own snug oratory with nary a king or earl in sight he paused considering i think about that do i not he caught brans expression and said i do sometimes bran shook his head ah tuck my man you were born for greater things so you say the world and his wife says different methinks the three waded into the busy square and made short work of purchasing the items required alan prevailed upon the apothecary to mix the lavender and angelica oil for them and add in the herbs this made a fairly sticky concoction with a strong odour which seemed right for the purpose they also bought a stout hemp bag with a good leather cord to close it and then wound their way back to meet their two young companions and see how they had fared we bought these said brocmael offering up the bundle of goods they had purchased not new mind but good quality still looking doubtful he added i would wear them it cost but a penny ifor explained so we bought a cloak as well he shook out a hooded cloak and held it up it was heavy wool of a tight weave dyed green it had once been a handsome thing made perhaps for a nobleman it was slightly faded now and patched in several places but wellmended and clean no doubt hed choose a better one ifor admitted looking to bran for approval but needs must and this is better for hiding he will be glad of it bran assured him youve done wellboth of you so nowhe looked around with the air of a man about to depart for territories unknowni think we are ready at last with that the party began making their way back to the castle the day had turned fair and bright the breeze coming inland from the sea was warm and lightly scented with the saltandseaweed smell of the bay they walked along in silence as thoughts turned to the danger of what lay ahead all at once bran stopped and said we should not go on this way which way should we go alan said this is the shortest way back to the castle i mean bran explained it will not do to rouse the wolf in his den tuck puzzled over this a moment and said dunce that i am your meaning eludes me i fear if we return to the caer like thisall longfaced and fretfulit might put the earl on edge tonight of all nights we need the wolf to sleep soundly while we work i agree of course tuck replied so pray what is in your mind a drink with my friends bran said come alan i daresay you know an inn or public house where we can sit together over a jar or two right you are there mlord im the man fer ye he declared lapsing once more into that curious beggar cant he adopted from time to time fret ye not whit nor tiddle theres ale aplenty in caer cestre jist pick up yer feet an follow alan he turned and led the little group back down the street towards the centre of the town it is a commonplace among settlements of a certain size that the better alehouses will be found fronting the square so as to attract and serve the buyers and sellers on market days and although the normans ruled the town of late it was still saxon at heart which meant if nothing else that there would be ale and pies alan pointed out two acceptable alehouses and they decided on the one that had a few little tables and stools set up outside in the sun there were barrels stacked up to one side of the doorway forming a low wall to separate the tables from the bustle of the square they sat down and soon had jars of sweet dark ale in their fists and a plate of pies to share amongst them i would not insult you by repeating your instructions yet again bran said setting his jar aside you all know what to do and need no reminding how important it is he looked each in the eye as he spoke one after the other as if to see if there might be a weakening of will to be glimpsed there but if any of you have any questions about what is to come ask them now it will be the last time we are together until we cross the river bran mindful of the trust he was placing on such young and untried shoulders wanted to give the two welshmen a last opportunity to ease their minds of any burdens they might be carrying but each returned his gaze with studied determination and it was clear the group was of one accord and each one ready to play his part to the last nor did anyone have any questions save only their guide and interpreter there is something ive been thinking these last few days mlord alan said after a slight hesitation and maybe now is a good time to ask as good a time as any agreed bran what is in your mind alan it is this he said lowering his eyes to the table as if suddenly embarrassed to speak when you leave this place will you take me with you bran was silent watching the man across the table from him he broke off a bit of crust from a pie and popped it into his mouth you want to come with us bran said keeping his voice light that i do alan said i know im not a fighting man and of no great account by any books who would say a thing like that teased bran i know what i know insisted alan seriously but i can read and write and i know good french and english some welsh and a little latin i can make myself usefulas i think ive been useful to you till now i may not be all if that is what you want said bran breaking into alans carefully prepared speech youve served us well alan and we could not have come this far without you if we succeed we will have you to thank bran reached out his hand yes well take you with us when we leave alan stared at brans offered hand for a moment then seized it in his own and shook it vigorously you will not be sorry mlord i am your man so the five sat for a while in peace enjoying the ale and the warmth of the day talking of this and thatbut not another word of what was to come when they rose a little later to resume their walk back to castle davranches it was with lighter hearts than when they had sat down they slipped back into the castle and went to their separate quarters to prepare for the next days activities that night at supper bran baited and set the snare to catch wolf hugh chapter ah there you are cried earl hugh as his spanish guests trooped into the hall with him at the table were several of his courtiers six or seven of the women he kept and new to the proceedings five ffreinc noblemen the others had not seen beforelarge looming wellfleshed normans of dour demeanour judging from the cut and weave of their short red woollen cloaks white linen tunics and fine leather boots curled hair and cleanshaven faces they were more than likely fresh off the boat from france their smiles were tightalmost grimacesand their eyes kept roaming around the hall as if they could not quite credit their surroundings indeed they gave every appearance of men who had awakened from a pleasant dream to find themselves not in paradise but in perdition heres trouble whispered bran through his smile not one norman to fleece but five more as well we may have to hold off for tonight no doubt you know best tuck said softly and even as he spoke an idea sprang fullbloomed into his round saxon head yet here may be a godsend staring us dead in the eye what do you see bran said still smiling at the ffreinc who were watching from their places at the board he motioned alan and the others to continue on saying keep your wits about you everyoneespecially you alan remember this is why we came turning once more to tuck he said speak it out and be quick what is it it just came to me that this is like john the baptiser in herods pit brans mouth turned down in an expression of exasperated incomprehension we dont have time for a sermon just now friar if you have something to say king gruffydd is john tuck whispered and earl hugh is herod and who am i then it is obvious is it not not to me bran muttered he gestured to the earl as if to beg a moments grace so that he might confer a little longer lord bless you tuck sighed do you never pay attention when the holy writ is read out still id have thought some smattering of the tale would have stuck by you tuck tell me quick or shut up bran rasped in a strained whisper were being watched youre solome of course refresh my memory the dancing girl bran gave him a frustrated glare and turned away once more just you be on your guard the two approached the board where the earl and his noble visitors were waiting alan standing ready smiled broadly for the normans and made an elaborate bow my lords i give you greetings in the name of count rexindo of spainhe paused so that bran might make his own gesture of greeting to the assembled lordsand with him lord galindo and lord ramierohe paused again as the two young welshmen bowedand father balthus bishop of pamplona tuck stepped forward and thinking it appropriate made the sign of the cross over the table welcome friends bellowed earl hugh already deeply into his cups sit sit and drink with us tonight we are celebrating my good fortune my lords herehe gestured vaguely at the five newcomersbring word from normandie that my brother has died and his estates have passed to me i am to be a baron baron davranchesthink of that eh my sympathies for the loss of your brother replied the count he was a rascal and wont be missed or mourned sniffed the earl but he leaves me the family estates for which i am grateful a fine excuse for a drink then remarked count rexindo through his able interpreter i can think of none better than sudden and unexpected wealth bran sent up a silent prayer that none of the earls new guests could speak spanish and took his place on the nearest bench the rest of his company filled in around him two of the womenone of whom had been openly preening for the counts attention ever since he stepped across the thresholdbrought a jar and some cups she placed these before bran and then bent near to fill thembending lower and nearer than strictly necessary the count smiled at her obvious attentions and gave her a wink for her effort such blatant flirtation was shameless as it was bold but then tuck reflected shame was certainly an oddity in earl hugh davranchess court and quite possibly unknown nevertheless as bishop balthus tuck felt he should give the brazen woman a stiff frown to show his clerical displeasure he did so and marked that it did nothing to chasten her nor did it prevent her from insinuating herself between him and the handsome count oh well thought tuck as he slid aside to make room for her with a toothsome prize in sight folk are blind to all they should beware ofand that has been true since adam first tasted apple juice the jars went round and round filling cups and bowls and goblets and then filling them again earl hugh in a high and happy mood called a feast to be laid for this impromptu celebration of his windfall of good fortune his musicians were summoned and as the kitchen servants began laying a meal of roast venison on the haunch loaves of bread rounds of cheese and bowls of boiled greens a gang of rowdy minstrels entered the hall and commenced perpetrating the most awful screech and clatter pushing an already boisterous gathering into a barely restrained chaos tuck viewed the convivial tumult as a very godsend for it offered a mighty distraction to lull suspicious minds he glanced around the board at his nearest companions alan seemed to be watching the roister in an agony of want as jar after jar passed him by yet lord bless him he resisted the temptation to down as many as might be poured and contented himself with coddling his one small cup ifor and brocmael true to their duty resisted the temptation to indulge and passed the jars along without adding anything to their cups bran as count rexindo on the other hand became more expansive and jolly as the evening drew on he not only filled his own cup liberally but was seen to fill others as wellincluding those of the earl and the hovering women engaging the visiting norman lords in loud conversation about hunting and fighting and the likewith the aid of alans ready tonguehe drew them out of their stony shells and coaxed a laugh a time or two therefore no one was the least surprised when he rose from his seat and hoisted his cup high and announced again through alan i drink to our esteemed and honoured host who is with me of course everyone stood with him thenas who would not and raised their cups shouting attente attente the spanish count tipped down a great draught of wine wiped his mouth and said speaking loudly and with some little passion my friends and i have enjoyed our sojourn here in your realm my lord earl your hospitality is as expansive as your girth the earl looked puzzled as this was spoken and alan quickly corrected the counts meaning saying generosity as expansive as your generosity my lord please excuse my poor translation he means your hospitality is as great as your generosity it is nothing replied earl hugh grandly nothing at all i must beg your pardon my good earl replied count rexindo a little blearily but it is not nothing to me in spain where all the virtues are accorded great regard none sits higher in our esteem than the welcome given to kin and countrymen and the strangers in our midst his words came across a little slurred through the wine though alan cleaned them up as one who knows something of this i can say with all confidence that your hospitality is worthy of its great renown he lifted his cup once more i drink to you most worthy and esti estimable lord to earl hugh came the chorused acclaim all drank and everyone sat down again and made to resume the meal but count rexindo was not finished yet alas the time has come for us to leave tomorrows hunt will be my last but it will be memorable he paused to allow these words to penetrate the haze of drink and food befogging his listeners heads indeed all the more if our exalted earl will allow me to suggest a certain refinement to tomorrows ride of course of course cried the earl his spirits lofty goodwill overflowing like the wine sloshing over the rim of his cup anything you desire he said with an airy wave of his hand anything at all he smiled his ruddy face beaming with pride at the way hed been feted and flattered by the young count in the presence of his visiting noblemen how very gracious of you my lord in truth i expected nothing less from one whose largesse is legendary count rexindo replied beaming happily come man bellowed the earl thumping the table with his hand what is it that you want name it and it is done count rexindo all smiles and benevolence gave a little bow and said in my country when a lord wishes to make a special hunt in honour of his guests he releases a prisoner into the wild i can assure you that it is sport second to none ah there it is thought tuck our bran has remembered his bible story at last it took a moment for the earl and the others to work out what had just been suggested hunt a man said the earl his smile growing stiff yes my lord agreed the count still standing still commanding the proceedings a criminal or some other prisonersomeone of no account it makes for a very good chase but began the earl glancing around the table quickly he saw his other guests looking to him expectantly tuck saw the hesitation and instantly the distress that followed and knew the earl was well and truly caught in brans trap surely that is unworthy of your attention hugh replied lamely why not choose something else i see i have overreached myself the count said sitting down at last i understand if you have no appetite for such rich sport no no earl hugh said quickly seeing the frowns appear on the faces of his gathered noblemen having accepted the counts effusive praise for his untethered largesse how could he now refuse to grant rexindos wish he had no wish to appear tightfisted and mean before his noblemen so like a ferret trapped in a snare squirm though he might he could not get free without gnawing off one of his own legs did i say no i am intrigued by your suggestion he offered and would be eager to try it myself it is just that i keep no criminals here as it is i have only one captive in my keep and he is too valuable concluded count rexindo his disappointment barely contained i understand the earl glanced around at his noblemen as if to explain saw their frowns growing and his own reputation diminishing in their eyes and hastily reconsidered however it seems to me that this prisoner would be well worthy of our sporta king in his own country who has enjoyed my hospitality far too long already splendido cried the count through alan he continued it will give me a chance to try the hounds i am buying again a slight hint of a grimace crossed the earls face he did not like the idea of using valuable dogs for such dangerous sportespecially considered tuck dogs that had not yet been purchased this required a small conference whereuponbut rising to the bait the earl shrugged off his misgivings why not he roared stirring the feast to life once more why not i say here let us drink to the count and to tomorrows sport thus the trap was set and sprung and the prey neatly captured tuck waited until the festivity slowly resumed and when the music and drink were once again in full spate he rose bowing to their host who had recovered his good cheer he approached the earls chair and with alans help declared this game you propose sits ill with me i do confess my lord does it he replied lazily does it indeed how so pray the hunting of men is an abomination before the throne of god before the earl could reply he added true it is a custom long honoured in spain and elsewhere but one that the church does not endorse this rocked the old wolf back a step or two he frowned and swirled the wine in his cup if i told you that this rogue of a prisoner has earned his death ten times over would that make it sit more comfortably with you perhaps tuck allowed though i would still wish to give the wretch the benefit of absolution by your leave earl i will hear his confession and shrive him now then he will be ready to face his ordeal with a clear mind and clean soul seeing that bishop balthus was determined and he equally anxious to maintain his toplofty dignity in the eyes of his guests earl hugh agreed then do so he said as if it had been his own idea all along he put his nose in his cup once more do so by all means if it pleases you one of my men will take you down to him tuck thanked him begged his dinner companions to excuse his absence and then departed in the company of the earls seneschal who was standing at the door the friar made his way down and down into the lowvaulted undercastle to the hostage pit to see for the first time the man they had come to free leaving the hall and its uproar behind they passed along a dark narrow corridor to an even darker more narrow passage through the castle inner wall to a round chamber below what must have been the guardhouse attendre ici sil vous plait said the seneschal who disappeared up the steps to the room above returning a few moments later with a dishevelled man who had very obviously been drug from his bed yawning the guard applied a key to an iron grate that covered a hole in the floor unlocked it and pulled back the grate he took up a torch from a basket on the floor lit it from the candle in the seneschals hand and beckoned bishop balthus to follow a short flight of spiral steps led them to another passage at the end of which stood another iron grate which formed the door of a cell upon reaching the door the guard thrust his torch closer and in the fitful light of it tuck saw the prisoner slumped against the wall with his head down legs splayed before him hands limp at his sides palms upward with his thick and matted tangle of hair and beard he looked more like a bear dressed up in filthy rags than a man once again the guard plied the key and after a few moments huffing and puffing the lock gave and the door swung open squealing on its rusted hinges like a tortured rat the prisoner started at the sound then looked around slowly hardly raising his head but he made no other move or sound stepping past the gaoler tuck pushed the door open farther and relieving the porter of his torch entered the cell it was a small square room of unfinished stone with a wooden stool a threelegged table and a pile of rancid rushes in one corner for a bed although it stank of the slop bucket standing open beside the door and vermin crawled in the mildewed rushes the room was dry enough two bars of solid iron covered a square window near the top of one wall and an iron ring was set into the opposite wall to this ring was attached a heavy chain which was in turn clamped to the prisoners leg i will shrive him now tuck said to the guard the fellow settled himself to wait leaning against the corridor wall he picked his teeth and waited for the bishop to begin you are welcome to stay of course said tuck speaking as the bishop kneel down i will shrive you too understanding came slowly to the guard but when it did he opened his mouth to protest come insisted the smiling bishop we all need shriving from time to time kneel down he directed or leave us in peace the gaoler regarded the prisoner shrugged and departed taking the key with him tuck waited and when he could no longer hear the mans footsteps on the stairs outside he knelt down before the prisoner and declared in a loud voice sure to be overheard pax vobiscum the prisoner made no reply nor gave any sign that he had heard lord gruffydd can you hear me are you well tuck asked his voice hushed at the sound of these words spoken in his own language by a priest the king raised his head a little and in a voice grown creaky from disuse asked who are you friar aethelfrith tuck replied softly i am with some others and we have come to free you gruffydd stared at him as if he could not make sense of what he had been told free me yes the captive king pondered this a moment then asked how many are with you three tuck said it cannot be done gruffydd replied his head sank down again not with three hundred much less three take heart tuck told him do as i say and you will soon gain your freedom rouse yourself and pay me heed now i must tell you what to do and we do not have much time chapter count rexindo and his entourage assembled in the yard to await the appearance of the earl and his men the stablehands and idlers in the yardmany who had been in the hall the night beforewatched them with an interest they had not shown in several days word of the days unusual sport had spread throughout the castle and those who could had come to observe the spectacle for themselves under the gaze of the earls court bran gathered his company at a mounting block near the stables and traced out the steps of his plan one last time all listened intently keenly aware of the grave importance of what lay before them when he finished bran asked you gave lord gruffydd the oil tuck i did the friar answered and brocmael here has the clothes we bought bran glanced at the young man who patted a bulge beneath his cloak alan you know what to say he asked placing his hand on the fellows shoulder and searching his face with his eyes that i do my lord come what may i am ready never let it be said alan adale was ever at a loss for words well then bran said gazing around the ring of faces its going to be a long and dangerous day god knows but with the good lords help well come through it none the worse and the hounds asked ifor leave them to me answered bran there was a noise in the yard as the earl and his companyincluding the five ffreinc noblemen they had feasted with the previous nightemerged from the doorway across the yard he gave brocmael and ifor an encouraging slap on the back and sent them on their way to the horses lads see you keep your wits about you and all will be well as the two young welshmen moved off to fetch their mounts bran composed himself as count rexindo then straightening himself he turned smiled and offered a goodnatured salute to earl hugh out of the side of his mouth he said pray for all youre worth good friar i would have gods aid and comfort on this day hey now tuck replied its potent prayers im praying since first light this morning am i not trust in the lord our cause is just and we cannot fail the earl and his company came into earshot then and the count piping up said pax vobiscum mes ami alan added his greeting and gave the earl a low bow he did not in any way deserve pax said hugh he rubbed his fat hands and glanced quickly around the yard looking for his hounds and handlers the lately arrived ffreinc noblemen stood a little apart stifflegged and yawning with faces unshaven and eyes rimmed red they appeared ill rested and queasy in the soft morning light clearly they were not accustomed to the roister and revel such as took place in castle cestre of an evening the earl shouted across the empty yard his voice echoing off the stone walls in response to his call a narrow door opened at the far end of the stable block and the porter entered the yard pulling a very reluctant prisoner at the end of a chain behind him here here said hugh a moment later from a door at the other end of the stables the hounds and their handlers entered the yard the hounds seeing the horses and men assembled and waiting began yapping with eager anticipation of the trail as hounds will count rexindo however took one look at the chained captive and began shaking his head gravely this is very bad he said speaking through alan who made a sour face as he spokeso as to emphasize the counts displeasure no good at all in truth it was very bad years of captivity had reduced the welsh king to little more than a rank sack of hair and bone his limbs wasted through disuse were but spindles and his skin dull and grey with the pallor of the prison cell the bright morning light made him squint and his eyes watered although he was so hunched he could hardly hold himself erect gruffydd nevertheless attempted to display what scraps of dignity he still possessed this served only to make him appear all the more pathetic my lord the count says that this prisoner will not serve alan informed the earl why not wondered hugh what is wrong with him the spanish count flicked a dismissive hand at the shambling ragged baggage before him and conferred with his interpreter who said this man is in such wretched condition the count fears it will be poor sport for us the hunt will be over before it has begun the count shook his head haughtily please get another prisoner but this is the only one i have god love you retorted the earl although he too peered at the captive doubtfully tuck wondered wonder how long it had been since the earl had last laid eyes on the welsh lordseveral months at least he reckoned perhaps years i say he will serve hugh said stiffly in any event he must for there is no other alan and count rexindo held a short consultation whereupon alan turned and said begging your pardon lord earl but the man is clearly unwell if he cannot give good chase there is little point in pursuing him we regret that the hunt must be abandoned with your permission we will bid you farewell and prepare instead to take our leave the earl frowned mightily he was that unused to having his will thwarted that he became all the more adamant that the hunt should take place as planned he argued with such vehemence it soon became clear to the others that the earl and his visiting noblemen had wagered on the outcome of the days huntor more likely which among them would draw first blood having set such great store by his prowess he was now loath to see that particular prize elude him the hunt will go ahead he declared flatly and motioned for the porter to remove the chains from the prisoner this was your idea after all count we will make what sport of it we can count rexindo accepted the earls decision with good grace he seemed to brighten then and said something to alan who translated let it be as you say lord earl as it happens the count has thought of a way to make a better game of it we will not use the dogs and this will give our quarry a fighting chance not use the dogs scoffed the earl but see here i thought you wished to try them one last time before the purchase alan and the count held a brief discussion and alan replied it is not done this way in spain he explained however the count allows that you know your realm best might he suggest using just one hound if you agree the count would like to use one of the dogs he will buy moreover he is prepared to wager that he will make the kill today how much will he wager wondered hugh his pig eyes brightening at the thought whatever you like answered alan it makes no difference to the count one hundred marks answered the earl quickly alan relayed this to rexindo who nodded appreciatively done shouted the earl turning to bishop balthus he said you priest mark this you are a witness to the wagerone hundred marks silver to the one who makes the kill tuck gave him a nod of acceptance wondering where on gods green earth bran imagined he would find such a princely sum ifheaven forbid ithe should lose the wager meanwhile bran ignoring the stare of the captive king who stood shivering but a few paces away instead approached the hounds and walked in amongst them holding out his hands as he was wont to do allowing the dogs to lick his fingers and palms he chose one from among those he had marked to buya big sleek shaggy grey creatureand rubbed the animals muzzle affectionately reaching into the pouch at his belt he brought out a morsel hed filched from last nights meal and fed it to the hound rubbing the dogs nose and muzzle all the while this one he said through alan let us take this one with us and leave the others the earl happy with the choiceall the more so since it meant he would not risk his other hounds developing a taste for this unusual gameagreed readily count rexindo then gestured to his two young attendants and directed them to take charge of the prisoner relacher le captif alan said to the gaoler who began fumbling at his belt for the key to the shackles the earl frowned again as the chains fell away and it appeared he might have second thoughts about disposing of such a valuable prisoner in this way the hound was given to sniff the captives clothing and as the two young nobles began marching the prisoner away he protested here now what goes alan explained the count has ordered his men to take the wretch to the head of the hunting run and release him they are to ride back here and tell us as soon as it is done and then the chase will begin he paused regarding the ffreinc noblemen then added with this many hunters there will surely be no sport unless the prey is given a fair start go then directed earl hugh and hurry back all the sooner spying one of the servants just then creeping across the yard he shouted tremar bring us a saddle cup the man seized up like a thief caught with his hand in the satchel then spun about and ran for the hall entrance two of them roared hugh as the man disappeared to his noblemen he added hunting is such thirsty business when count rexindo finished with the hounds he turned and walked back to where bishop balthus stood and the cleric saw the count slip his fingers back into the pouch at his belt replacing the rag that had been liberally doused with herb oil and with which he had smeared his palmthe same that had stroked the dogs nose and muzzle do you think it will work tuck whispered as the grooms brought out the horses or are we mad we can but pray still if gruffydd has followed your instruction he said we have a chance at leastif he can endure the hunt he motioned alan to him and said you had best come with us today we may need you tell the earl that count rexindo requires the aid of his servant and to bring a horse for you can you ride i can keep a saddle my lord he answered good man as alan arranged for himself to accompany the hunt a servant appeared with two saddle cups overflowing and these were passed hand to hand around the ring of gathered hunters the ffreinc noblemen revived somewhat with the application of a little wine and were soon showing themselves as keen as the earl to begin the days amusement watch them muttered bran as he passed the cup to tuck and alan once more we have the measure of hugh but as for thesewe dont know them and cannot tell how they will behave once were on the trail they may be trouble i will keep my eye on them never fear tuck told him the grooms brought the horses then and to pass the time the hunters examined the tack and weapons it had been decided that each would have two spears and a knife ample weapons to bring down a defenceless prey by the time the counts two young attendants returned from their errand the earl was in a fever to begin the pursuit despite any lingering misgivings about losing a valuable captive the idea of hunting a man had begun to work a spell in him and like the hounds he cherished so much waiting chafed him raw at the earls cry the company took to their saddles and clattered from the yard earl hugh sang out for count rexindo to ride with himwhich of course bran was only too happy to doand they were off at first ifor and brocmael and tuck pretended to be as eager for the pursuit as those around them they kept pace staying only a little behind the earl who was leading the chase the ffreinc noblemen thundered along behindso close that tuck could have sworn he could hear the bloodlust drumming in their veins they reached the head of the game run at the gallop and entered the long leafy avenue in full flight rather than wait for the hound and handler to catch up earl hugh proceeded headlong down the run with count rexindo right beside after a few hundred yards or so the count swerved to the right as if to begin searching that side of the run two of the ffreinc noblemen went with him and the rest followed the earl however no one turned up a trail so the party slowed eventually coming to a halt there was nothing for it but to return to the head of the run and await the hound which was not long in coming nor was the animal slow in raising the scent of the fugitive only a few hundred paces into the run the great grey beast gave out with a loud baying yelp and leapt ahead straining at the leashand the party was away once more this time they were led directly to the tree where ifor and brocmael had hidden brocmaels spear a few days earlier the hound bawling and barking all the way upon arrival the hunters discovered a heap of filthy ragsthe prisoners ratty clothes now cast aside the dog handler picked up the heap of rags and showed it to the earl whose eyes narrowed he is smart this one he said with grudging appreciation but it will take more than that to throw one of my dogs off the scent to the handler he said give him to mark the handler shoved the bundle against the dogs muzzle to renew the scent and the hound began circling the tree to raise the trail once and again and then three more timesbut each time the beast stopped in the place where the clothes had lain confusing himself the more and frustrating his handler we must raise another scent my lord reported the handler at last this trail is tainted tainted growled hugh the man shed his clothes is all give the hound his head and he will yet raise the trail the handler loosed the hound from the leash and urged it to search a wider area around the tree this time the dutiful hound came to stand before count rexindo who gazed placidly down from his saddle as the dog bayed at him lontano said the count waving the dog away the handler pulled the animal off but time and again the fuddled dog ran between the heap of clothing on the ground and count rexindo on his horse finally the handler picked up some of the rags and gave them a sniff himself then approaching the earl he handed up the rags there is some mischief here sire he said as you will see the earl gave the scraps a sniff and straightened in the saddle what he sniffed again what is that lavender methinks replied the handler tainted as i said the earl looked around suspiciously how in the devils name count rexindo impatient and keen to be off spoke up and alan offered the count says that clearly the dog is useless our prey cannot be far away he suggests we spread out and raise the trail ourselves yes yes replied earl hugh you heard him eh he said to the ffreinc noblemen go to itand give a shout when you find the trail so all scattered each a separate way the count led the search farther down the run and several of the ffreinc followed that way bishop balthus led lords galindo and ramiero to the opposite side of the run and began searching thereall of them knowing full well that gruffydd would not be found chapter caer rhodl merians fingernails dug deep grooves in her palm and she fought to control the rage she felt roiling inside her she did not expect the ladies neufmarche to understand much less accept the least part of what she had to tell them they would refuse to listen call her liar heap scorn upon her so be it her mother and brother however could be counted on to support her once she had explained what had happened the day she was abductedas well as all that had happened sinceshe knew they would rally to her aid without question she drew a calming breath and organized her thoughts deciding how she would relate the events of the past two years in the greenwood then raising her head she squared her shoulders and put her hand to the latch she pushed open the door to the hall and stepped inside they were all assembled to hear her lady agnes beside her daughter queen sybil and in the next seat her brother garran beside him sat her mother the dowager queen anora the two ffreinc women sat erect grimfaced clearly unhappy they had heard the accusations merian had laid at their feet her brother the king appeared no happier drawn and somewhat haggard he was torn between his own family and that of his new bride only her mother looked at all sympathetic offering her a sad smile and saying do come along merian we have been waiting for you pray forgive me she said moving farther into the room she saw there was no chair for herself very well she would stand it was better this way taking her place before them she folded her hands and glanced at each in turn i see you have been discussing the problem of merian already youre not a problem to be solved my dear her mother replied but we thought it wise to talk a little among ourselves before seeing you again you will appreciate how awkward some of the things you have said said lady agnes these allegations if it please you my lady interrupted garran we will yet come to that first he declared turning to face his sister i want you to know that these are grave charges you have made and we are taking them very seriously naturally replied merian feeling more and more like a criminal with each passing moment she rankled against the feeling be assured brother i would not have declared them if they were not true we do not doubt you merian her mother put in quickly but you must see how difficult this has become difficult merian snapped her voice instantly sharp mother you have no idea living in the greenwood with the dispossessed who have been driven from their homes and lands whose hands have been cut off or eyes gouged out for petty offences and imaginary crimes is difficult living in a hovel made of sticks and mud and covered with animal skins in deep forest where the sun cannot penetrate and stifling every stray sound for fear of discovery is difficult creeping place to place careful to stay out of sight lest the ffreinc soldiers see you is difficult hiding day on day from a sheriff who slaughters any unfortunate who happens to cross his paththat is difficult grubbing in the dirt for roots and berries to feed enough merian snapped her brother his tone matching hers we know youve suffered but you are home now and safe there is no one in this room who wishes you harm mind your tongue and we will all fare the better for it your brother is right mon cher said agnes neufmarche controlling her tone her welsh was fair if simple that she was able to speak it at all merian considered a revelation we are your family now we seek nothing but your good how kind merian retorted and was it for my good that your husband the baron pursued me and tried to kill me of course you have endured the ordeal terrible agnes granted loftily yet knowing my husband as i do i cannot accepteraccept this as the truth merian stiffened she had been expecting this you would call me liar jamais said the baroness i suggest only that perhaps in your fear you mistook the barons ah laction as the assaut she glanced to her daughter who supplied the proper word as an attack said sybil is that what you think challenged merian you were there that day sybil you saw what happened is that what you think bran was forced to flee for his life he took me with him yesat first i thought he meant to abduct me for ransom but it was to save me he saw the danger i was in before i did and he acted when the baron discovered our escape he sent men to kill us both very well said garran irritably granting what you say is true what can be done about it now he stared at his sister his lips bent in a frown of deep dissatisfaction its been two years merian things have changed what do you want me to do there it was the question she had been anticipating her sole reason for coming i want she replied taking time to choose her words carefully i want you to join with us i want you to raise a war band and come help us recover elfael us wondered garran it was not a response merian had anticipated have you lived so long among the outlaws that you no longer know where your true loyalties lie my loyalties she blinked at him in confusion i dont understand what your brother is saying offered anora is that the affairs of elfael are nothing to do with us you are safe now you are home what is past is past but the fate of elfael is my worry motheras it is for all cymry who would live free in their own country she turned to her brother the king and his nervous young queen beside him that is where my loyalties lie brotherand where yours should lie too unless that bit of french fluff beside you has addled your mind you would know this her brother bristled careful merian dear you will go too far i am sorry she said changing her tone from haughty selfrighteousness to appeal she smoothed the front of her gown beneath her hands and began again i truly do not mean to offend but if i cannot speak my mind here in this room among those who know me best then perhaps i do not belong here anymore in any event the urgency of my errand leaves me little choice she licked her lipsbaron de braose has been banished from his lands and holdings in england and wales as you may have heard by now elfael is in the hands of abbot hugo de rainault and the kings sheriff richard de glanville without the baron to back them up they are weak this is the best chance weve had in many years to drive the invaders from our landbut we must strike soon the sheriff has brought more men and we must act quickly if we are to keep our advantage if you were to we know all this her brother interrupted elfael belongs to the king now i should not have to remind you that to go against red william is treason to raise rebellion against him will get you drawn and quartered at the white tower and your pretty head fixed to a pike above the gates de braose stole the land from bran and his people king william promised justice but betrayed bran and kept the land for himself he is the king countered garran it is his right to do with it what pleases him oh truly said merian growing angry again is that what you think you would sing a different song if the kings greedy eye was on your throne brother mine or has baron neufmarche already bought your throne for the price of a wife merian warned her mother that is beneath you non sil vous plait put in the baroness do not tax her so she has had the traumatisme yes she is not herself in time she will see that the famille neufmarche means only good for the people of this realm thank you lady agnes said garran as always your judgement is most welcome to merian he said brans affairs are nothing to do with us he has become an outlaw and a rebel and will pay with his life for his crimes of that i have no doubt do not speak to me of crimes merian said her face flushing hot abbot hugo and the sheriff rule with blood and terror they hang the innocent and subject the cymry living beneath their rule to all manner of torment and starvation they are the real criminals and chief among them is king william himself she tried one last desperate appeal listen to me please bran and his people are preparing for war they mean to take the fight to the invaders and there is every chance they can succeed but they need help glancing at queen sybil whose face appeared unnaturally white and pinched with worry she said join us help us overthrow this wicked throne and restore the rightful king to elfael no said her brother we will speak no more about it then there is nothing more to say merian turned on her heel and prepared to walk from the hall and out through the gates stunned by her brothers outright rejection the only thing she could think was returning to cel craidd and that if she hurried she might make it back before the night had passed where do you think to go merian king garran called after her to the greenwood she said i am needed there it is plain to me now that i have no place here you will not leave the caer garran informed her she spun around and stormed back to confront her brother who are you to tell me where i will or will not go father is dead garran replied until you are wed and have a husband i am your guardian moreover i am king and you are a member of my household you will obey me in this my guardian when did you ever lift a finger to help me dear brother demanded merian her defiance gave her a terrible aspect but garran stood his ground i am a lady in my own right and i will not submit to your ridiculous rule you will never see those outlaws again garran told her with icy calm never you will remain here for your own protection the audacity of the command stole the warm breath from her body how dare you it is for your own good merian said her mother trying to soften the blow you will see i see very clearly already mother merian retorted i see i was wrong to come here i see that you have all made your bed with the enemy where once there was a family i see only strangers mark me you will yet curse this day you are much mistaken sister garran said oh indeed agreed merian she began backing away thinking my own flesh and blood would understand and want to helpthat was my mistake she turned once more toward the door but do not worry dear hearts it is not a mistake i will make again she pulled open the heavy door stepped through and slammed it shut behind her with a resounding crack she marched out into the yard her heart roiling with anger at the unfeeling hardness of her own nearest kin how could they fail to see the need and refuse her plea for help their intimate contact with the ffreinc had corrupted them poisoned their judgement and tainted their reason that was the only explanation merian shuddered she too had come very close to succumbing to that same corruption once if bran had not rescued her she would be like her brother nowperhaps married off to some odious norman nobleman or other she would rather be dead merian strode to the stable brought out her horse and led it to the gateonly to find it closed open it please she said to the gateman a young man with a bad limp forgive me my lady he began spare me she snapped open the gate at once i am leaving lord help me i cannot why she demanded why not my lord king garran said i was to keep it locked and let no one in or out until he told me otherwise oh he did she said well i am sure he did not mean me open the gate at once sorry my lady he mentioned you especiallysaid it was more than my life was worth to let you pass the young man crossed his arms across his chest and stood his ground merian stepped around him and moved to the gate at that moment there came a call from across the yard and three menatarms issued from the hall and ran to apprehend her now now lady merian come away from there said the first to reach her you are to follow uskings orders and if i should refuse the warrior made no reply but simply wrapped his arms around her waist and hoisted her off her feet she shrieked her outrage and kicked at his legs the remaining two warriors joined the first and all three laid hold merian was hauled back to the hall in a spitting rage and thrown into her room no sooner had the door been shut than she began hammering on it with her fists shouting to be let out scream all you like it will avail you nothing came the voice of her brother through the planking of the door let me out she cried when you are prepared to listen to reason he replied blandly and pledge to rejoin your true family to the devil with you her only reply was the sound of the heavy iron bar dropping into place outside and her brothers retreating footsteps chapter when a painstaking search of the hunting run and woodland surrounding the tree where the captives castoff clothing had been found failed to turn up any trace of their human prey the hunters moved down the run and deeper into the forest owing greatly to count rexindos many wrongheaded interventions the company was subtly led farther and farther away from any path gruffydd might have taken thus spending the entire day without discovering their quarry or raising even so much as a whiff of his trail as twilight began to glaze the trails with shadow the frustrated company was forced to conclude that the captive king had miraculously eluded their pursuit it appeared that brans audacious plan had worked all that remained was to suffer the wrath of a very angry earl and then they too would be free the spanish visitors endured an extremely acrimonious ride back to the fortress the earl fretting and fuming all the way cursing everything that came to mindmost especially count rexindos ineptitude and the incompetence of spaniards in general as well as his own misguided complicity in a foolbait scheme which had not only cost him a very valuable prisoner but also had returned a powerful enemy to the battlefield courage men counselled bran as they paused before the doors of the hall it is soon over to ifor and brocmael he said are the horses ready the young men nodded good whatever happens be ready to depart on my signal we may have to bolt they entered a hall much subdued from the previous night where before the walls had reverberated with song and laughter this nights supper was taken in sullen silence and bitter resentment count rexindo and his retinue braved the blast of illwill with stoic silence as they listened to hugh davranches alternately berating one and all for their gross failure and bemoaning the loss of his captive as the drink took hold of him the livid simmering anger gave way to morose distemper with the earl declaring loudly for all to hear that he wished he had never laid eyes on count rexindo and his miserable company this then was the signal for the visitors to make their farewells and remove themselves from the castle the count having been seen to bear the earls complaints and abuse with the good grace of one who could not grasp the more subtle nuances of insult in a foreign tongue rose from his seat and with the aid of his able interpreter said no one is more sorry than i that we have failed today still it is in the nature of things that the hunter is sometimes outwitted by his prey and must return to his hearth emptyhanded he gave a slight shrug i myself blame no one it happens we live to hunt another day but a man would be a fool to remain where his friendship is no longer welcome or valued therefore i thank you for your hospitality my lord and bid you farewell oh well done thought tuck rising at brans gesture as bishop he gave the earl a small benedictory flourish and turning followed the count from the hall what about the hounds cried hugh after the departing count too late he remembered the money he hoped to make on the sale of his expensive animals alan taking the counts elbow restrained him and whispered into his ear rexindo shook his head gave a final gesture of farewell and stepped through the door i am sorry my lord alan said standing with his hand on the latch but the count says that he could not possibly consider buying such illtrained and ungovernable beasts as the one he witnessed today he has withdrawn his offer you may keep your dogs with that alan disappeared following bishop balthus lord galindo and lord ramiero across the threshold and into the corridor beyond as soon as the heavy door shut behind them they fairly flew to the stable and relieved the grooms of the care of their horses rexindo true to his noble spanish character paid the grooms a few silver pennies eachas much to buy their aid as for their unwitting diligenceand with kind words and praise bade them farewell the chief groomsman pleased and charmed by the counts noble treatment led the company from the yard and opened the gate for them himself as they mounted their horses bran reached down a hand to alan if you still want to come with me he said without hesitation alan adale grabbed the offered hand and bran pulled him up to sit behind him at last having successfully skinned the wolf in his den the short ride to caer cestre became a jubilant race in the fading evening light the company came clattering into a nearly deserted town square where they dismounted and quickly made their way to the docks to meet king gruffydd when a cursory search failed to find him they split up and each taking a separate street began combing the town this too failed perhaps he is waiting at one of the inns suggested alan bran commended the idea and said you and tuck go look there ifor brocmael and i will wait for you at the wharf in case he should come there the two hurried off and were soon approaching the first of the river towns three innsa place called the crown and keys despite the somewhat lofty ambitions of its name it was a low place smuggy with smoke from a faulty chimney and poorly lit a cushion of damp reeds carpeted the uneven floor upon which rested one long table down the centre of the room with benches on either side four men sat at the table and the brewmistress stood nearby to fetch the necessaries for her patrons one glance into the room told them they must pursue their search elsewhere the next innthe starwas the place where theyd sat outside in the sun and enjoyed a jar on a day that now seemed years ago inside the single large room was full of travellers and townsfolk pipers had taken up residence beside the great hearth and the skirl of pipes lent a festive atmosphere to the room it took them longer here to look among the tables and investigate all the corners alan asked the alewife if anyone answering gruffydds description had been seen in or about the place that day nayno one like that its been a quiet day all told she said shouting over the pipers not being a market day ye ken they had another look around the room and then moved on to the last of the towns innsa mean place only a rung or two up from a cattle stall with a few small tables and a few nooks with benches it had little to recommend it but its ready supply of ale which many of the boat trade seemed to prefer judging from the number of seafarers in the place again they quickly gleaned that not only was king gruffydd not in the room but no one answering his description had been seen that day or any other tuck thanked the owner and he and alan hurried back to rejoin bran and the others at the dock what now asked ifor when alan finished his report weve looked everywhere i told him where to go said tuck i made certain he understood maybe hes hiding in a barn or byre somewhere suggested alan when you took him out to the hunting run said bran what did you tell him to come to the dock in town and wait for us there said iforhe said he would then i think we must assume he is not in the town at all suggested bran otherwise hed be here tuck considered this he never made it you mean either that confirmed bran or he took matters into his own hands and fled elsewhere you think he didnt trust us to get him away safely said brocmael ifor countered this saying he knew we were kinsmen and he was keen as the blade in my belt to be leaving caer cestre at last he said hed reward us right well for helping him did he say anything else asked tuck he kept asking about lord branabout why he would risk so much to free him what did you tell him bran asked we told him he would have to speak to you my lord your reasons were your own it does not seem as if he feared to trust us remarked tuck something ill must have befallen him what now asked alan again its back to foul hughs hunting run bran decided we must try to raise gruffydds trail and track him downthis time in earnest well get what rest we can tonight and ride as soon as it is light enough to see the trail beneath our feet he hesitated then added in any event finding gruffydd might be the least of our worries why said tuck what else the ship is gone only then did it occur to tuck to look among the vessels at anchor along the dock and in the central stream of the river it was true the iberian boat that had brought them was no longer to be seen i thought he said hed wait for us he said his business would take him no more than a week bran corrected maybe he finished sooner than he expected or its taken longer alan pointed out the two young noblemen shared a worried glance and tuck sighed bless me when it rains it pours never mind said bran so long as we stay out of sight of the earl well make good our escape the welsh border is only a day and a half away we can always ride if need be they found a dry place on the dock among piles of casks and rope and settled down for a restless night it was warm enough but as night drew on clouds drifted in bringing rain with the approach of dawn tuck awoke when his face grew wet and then could not get back to sleep so contented himself with saying the psalms until the others rose and they departed once more leaving alan adale behind in case the iberian ship should return skirting the earls stronghold they made for the hunting run by the time they reached the place where gruffydd had shed his prison rags for those supplied by his rescuers the sky was light enough and they could begin making out marks on the trail ifor and brocmael dismounted and on hands and knees began searching the soft earth in the undergrowth around the tree where the clothes had been hidden ifor found a mark which he thought could have been made by the butt of a spear being used as a staff and before bran and tuck could see it for themselves brocmael working a little farther on called out that he had found a halfprint of a shoe bran and tuck dismounted and hurried to where the darkhaired young nobleman was waiting it is a footprint no doubt agreed tuck when he saw it but is it our man or one of the ffreinc handlers that is the question is it not follow it instructed bran see if you can find out where it leads the trail was slight and difficult to follow which made the going slow meanwhile the sky flamed to sunrise in the east by the time they had determined that the tracks they were finding did indeed belong to king gruffydd the sun was up and casting shadows across the manystranded pathways of the wood this is not good observed bran gazing upwards at the cloudswept heavens my lord said tuck following his glance what do you see hes going the wrong way bran pointed out were being led deeper into the wood and away from the town so they were but there was nothing for it they had to follow the trail wherever it led and eventually arrived at a sizeable clearing on the southfacing slope of a hill in the centre of which was a small house made of mud and wattles brush and beech saplings and small elm trees were growing up around the hovel and the grass was long clearly the steading had been abandoned some few years agono doubt when the earl became its nearest neighbour the surrounding wood was actively reclaiming the clearing and had long since begun to encroach on what once had been fine welldrained fields the grass still bore the faint trace of a path someone had walked through the place not long ago at the edge of the clearing the searchers paused to observe the house do you think hes down there my lord asked ifor he is affirmed bran or was lets find out he lifted the reins and proceeded into the old field the house was decrepittwo of the four walls were in slow dissolving collapsebut the upright posts still stood strong and stout crossbeams supported what was left of the roof go and see he told ifor the rest of us will wait here so that we dont make more of a trail than is here already the young man hurried off and the others watched his progress across the field until he disappeared around the far side of the house they waited and ifor reappeared a moment later signalling them to come on ahead by the time the others reached the house they found a very groggy king gruffydd sitting on a stump outside the ruined doorway and ifor sprawled on the ground clutching his head i nearly did for your man here said gruffydd looking up as bran swiftly dismounting came to stand over him he woke me up and i thought he was a ffreinc come to take me back you hit him said tuck kneeling beside the injured ifor aye admitted the king i did and for that i am heartily sorry tuck jostled the young mans shoulder are you well ifor ifor groaned well enough he grunted between clenched teeth i think he broke my skull i said i was sorry lad offered gruffydd somewhat testily have you brought anything to eat what are you doing here bran asked we waited for you in the town why didnt you come the grizzled king frowned as he watched tuck gently probing the young mans head i got lost bran stared at the man unable to think of anything to say its eight years since i was beyond the walls of that vile place gruffydd explained i must have got muddled and turned around and the air made me tired the air repeated bran dully i expect thats so offered tuck considering his lordship hasnt been out of that cramped cell in a good long while his endurance might have suffered in that time it makes sense i apologize my lord said bran then it never occurred to me that your strength would be impaired im not impaired curse your lying tongue growled the king i was just a little tired is all he made to stand and tottered as he came to his feet he swayed so much tuck put out a hand to steady him then thought better of it and pulled it away again have you brought me a horse we had no time to get you one bran replied but it isnt faryou can share with one of us i will not ride behind anyone the king asserted stiffly you can have my horse sire volunteered brocmael ifor and i will share for all its only back to town bran nodded we best be on our way i want to be as far from here as possible when wolf hugh realizes what has been done to himif he hasnt guessed already dismounting quickly brocmael gave over the reins of his horse and helped his king into the saddle then he vaulted up behind ifor and the party set off the fastest way to the town was along one of the hunting runs towards the castle as the morning was still fresh bran decided the need for a speedy retreat outweighed the concern of being seen so they made their way to the nearest hunting run and headed back the way they had come they passed along the slightly undulating greenwalled corridor eyes searching the way ahead alert to the barest hint of danger even so danger took them unawares they had just rounded a blind bend and as the leafbounded tunnel of the run came straight they saw in the near distance a hunting party riding towards them without a word the four fugitives urged their mounts into the brake and were soon concealed in the heavier undergrowth amongst the trees do you think they saw us asked ifor drawing up beside bran impossible to say replied bran dismounting he darted back toward the run stay here everyone and keep the horses quiet do as he says instructed tuck sliding from the saddle he followed bran and found him crouched in the bracken peering out from beneath lowhanging yew branches onto the run any sign of them he said creeping up beside bran not yet whispered bran laying a finger to his lips in a moment they heard the light jingling of the ffreinc horses tack and the faint thump of hooves on the soft earth as they came bran flattened himself to the ground and tuck likewise they waited holding their breath the first of the riders passedone of the visiting ffreinc noblemen who had ridden with them the previous dayscouting ahead of the others at that moment there was a rustling of brush behind them and king gruffydd appeared is it him demanded gruffydd is it wolf davranches shh bran hissed get down just then the main body of hunters passed four knights and earl hugh riding easily in the early morning there he is said gruffydd starting up again quiet said bran that vile gutbucketill have him growled gruffydd charging out of the brake bran made a grab for the king caught him by the leg and pulled gruffydd kicked out shaking bran off and stumbled out onto the run the riders were but a hundred paces down the run when the welsh king appeared out on the open track behind them he gave a shout and one of the riders turned saw him and jerked hard on the reins ici arret he cried wheeling his horse hes insane snarled bran out from the wood he leaped snagged the king by the neck of his cloak and yanked him back under the bough of the yew tree release me shouted the king wrestling in his grasp youll get us all killed growled bran dragging him farther into the wood let them come sneered gruffydd shrugging off brans hands im not afraid jesu forgive said tuck to himself stepping quickly behind the king he tapped him on the shoulder gruffydd turned and the friar brought the thick end of a stout stick down on the top of his head with a crack the king staggered back a step then lurched forward hands grasping for the priest tuck gave him another smart tap and the kings eyes fluttered back in his head and he fell to his knees good work tuck said bran catching gruffydd as he toppled to the ground from the hunting run there came a sound that set their hearts beating all the faster hounds the first dog gave voice followed by two others hurry get back to the horses dragging the halfconscious king between them they fought through the bracken and tangled vines of ivy to where ifor and brocmael were waiting with the horses get his clothes off him directed bran pointing to gruffydd as brocmael and ifor began stripping off the welsh kings clothing bran laid out his plan fly back to town and make for the docks find alan and have him get any ship thats going bran began shucking off his boots ill keep them busy while you make good your escape the baying of the hounds seemed to fill the forest now drawing ever nearer what are you going to do said tuck watching bran pull off his tunic and trousers give those to me he took gruffydds tunic and cloak from ifor get his trousers there was shouting from the hunting run the hunters had found their trail as the others hefted an unresisting gruffydd into the saddle bran pulled on the welsh kings trousers and stuffed his feet into his boots ill stay with you said tuck no said bran go with them take care of gruffydd if i dont find you before you reach the town see you get yourselves on the first ship sailing anywhere leave the horses if you have tojust see you get clear of the town with all haste god with you said tuck as bran disappeared into the forest racing towards the sound of the barking dogs we should stay and help him ifor said he can take care of himself replied the priest struggling into the saddle believe me no one knows how to work the greenwood like rhi bran im staying ifor declared drawing his sword put that away lad tuck told him theres been enough disobedience for one day well do as were told with a grimace of frustration the young welshman thrust his blade back into the scabbard and the three took to flight leading brans horse with the wounded king slung sideways across his mount like a bag of grain they worked deeper into the wood and heard briefly shouts echoing from the direction of the hunting run and horses thrashing into the closegrown bushes and branches there was a crashas if a horse or its rider had fallen into a hedgeand then a cry of alarm followed by other shouts and the frenzied barking of the hounds sighting their quarry then slowly the sounds of the chase began to dwindle as the pursuit moved off in another direction the riders continued on eventually working back to the head of the hunting run by this time gruffydd was able to sit up in the saddle so they lashed their horses to speed and made quick work of the remaining distance keeping out of sight of the castle until they reached the track leading to caer cestre alan was there on the wharf waiting where theyd left him he waved as tuck and the others came in sighta quick furtive flick of his hand tuck then saw why alan was trying to warn them his heart sank for between alan and the dock stood two of the ffreinc noblemen they had been hunting with the day before and there was no ship in sight chapter leaping ducking dodging through the thickgrown woodland tangle like a wild bird bran flew towards the sound of the baying hounds in a little while he reached the edge of the hunting run and burst out onto open groundnot more than a few hundred paces from the hunting party four men on horseback lances ready they were standing at the edge of the run watching the wood and waiting for the dogs and their handler to flush the quarry into the open so they could ride it down it was their usual way of hunting only this time their quarry was bran without a moments hesitation bran put his head down and ran for the opposite side of the wide grassy corridor he had made it but halfway across when there arose a shout behind him arret arret he ran even faster and reached the far side of the hunting run and flashed into the undergrowth with the riders right behind there was more shouting behind him and the sound of ringing steel as the four knights began hacking their way into the wood bran found a big elm tree and paused to catch his breath he waited until he heard the hounds again and then darted off once more this time working his way back through the woods in the direction of the earls castle the chase was breathless and frantic the hounds were quick on his scent and as fast as bran hurtled through the brake the dogs were faster still it was only a matter of time before he would be caught and brought to bay he ran on trying his best to put some distance between himself and the hunters he heard the slavering growls as the beasts closed on him he was searching for a heavy branch to wield as a club when the first hound finally reached him the dog bounded over a fallen limb and bran turned meet it the animala great longlegged rangy grey beasthowled once and leaped for him bran standing still in the path made no move to flee instead he held out his hands here come old friend come to count rexindo the dog confused now hesitated then identifying the man who had fed him and befriended him it gave a yelp of recognition and ran to bran put his paws on his chest and began licking brans face good fella said bran thats right were friends here come with me lets run bran started off again with the dog loping easily beside him they were joined by a second dog and within another dozen running steps the third hound came alongside the four of them dogs and man flowed through the forest with the ease and grace of creatures born to the greenwood quickly outdistancing the handler and the hunters still sitting on their horses in the hunting run they came onto a path lying roughly parallel to the hunting run a few flying steps farther and it began sloping down towards a stream which would bran guessed lead to the river and the river to the town this way boys called bran hurtling down towards the water they splashed into the stream and continued on at a slower pace after a time bran paused to listen he heard nothingno crack and swish of branches no shouts of hunters keen on the trail no sounds of pursuit at all he had outstripped the chase and without the constant howling of the dogs to lead them the hunters were floundering far far behind and likely on a different path altogether he paused in the stream then stooped and cupped water to his mouth and swallowed down a few gulps then stood sunlight splashing down from a gap in the branches overhead and drew the moist air deep into his lungs the sky was clear and blue the day stretching out fine before him come on lads said bran lets go home they resumed their long walk splashing downstream sometimes in it more often on the wide muddy bank the dogs did not follow so much as accompany himnow running ahead now lagging behind as they sniffed the air for scent of errant game bran kept up a steady pace pausing to listen every now and then but heard nothing save the sounds of the forest some little time later the woodland began to thin and he glimpsed cultivated fields through the trees he stepped out to find himself at the edge of a settlementa few low houses a barn and a scattering of outbuildings with a small pen for pigs he watched the place for a moment but saw no one about so quickly moved on working his way towards the track he knew he would find eventuallythe path that connected the settlement to the town once on the road he made good time reaching caer cestre after midday he hurried down the narrow streets and proceeded directly to the wharf alert to any threat of discovery at the lower town he made for the dockyard and was still a little way off when he saw the mast of a moored ship a small coastcrawling cog with a single low central mast and broad tiller closer he saw a clump of men standing on the dock and picked out the plump form of tuck and with him four of earl hughs soldiers they seemed to be arguing he halted thinking what to do there was no sign of the other welshmen so bran resumed his walk down to the dock picking up his speed as he went until with a sudden furious rush he closed on the group of men he was on them before they knew he was there seizing the nearest soldier by the arm he marched the surprised knight to the edge of the jetty and with a mighty heave vaulted him into the river the body hit with a loud thwack and the resulting splash showered the dock with water bran dropped lightly down into a small fishing boat moored to the pier below and seizing an oar from the oarlock fended off the flailing knight the soldiers companions stared in slackjawed astonishment at this audacious attack one of them dashed to the end of the dock and extended his hand to his comrade bran dropped the oar grabbed the hand and pulled for all he was worth the knight gave out a whoop as he toppled over the edge and into the water as well the two remaining knights backed away from the edge of the dock and drew their swords one of them raised the point of his blade to tucks throat while the other waved his weapon impotently at bran who remained out of reach in the boat both were shouting in french and gesturing for the two welshmen to surrender tuck cried bran lofting the other oar catch up came the oar the friar snatched it from the air and gathering his strength behind it drove the blade into the soldiers chest propelling him backward and over the edge of the dock to join his two companions in the water the last knight standing swung towards tuck his blade a bright arc in the air tuck was quicker than he knew sliding his hands along the shaft of the oar he deftly spun it up into the mans face the knight stumbled backwards retreating step by step bran meanwhile scrambled back onto the dock now tuck tuck drove forward with the oar and the knight fell back a step tripping over brans outstretched foot the knight lurched awkwardly trying to keep his feet under him he swung the blade wildly at tuck who easily parried the stroke knocking it wide another thrust with the oar sent the soldier sprawling onto his backside and before he could recover bran had grabbed his legs pulled them up over his head and pitched the knight heels first off the dock and into the river bran and tuck paused to look at their handiwork four soldiers thrashing in the water and crying for help owing to the weight of their padded jerkins and mail shirts they were unable to clamber out of the river it was all they could do to keep their heads above water their cries had begun to draw wouldbe rescuers to the waterfront where are gruffydd and the others asked bran theyre hiding across the way tuck said waving vaguely behind him i told alan to keep them out of sight until the ship was ready it has only just arrived bran glanced around two boys stood on deck laughing at the spectacle played out on the dock their shipmates had gone ashore leaving the youngest crew members to watch the vessel go get them ordered bran get everyone aboard the ship and cast off but the captain and crew are not here replied tuck theyve gone up to the town just go bran urged picking up the oar ill keep the soldiers busy tuck dashed away returning as fast as his stubby legs allowed with alan gruffydd and the two young welshmen trailing in his wake they arrived on the dock to find bran swinging the oar and shouting keeping the waterlogged ffreinc in the water and the gathering crowd of onlookers at bay truth be told bran found preventing the rescue far easier than he imagined most of the townsfolk seemed to be enjoying the spectacle of the earls thugs at such an embarrassing disadvantage several boys were throwing stones at the knights who singed the air with curses and obscenities get aboard cried bran cast off tuck turned on the others you heard him get aboard and cast off while ifor and brocmael untied the mooring ropes alan picked up two long poles that were lying on the dock and tossed them onto the deck of the ship the boats two young guardians protested but were powerless to prevent their vessel from being boarded they stood by helplessly as tuck and gruffydd set the plank on the rail and climbed aboard ready tuck called push away shouted bran wielding the oar over his sputtering charges using the poles alan and brocmael began easing the cog away from the dock as the ship floated free ifor grabbed the tiller and tried to steer the vessel into deeper water in the centre of the stream the ship began to move bran shouted tuck now bran gave a last thrust with the oar and threw it into the water then with a running jump he leapt from the dock onto the deck of the ship he was no sooner aboard than a howling arose from the wharf he turned to see the three hounds pacing along the edge of the dock and barking come called bran slapping the side of the vessel come on lads jump the dogs needed no further encouragement they put their heads down and ran for the ship bounded across the widening gap and fell onto the deck in a tangle of legs and tails bran laughed and dived in among them they licked his hands and face and he returned their affection giving them each a chuck around the ears and telling them what good brave dogs they were youve stolen the earls hounds brocmael said amazed at brans audacityconsidering the high price wolf hugh set on his prize animals hounds said ifor weve stolen a whole ship entire the ship will be returned bran told them still patting the nearest dog but the hounds we keeptheyll help us to remember our pleasant days hunting with the earl anyway weve left him our horsesa fair enough trade i reckon does anyone know how to sail a ship of this size wondered alan maybe the lads there can help us tuck said regarding the boyswho were thoroughly amazed at what had taken place and were enjoying it in spite of themselves maybe they know how to sail it we dont have to sail it bran countered well let the tideflow carry us downriver as far as the next settlement and try to pick up a pilot there until then ifor you and your two young friends will man the tiller and see you keep us in the stream flow and off the bank can you do that ive seen it done replied the young man then take us home said bran ifor called the two young crewmen to him and with an assortment of signs and gestures showed them what they were to do bran crossed to where gruffydd was sitting against the side of the ship knees up and his head resting on his arms are you well my lord bran said squatting down beside him my blasted head hurts he complained did you have to hit me so hard perhaps not bran allowed but then you did not give us much choice the king offered a grunt of derision and lowered his head once more you will feel better soon bran told him rising once more and when we cross over into wales youll begin to see things in a better light gruffydd made no reply so bran left him alone to nurse his aching head meanwhile tuck and brocmael had begun searching the hold of the ship to see what it carried by way of provisions we have cheese dried meat and a little ale well pick up more when we stop until then fill the cups tuck i feel a thirst coming on part four o cowardly dastard will scadlocke exclaimd thou fainthearted sowmothered reeve if ever my master doth deign thee to meet thou shalt thy full paiment receive then rhiban hud setting his horn to his mouth a blast he merrily blows his yeomen from bushes and treetops appeared a hundred with trusty longbows and little john came at the head of them all cloathd in a rich mantle green and likewise the others were fancif ly drest a wonderous sight to be seen forth from the greenwoode about they are come with hearts that are firm and eer stout pledging them all with the sheriff s yeomen to give them a full hearty bout and rhiban the hud has removed his cloak and the sheriff has uttered an oath and william now smites him on top of his pate and swift exit is now made by both little i thought quod scadlocke eftsoon when i first came to this place for to have met with dear little john or again see my masters fine face chapter it is a grand day my lord bran llewelyn proclaimed grinning blearily through a haze of brown ale a grand and glorious day though it shames me to admit it i never hoped to see our gruffydd on his throne again no i never did yet here he isall thanks to you here he is two days of riotous celebration had followed the rescuers triumphant return to aberffraw with their newly freed captive king gruffydds homecoming was heralded as a miracle on the order of lazarus walking out of his tomb and bran tuck ifor brocmael and alan were lauded as champions and made to recount their exploits time and again to rapturous listeners until they grew hoarse for speaking the revel was entering its third day before bran and tuck finally found the opportunity to speak to gruffydd and llewelyn in private here are men after my own heart declared gruffydd closing the door on the celebration to join them in his chamber bathed and shaved his matted motheaten locks shorn to his scalp arrayed in a new wool cloak and fine red linen shirt the king of the northern cymry finally resembled something worthy of the name you should have seen them llewelyn he bellowed they were mighty giants doing battle for me its true swaying unsteadily he draped an arm across brans shoulders i am forever in your debt my friend hear me bran ap brychan may god blind me if i should ever forget that would be most uncomfortable for you allowed bran with a smile but never fear i have a way to help you then speak it out man and see how quickly it is accomplished said gruffydd reeling slightly he looked around for his cup saw one in llewelyns hand and took it bran hesitated uncertain whether to take advantage of the kings aleinduced generosity or wait until gruffydd was sober once morewhich might mean a wait of several more days speak man and if it is in my power to grant you shall have it before the sun has set on another day boasted gruffydd he drained the cup and wiped the foam from his moustache what will you have your friendship said bran that you have in abundance already replied gruffydd grandly he waved his hand airily what else prompted llewelyn well aware of brans true desire bran looked to tuck who urged him with a glance to ask for the help he had come north to seek as i have aided the return of your king to his lands and people replied bran speaking slowly and deliberately i ask the kings pledge to aid me in the return of my lands and people a shadow passed over gruffydds square face just then the smile remained firmly fixed but his eyes narrowed then receive my pledge gruffydd said how can i help you with men and weapons bran said raise the tribes of gwynedd and the north and ride with me together we can wrest elfael from the ffreinc and drive them from our lands gruffydd frowned he looked into the empty cup as if it had offended him then thrust it back at llewelyn if that lay within my power he said his voice falling you would have it this very night alas i cannot grant such a request brans face tightened staring at the king he said you will not help i cannot replied gruffydd who seemed to have sobered in the matter of a moment you must understand he continued half turning away i have been absent from my realm eight years for eight years my people have been without a king theyve had llewelyn bran pointed out true enough granted gruffydd and i am the first to say he has served faithfully and well but you and i both know that it is not the same thing at all then you will not help me bran said his voice tight i wish you had asked anything but that the king replied my first duty is to my people and my realm i cannot resume my reign by running off again as soon as i am home much less can i mark my return by forcing my people into a war that does not concern them if you were in my place you would see that my friends and i risked all to save you and for that you have my friendship and gratitude to my dying breath lord gruffydd replied it is not your gratitude i want bran said his tone taking on an edge it is your aid in arms that said gruffydd carelessly is the one thing you cannot have bran made to step closer gruffydd held his ground my lord said tuck insinuating his bulk between gruffydd and an increasingly angry bran if you knew the precarious hold the ffreinc possessed you would see our request in a different light how so asked llewelyn doing what he could to help the ffreinc forces are few in number tuck said still holding himself between the increasingly angry lords and poorly supplied we have seen to that have we not for though we are few in number living rough in the greenwood on pitiful fare with families and little uns to keepeven so we have pressed them hard these last two years and more and they are bent that near to breaking all it needs is some stout warriors a few fresh fighters a last battle or twoa final push over the edge and the thing is done how long would you need the use of the men asked llewelyn a month perhaps said bran quickly the ffreinc do not have enough soldiers to make a lengthy campaign it would be finished in a monthno more that is little enough it seems to me alas rued gruffydd unmoved even that little is too much i wish i could help my lord i urge you to reconsider pleaded llewelyn a month mind you surely it is not beyond our ability to aid them in this his entreaty was cut short by a curt gesture from his king i have spoken gruffydd turned and stepped towards the door my friends he said adopting a stiffly formal air even as he clutched the doorpost to steady himself you are most welcome to remain with me as long as you like i am happy for your company nevertheless we will not speak of this again with that the king returned to the celebration come tuck said bran watching gruffydd through the open door as the king moved among his kinsmen and friends embracing some sharing the cup with others we will not remain here a moment longer than it takes to scrape the dung of this miserable place off our feet my lord said llewelyn deeply embarrassed by his kings behaviour do not be overhasty stay a little longera few days onlyand we will yet change his mind i will summon the lords to council with the king and he will be persuaded on my word you will yet have your just reward if only you were king llewelyn replied bran darkly then remembering himself he softened his tone and said you have shown me honour and respect and i thank you for that nor do i hold gruffydds ingratitude against you but i see now that i was wrong to come here wrong to ask wrong to think the fate of elfael meant anything to my family in the north llewelyn opened his mouth to protest this last assertion but a warning glance from tuck prevented him instead he moved quietly to the door and there he paused and regarded bran sadly im sorry he said then stepped back into the hall leaving tuck and bran alone and god with you too cousins muttered bran to men who were no longer there bring the horses tuck he said after a moment and find alan were leaving they left the hall and moved out into the yard it was after midday and the clouds were low and dark threatening rain tuck thought to argue for staying at least one day longer to allow gruffydd the chance to change his mind and so they would not have to ride in the rain but he knew bran would not hear it as the cinch belts were being tightened on the saddles ifor and brocmael came into the stables we were looking for you said brocmael youre leaving so soon said ifor both young men appeared so crestfallen that tuck tried to put a better face on it we have finished here and anyway we are needed back home but god willing well come back one day he told them then added patting the fresh mount beside him do thank your father for the gift of these fine horses it is the least we could do said ifor after all youve done for us what about the troops wondered brocmael your king does not see fit to raise any bran told him thats why youre leaving said ifor aye confessed bran that is why well come with you ifor offered he nudged brocmael who agreed we can fight your place is here said bran your king will not give you leave to go he has made it very clear he does not think elfael worth saving reaching out a hand he gave each of their arms a squeeze by way of farewell nevertheless you have been brave and loyal companions these past days you have done yourselves and your families proud no one could have served me better but here is where it ends the two young warriors exchanged an unhappy glance what about earl hughs hounds asked brocmael shall i fetch them for you no i want you and ifor to have them answered bran consider them a small gesture of thanks for your help we cannot my lord protested ifor they are worth a very fortune it is too much agreed brocmael they are far too valuable no more valuable than the help you gave me when asked bran replied they are yours my friends make your fortune with them tuck alan and bran left aberffraw as soon as the horses were ready bran did not speak the rest of the day but fumed and fretted working himself into such a dark and threatening gloom that tuck began to fear for the havoc unleashed when the gathering storm finally broke he had seen bran like this beforeonce in londein when they had gone to redeem the lands from the crown at the enormous price of six hundred marks only to have cardinal flambard cheat him by raising the price to two thousand tuck and iwan had pulled him off the scoundrel churchman or in all likelihood none of them would have lived out the day angharad knew best how to ease rhi brans murderous moods but she was in faraway elfael alan tuck had said if you know any songs that would put our bran in a better mood i pray you sing one now as it happens replied alan adale i have been thinking of a song he might enjoy it isnt finished yeti need a rhyme for count rexindo dye ken sing it anyway tuck told him so alan sang them on their way four days later he was still singing as from time to time brans dark and dangerous mood threatened to swallow them all alan it seemed was full of unexpected talents and ever ready to cheer his lord along with a quip or a joke or a song of the latter most of his ditties were english drinking songs and ballads more appreciated by friar tuck than by bran who from time to time slipped back into his moody darkness the french and welsh songs had lilting melodiessome glad some mournful to suit their solemn humourbut the best songs were those alan had made up himself including the new one that extolled the exploits of count rexindo and his merry band who deceived the wicked earl and won the freedom of the captive king of gwynedd tuck found this highly amusing but bran was not so sure he wanted his doings voiced about the countryside like so much scattered seed still the singing and stories told under the clear open sky worked their wonders and by the time the travellers came within sight of the towering green wall of the great forest of coed cadw brans temper had cooled to the point where tuck thought he might risk venturing a thought or two of his own regarding their predicament as it now stood perhaps he suggested it might be well to heed merians advice and go see her father bran considered this only as long as it took to purse his lips and shake his head god knows that man is no friend of mine even if cadwgan did not hate me when this began i will not have risen any higher in his esteem by holding his daughter captive at the first maybe granted tuck but she stayed on of her own free will when given the choice she stayed even if he was inclined to help countered bran he is a vassal of baron neufmarche as it runs against his interests the baron would never allow it no said bran shaking his head again this time with resignation we will get no help from lord cadwgan they skirted saint martins the abbots town and entered the sheltering forest just as the sky of lowering clouds sent rain streaming down the wind it would be a wet night in the greenwood but the rain did little to dampen the welcome the travellers received at their homecoming the grellon gathered to greet them and bran roused himself from his grim melancholy to say that he was glad to be home once more but as he scanned the faces gathered around the one lookedfor face did not appear wheres merian bran asked an uneasy hush drew across the forest dwellers and iwan stepped forward welcome my lord he said his voice booming in the quiet it is good to have you back safely i trust your journey was successful your trust is misplaced snapped bran we failed still searching among the grellon he said merian where is she iwan the big warrior paused looking thoughtful merian is not here he said at last she left and went back to eiwas before bran could ask more the champion gestured to someone in the crowd of onlookers and noin stepped forward tell him what happened iwan instructed noinina made a small bow of greeting to her king and said it is true my lord merian went home she folded her hands into the apron at her waist it was in her mind to go and ask her father to send men to aid us in the fight against the ffreinc i see bran replied coldly when did she leave two days after you departed for the north who went with her my lord said noin a note of anxiety rising in her voice she went alone alone turning on iwan he demanded you let her go alone when the big man made no reply bran glanced around at the others did no one think to go with her we did not know she was going iwan explained i would have prevented her of course but she told no one of her intentions and left before anyone knew she was gone someone knew by the rood bran observed indicating the worried noin before him forgive me my lord but she made me promise not to say anything until after she had gone noin said looking down at her feet i did try to persuade her otherwise but she would not hear it i was halfway down the trail for going after her said will scarlet pushing forward to stand beside his wife woulda gone too but by the time we found out it was too late merian was already home and if anything was going to happen to her he paused well i reckoned it already did bran took this in his fists clenching and unclenching at his side i leave you in charge iwan he snarled and this is how my trust is repaid i am peace said angharad speaking from a few steps behind him pushing through the gathered throng of welcomers the wise banfaith planted herself in front of him this is not seemly my lord your people have given you good greeting and the same would receive from their king she fixed him with a commanding stare until bran remembered himself and in a somewhat stilted fashion thanked his champion and others for keeping cel craidd in his absence tuck drawing near gave bran a nudge with his elbow and indicated alan adale standing a short distance apart from the group ignored and unremarked so bran introduced the grellon to alan adale and instructed his flock to make the newcomer feel at home among them having satisfied courtesy bran retreated to his hut saying he wished to be left in peace to rest after his journey rest you will have said angharad following him into the hut but not from you i see not from meand not until you learn that berating those who have given good service is beneath one who would account himself a worthy king angry with merian you may be she disobeyed me she must have had good reason think you we discussed it and i told her not to go bran complained throwing himself into his hideandantler chair yet the moment my back is turned what does she do your lady merian is a woman of great determination and resourcefulness she is not one to be easily dominated by others angharad gazed at him her eyes alight within their wreath of familiar wrinkles it is her own mind she has followed she has disobeyed me bran said this it is that tears at you replied the banfaith or is it that she might have been right to go before bran could answer she said it matters not for now there is nothing to be done about it bran glared at her but knew that pursuing this argument any further would avail him nothing too late you show the wisdom of silence angharad observed so now if you would put away childish things tell me what happened in the north bran frowned and passed a hand over his face as if trying to wipe away the memory he gave a brief account of finding the king of gwynedd a captive to earl hugh and riding into caer cestre to free him the long and short of it he continued is that we failed to persuade king gruffydd to rally the tribes to our support we cannot count on them for any men the old woman considered this nodded but said nothing not one said bran we are worse off than when we began he concluded gloomily into the fraught and fretted silence of the hut there drifted a soft lilting melody sung by a clear and steady voicea sound not unfamiliar in cel craidd but this one was different angharad went to the door of the hut opened it and stepped outside bran followed and felt his anger and disappointment begin to melt away in the refrains of the tune there surrounded by the forestdwellers his head lifted high and with a voice to set the glade shimmering alan was singing his song about rhi bran and the wolf of cestre chapter when bran learned that sheriff de glanville had returned to saint martins with a force of fifty soldiers he said nothing but took his bow and went alone into the greenwood siarles was all for going after him but angharad advised against it saying think yourself a king to bear a kings burden his own counsel he must keep if his own mind he would know and to be sure rhi bran returned that evening with a yearling buck and a battle plan first he determined to do what he could to even the odds against him the fine dry summer had given way to a blessedly mild autumn and the harvest in the valleys had been good most of the crops would be gathered in now against the lean seasons to follow the granaries and storehouses would be bulging bran decided to help his people and at the same time hit the ffreinc where it would hurt the most he would attack in the dead heart of the darkest night of the month the moon had been on the wane for several days and tonight there would be a new one the darkness would be heavy and would aid his design early in the morning bran sent spies into the town to see what could be learned of the disposition of the sheriff s troops noin and alan had been chosenmuch to wills displeasure i have no objection scarlet complained so long as i go along they know you too well bran reminded him i dont want to see you end up in that pit againor worse one glimpse is all the sheriff would need to put your head on a spike but you dont mind if my noins sweet face ends up decorating that bloody spike he griped scarlet the sound was sharp as a slap you go too far angharad shuffled forth wagging a bony finger a proper respect for your king would well become you will glared at her his jaw set now william scatlocke forgive me sire offered will striving to sound suitably contrite if i have spoken above myself i do most humbly beg your pardon pardon granted will bran told him a man would have a heart of stone who did not care for his wife but the raids i have in mind succeed or fail on what we learn we need to know how things sit in the town before we go rushing down there will nodded and glanced to noin who pressed his hand i have gone to market before you know thats all it isjust two folk going to market you had best leave now said bran stay only as long as it takes to find out what we need and then hurry back we will wait for you at the ford there and back and no one the wiser mlord alan volunteered alan adale will see to it to scarlet he said theyve never seen me before and i can talk the legs off a donkey if i have to well be back safe and sound before you know it bran commended them to their task and angharad spoke a brief blessing of protection over them and the two departed the rest of the grellon began preparing for the nights activities weapons and ropes were readied and five riders were sent to the holdings and farms in the valley to warn the folk about king ravens plans and to enlist any aid they could find in the end there were so many willing volunteers that they chose only the most hale and hearty to help and told them where to go and when tuck decided that he would best be served by a new staff so took himself into the wood to find a sturdy branch of ash which he cut to length and then shaped as he worked he found great satisfaction in reciting a few of the psalms that the young israelite warrior david composed when seeking deliverance from his many enemies by the time the sun began its long slow plunge into the western sea all was ready the raiders eight in all departed for the ford to meet the spies alan and noin were already waiting at the forests edge when they arrived will scarlet was the first to see them and ran to where the two sat beside the stream near the ford is all well he asked and received a brushing kiss by way of answer from his wife no one paid us any heed at all alan told them why would they we were just two humble folk attending the market ye ken well and good said bran so now what did you discover it is true the town is full of ffreinc began alan but they trust their numbers a little too much it seems to me he went on to explain that the soldiers were everywhere to be seenat the entrance to the town square before the abbey gate clustered around the guardhouse towerbut almost to a man they appeared bored and lax you can see those fellas idling here and there dicin and drinkin and whatall they swagger around like little emperors all and most of them dont carry weaponsmaybe a dagger only no doubt they know where to find a ready blade smart enough when pressed to it observed iwan oh no doubt agreed alan readily but im just saying what i saw what about the sheriff asked will did you see that ratfaced spoiler i did not answered alan neither hide nor hair plenty of soldiers though as i say you found where they keep the supplies asked bran we did lord answered alan looking to noin he nodded noin here did that easy as please and be thanked i went to the church when they rang the bell for the midday mass noin reported there were but a few townsfolk and a merchant or two so i knelt in the back and waited for the service to finish then i followed the monks to the abbey pretending that i was hungry and in need of food for myself and my poor starving children three you told them that said scarlet chagrined at the barest suggestion that he was no fit provider for his family it was only pretence she said lightly but i have been pared near enough to the bone to know how it feels to their credit the priests took pity on me and let me inside the abbey walls i was made to wait in the yard while they fetched a few provisions and you saw where these were kept said siarles oh ayemade sure of it there is a granary behind the bishops house it looks new to mewattled and thatched like a barn but smaller they brought you food from these stores asked tuck you saw this aye they didbrought me some grain and a rind of salt pork noin told him and a handful of dried beans there was plenty more whence that came believe me there must be mused iwan if they are about giving away food to needy cymry at least suggested siarles they are not overworried about running out of provisions anytime soon they will be running out sooner than they know said bran what else the raiding party listened to all that alan and noin had to say about the troops and stores when they finished bran praised their good service and sent them on their way back to cel craidd saying tell the others were going ahead with the raid if all goes well we will return before dawn so alan and noin continued on their way and the raiding party settled down to wait watching a pale blue velvet dusk settle over the vale of elfael below the stars winked on one by one and the raiders sat and talked their voices a low murmur barely audible above the liquid splash of the nearby stream it is so beautiful thought tuck so peaceful ach fy enaid he sighed second thoughts friar asked siarles sliding down beside him never that boyo replied tuck but it does seem a very shame to violate such tranquillity does it not perhaps but it will be far more tranquil when the ffreinc are gone friar answered siarles think of that i pray that it is so tuck sighed again it is a beautiful valley though they talked a little while and then tuck closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep to be awakened sometime later by siarles jostling his shoulder time to be about the devils business friar regaining their saddles the party rode down into the vale circling around to the north of the town and the abbey fields they came to the edge of a bean field which lay just beyond the stone walls of the monastery abbot hugo had erected if i heard it right the abbots storehouse is just the other side of that wall iwan pointed out the wall like the abbey and town behind it was an indistinct mass black against the deeper featureless blackness of a moonless night owain and rhoddi said bran go and rouse the others bring them hereand for the love of god and all the angels tell everyone to keep quiet the two warriors turned and rode for the forests edge north of town as soon as they had gone bran said tuck you will stay with the horses and keep order outside the walls tomas and scarletgo with iwan siarles you come with me once over the wall meet at the storehouse the old sly smile played on his lips as he said time for rhi bran y hud to fly the raiders urged their mounts forward across the leafy field now black beneath the hooves of their horses a few paces from the wall they stopped and dismounted god with you whispered tuck as they hefted first one man and then the next up onto the top of the abbey wall when the last raider disappeared the friar turned to look for rhoddi and owain but could see nothing in the darkness he waited gazing wideeyed into the darkness and listening for any stray sounds from the other side of the wall but saw nothing and heard only the sound of the horses breathing and once in a while chafing the ground with an idle hoof after a time there came a whispered hiss from somewhere above his head ssssst once and then again ssssst here whispered tuck this wayto your right get ready said the voice it was siarles kneeling atop the wall well send over the grain sacks first ready im the only one here tuck told him where is everyone theyre here came the reply as rhoddi appeared silent as a ghost out of the darkness to his unseen companions he said owain line em up behind me keep out of the way and stay alert how many are with you siarles called down softly ten answered owain were ready so heave away a moment later another figure joined siarles on the wall there was a dry scraping sound followed by a thick thud as the first sack hit the ground at the base of the wall three more followed in quick succession get em up whispered siarles fumbling in the darkness the cymry from the surrounding settlements jostled the bulging sacks of grain onto the shoulders of three of their number who disappeared into the darkness ready rhoddi called quietly there followed a pause and then without warning a large weighty object thudded to the ground what was that wondered tuck mostly to himself four more objects were sent over the wall in quick succession followed by numerous smaller bundles dropped over the wall to form a growing heap on the ground clear it out whispered siarles you heard him men said owain again the waiting cymry leapt forward and fell upon the bundles sacks and casks that had been tossed over the wall the process was repeated two more times and each time there were fewer cymry left to carry the supplies away finally siarles reappeared atop the wall and said theres people stirring in the abbey im coming over squatting down he turned grabbed an edge and lowered himself lengthwise down the face of the wall the others are clean away tuck told him ive got the horses ready we best stir ourselves and get this lot loaded too siarles said bring em up and lets have at it the two of them began piling the goods onto the carriers attached to the saddles of the horses one by one the remaining raiders joined tuck and siarles outside the wall bran and iwan were the last and all made short work of toting the bundles and casks to the waiting horses the backandforth continued until from somewhere beyond the wall a bell sounded and the raiders halted the bell tolled three times its lauds said tuck theyll be going to the chapel for prayer thats it lads said bran time to fly he glanced away towards the east where a dull glow could be seen above the dark line of treetops look now its beginning to get light and all this thieving has made me hungry luckily theres ale for our troubles scarlet said picking up a cask and shaking it so it sloshed and wine too if im not mistaken the last of the goods were packed and tied into place and as each horse was ready one of the riders led it away bran and tuck were last to leave following the others across the broad black expanse of the bean field to the forest edge where they met with the cymry who had helped and a rough division of the spoils was made then and there spread it around to those who need it most bran told them but mind to keep it well hid in case any of the ffreinc come sniffing around after it the rest of the way back to the forest was a long slow amble through the nightdark vale and up the rise into the greenwood they moved with the mist along cool forest pathways and arrived back at cel craidd as the sun broke fair on another sparkling crisp autumn daybut a day that abbot hugo would remember as dismal indeed the day his troubles began in earnest chapter king raven visited the abbey stores again the next night despite the watch the sheriff and abbot had placed on the gate and storehouse this time however instead of carrying off the supplies the blackhooded creature destroyed them iwan and tuck rode with him to the edge of the forest and as they had done the previous night waited for night to deepen the darkness the moon would rise late but it would be only a pale sliver in the sky in any event bran planned to be back in the forest before his trail could be followed when he judged the time was right he donned his feathered cloak and the highcrested beak mask and climbed into the saddle i could go with you iwan said theres no need bran demurred and it will be easier to elude them on my own well wait for you here then replied the champion he handed bran his bow and six black arrows three of which had been specially prepared go with god tuck said and passed bran the chain from which was suspended a small iron canistera covered dish of coals oh its a sorry waste he sighed as bran rode away his dark form was swiftly swallowed by the darkness aye agreed iwan but needful taking food from the mouth of an enemy is almost as good as eating it yourself tuck considered this for a moment no he decided it is not the two settled back to watch and wait they listened to the night sounds of the forest and the easy rustling of the leaves in the upper boughs of the trees as the breeze came up tuck was nodding off to sleep when iwan said there he is tuck came awake with a start at the sound he looked around but saw nothing where just there said iwan stretching out his hand towards the darkness low to the ground and a little to your left tuck looked where iwan indicated and saw a tiny yellow glow moving along the ground then even as he watched the glow floated up into the air where it hung for a moment hes on the wall said iwan the glowing spark seemed to brighten and burst into flame in the same instant the flame flared and disappeared and all was darkness again they waited in a moment the glow fluttered to life once more in midair it flared to life and disappeared just as quickly thats two said iwan one more they waited this time the glow did not reappear at once when it did it was some distance farther along the wall as before the faint firefly glow brightened then flared to brilliant life and disappeared in a smear of sparks and fire darkness reclaimed the night and they waited a long moment passed then another and they heard the hoofbeats of a swiftly approaching horse and at almost the same time a line of light appeared low in the sky the light grew in intensity until they could see the form of a dark rider galloping toward them all at once the light bloomed in the sky erupting in a shower of orange and red flames to your horses shouted bran as he came pounding up theyll be wanting our heads for this i fired the storehouse and granary both did anyone see you wondered iwan as he swung up into the saddle its possible bran said but theyll have their hands full for a little while at least tsk clucked tuck with mild disapproval such a sad waste but necessary offered iwan anything that weakens them helps us and anything that helps us helps elfael and its people concluded bran it was necessary a holy waste then replied tuck he raised himself to a fallen limb and squirmed into the saddle by the time he had the reins in his fist his companions were already riding along the edge of the field up the long rising slope towards coed cadw a dark mass rising like a wall against a sky alive with stars as the news about what had happened spread throughout the vale of elfael everyone who heard about the theft and fire of the previous nights knew what it meant king ravens war with the ffreinc had entered a new more desperate stage burning the abbeys storehouse and granary would provoke abbot hugo and the sheriff to a swift and terrible reaction if an army cannot eat it cannot fight and the abbots army had just lost its supper sheriff de glanville wont be dainty about taking what he needs from the poor cymry round about scarlet pointed out after hearing an account of the previous nights raid hell make a right fuss no mistake i expect he will bran agreed id be disappointed otherwise wills got a fair point siarles affirmed de glanville will steal from the farm folk its always them he turns to yes and when he does hell find king raven waiting for him said bran brans reply stunned his listenersnot what he saidthe words themselves were reasonable enough it was the way he said them there was a coldness in his tone that chilled all who heard it there wasnt a man among them who did not recognize that something had changed in their king since his return from the north if he had been determined before he was that much more determined now but it was more than simple purposethere was a dark implacable hardness to it as if somehow his customary resolve had been chastened and hardened in a forge there was an edge to it keen and lethal as stropped steel scarlet put it best when he said god bless me brother tuck but talking to rhi bran now is like talking to the blade of a spear he turned wondering eyes on the little priest just what did you two get up to in the north thats made him so its never the north thats made him this way replied the friar although that maybe tipped the load into the muck but its coming back home and seeing how things are hereall this time passing and the abbot is ruling the roost and the sheriff cutting up rough and all the ffreinc are still here and nothings changednothing for the better at least scarlet nodded in commiseration it may be as you say friar but i say that little jaunt up north changed him he insisted ill bet my back teeth ont perhaps allowed tuck oh you should have seen him scarlet the way he peeled that hardboiled earlit was a gladsome sight the friar went on to describe the elaborate deception hed witnessed and in which hed taken partthe clothes the hunting alans tireless translating the young welshmen and their willing and industrious participation the breathless escape and all the rest we were count rexindo and his merry band as alan saysalbeit his song makes it sound like a frolic of larks but it was grim dire i can tell you we were tiptoeing in the wolf s den with fresh meat in our hands but bran never put a foot wrong why it would have made you proud it truly would and yet it all came to nothing in the end saints bear witness scarlet thats the naked bleeding heart of it is it not we dared much and risked more to save king gruffydds worthless neck tuck said his voice rising with the force of his indignation and we succeeded beyond all hope of success we succeeded but that selfish sot refused to help after we saved his life by peters beard that rascal of a king would not lend so much as a single sausage to our aid he shook his head in weary commiseration poor bran that his own kinsman would use him so illits a wicked betrayal thats what it is raw as a wound from a rusty blade he considered this for a moment so thats the grit in his gizzardour bran knows were on our own now concluded scarlet gloomily aye were alone in this and thats shame and pity enough to make man woman horse or dog weep never say it tuck rebuked gently we are not alonefor the lord of hosts is on our side and stretches out his mighty arm against our enemies the little friar smiled his round face beaming simple good pleasure at the thought if the almighty stands with us who can stand against us aye tuck prodded scarlet in the chest with a stubby finger just you answer me that boyo who can stand against us the friar had a point scarlet confessed that no one could stand against godthen added but there does seem no end o folk thatll try the grellon resumed the task of accumulating what provisions they couldmeat from the hunt grain and beans from the raid tending the turnips in the field making cheese from the milk of their two cowspreserving all they could and storing it up against the days of want that were surely coming bran turned his attention to the other matter weighing on his mind with everyone else already occupied he called scarlet and tuck to him and announced put on your riding boots were going to find merianand while were at it well see if we can convince king cadwgan to lend some of his men to aid us this is what merian has been arguing all this while tuck pointed out aye it is bran conceded i was against it at first i confess but our feet are in the flame now and we have no other choice maybe merian is rightmaybe her family will help where mine would not lord cadwgan holds no kindly feelings towards me god knows but shes had a few days with him i have to know whether shes been able to soften her fathers opinion and persuade him pray she has friendsits our last hope he spun on his heel and started away at once ready the horses he called over his shoulder we have only this day it seems his disappointment has passed said scarlet and were for a ride through lands filled with vengeful ffreinc lord have mercy tuck sighed the last thing i need is to spend more time jouncing around on horseback still if we can convince cadwgan to help us it will be worth another saddle sore so now if the ffreinc catch us rambling abroad in plain daylight warned scarlet saddle sores will be least of all your earthly worries friend friar chapter arriving just after midday the three riders paused to observe king cadwgans stronghold from a distance all appeared peaceable and quiet on the low hill and surrounding countryside there were folk working in the fields to the west and south of the fortress and a few men and dogs moving cattle to another pasture for grazing seems friendly enough from here remarked scarlet any ffreinc around dyou reckon possibly answered bran you never can tellcadwgan is client king to baron neufmarche same as tried to kill you wondered scarlet one and the same i made the mistake of asking neufmarche for help and thought he might behave honourably replied bran it is not a mistake i shall make a second time a bad business that mused tuck it is a very miracle cadwgan has survived this long under the barons heavy thumb you know him asked scarlet aye i dowere not the best of friends mind but i know him when i see himfor all ive lived in the shadow of hereford castle for many years that is why i am sending you on ahead said bran me i dare not show my face within those walls until you have seen how things sit with the king you want me to go in there alone tuck said who better to spy out the lay of the land said bran no one up there has ever seen you he pointed out to the good folk of caer rhodl you will simply be who you area wandering mendicant priest youve nothing to fear then why do i feel like daniel sent into the lions lair he made to urge his mount forward but bran took hold of the bridle strap and pulled him up on foot i have to walk wandering mendicant priests do not ride fine horses fine horses my fat arse tuck rolled his eyes and puffed out his cheeks you call these plodders we ride fine complaining he squirmed down from his mount landing hard on the path below that grove of beeches said bran pointing a little way down the track the way they had come well wait for you there what do you want me to tell cadwgan tuck asked untying the loop that held his staff alongside the saddle tell him anything you like said bran only find out if it is safe for me to come up there and speak to him and find out what has become of merian tuck beetled off on his bowed legs while bran and will rode back to wait in the grove upon reaching the foot of the fortress mound tuck worked his way along the rising switchback path towards the entrance the thoughtthe fervent hopeof cool dark ale awaiting him in a welcome cup sprang up bringing the water to his thirsty mouth by the time he reached the gate atop the long ramp he was panting with anticipation a word with the gatekeeper brought the desired result and he was quickly admitted and directed to the cookhouse bless you my son said tuck may god be good to you at the cookhouse he begged a bite to eat and a cup of something to drink and found the kitchener most obliging come in friar and be welcome said the woman who served the king and his household as master cook sit you down and ill soon set a dish or two before you and if you have a little ale suggested tuck lightly i would dearly love to wash the dust of the road from my mouth that you shall have replied the cookso amiably that tuck remembered all over again how well he was so often received in the houses of the great lords for however high and mighty the lord might bewith his own priests or those nearby to attend him as he pleasedhis vassals and servants were usually more than glad to receive a priest of their own class she busied herself in the next room and returned with a leather cannikin dripping with foam here she said passing the vessel to tuck get some of this inside you and slay the nasty dragon o thirst tuck seized the container with both hands and brought it to his face he drank deep savouring the cool sweet liquid as it filled his mouth and flowed over his tongue and down his chin bless you he sighed wiping his mouth with his sleeve i was that parched now then said the master cook just enjoy your cup i wont be a moment the cook left the kitchen for the larder and tuck sat on his stool elbows on the board sipping the good dark ale in a moment a young woman came in with a wedge of cheese on a wooden plate cook said to give you this while you wait said the serving maid thank you my child replied tuck taking the plate from her hand if you please friar she said i have a sore foot she looked at him doubtfully would you know of a cure or blessing let me see he said glancing down at her feet which foot is it she slipped off her shoea wooden clog with a leather topand held the foot up slightly tuck saw a red welt at the base of her big toe that looked to him like the beginning of a bunion ah yes he said i have seen this before he gently lifted the young womans foot and touched the raw red bulge i think you are fortunate to catch this before it has become incurable she winced drawing in her breath sharply can you fix it i think so can you get a little mayweed hereabouts for a certainty she replied we use it all the time then youll know how to make a tisane do you not the girl nodded goodmake one and drink it down then take the wet leaves from the bowl and apply them to the sore do this three times a day every day for five days and youll soon feel better oh yes put off your shoes for a few days the girl made a sour face my lady does not like us to go barefoot she said leastwise not in the house not to worry said tuck when you go in the house just put some willow bark shavings in your shoe but take off your shoes whenever you can oh yesfind some larger shoes if you can the ones you are wearing are too small for you and that no doubt is what has caused this ailment he laid a finger to his lips now then i think saint birinius is the one to seek on this one he said bow your head child the young woman did as she was told and tuck held his hand over her and sought the blessing of birinius whose feet were held in the fire by one of the old mercian kings as a test of his faith and thus was one who knew the pain associated with various foot ailments the young lady thanked the friar and leftonly to be replaced by another woman bringing a small woollen cloak she had just finished making if it is not too much trouble friar she said politely i would ask a blessing for this cloak as ive made it for my sisters baby thats due to come any day now may god be good to you for your thoughtfulness said tuck it is no trouble at all and he blessed the soft square of delicate cloth when he finished the cook returned and began placing bowls of minted beans and new greens and a plate of cold duck before him the woman with the infants cloak thanked him and said my man is outside with a horse hed like you to see when youve finished your meal tell him i will attend directly replied tuck reaching for a wooden spoon he ate and drank and worked out what he wanted to say to lord cadwgan when the cook returned to see how he fared tuck asked the lord of this placeis he well oh indeed friar never better good replied tuck i am glad to hear it how could it be otherwise a newmarried man and his bridewhy birds in a nest those two this caught tuck on the hop lord cadwgan newly married you say lord have mercy no laughed the cook its garran im talking about hes king now and lord of this place oh is he but that must mean the cook was already nodding in reply the old king died last year and garran has taken his fathers place on the throne may god keep him of course replied tuck he finished his meal wondering whether this revelation made his task easier or more difficult knowing little about cadwgan and nothing at all about garran there was no way to tell he decided until he met the young king in the flesh he finished his meal and thanked the cook for extending the hospitality of her lord to him then went out into the yard to see the horse the stablehand was waiting patiently and tuck greeted him and asked what he could do the mares with foal the man told him as you can see i would have a blessing on her that the birth will be easy and the young un healthy consider it done replied the friar placing his hand on the broad forehead of the animal tuck said a prayer and blessed the beast asking for the aid of saint eligius for the animal and for good measure saint monica as well while he was praying he became aware that there were others looking on on concluding he turned to see that he was being watched by a young man who despite his fair hair looked that much like merianthe same large dark eyes the same full mouth and high noble foreheadthat tuck decided the fellow had to be her brother i do beg your pardon my lord tuck said offering a slight bow but mightnt you be rhi garran god be good to you friar i might be and as it happens i am replied the young man with a smile and who so long as were asking are you to be blessing my horses i am as you see me replied tuck a humble friar brother aethelfrith is my name a saxon then i am and that proud of it now i know you must be a christian replied garran lightly for you speak the language of heaven right well how is that if you dont mind my asking for ive never known a saxon to bother himself overmuch with learning the cymry tongue that is easily told answered tuck and explained that as a boy in lincolnshire he had been captured in a raid and sold into slavery in the copper mines of powys when he grew old enough and bold enough he had made good his escape and was received by the monks of llandewi where he lived until taking his vows and some little time later becoming a mendicant the young king nodded the same amiable smile playing on his lips the while well i hope they have fed you in the kitchen friend friar you are welcome to stay as long as you likenefi here will give you a corner of the stable for a bed and i am certain my people will make you feel at home your generosity does you credit sire tuck said but it is you i have come to seeon a matter of some urgency the young man hesitated he made a dismissive gesture then i commend you to my seneschal i am certain he will be best able to help again he turned to go giving tuck the impression that he was intruding on the busy life of this young monarch if you please my lord said tuck starting after him it is about a friend of yours and mineand of your sister merians at this last name the young king halted and turned around again you know my sister i do my lord and that right well do i not how do you know her the kings tone became wary suspicious i have lately come from the place where she has been living garran tensed and drew himself up then you must be one of those outlaws of the greenwood we have been hearing about before tuck could reply he said you are no longer welcome here i suggest you leave before i have you whipped and thrown out so that is the way of it concluded tuck i have nothing more to say to you garran turned on his heel and started away god love you man said tuck stepping after him it can do no harm to talk did you not hear me snarled garran turning on the little friar i can have you beaten and cast out like the filth you are get you from my sight or heaven help me i will whip you myself then do so tuck replied squaring himself for a fight for i will not leave until i have said what i came here to say garran glared at him but said go on then if it will get your repulsive carcase out of my sight the sooner speak you seem to think that we harmed merian in some way tuck began we did no such thing indeed merian was not held against her will she stayed in the greenwood lived with us in the greenwood because she believes in the cause that we pursuethe same cause that brings me here to ask your aid what cause justice pure and simple king william has erred and fomented a great injustice against the rightful lord and people of elfael who are most cruelly used and oppressed a most grievous wrong has been committed and we seek to put it right to speak plainly we mean to drive out the wicked usurpers and reclaim the throne of elfael your sister merian has been helping us do just that she has been a most ardent and enthusiastic member of our little band let us go ask her tuck suggested and you can hear this from her own lips garran was already shaking his head youre not going anywhere near her he said merian is home nowback among her family where she belongs you will no longer twist her to your treason twist her wondered tuck she has been more than willing merian is a leader among the forest folk she is whatever she was to you sneered garran she is no more be gone please you must must know you baron neufmarche is my liege lord as william is his we are loyal to the crown in this house if you persist in speaking of this i will report you for treason against the throne of englandas is my sworn duty i beg you sire do not daffyd awstin the king shouted calling for his men who appeared on the run from the stables thrusting a finger at the friar he said throw him out and bar the gate behind him if he does not leave whip him and drag him to the border of eiwasfor i will not suffer him to remain in my sight or on my land another moment i will go and gladly tuck said but let me speak to merian garrans face clenched like a fist mention her name again and priest or no i will cut out your tongue he gave a nod to the two stablehands who stepped forward and roughly took hold of tuck the friar was hauled from the yard and pushed out through the gate sorry friar said one as he closed the gate bless you friend replied tuck with a sigh i do not hold it against you he took a moment to shake the dust from his feet and then started the long walk back to where bran and scarlet were waiting for a better word than he had to give them nor was bran any better pleased than tuck imagined he would be he listened to all that tuck had to say about what had taken place up at the caer and then walked a few paces apart and stood looking at the fortress mound in the near distance he stood there so long that scarlet eventually approached him and said my lord what is your pleasure when bran failed to respond he said if we hurry we can be back in cel craidd before dark without turning bran replied i am not leaving until i have spoken to merian how wondered tuck he will hardly allow any of us inside the caer again bran turned and flashed his crooked smile tuck old friend i have been in and out of that fortress without anyone the wiser more times than youve et hot soup he looked around for a soft spot in the shade its going to be a long night i suggest we rest until it gets dark they tethered the horses so that they might graze among the trees and then settled back to nap and wait for night and the cover of darkness the day passed quietly and night came on when bran reckoned that all in the fortress would be in bed asleep he roused the other two tuck rose yawned shook out his robe and clambered back into the saddle thinking that he would be heartily glad when all this toing and froing was over and peace reigned in the land once more they rode in silence around the base of the hill on which the fortress sat bran picking his way with practiced assurance along a path none of the others could see in the darkness they came to a place below the wall where a small ditch or ravine caused the wall to dip slightly here bran halted and dismounted we are behind the kitchen he explained merians chamber used to be just the other side of the wall pray it is so now and is this why lord cadwgan took such umbrage against you wondered scarlet now that you mention it bran allowed his grin a white glint in the dark that could have had something to do with itnot that any other reason was needed he started up the steep hillside lets be at it quick and silent as a shadow bran was up the slope and over the wall leaving scarlet and tuck to struggle over as best they could by the time tuck eased himself over the rough timber palisade and into the yard bran was already clinging onto the sill below a small glass windowone of only three in the entire fortress bran lightly tapped twice on the small round panes paused and tapped three more times when nothing happened he repeated the same series of raps dyou think shes there asked scarlet bran hissed him to silence and repeated his signal yet again this time there was a tap from the other side and a moment later the window swung inward on its hinges and merians face appeared where the glass had been bran saints and angels it is you merian are you well i thought you would never get here she said i have been praying you would comeand listening for you each night are you well merian i am very wellfor all i am made prisoner in my own house she said tartly but i am not mistreated they think you took me hostage i did and held me against my will they seem to think that if i am given a little time i will come to see how i was tricked into siding with you against the ffreinc until i repent of my folly i am to remain locked in this room well have you out of there soon enough said bran he glanced across to the shuttered window of the kitchen give me a moment and ill come through there is there likely to be anyone awake in the kitchen bran nowait said merian listen to meive been thinking i should stay here a little longer but you just said i know but i think i can persuade garran to send men to aid us tuck tried to ask him already he asked to see you too and garran refused he wouldnt hear anything we had to say you talked to him when today tuck came up but garran had him thrown out of the caer its no use your brother will not go against baron neufmarche in any case he has good reason merian said hes married to the barons daughter what lady sybil neufmarchethey were wed in the spring she explained about her fathers death and funeral and the match the baron had proposed they are living herelady agnes and sybil i mean bran dropped lightly to the ground they wont let you go and no matter what you say youll never persuade them to join us he gestured behind him scarlet tuck come here what are you going to do free you please bran not like this if i stay here i might yet be able to convince them to join us if i leave now it will enrage themand then you will have garran and his men against you too we cannot risk making enemies of those who should be our friends come with me merian i need you bran i pray you think what this means bran paused and looked up at her i remember once not so long ago when i stood where im standing now and asked you to come with me he said do you remember i remember she said you refused to come with me then too oh bran her voice became plaintive this is not like that i will comeas soon as i can until then i will work to bring garran around to our side i can do this youll see bran started away fading into the nightshadowed darkness it is for the best merian insisted you will see farewell merian bran called over his shoulder come he said to scarlet and tuck we are finished there is nothing for us here chapter saint martins the small steading lay amidst fields of barley in a narrow crook of a finger of the vale of elfael north of saint martinsnot the largest holding in elfael nor the closest to the caer but one that gysburne had marked before as a prosperous place and well worth keeping an eye on captain aloin commander of the knights that had been sent to help the abbot and sheriff maintain order in the cantref surveyed the quiet farm from the back of his horse are you certain this is the place asked the captain casting his gaze right and left for any sign of trouble it seems peaceful enough the calm can be misleading replied marshal gysburne these welsh are sly devils every one you must be prepared to fight for your life at any moment the sheriff and abbot had determined to begin retaliation for the most recent predations of king raven and his thieving flock the sack of the welsh farms and confiscation of all supplies stock and provisions would serve as a warning to the folk of the cantrefespecially those who benefited from the thievery to this end a large body of knightsfully half of the entire force accompanied by menat arms and four empty hay wainshad been dispatched to the holding with orders to strip it of all possessions and kill anyone bold enough to resist and when weve finished here captain aloin asked we continue on to the next farm and the next until the wagons are full or until king raven and his foul flock appear how do you know he will come asked captain aloin as he and gysburne rode out from the caer each at the head of a company of soldiers he will appear without a doubt replied marshal guy if not today then tomorrow attacking one of his beloved settlements raises his irekilling a few cymry is sure to bring him out of hiding if that is so surmised aloin then why have you not done this before why have you waited so long and put up with his thievery and treasons all this time because count falkes de braosethe ruler of elfael before he was driven into exilehad no stomach for such tactics he thought it important to gain the trust and goodwill of the people or some such nonsense he said he could not rule if all hands were against him at every turn and now gysburne smiled to himself now things have changed abbot hugo is not so delicate as the count and sheriff de glanville what about him where does he stand in this matter it was de glanville who begged our services from the king i would have thought he would ride out with us today but he has replied gysburne he most certainly hasas you shall see the marshal lifted the reins walk on he said captain aloin raised his fist in the air and gave the signal to move out and the double column of soldiers on horseback continued on upon reaching the farmstead the knights quickly arrayed themselves for battle while half of the company under the command of gysburne rode into the yard and took over the holding aloins division fanned out to form a shield wall to prevent any approach to the property and discourage anyone who might be minded to take an interest in the affair sitting on his great warhorse in the centre of the yard gysburne gave the command to begin knights and menatarms swarmed into the house and dragged out the farmer his wife and daughter and three grown sons there were several others as well hauled out into the earlymorning light to stand in the yard surrounded by enemy soldiers and watch while all their possessions provisions and supplies were bundled into wagons none of the welshmen made even the slightest attempt to interfere with the sack of their home the farmer and his sons stood in stifflegged defiance glowering with pent rage at all those around them but said nothing and did not lift a hand to prevent the pillagewhich gysburne put down to their display of overwhelming military might for once the superior ffreinc forces had cowed the indomitable welsh spirit the ransacking of the house and barn and outbuildings was swiftly accomplished the fact that the soldiers had not had to subdue the hostile natives and the piteous lack of possessions meant that the raid was finished almost as soon as it began it is done reported sergeant jeremias as the last grain sacks were tossed into a waiting wagon what is your command burn it sergeant but siresheriff de glanville said never mind what de glanville said burn it everything to the ground the sight of torches being lit brought the farmer and his sons out of their belligerent stupor they began shouting and cursing and shaking their fists at the ffreinc soldiers one of the younger boys made as if to rush at one of the knights as he passed with a torch but the farmer grabbed his son back and held him fast they all watched as the flames took hold rising skyward on the soft morning air the farmwife held her head in her hands tears streaming down her face still none of the cymry stirred from where they stood when it was certain that the flames could not be extinguished marshal guy gave the order for the knights to be mounted and the company moved off that went well observed aloin when the last of the wagons and soldiers had cleared the yard better than i expectedfrom what you said about the welshies love of fighting yes agreed the marshal slowly in truth i expected more of a fight just see you keep your sword ready we cannot count on the next one being so peaceful but in fact the cymry at the second farm were no more inclined to take arms and resist the pillagers than the first lot like those at the previous settlement the second clan put up no struggle at all bearing the assault with a grave and baleful silence if they did not voice their fury outright their doomful expressions were nevertheless most eloquent again marshal guy could not quite credit the odd docility of the natives when faced with the destruction of their homes but there it was in spite of this conundrum he decided to burn the second farm toothe better to provoke king raven to show himself what now asked captain aloin as the smoke rolled skyward the wagons are almost full almost full is not enough replied guy we go on and if this king of the ravens does not appear what then then well take the wagons back to the caer and raid again tomorrow we keep at it until he comes youre sure about that oui oh yes hell come he always does the third farmstead lay almost within sight of the walls of caer cadarn it was small and owing to its nearness to the town and stronghold it had suffered plundering by ffreinc troops before and guy remembered it the farm was quiet as the soldiers surrounded the property no one came out to meet the soldiers as they entered the yard so gysburne ordered sergeant jeremias to go in and bring the farmer and his family out the sergeant returned a moment later there is no one here my lord they must have gone into hiding concluded the marshal they knew we were coming asked captain aloin how so the welsh are uncanny this way explained gysburne i dont know how they know but word travels on the air in these valleys they seem to know everything that happens turning back to the sergeant he said ransack the barn and granary they will not have had time to carry anything away jeremias hurried off strip it he called take everything the soldiers dismounted and while the wagons were driven into position they moved off to the buildings the first manatarms to reach the barn threw open the doors and started into be met by the angry waspbuzz of arrows streaking out of the dark interior he and two other soldiers dropped dead to the ground three more staggered back clutching their chests and staring in horror at the oaken shafts that had so suddenly appeared there marshal guy saw the arrows flash and realized they were under attack he turned to the soldiers who were just then about to enter the house halt he shouted dont go in there but the knights hand was on the door and he had already pushed it open with a sound like that of a whip snapping against naked flesh the first flight of arrows struck home four knights fell as one an errant arrow glanced off a soldiers helmet and careered off at an angle striking a horse standing in the yard the animal reared and began bucking in a forlorn effort to relieve the lethal sting in its side then all was chaos as everywhere knights and menatarms were stumbling back colliding with one another fleeing the deadly and unseen assault with desperate shouts and screams of agony they shrank from the arrows that continued to stream into the yard seemingly from every direction at once there was no escaping them with each flight more soldiers droppedby twos and threes they fell pierced by the lethal missiles to arms to arms cried captain aloin trying to rally his troops seal the barn seal the barn and burn it in answer to the command three wellarmoured knights leapt to obey through the deadly onslaught they ran their shields high before them as shaft after shaft hammered into the splintering wood one of the knights reached the righthand door of the barn and flung it closed he put his back against it to hold it shut while his two comrades flung the lefthand door closed the torches get the torches shouted the first knight still bracing the door shut he drew breath to shout once more and shrieked in agony instead as with the sound of a branch breaking in a storm the steel point of an arrow slammed through the planking and poked through the centre of his chest he gave out a strangled yelp and slumped down his body snagged and caught by the strong oaken shaft of the arrow his two companions holding the lefthand barn door heard the sharp cracking sound and watched aghast as three more arrows penetrated the stout timber doors to half their length had their backs been to the door they would have suffered the same fate as their unfortunate comrade meanwhile arrows continued to fly from the housefrom the door and the two small windows facing the yard which had become a tumult of plunging horses and frightened men scrambling over the bodies of corpses the wagon drivers defenceless in the centre of the yard threw themselves from their carts and ran for safety beyond range of the whistling shafts this left the oxen to fend for themselves confused and terrified by the violent turmoil the beasts strained at their yokes and tried to break their traces unable to escape they stood in wildeyed terror and bawled when the barn doors burst open once more a tall slender figure appeared in the gap a mans form from shoulders to the tips of his tall black boots but bearing the head of an enormous bird with a weird skulllike black face and a wickedly long narrow beak in its hand the creature clutched a longbow with an arrow nocked to the string the smooth expressionless face surveyed the churning turmoil with a quick sweep of its head picked out gysburne and directed an arrow at him the marshal who was already wheeling his horse took the arrow on his shield as three more archers joined the creature and proceeded to loose shaft after shaft at will into the melee retreat cried gysburne trying to make himself heard above the commotion retreat arrows singing around his ears guy put his head down and raced from the yard those soldiers still in the saddle and those yet able to walk or run followed five more met their deaths before the last of the knights had cleared the yard the ffreinc raiding party continued to a place beyond arrows reach and halted to regroup what was that shouted captain aloin as he came galloping in beside the marshal what in the holy name was that that was king raven replied guy pulling an arrow from his shield and another from the cantle of his saddle that was the fiend at his worst by the blood breathed the captain how many were with him i dont know it doesnt matter doesnt matter captain aloin cried in stunned disbelief gazing quickly around him he counted those who had escaped the massacre are you insane weve lost more than half our men in a onesided slaughter and you say it doesnt matter six or sixty muttered guy what does it matter we were beaten by those godcursed arrows this is an outrage growled the captain of the kings men mark me by heaven someone will pay for this i daresay they will agreed guy looking away towards the forest where he imagined he saw the glint of sunlight off a steel blade what are we to do now demanded aloin are we to retreat and let the bastards get away with it we run but they wont get away said guy sheriff de glanville will see to that chapter are they gone asked owain his fingers tight around the arrow nocked to his bowstring shhh said iwan gently stay sharp well wait just a little and then take a look round he turned to siarles crouched low behind the doorpost of the farmhouse see to it siarles but keep an eye out for the wounded there might be some fight in one or two yet siarles nodded and continued to watch the yard from one of the small windows nothing moved outside the three archers waited a few moments more alert arrows on string listening for any sound of returning horsesbut save for a low whimpering moan from one of the fallen soldiers all seemed quiet enough siarles rose and stepped lightly through the door paused and looked around then disappeared into the yard at a run he was back a few moments later saying theyve gone its safe to come out as they stepped from the house bran tomas and rhoddi emerged from the barn to me men bran called pulling off the hooded raven mask when everyone had gathered he said strip the dead of anything useful throw it in the wagons and lets fly home scarlet and the others will be tired of waiting arent we going to give back all the supplies theyve stolen asked owain aye lad replied iwan but not now not today your concern does you credit owain bran told him but the enemy will return to the caer and muster the rest of the soldiers to come and retrieve their dead unless we hurry well meet them again and this time well not own the advantage too many ffreinc around for the few of us iwan told him well return the supplies when its a mite safer theres eighteen fewer ffreinc now than there were a while ago announced siarles who had been making a count and four more that will likely join em before the sun is over the barn twentytwo gasped rhoddi god help us that must be near half their forcedestroyed in one battle there will be hell to pay muttered tomas as the realization of the enormity of their success came over him too right there will agreed bran but we must make very sure it is the abbot who pays come men lets be about our business before the marshal comes back so while siarles kept watch the other five archers stripped the dead and dying tossing the various articles into the wagons the soldiers had abandoned in their retreat then leading the oxen from the yard they departednot by the road which led away to the fortress and townbut by the field track that led up through the valley towards coed cadw the guardian wood owing to the weight of the wagons and the slowness of the oxen they could not travel as swiftly as the demands of the situation warranted even so they reached the edge of the forest in due course without any sign of pursuing ffreinc as they drew in towards the line of trees however the leaves of the nearby hawthorn bushes quivered rattling an alarm bran in the lead glanced up in time to see the round gleaming top of a norman helmet rising from the brush the spear was in the air before bran could shout a warning he dodged to the side and the missile caught owain a few steps behind him the young man gave out a yelp and fell back bran had an arrow in the air before owains body came to rest in the grass the stone point struck the helmet and shattered scattering shards into the attackers eyes he screamed and sank out of sight instantly another soldier was there in his place and others were appearing in a ragged rank all along the forest line ambush shouted bran loosing an arrow at the nearest head to appear fall back shouted iwan stooping low he scooped up the wounded owain put him over his shoulder as lightly as a sheaf of wheat and ran to the nearest wagon ducking behind it as the spears began to fall the four archers joined the champion behind the wagon and all looked to bran for a way out of their predicament how many are there asked siarles anybody see plenty for each of us iwan said never you fear owain said bran owain look at me how bad are you it hurts groaned the young man through gritted teeth he held his side above his hip blood seeped through his fingers im lying if i say otherwise but get my feet under me and i can walk we cant stay here iwan told them theyll charge soon and cut us down in the open like this right said bran everyone nock an arrow and be ready to move they cant run and throw at the same time so as soon as they mount the charge we go for the greenwood go into them said tomas aye replied iwan headfirst into the charge smack em hard in the teeth said siarles glancing up as a spear head chipped through the side of the wagon above his head itll be the only thing theyre not expecting once were in the trees we have a chance bran said reaching over the side of the wagon he pulled down a norman shield and handed it to owain then took the young mans bag of arrows and passed them around to the others did anyone see which manjack is leadin em asked siarles as he peered around the back of the wagon towards the tree line the question went unanswered as there came a rising cry from the forest and ffreinc soldiers rushed up out of the brush towards the wagons ready shouted bran now fly out from behind the wagon he darted raising his bow he drew on the foremost knight just then charging up out of the bush the bowstring slapped and the arrow blurred across the distance lifting the onrushing soldier off his feet and throwing him onto his back the sudden absence of the soldier created a hole in the line and iwan running hard behind his lord opened it a little wider by taking out the soldier to the left of the first spears sailed in deadly arcs slicing through the sundrenched air sprouting like leafless saplings in turf the archers dodged those that sprang up in their path loosing arrows as they ran the gap which iwan and bran had opened narrowed as more knights screaming and cursing drove in desperate to close on the fleeing outlaws before they could reach the wood bran loosed the last of his arrows put his head down and ran two heavily armoured knights lurched into the gap low behind their spears the nearest lunged making a wide swipe with the spear blade and the second let fly the throw was low and skidded along the ground bran leapt over it easily but iwan coming two steps behind was not so lucky the sliding shaft snaked through the grass gliding between his feet he tripped and fell onto his left side the knight was on him instantly sword drawn with a shout of triumph he swung the blade high and prepared to deliver the killing stroke iwan defenceless on his back saw the blade flash as it swung up and threw his hands before him to ward off the blow but the knights cry of triumph stuck in his throat and he seemed to strain against the blade that had become inextricably caught in the air the knight sword still high crashed to his knees his eyes wide in shock and disbelief iwan had just time enough to roll aside as the knights body jolted forward with the force of the second arrow which drove him facedown into the ground as iwan scrambled to his feet he saw twin shafts protruding from the knights mail hauberk here iwan the champion looked to the shout and saw scarlet bow in hand waving him forward the first knight still gripping his spear made a second swipe at bran who grabbed hold of the spear shaft with his free hand pulling the soldier towards him as the knight fell forward bran swung his longbow like a club into the mans face the knight lowered his head and let his helmet take the blow then thrust again with the spear bran lashed out with his foot catching the knight on the chin his jaw snapped shut with a teethshattering crack and his head flew back bran swung the body of the longbow down hard and the mailclad knight went down as he sprawled on the ground bran light as a deer in flight took a running step planted a foot in the middle of the mans back and vaulted over him he reached the shelter of the trees to find scarlet waiting for him here my lord said the forester thrusting a handful of arrows at him youll be needing these i think thanks will said bran breathing hard this way scarlet led him along the tree line and together they loosed arrow after arrow into the ffreinc from behind until the remaining archers had reached the wood now king raven and his men occupied the wood and the ffreinc were exposed on open ground as the lethal oaken shafts struck again and again some of the knights sought shelter behind the wagons others crawled back into the wood bran and scarlet gathered the archers how many arrows have you got left bran asked as the men gathered under cover of a bramble thicket two said siarles tomas and scarlet each had two as well none of the others had any then this fight is over said bran just leave objected siarles we can end it now with but six arrows no siarles bran told him we live to fight another day its time to go home wheres tuck got to wondered iwan he should be nearby scarlet replied he was right beside me before the charge do you want me to go look for him we cant be leaving him behind for the ffreinc to capture said iwan scarlet and i will find him bran said the rest of you start back to cel craidd he held out his hand give us the arrows he took the remaining arrows and urged them away go well join you on the way the others disappeared into the bush where were you when this started bran asked passing three arrows to scarlet show me this way will told him starting back along the tree line to the place he and tuck had been hiding when the attack began no sooner had they skirted a large bramble thicket than they heard someone call out scarlet here boyo i think it came from over there somewhere said scarlet both men turned and started for the spot they quickly came to a dense wall of elder and halted tuck sing out brother where are you here came the voice once more this way hurry the two pushed through the elder hedge to find the little priest holding a sturdy quarterstaff in one hand and a sword in the other as he stood astraddle an inert figure on the ground the figure groaned and made to rise and the friar gave him a sharp rap between the shoulder blades that pushed him back down thank the good lord youre here breathed tuck i was halfway to wishing id never acaught this one hes getting to be a handful here now said bran taking the sword stand aside and lets see who youve got tuck moved away but kept the staff at the ready bran took hold of the prostrate mans hair and lifted his head from the ground richard de glanville he exclaimed his surprise genuine glancing around to the friar he said well done tuck you are a very wonder he released his handful of hair and the groggy head thumped back onto the earth with a little luck and providence on our side we may reclaim the throne of elfael far sooner than we ever dared hope truly aye declared bran with the sheriff s valuable assistance of course but we must act quickly we cannot give gysburne and hugo time to think chapter well heres a prize we never thought to get remarked iwan he put a hand to the sheriff s shoulder and rolled him over onto his back the sheriff moaned his eyelids fluttering as he struggled for consciousness but he made no effort to rise bran had quickly recalled his men and they gathered once more to receive new instructions as bran began to explain what he had in mind their prisoner regained his senses vous jai pense jai senti la merde groaned the sheriff in a voice thick and slurred what did he say asked bran nothing nice replied tuck he gave the sheriff a kick with the toe of his shoe and warned him to speak respectfully or keep his mouth shut me tuer et est fait he wants us to kill him now and be done with it offered the friar kill a valuable prisoner like you said bran squatting down he patted the sheriff s clothes and felt along his belt before withdrawing a dagger which he took and handed to scarlet i suppose youd prefer death just now but youll have to become accustomed to disappointment to tuck he added tell him what i said tuck relayed brans words to de glanville who groaned and put his face to the ground once more what is in your mind my lord asked iwan bind him bran directed and get him on his feet gysburne and his men will be recovering their courage and any moment they might take it into their heads to come after us siarles tomassee how many arrows you can get from the field and hurry back the two hurried off returning a short while later with eight shafts collected in fair condition from dead soldiers which added to the six they already possessed brought the total to fourteen i would there were more but these will have to do bran said pray it is enough he gave arrows to each of the archers save the wounded owain and himself instead he shouldered his bow and took the sheriff s sword and instructed tuck to ask de glanville where the ffreinc had hidden their horses tuck did so and received a terse replyto which tuck responded with another sharp rap of his staff against the sheriff s shins de glanville let out a yelp of pain and spat a string of words he says theyre behind the rocks reported tuck pointing a short distance away to a heap of boulders half covered in ivy and bracken while siarles and rhoddi collected the horses bran turned to owain do you think you can ride his face was white and he was sweating but his voice was steady as he replied i can ride my lord very well bran nodded he turned to tomas im sending you and owain back to cel craidd tell angharad and the others what has happened and to see to owains wound then get alan and bring him the two of you meet us on the roadthe place near the stream where the willows grow tomas nodded i know the place then go ride like the devil himself was on your tail to the others bran said find us something to drink and be ready to ride as soon as siarles and rhoddi return with the horses what about the wagons asked iwan leave them said bran if all goes well we will own not only the wagons but all the rest of elfael before nightfall the graves had been dug outside the abbey walls and the first bodies were being laid to rest under the solemn gaze of captain aloin and the chanting of psalms from some of saint martins monks when one of the gravediggers glanced up and saw in the crimson light of a fading sunset a body of men on horseback riding towards them from the direction of the forest at first thought he assumed it must be sheriff de glanville and his men returning at last from their part in the days events so he said nothing but as the riders came closer a trickle of doubt began to erode his assumption captain aloin bruised and battered by his first encounter with king raven and the lethal welsh longbows had determined to raise the issue of what he considered marshal guys murderous incompetence with both the abbot and the sheriff at first opportunity clearly gysburne had to go aloin was thinking how best to put his case before the abbot and did not hear the monk speaking to him he felt a touch on his arm and glanced up mon seigneur regarder said the monk aloin shifted his eyes from the corpse being lowered into the grave and looked where the monk was pointing the approaching horsemen were near enough now to make out their faces and what he saw was not the sheriff and his men but strangers riding ffreinc horses qui dans les flames cest le gallois que the one they call king raven said the monk blind them they have sheriff de glanville instantly terrified the monks and soldiers scattered running for the safety of the abbey walls within moments the abbey bells were signalling alarm the few remaining knights who were not seriously wounded scurried to arm themselves and meet the attack what they met instead were seven outlaws surrounding a redfaced sullen sheriff richard de glanville bound with his own belt the town square had been given over to the wounded from the days earlier skirmishes they had been laid on pallets in the open air to have their injuries tended by the monks who moved among the rows of pallets bathing and bandaging the injuries and offering what comfort they could to the dying the outlaws rode to the entrance of the square and one of themin good plain frenchcalled aloud for abbot hugo the abbot heeding the warning of king ravens approach had hidden himself in the guard tower to be defended by the eight knights still able to fight these had arrayed themselves before the tower weapons levelled ready for the attack when the abbot failed to present himself the frenchspeaking outlaw called marshal guy de gysburne show yourself there was a movement at the foot of the tower i am guy said the marshal shoving through the knot of men what is this this replied alan putting out a hand to the sheriff is all that is left of the company sent out to plunder the countryside this morning the battle is over and we have come to negotiate the terms of surrender surrender scoffed gysburne your surrender i expect no my lord replied alan adale the surrender of abbot hugo and yourself and those of your men still alive you will bring the abbot now so that we can begin a knight moved to take his place beside the marshal you must be insane he charged coming here like this he flung an accusing finger at the outlaw band come down off your horses you filthy dogs we will settle this here and now bran leaned near his interpreter and spoke a few words which alan passed on speaking to gysburne who is this man my lord wishes to know i am captain aloin by the blood come down here and hear me marshal gysburne interrupted alan you will tell your man to hold his tongue we have nothing to say to him you arrogant dog sneered guy he spat on the ground in a show of contempt there will be no talk of surrender alan paused to confer with bran then nodded and continued rhi bran urges you to take a good long look around you marshal he said unless you wish to join your men here in the squareor out in the ground behind the abbeyyou will do well to reconsider gysburne and aloin exchanged a word and the marshal replied we hold this realm by order of king william you have gone against my lords longbows twice today and have been beaten both times do you truly wish to try again if so be assured that you and the sheriff will be the first to dieand then what is left of your men will join you alan paused to allow this to sink in among all those listening then in a plaintive tone he added think man there has been enough killing today bring the abbot and let him surrender and put an end to the bloodshed bran lifted the sword in his hand and from their saddles the archers on either flank bent the bellies of their longbows guy hesitated a moment more then called out sergeant jeremias do as he says fetch the abbot prudence is a virtue tuck muttered under his breath as he watched the sergeant dart up the stone steps of the tower and wisdom is gained through trials of many kinds most always too late added scarlet there followed a tense and uneasy interval in which both sides glared across the square at one another captain aloin seeing that there were but six cymry archers one ragged monk and an unarmed translator was for rushing them on the chance that his few healthy knights might overwhelm them we can take them aloin whispered at most theyll only get an arrow or two off before we cut them down yes and its the first arrow that kills you replied marshal guy have you already forgotten what happened at the farm it is madness to deal with them that is as may be granted gysburne but do you really want to add another slaughter to your tally today it is the abbot they want so we let him decide at last the abbot appeared and owing to the look of stunned horror on his face he hardly seemed the same man clearly the last thing he expected of this day was to find his enemy standing in the town square delivering demands of capitulation but that was how things stood bouchers he snarled as he came striding up trying to rouse his innate defiance les meurtres pax labbe shouted bran across the yard your life and those of your men is in our hands be quiet and listen if you want that life to continue another breath longer alan relayed these words to the abbot who subsided ask him what he wantsmy head on a silver platter i suppose bran smiled when he heard this and replied no abbot your head is worth less than the trouble it would take to carve it from your scabby shoulders but here is what i want you are to lay down your arms and leave elfaelyou and all your men and any of the townsfolk who choose to go with you alan translated brans demand and the abbots face darkened see here he protested you have no ri you sent soldiers against me today and the issue has been decided i claim the victors right to the spoils if you would keep your life you must leave this place and never return allow me a moment to confer with my commander said the abbot when alan had finished without waiting for a reply he turned to marshal gysburne idiot do somethingyou just stand there attack kill them the first man to advance against them is dead where he stands my lord abbot replied guy so please by all means lead the way but they cannot get away with thisjust like that just like that theyve killed nearly forty of our men today already priest gysburnes voice was an ugly growl are you blind as well as stupid look around you the soldiers you see on their feet are all we have left how many more must die to satisfy your insane ambitions the abbot gazed around at his sorely beaten troops as if seeing them for the first time this is all we have left every last one replied gysburne where are the rest either dead or dyingand im not joining them not like this not today the marshal is right abbot conceded captain aloin at last make the best bargain you can and well go back to the king and raise a force large enough to vanquish these bandits for once and all we were beaten today but the war is not over we live to fight again bran having permitted them to speak freely signalled alan to bring the discussion to an end enough he called what is it to be lord bran says you must give your answer now abbot hugo drew himself up to full height he lifted his head some of the old defiance returning i agree to nothing he announced until you accept our conditions what conditions bran asked when alan informed him of the abbots reply perhaps you will accept the same conditions you offered those farm families this morning the abbots lip curled into a silent snarl i thought not continued bran speaking through alan here are the conditions i offer you are to depart now taking nothing with you but the clothes on your back this reply occasioned a long and impassioned plea from the abbot what did he say bran asked the coward is afraid you mean to slaughter them all the moment their backs are turned he wants safe conduct to the border of elfael tell him he can have that and gladly agreed bran also tell him that as long as he abides by the terms of surrender no one will be killed when this was relayed to the abbot the cleric made another impassioned speech now what does he want said bran losing his patience he says he needs time to gather his thingshis papers and such said alan i wouldnt trust him further than i could spit muttered tuck look at himthe old devil he probably means to empty the treasury before he goes i know i would added scarlet do not let them out of your sight said iwan theres no telling what he might get up to they have to leave now insisted siarles with nothing but the clothes on their backs bran lifted the reins and urged his mount a few steps closer hear me abbot that you live to draw breath when so many who served you are dead this day is insult to heaven above and gods creatures below you will go now taking only what you have hidden in your robes your men are to lay down their arms now when that is done you will all be escorted from elfaelnever to return on pain of death what about the wounded said gysburne they cannot travel bran held a quick consultation with tuck and iwan and alan relayed the decision they will continue to be cared for by the monks of the abbey until they are well enough to leave he pointed to the sheriff who sat slumped in the saddle with his head down miserable in defeat when the last is fit to travel all will be sent along with the monks in the care of the sheriff to ensure that this agreement is upheld de glanville will remain a hostage until that time his life is forfeit if you fail to honour your part you mean to kill them all anyway as soon as were gone said gysburne as alan relayed the marshals words bran gazed at his adversary with an expression so hard it might have been carved of stone tell him he replied that if i meant to kill them they would be dead already how do we know youll keep your word demanded aloin when the translator finished you will all die here and now if the surrender is not agreed said alan my lord bran says that if his word is not acceptable then you are free to take your wounded with you now the abbot did not like this last proviso and made to dispute it but bran would not relent in the end gysburne sealed the bargain by turning the sword in his hand and throwing it down in the dirt halfway between himself and bran god in heaven be praised said tuck i do believe theyre going to surrender youve done it bran you beautiful man youve done it steady on friar replied bran this is not finished yet by a long throw we are dancing on a knife edge here pray we dont yet slip he cast his gaze around the square i greatly fear a fall now would prove fatal all of you said iwan pointing to the sword on the ground one by one the soldiers added their weapons to the marshals captain aloin was the last to disarm what now said siarles gather round everyone said bran and explained how they were to shepherd the ffreinc through the forest well see them to the vale of wye and release them at the border of the march then they are on their own it will be dark soon tuck pointed out then we had best get started bran replied all saints and angels bear witness on my life they will not spend another night in my realm chapter castle neufmarche four long days on the road brought the weary abbot and his footsore companysix soldiers three monks and two dejected commandersto the busy market town of hereford the principal seat of baron neufmarche very possibly the baron may have been the closest thing to an ally that abbot hugo possessed just then exhausted begrimed from his journey and aching from sleeping in rude beds appropriated from settlements alongside the road hugo lifted his sweaty face to the solid stone walls of the castle on the hill above the town and felt what it must be like for weary pilgrims to behold the promised land here at last he would be given a welcome worthy of his rank moreover if he sharpened his appeal with hints of clerical patronageoffers of perpetual prayer and special indulgences excusing the baron from certain past sinshugo imagined he might enlist the barons aid to help him recover his abbey and reclaim elfael from the hands of that blasted king raven and his troop of outlaws captain aloin he called climbing down from a swaybacked horsethe only one they had been able to commandeer from the first norman town they had come to after leaving the march you and your men will rest and wait for us in the town go to the monastery and get some food and drinkmy monks will take you there where are you going abbot marshal guy and i will go to the baron and see if he is of a mood to receive us if all goes well i will send for you as soon as suitable arrangements can be made the captain who had risked life and limb in the abbots service and whose troops bore the brunt of the failure to roust king raven from his roost was not best pleased to be shut out of the proceedings now but aloin was too tired to argue so agreedif only that he might find a cool place to sit down that much sooner he waved the marshal and abbot away ordered his men to go with the monks and fetch food and drink from the abbey and bring some back for him and then sitting himself down in the shade of the stone archway leading into the town square he pulled off his boots and closed his eyes before he drifted off to sleep it occurred to him that this was likely the last he would see of the abbot this caused him fleeting concern yet close on this first thought was another if he never saw that grasping arrogant conniving churchman again well all things considered that was fine too meanwhile bernard neufmarche lord of hereford and gloucester was sitting in his private courtyard gazing up at the sky for no other reason than that he thought a shadow had passed over him and he felt a sudden chill he glanced up to see if an errant cloud had obscured the sun for a moment but there were no clouds and the sun shone as brightly as ever the baron was not a man for omens or portents but it did seem to him that latelyat least ever since his lady wife had become smitten with all things welshhe often had odd feelings and sudden urges to do things he had never done before such as sit quietly alone with his thoughts in his pleasant courtyard moreover he often entertained the notion that strange forces were swirling around him moving him towards destinations and destinies unknown he smiled at his own superstitious naturesomething else he never did when remey his redcapped seneschal appeared in the doorway to tell him that he had visitors he felt the intrusion like a clammy dampness in the small of his back odd that who is it he asked and before remey could reply he added send them away i do not wish to see anyone today of course my lord baron replied the seneschal smoothly but you may wish to reconsider when i tell you that abbot hugo de rainault and marshal guy de gysburne have arrived on foot alone and wish to speak to you most urgently indeed wondered the baron intrigued now very well he sighed rising from his warm bench give them something to drink and i will join them in the hall i want to speak to father gervais first very wise my lord remey withdrew to find the steward and order some refreshments for the barons unexpected guests when his servant had gone the baron walked slowly across the courtyard to an opposite doorway which led onto the porch of the little chapel where he found the familys elderly priest sitting in a pool of light from the courtyard and nodding over a small parchment chapbook in his lap the baron picked up the book it was the gospel of saint matthew in latin he was able to pick out a few words here and there and the thought came to him that perhaps it was time he learned to read properlynot like a barnyard chicken pecking seeds willynilly the old priest awoke with a start oh bless me i must have dozed off good day to you my son and gods rich blessing very well father replied the baron and thanked the priest i would not disturb your meditations but we have visitorsabbot hugo de rainault and his marshal guy of some such i believe you know the abbot i had dealings with him now and then replied the priest but that was a long time ago i would not say i knew him the baron considered this and turned another page of the book in his hand there must be trouble in elfael mused the baron idly i can think of no other reason de rainault would turn up at my door the priest considered this yes he agreed slowly no doubt you are right about that then again it has been very quiet of late we would have heard about any trouble i think perhaps not countered the baron the outlaws own the kings road through the forest nothing moves in or out of wales that they do not allowwhich is why i expect this visit means trouble you know best bernard well in any event well soon find out said the baron with a sigh im going to see them now but i wanted to ask if you would come with me to greet them id like to have you there father certainly my son id be delighted the baron held out his hand to the elder man and helped him to his feet these old bones get slower every day said the priest rising heavily nonsense father replied baron neufmarche the years touch you but lightly bah now who is speaking nonsense they strolled amiably to the barons great hall where at a table near the wide double door leading to the castles main yard a very dusty gysburne and travelsoiled abbot were finishing their wine and cheese my lord baron declared gysburne standing quickly and brushing crumbs from his tunic god be good to you sire my thanks for your inestimable hospitality god with you marshal replied the baron and with you abbot de rainault greetings and welcome i hope you are well abbot hugo extended his hand to be reverenced god with you baron i fear you find me not at all well oh i am sorry to hear it the baron turned to his companion and they exchanged a knowing glance may i present my dear friend father gervais i think you may know one another the abbot glanced at the elderly cleric no i dont think so i would remember god with you father he gave the old man a nod and dismissed him with a slighting smile it will save us all some bother if i come to the point my lord i am all for it replied the baron please continue there has been a wicked uprising in elfael soldiers under the command of marshal guy here were slaughtered in an unprovoked attack and the fortress taken in short we have been driven from our lands by an uprising of welsh rebels i say rebels and so they style themselves in truth they are little more than thieves and outlaws every last one i see baron bernard frowned thoughtfully that is not good news what is more they have killed a regiment of kings men under the command of one captain aloin the few survivors have been driven into exile with me hmmm said the baron shaking his head these rebels lord abbot said father gervais would they be the same that control the kings road through the forest we have heard about them the same since you ask yes the same their strength in arms and numbers has grown in these last months and they have become ever more bold in their raiding and thieving we had hoped that the arrival of the kings soldiers would have been sufficient to discourage them alas they respect no authority and live only to shed innocent blood how many men did the king lend you wondered the baron summoning a steward with a gesture a chair for father gervais he said and one for myself bring us wine too the steward brought the chairs and another produced a small table for the wine while the cups were filled the abbot continued how many kings men did i have too few by the rood if we had received numbers sufficient to the taskand which i specifically requested mind youi am certain this disaster could have been averted it is only through my most stringent endeavours at persuasion that any of us have survived at all marshal guy stared at the abbot whose lies he almost believed himself the attack was vicious and unprovoked as i say concluded the abbot they struck without warning and showed no mercy though we mounted a vigorous defence we were at last overwhelmed we were fortunate to escape with our lives yes no doubt mused the baron thoughtfully you said they were with you the soldiers who survived the attackwhere are they now in the town replied guy weve been on the road for four days without horses we are all of us exhausted of course replied the baron guy could not fail to notice that the baron did not offer to send for the troops and bring them to the castle to be fed in fact the baron seemed more than content to let the matter rest where it lay the abbot however was not so inclined he had the spoon in his fist and meant to stir the pot with it my lord baron said hugo offering up his cup to be refilled how many men have you under your command the baron waited while the wine was poured not as many as i should like he answered raising his cup to his lips times being what they are he drank a sip to give himself a little time to think no doubt king william would be able to raise as many as required he smiled but i am no king no of course not replied the abbot he placed his cup carefully on the table and looked the baron full in the face even so i would like to ask you to consider lending me some of your soldiers nowhe raised his hand as if to forestall an objection he saw comingthink carefully before you answer you would be aiding the church in its ongoing affairs and that would place me in a position to pass along certain indulgences he watched the baron for his reaction certain shall we say very valuable indulgences the perpetual prayers of an abbey can guarantee salvation on the day of judgement as we knowwhich is ordinarily obtained only at great expense the baron still smiling said nothing you could of course lead your men continued hugo i would not presume to usurp your place on the field indeed i have no doubt that under your able command elfael would be rid of the outlaws within two or three daysa week at most baron neufmarche placed his cup very deliberately on the table and leaned forward your confidence in me is most gratifying lord abbot and of course i wish i were in a position to help unfortunately what you suggest is difficult just nownot to say impossible i am truly sorry the abbots face froze his white hair wild on his head his pristine satin robe stained from the toil of his flight he appeared haggard and old as he gazed at the baron trying to find a way over the stone wall so deftly thrown into his path ah well he said at last i find it never hurts to ask you have not because you ask not declared father gervais suddenly saint james i believe precisely murmured the abbot thinking furiously how to rescue his stranded request what plans have you made inquired the baron looking to gysburne we will go to the king answered guy his men would return in any case and we the king yes interrupted the abbot rousing himself to life again it is his cantref after all and his to defend my thoughts exactly concurred the baronas if the point had been under dispute but was now successfully resolved to the satisfaction of all it goes without saying that i would ask you to stay here and rest a few days but i can see that the urgency of your journey requires you to reach londein without delay i only wish it was possible to lend you horses for the remainder of your journeyhe spread his hands helplesslybut alas such is not the case your thoughtfulness is commendable intoned the abbot he slumped wearily in his chair looking more and more like an old bone that had been gnawed close and tossed onto the midden heap no no countered the baron it is nothing please you will stay and eat something before you go i insist then my commander will escort you to rejoin your men in the town and see you on your way youve come this far without incident we dont wish to see anything ill befall you now do we and that was that a cold supper was brought to the chamber and while the abbot and marshal ate two mules were loaded with provisions to be led by a driver who would accompany them and bring the animals back upon their arrival in londein as the abbot and marshal were preparing to leave the baron and several of his men joined them in the yard to bid the visitors farewell god speed you my friends he said cheerily at least you have good weather for your journey at the very least agreed the abbot sourly ah said the baron as if thinking of it for the first time there was a sheriff i believe in elfael you didnt say what became of him killed i suppose in the battle not at all answered gysburne sheriff de glanville was leading a division of men who were butchered by the rebels all were murdered save the sheriff who was taken prisoner and is being held hostage they promise to release him once our wounded soldiers are well enough to travel although what is to become of him i cannot say i see said baron neufmarche gravely a bad business all around well i bid you adieu and wish you safe travels he turned and summoned his commander to his side see here ormand he said my friends are travelling to londein on an errand of some urgency i want you to escort them through the town and see them safely to the borders of my realm let nothing untoward happen to them while they are with you to be sure sire ormand a capable and levelheaded knight who served as the barons marshal put out a hand to his new charges shall we proceed my lords after you the baron standing at the topmost gate waved his unwanted guests away he waited until they were lost to sight in the narrow street leading down from the castle then hurrying to his chambers he called for a pen and parchment to send a message to the baroness in wales informing her of the uprising and instructing her to tell king garran to gather his soldiers and be ready to step in should the revolt show signs of spreading remey he called waving the small square of parchment in the air to dry the ink i need a messenger at onceand see that he has the fastest horse in the stable i want this delivered to lady agnes this time tomorrow and no later chapter londein cardinal flambard pulled up the hem of his robe and stepped over the low rail of the boat and onto the dock he dipped into his purse for a coin and flipped it to the ferryman then turned and strolled up the dock avoiding the gulls fighting over piles of fish guts some unthinking oaf had left to swelter in the sun he raised his eyes to the billings gate and started his climb up the steep bank stifling an inward sigh it was his lot ever to run to the kings least whim and answer his majestys flimsiest fancy like two men sharing a prison cell they were chained to one another until one of them died such was the price of standing so near the throne standing ranulf flambard occupied that gilded seat as often as ever the king sat thereconsidering that red william remained in perpetual motion flitting here and there and everywhere stamping out rebellion squabbling with his disgruntled brothers resisting the constant incursions by the mother church into what he considered his private affairs and when the king wasnt doing that he was hunting in fact that was william always at the sharp end of any conflict going or failing that causing one and the dutiful ranulf flambard chief justiciar of england was there at his side to pick up the pieces it was to williams side that he was summoned now and he laboured up from the stinking jetty with a scented cloth pressed to his nose the riverside at the rank end of summer was a very cesspoolwhen was it not proceeding through the narrow streets lining the great citys wharf he allowed himself to think what life might be like as a bishop in a remote upcountry see as attractive as the notion seemed at the moment would all that serenity soon pall it was not likely he would ever find out turning from that he wondered what fresh debacle awaited him this time at the gate to the white tower he was admitted without delay and personally conducted by the porter to the entrance to the kings private apartment where his presence was announced by the chamberlain following a short interval he was admitted oh flambard its you said william glancing up he was stuffing the voluminous tail of his shirt into his tootight breeches finishing the chore he started towards the door at last i came as soon as i received your summons majesty forgive me for not anticipating your call eh yes well red william looked at his chief advisor and tried to work out whether flambard was mocking him he could not tell so let it go youre here now and theres work to do a pleasure sire he made a tight little bow that perfected over years of service had become little more than a slight nod of the head with a barely discernible bend at the waist am i to know what has occasioned this summons my lord it is all to do with that business in elvile william said pushing past the justiciar and bowling down the corridor which led to his audience rooms remember all that ruck i seem to have a recollection sire there was some trouble with one of the baronsde braose if i recall the incident correctly you banished the baron and took the cantref under your authorityplaced it in the care of some abbot or other and a sheriff somebody you remember good decided the king then you can talk to him talk to whom majesty if i may ask that blasted abbothes here been driven off his perch by bandits apparently demanding an audience screaming the roof down the king stopped walking so abruptly that the cardinal almost collided with his squat solid form give him whatever he wants nowhatever it takes to make him go away im off to normandie in a fortnight and i cannot spare even a moment i understand highness replied the cardinal judiciously i will see what can be done they continued on to the audience chamber discussing the kings proposed journey to normandie where he planned to meet with king philip to challenge the french monarchs increasingly flagrant incursions beyond the borders of the vexin philip is a low craven ass his trespasses will not be tolerated hear said william as he pushed open the chamber door ah there you are this was spoken as if the king had spent the better part of the day in a harried search for the petitioner my lord and majesty said the abbot once again resplendent in a simple white satin robe and purple stole you honour your servant with your presence william waved aside the flattery what is it you want i was told it was a matter of some urgency speak man lets get it done my lord said abbot hugo i fear i bring unhappy tidings the who are you asked the king turning to the young man standing a few steps behind the abbot well step up let me know you i am marshal guy de gysburne at your service sire replied the knight gysburne eh i think i know your fatherup north somewhere isnt it indeed majesty are you the sheriff majesty the sheriff i appointed to elvileor whatever the miserable place is called no majesty replied guy i am the abbots marshal sheriff de glanville is de glanvilleyes thats the fellow said the king as the memory came back to him came to me begging the use of some soldiers where is he why isnt he here that is what weve come to speak to you about highness said the abbot resuming his tale of woe it pains me to inform you that the realm of elfael is in open rebellion against your rule the rebels have slaughtered most of the men you sent to aid in the protection of your loyal subjects abbot hugo then proceeded to describe a realm under siege and a population captive to chaos and terror he spoke passionately and in some detailso much so that even gysburne felt himself moved to outrage at the accumulated atrocities though the abbots description had parted company with the truth after the first few words if that was not enough concluded hugo the outlaws have seized the throne and taken your sheriff hostage they have eh by the rood ill have their eyes on my belt ill hang the your majesty interrupted cardinal flambard perhaps it would be best if i were to sit down with the abbot here and see what can be done no need flambard retorted the king a blind man can see what needs to be done rebellion must be snuffed out swiftly and mercilessly lest it spreads out of hand these welsh must be taught a lesson ive too long been overlenient with themtoo generous by the blood and theyve used me for a fool sire ventured cardinal flambard gently i do not think this present circumstance is quite as simple as it might seem at first blush i think i remember this outlaw fellow from elfael sire was he not the same who came to you at rouen with word of duke roberts treason he uncovered the plot against youthat was why baron de braose was exiled if you will recall yes what of it well it would seem that the fellow sought restitution of his lands in exchange for his service to your throne abbot hugos expression grew grim he had carefully avoided any mention of the circumstances leading up to the insurrectionlest his own part in the barons conspiracy against william should inadvertently come to light ah yes good hunting land elvile i believe the best sire encouraged hugo what is your point flambard we settled with duke robert and his schemers that is over and done quite so sire offered hugo if i may continued the justiciar undeterred i would suggest that inasmuch as this welshman did not receive the reward he was looking for at the time it would seem that he has taken matters into his own hands i am to blame for this said william is that what youre suggesting i am to blame for this rebellion by no means sire far from it i merely point out that the two matters are related perhaps in light of the present circumstance it would be most expedient simply to allow the welshman to claim the throne i believe he offered to swear fealty to you once if you were to allow him his due this time i have no doubt he could be persuaded to make good his previous offer william the red stared at his chief counsellor in disbelief give him what he wantsis that what you said in a word majesty yes by the bloody rood flambard that i will not do if we were to allow these rogues to murder my troops and then take whatever they want with our blessing the kingdom would soon descend into anarchy no sir not while i sit on the throne of england all such insurrections will be crushed this rogue will be captured and brought to the tower in chains he will be tried for treason against the crown and he will be hung before the city gate that is how we deal with rebels while william sits the throne very wise your majesty intoned the abbot it goes without saying that you shall have my entire supportand that of my marshal william glanced at the abbot and gave a short blast through his nostrils huff turning swiftly on the cardinal he said summon the barons i want them to he stopped did a rapid calculation in his head and then said no send to them and command them to raise their men and attend me at hereford whos that neufmarche highness volunteered the abbot with smug satisfaction at the thought that the baron would be forced to help in the end all are to meet me at hereford castle with their troops we will march on elfael from there and take these rebels i want sufficient force to quash the rebellion in the egg it shouldnt take long he looked to the marshal for agreement a few days sire said gysburne speaking up there are not so many that they cannot be brought to justice in a day or two of fightinga week at most there you see a week and the thing is done the rebels brought to heel and i can go to normandie cardinal flambard pursed his lips doubtfully well demanded the king accusingly youre sulking priest out with it with all respect highness i still believe an embassy to this nobleman outlaw as he may be would achieve the same end with far less costand then there is the bloodshed to think about nonsense snorted william hang the cost and bloodshed the rest of wales will see and understand by this that our sovereign rule will not be violated treason will not be tolerated and that will save blood and silver in days to come you can always invade wales as a last resort my liege suggested cardinal flambard should the embassy fail that is which i doubt but william the red was no longer listening he had turned his back and was striding for the door send to the barons cardinal he called over his shoulder all are to meet me in hereford ready to fight in six days time part five for nine seasons long they lived in the woode he sheriff they vexed and his men the regents reeve bent but did not yet break and rhiban was angered with him i must regayne my land and my rights my people needs all must be free lets go with our bows to the true kings keep and there with our points make our plea i rede that not said merian fayre beloved repent of your haste lets all of us yeomen and women alike go with you to argue your case so soon they are gone up to greate lundein town wives maids and warriors same but when city folk round there them saw they thought that besiegers there came the ploughman he leaves his plough in the fields the smithy has fled from his shop and beggars who only acreeping could go over their crutches did hop the king is informed of the forthmarching host and assembles his armies at speed he swingsto the gates and he marshals his men their progress he means to impede with fryer tuck rhiban approaches the king under the true sign of peace the king gives him entrance for he is full wise and wishes hostility cease god save the king quod rhiban to he and them that wish him full well and he that does his true sovereign deny i wish him with satan to dwell chapter iwan awoke in the hall of the fortress where he had been born raised and grown to manhood as a young warrior he had become champion to brychan ap tewdwr brans fathera hard man fair but uncompromising easily angered and stony as flintand until the arrival of the ffreinc invaders caer cadarn the iron stronghold had been his home god willing it would be again he sat up and looked around at the scores of bodies asleep on the floor around him then rose and quietly made his way to the entrance pushed open the heavy oaken door and stepped out into the quiet dawn of a fresh day he turned his face to the newrisen sun and drew the soft morning air deep into his lungs exhaling slowly from somewhere high above a lark poured out its heart in praise of a glorious day it should be like this always he murmured surveying the yard and surrounding buildings he noted the alterations made to the old fortress during the ffreinc occupation of the last four yearsmostly for the better he had to admit the timber palisade had been shored up all around and weak timbers replaced and strengthened a covered guard station had been erected above the entrance gate the roof of the hall had been replaced with new thatch and given stout new doors there were new storehouses a granary and the kitchen and cookhouse had both been enlarged there were other changes he would notice in the days to come to be sure still it felt like home to him the thought brought a rare smile to his lips he had come home what the day held he could not say but if it was anything like the last it would be busy since the capture of the sheriff and the departure of hugo and his retinue from saint martins cymry had been streaming to the caer bringing provisions and livestock men and women brought their families for protection and to help defend the caer against the retaliation all knew was surely coming for now they were housed mostly in the hall and outbuildings of the fortresswith a few here and there sleeping on the ramparts he washed his face in the big iron basin beside the door and then walked across the deserted yard to an empty storehouse behind the stables outside the small square wooden building he found alan adale sitting slumped against a nearby post his head on his knees god with you alan said iwan nudging the minstrel with his foot alan jolted awake and jumped to his feet oh iwanits you here i must have nodded off for a few winks just then never mind said iwan no harm done has our captive made any trouble quiet as a lamb replied alan he yawned rubbing the sleep from his eyes quieter even maybe he has resigned himself to his fate not likely replied iwan open the door and lets have a look at him alan untied the braided leather rope used to secure the storehouse and pulled open the rough plank door there huddled in his cloak on the beaten dirt floor sat richard de glanville sheriff of elfael chained at the wrists and ankles redeyed from lack of sleep his hair wild on his head as if he had been beating his skull against the walls of his prison he spat and began cursing as soon as he saw who had come to observe him iwan regarded the enraged prisoner for a moment then said you would think a man so eager for the captivity of others would endure his own with a little more dignity what is he saying alan listened to the sheriff s onrushing gush of abuse then said nothing worth hearing suffice it to say that he holds himself illused no doubt iwan agreed then addressed the prisoner if you think yourself mistreated now sheriff try escaping and whole new realms of woe will open before you to alan he added tell him what i said alan did as commanded which loosed another tirade in snarled french from the captive me tuer maintenant ou me relacherje lexigeshouted sheriff de glanville vous les porcs degoutants mentendre je lexige what did he say asked iwan something about pigs aye swine came into it replied alan more to the point he says he wants us to kill him now or set him free if it was left to me replied the champion he would have had his wish long since but our lord bran thinks he may be of some value yet mes regrets mon sherif helas il est impossible said alan to the sheriff who spat by way of reply iwan said ill send someone to relieve your watch very soon but before you go see his water bowl is filled and get him some bread and a little meat if there is any as good as done replied alan and tell our hostage that he is going to be with us for a few more days at least so he must try to endure his captivity with better grace than he has shown till now this was passed along to the prisoner who spat again and turned his face to the wall alan retied the rope securing the door and he and iwan walked across the yard to the hall he is a right rogue that one alan observed as blacksouled a brute as ever strode the earth on two legs what if king william will not bargain for his life oh hell bargain never fear iwan assured him for all his faults de glanville is a ffreinc nobleman and if ive learned anything these last years it is that the noble ffreinc look out for their own william may not like de glanville very muchno blame there god knowsbut he will bargain all we need do is make sure the ransom is not so high that the king will refuse to pay following the eviction of the ffreinc from the cantref bran had swiftly moved to occupy not only the fortress of caer cadarn but the nearby town as well reclaiming them for the cymry to that end he had summoned the venerable bishop asaph to return and take charge of the abbey at saint martins before being forced into exile by abbot hugo the elderly cleric had been the head of llanelli the monastery count falkes de braose had pulled down and rebuilt and around which he had constructed his new town as soon as asaph along with a goodly body of monks was firmly installed and keeping watch over the town and its inhabitantsboth the remaining ffreinc townsfolk and the wounded knights all of whom had been left behind by the abbot and his troopsbran then moved to regain control of the fortress this was swiftly done since the ffreinc had abandoned the stronghold before the last battle they had never worried that king raven would attack it in any case and only ever kept a token occupation in place bran gave the defence of the caer and the valley round about to iwan with siarles and alan to help he sent tomas and rhoddi on fast horses to ride throughout elfael and to settlements in the nearest cantrefs and spread the news that king raven had driven out the ffreinc invaders and taken caer cadarn all who could were to gather weapons and supplies and come occupy the caerfor safety for defence and so that elfaels ancient stronghold would not be abandoned with these measures in place bran had returned to cel craidd and now two days after escorting abbot hugo and marshal gysburne and their few remaining troops to the borders of the march he planned his defence of his realm he had spent the day at the caer working with iwan on the fortifications there returning at sundown and now while the rest of the forest dwellers slept bran sat in council with his closest advisors angharad his wise banfaith friar tuck will scarlet and owain merians absence was a pang felt by them all forgive me rhi bran but i thought owain gave a shrug what is the point of driving out the enemy if we still must skulk around in the greenwood like outlaws we have not seen the last of the ffreinc bran told him iwan and siarles can direct the defence of the caer but we need cel craidd as well how long then owain asked until william the red recognizes my claim bran replied surely that cannot be long in coming owain said the king must recognize your kingship now weve defeated his lackeys nothing of the kind lad scarlet told him weve bloodied their noses a bit is all theyll come back in force added tuck you can bet your last hapenny on that two days of jubilation following the ffreinc defeat had given way to more sober reflection it was tuck thought as if the farm dog that chased every passing wagon had against every sane expectation finally caught one now the forest dwellers were faced with the awful realization that there would be reprisals and they were woefully outmanned how could they hope to protect their gains that was the question in the forefront of their minds and it leached the joy from their hearts the point is bran continued we will never be secure in elfael until we have king williams seal on a treaty of peace and protection i do not expect red william to grant that without a fightwhich is why were still skulking around in the greenwood like outlaws he broke another stick and tossed the ends into the fire then declared the council at an end scarlet rose and shuffled off to join noin and nia in their hut owain whose wound though still painful was healing quickly went to his rest tuck and angharad were left to sit with bran a little while longer you are right to prepare for war of course tuck began did you think we would gain elfael without one but perhaps king williams appetite for this war is no match for your own the friar ventured watching the firelight and shadows flicker over brans sharp features perhaps even now he is searching for a way to avoid a fight perhaps bran allowed what are you suggesting we might send an emissary to the king with an offer of peace bran regarded the little priest thoughtfully peace that is tuck clarified in exchange for fealty if william recognizes my throne i agree to swear fealtyand the war is over over before it has begun bran looked to angharad sitting quietly beside the fire on her threelegged stool what do you see he asked the friar is right to suggest an offer of peace observed angharad it is close to gods heart always she rose stiffly and pulled the edges of her bird spirit cloak closed but unless god moves in the red kings heart peace we will not have the old woman made a little stirring motion with her hands in the smoke from the fire then lifted her palms upward as if raising the fragrance towards the nightdark sky above tilting her face heavenward her small dark eyes lost in the creases of her wrinkled face she stood very still for a long moment bran and tuck found themselves holding their breath in anticipation at last she sighed what do you see mother asked bran gently his voice barely audible above the crackle of the flames i see she began drawing a deep breath and letting it out slowly as she searched the tangled pathways of the future i see a trail of blood that leads from this place and spreads throughout the land where it ends god knows she opened her eyes and her face crinkled in a sad smile what we sow here will be reaped not by our children but by our childrens childrenor those who after them come but sow we must another course we have not yet there is hope asked the friar there is always hope aethelfrith replied the old woman in hope we do abide as children of the swift sure hand hope is our true home you a priest must understand this tuck smiled at the gentle rebuke i bow to your teaching banfaith and you are right of course i used to know a bishop who said much the same thing hope is the treasure of our souls he would say it is an end worth fighting for mused bran it may be for others to complete what weve begun but there must be a beginning and we will carry this fight as far as we can before passing it on to those who come after the three of them sat in silence watching the flames and listening to the crack and hiss of the wood as it burned from somewhere in the forest an owl called to its mate it was a sound tuck had heard countless times since throwing in his lot with the forest folk but tonight it filled him with an almost unbearable sadness he rose from his place and bade the other two a good night god rest you right well friends and grant you his peace tuck said bran as the friar stepped from the hearth the ffreinc are grasping devious devilsfalsehearted as the sea is wide even so i am willing to swear fealty to red william if it means we can draw a living breath without their foot on our neck if you can find a way to speak peace to william i stand ready to do my part i want you to know that that night the friar did not sleep though cool and damp the sky was clear and ablaze with stars he found a place among the roots of one of the giant oaks and settled down in the dry bracken to pray for elfael and its people and all those who would not be able to avoid the war that was coming he was praying still when the watchers rose silently saddled their horses and departed cel craidd to take up their posts on the kings road chapter hereford spare me the excuses marshal said king william cutting off the lengthy beggings of pardon as read out by guy of gysburne following his eviction from elfael his fortunes had risen beyond anything he might have dared to hope owing to his intimate knowledge of the cymry and the lands beyond the march the young marshal had become an aidedecamp to william rufus for the purpose of what the king now referred to as the harrowing of wales tell it to me plainwho has come gysburne allowed his gaze to drop down the parchment roll prepared for him by the court scribes in attendance besides huntingdon buckingham and surrey who marched out with you there is belleme of shrewsbury and de reviers of devon salisbury arrived a short while ago he read on fitzrobert of cornwall has sent word ahead and should arrive before nightfall earl hugh of chesteraccompanied by rhuddlanwill join us tomorrow or the day after le noir of richmond is on the road he begs pardon but the distance is too great and the time too short yes yes interrupted the king irritably go on there is de mowbray of northumberland who also sends regrets and apologies albeit he is en route and will join you as soon as travel permits guy looked up from the roll as for the rest we must presume they are either on their way or sending petitions of pardon the king nodded there is one notable absence sire neufmarche of course this is his castle by the bloody rood he should be here to receive us where is he i have spoken to his seneschal sire who will say only that the baron is away visiting his lands in wales the summons was sent on but it is not at all certain that it reached him since the messenger has not yet returned i swear upon my fathers grave if neufmarche does not appear in two days time it would be better for him not to appear at all sire the baron is a devious twofaced schemer marshal i snubbed him once to put him in his placesummoned him to attend me and then kept him wearing out the waiting bench for three days and this is how he repays the insult he should have learned humility so one would think majesty william began pacing his short bowed legs making quick steps from one side of the chamber to the other on the martyrs blood i will not have it mark me gysburne the king will not have it i will make an example of this vexsome baron for once and all god help me i will if neufmarche does not appear with his men by the time we leave this place he is banished and his estates in england fall forfeit to the crown i vow it gysburne nodded clearly there was some deeper grievance between the two that had caused this rift between the baron and his sovereign lord whatever it was neufmarche was now in very grave danger of losing everything how far away is mowbray asked william returning to the business at hand guy glanced once more to the parchment roll in his hand the messenger indicated that unless he encounters some difficulty mowbray will reach the march in three days time it will be the same with richmond i would expectthree or four days the incursion will be over by then fumed the king he spun on his heel and started pacing again from what you have said the welsh have few horses no knights and only a handful of archers gysburne nodded well then two days decided william one day of fighting and one to sluice down the abattoir floor as it were two days at most that is greatly to be hoped sire answered gysburne all the while thinking that it was manifestly imprudent to underestimate the amount of havoc that could be wreaked by a single welsh bowman no one knew that better than did guy himself but he kept his mouth shut before the king ha said william i hope neufmarche misses the battle entirely then i can banish him for good and sell all this he looked around at the interior of the chamber as if considering how much it might bring in the marketplace how many men do we have now with the arrival of salisburys sixtyeight we have three hundred ten knights and five hundred forty menatarms at present all are encamped in the fields outside the town anticipating the kings next question guy added counting those en route should almost double that number i believe that friend marshal is counting eggs not chickens cautioned a voice from the doorway both men turned to see a haggard young man in boots and gauntlets his green cloak and long dark hair grey with dust the fellow took one step into the room and went down on one knee forgive my tardiness sire he said i was on my way to londein when i received your summons but came as soon as i could assemble my men all is forgiven now youre here said the king smiling for the first time that day rise leicester and lets have a look at you the king crossed to the young lord and clapped him in a warm embrace heaven bless you robert i am right glad to see you it has been too long the king called over his shoulder to marshal guy you can go now gysburne but bring me word if anyone else should arrive this evening taking the earl of leicester by the arm he steered the young man to a nearby table and drew out a chair what news from your brother i had word this morning sire henry is well and has raised two hundred he hopes to join us tomorrow two hundred splendid here have some wine you must be parched said the king he picked up the jar but the younger man took it from him allow me majesty he said pouring out the wine he handed the cup to his king it would not do for anyone to think that the king served a lowly earl by his own hand hang what they think said william recklessly he took the cup and raised it let us drink to a swift campaign he said and successful said the earl swift and successful echoed the king this time next week we shall be on our way to france to be sure affirmed leicester lightly god willing the almighty has nothing to do with it declared william his nose in his cup he swallowed down a bolt then said this uprising will be crushed in the egg we need not invoke heavens help to apprehend a few scofflaw rogues and rebels why this agonie i do not see that you have any choice mon cher said lady agnes neufmarche you must go you must attend the king i know i know snapped the baron but this king will be the ruin of us all he is an idiot what is more he is an idiot with a stick and a hornets nest perhaps it will not be as bad as you fear counselled his wife and if you were there mon cour you could see that our interests were well defended bernard was not listening he has no idea of the hell he is about to loose on the land no idea at all you could warn him suggested agnes too late for that the baron replied i know william hes just like his father once he has his sword drawn he will not see reasononly blood the baron shook his head gravely there will be plenty of blood on both sides all the more reason to go and see what can be done to prevent it bernard shook his head again and looked at the scrap of parchment on the table he had received many royal summonses over the years and had always respondedto do anything else invited royal wrath at the very least or at worst banishment or hanging there was no way around it this summons had come at a most inopportune time just when the baron was winning over the devotion of his welsh vassals and preparing to expand his interests in the region the king declared war neufmarche stood to lose years of patient work and hardwon goodwill to the unthinking ire of a flighty king who would tramp around the hills and valleys for a few days and then beetle off back to londein or normandie as the whim took him pretending he had not received the kings summons had bought him enough time to assemble his men and flee hereford before the king arrived not the wisest course he would be the first to agree but in his mind the only one open to him just now there is something else agnes said her tone made him abandon his ruminations on the problems posed by the kings untimely summons he glanced at his wife to see the pucker of concern between her brows and that is merian she said simply merian he repeated his heart quickened at the name but he stifled any sign of recognition what of her she is here said the baroness aliveyou mean yes alive and welland here in this castle she returned a few weeks agoescaped from her captors it seems although she does not admit to being held so she merian here said the baron as if trying to understand a complex calculation oh yes said agnes and the curious thing about it is that garran has locked her in her chamberfor her own safety of course given the chance there is no doubt she would run straight back to the brigands who took her captive in the first place how extraordinary mused the baron you should know husband continued agnes that she has been saying some very disturbing things about you about me yes mon cher about you it seems that through her ordeal she has come to believe that you tried to kill her and this is why she fled her home and family for the forest mon dieu breathed bernard recalling his bungled attack on bran that day his heart beat faster still she thinks i tried to kill her has the poor girl lost all reason then oh no his wife assured him quickly she seems as sane as anyone but she does cling to this absurd beliefperhaps it was a way for her to keep her sanity while captive i only tell you about this so that when you see her you will not be taken by surprise at anything she says i see yes bernard nodded thoughtfully considering the implications of what he had just been told i will speak to her of course but not just yet i think perhaps when i have decided what to do about the kings summons well do see her before you leave advised the baroness if we were able to make her understand just how ridiculous is this notion of hers then perhaps she might be trusted to obey and we could release her lady agnes smiled it is a very cruelty to keep her captive in her own home after the torment she has endured wouldnt you agree oh indeed replied the baron his mind racing to how this meeting might be put off he was not of a mood to deal with angry contrary and likely vengeful women just now and perhaps not for a very long time a very cruelty as you say chapter theyre coming at the shout tuck sat up and rubbed his face he had been trimming the end of his staff and had fallen asleep in the warm sunlight now he rose and taking up the sturdy length of ashwood gave it a swing once around his head offering a grunt of satisfaction at the comforting heft of the simple weapon he then turned around in time to see the messenger slide down the grassy bank and into the bowl of cel craidd it was prebyn the son of one of the farmers whose house and barn had been burned by the ffreinc when they ransacked their settlement a few days before theyre coming the ffreinc are coming bran and tuck hurried to meet the young man my lord rhi bran rhi bran theyre coming announced prebyn red faced and breathless from his run the ffreinc king william theyre on the road theyll be here any moment he gulped air theres thousands of them thousands steady on prebyn said bran draw breath he put his hand on the farmers broad back calm yourself the young man bent over and rested his hands on his knees blowing air through his mouth when he was able to speak again bran said now then tell me what did rhoddi say my lord rhi bran he said i was to tell you that red williams soldiers have been sighted on the road at the bottom of the long ridgewhere the stream crosses i know the place bran said rhoddi has given us fair warning we have a little time yet he sent the youth away with instructions to get something to drink saddle a horse and hurry back for new orders well my friend were in it now he said when the messenger had gone ill send prebyn to the caer to alert iwan and siarles god have mercy breathed tuck bran turned and called out across cel craidd scarlet owain to me tomasmy weapons to me lads the ffreinc have been sighted this call roused the sleepy settlement and soon the few remaining inhabitants were running here and there to help the warriors on their way out from a nearby dwelling angharad emerged bran hurried to meet her it begins he said so it does she unfolded a bit of soft leather and handed bran three coiled bowstrings god with you rhi bran she said these i made especially for this day her face froze then and she drew a breath as if to speak but thought better of it i thank you wise banfaith he replied placing the bowstrings in a pouch at his belt was there something else you wanted to say the old woman stared at him her dark eyes peering as through a mist bran could sense her struggling to find the words to reach him in some way finally she relaxed her face softened and she smiled her wrinkled face smoothing somewhat in simple pleasure all that needs saying have i said reaching out she covered his hands with hers and gripped them tight now it is for us to remember then we will do the work of remembering replied bran the old woman lifted her hand to his face then rising on tiptoes she brushed his cheek with her dry lips i am proud of you my king do remember that prebyn returned then and received orders to tell iwan and those in the valley fortress that the kings army was on its way come back as soon as youve delivered your message bran told him there may be ffreinc outriders around and you do not want to be caught then turning to the rest of the grellon he said you all know what to do there were murmurs of assent all around and some voices called out encouragements which the king acknowledged then addressing angharad one last time he said pray for us all of you and let your prayers strengthen our courage and sharpen our aim i will uphold you in battle with psalms and prayers and songs of power as befits a bard of britain angharad said raising her staff she held it crosswise in her hands and lifted it high kneel before the high king of heaven she instructed bran knelt before his wise banfaith to receive her blessing fear nothing o king she said placing one withered hand on his head the almighty and his angelic battlehost go before you fight well and behold the glory of the lord bran thanked his bard and commended his people to her care tomas passed him his longbow and scarlet handed him a sheaf of arrows which he tied to his belt come friends lets be about the days business shouldering a thick bundle of arrows each from their sizeable stockpile of begged bought and grellonmade shafts they climbed the rim of cel craidds encircling rampart and started off along one of the many pathways leading into the forest bran had taken but half a dozen steps when he heard a heavy tread on the trail behind him what are you doing tuck i thought we agreed you would stay here and help angharad i seem to recall that we discussed something of the sort yes allowed the friar but agreed no i think not tuck you leave your flock in safe hands my lord angharad needs no help from me and i will be more aid to you on the battle line the priest patted the satchel at his side i am bringing cloths and such for wounds i can serve you better at the sharp end can i not come then bran said shifting the bundle of arrows on his hip it would not do to keep king william waiting they marched at a steady pace moving silently as shadows through the thickgrown trees and heavy undergrowth of bracken and tangled ivy vines and bramble canes guided by an intimate knowledge of the greenwoods myriad trackwaysmany of which would be invisible to anyone who had not spent years in the wild woodlands of the march they changed direction often abandoning one trail for another always working south however towards the kings road do you think william rufus himself has come asked tuck perhaps allowed scarlet a few paces behind him where you find kings men you sometimes find a king leading them red william is said to like a fight it would be good if he has come tuck observed then when we sue for peace he will be ready to hand sue for peace said bran i have no intention of suing for peace i was not thinking of you my lord replied the friar i was thinking of the ffreinc after a few days i would not be surprised if we see a flag of truce from williams camp a few days wondered bran tuck bless you we have but ten men if we make it to the end of this day with body and soul knit together i will count it a triumph oh ye of little faith the priest scoffed and on they went the land rose steadily beneath to form the long slope of the ridge that was the southern border of elfael at the place where the old road crested the ridgedropping low as it passed between two steep banks of stone like a river flowing through a gorgebran had chosen to engage the enemy they dropped their bundles at the foot of a high rock stack shielding them from view of the road below while scarlet and the others took a moments rest tuck and bran climbed the stack on a flat rock jutting out above the road they found rhoddi lying on his stomach and gazing down the long southern slope towards the foot of the ridge thank god said the warrior squirming upright as bran crawled up on hands and knees to join him here i was thinking prebyn had lost his way where are they asked bran squatting beside rhoddi just there he pointed down the slope towards a stand of oaks that grew beside the deeprutted road they seem to have stopped theyve been there for a while but they should come in sight any time now tuck scrambled up at last and lying on his belly turned his eyes to the dark stretch of road far down the slope where the intertwining limbs still overhung the deepsunk path the grellon had cleared the trees for a dozen yards on either side of the defile to give themselves a clear and unobstructed view from above how many do you think there are asked the friar i dont know replied rhoddi a fair few i reckon bran returned to where the others were waiting scarlet you and tomas will command the other side llwyd and beli he said referring to the two newcomers both farmers sons who had been added to their number following the abbots disastrous raid go with scarlet hell show you what to do youd better hurry we dont want the ffreinc to see you the four left on the run and bran and owain took up an armful of bundled arrows and scrambled back up to the lookout post i see them said tuck pointing down the long incline that spot of red there its moving its one of the scouts rhoddi told him they advance and fall back theyre plenty wary they know we will attack said bran trying to tempt us into showing ourselves brave men tuck murmured to himself brave fools amended owain is this the main body asked bran i made it three divisions rhoddi replied and explained how he had worked his way down to the bottom of the ridge to see what could be learned of the kings army from that vantage most are mounted but there are a number on foot as well and those i saw appeared but lightly armed they know they will not be facing knights on horseback surmised bran so they need not overburden themselves or their animals tuck backed slowly down the rocks and into a little sunny patch nearby hitching up his robe he knelt in the long grass and crossing his hands over his chest he lifted his face to the clear blue sky above and began to pray saying commander of the heavenly host you are no stranger to war and fighting i know youd rather have peace and id have it too if it was left to me but you know that sometimes that ent possible and if peace was in williams mind i dont reckon hed be marching against us now so im asking you to think back to your man moses and how you supported him in all his wrangles with the pharaohwhoknewnotjoseph great of might im asking you to support bran and his men todayand like you did with the hebrew slaves when pharaoh chased them out of egypt im asking you to drown the armies of the enemy in their own bloodlust last but not least im asking you to ease the suffering of the wounded and above all to treat kindly the souls of those who will be coming to stand before you in a little while grant them eternal rest in your wide kingdom for the sake of your most merciful son our lord jesus tuck was roused from his prayers by the sound of a trumpetsmall but bright as a needle point in the quiet forest amen so be it he whispered and crossing himself he picked up his staff and hauled himself back up the rocks to where bran owain and rhoddi were waiting the trumpet sounded again a single long unwavering note what is the meaning of that wondered owain vanity maybe they think to frighten us suggested tuck take more than a pip on the horn to send a shiver up my spine said rhoddi he nocked an arrow to the string but bran put a hand on his arm and pulled it down theyre still trying to get us to show ourselves so they can mark our positions said bran perhaps get some idea how large a force they will face if they only knew how few he let the rest of the thought go the trumpet called once more and this time the trumpeter himself rode into view behind him came two knights bearing banners a blue square with three long tails of green and a cross of gold in the centre surrounded by small green crosslets behind them could be seen the first ranks of knights some of these also carried banners of red and blue some with yellow lions some with crosses of white and red owain said bran find yourself a good position somewhere just therehe pointed a little farther along the rock walland be ready to loose on my signal as the young warrior departed bran turned to the friar tuck he said placing a bundle of arrows upright at his feet i want you to see that we do not run out of arrows in this first skirmish keep us supplied and let us know how many we have left if supplies run low good as done said tuck he scuttled back down the rocks and arranged the bundles in stacks of three which he then hauled up to a place just below the archers to keep them within easy reach by the time he rejoined rhoddi and bran the ffreinc were much closer tuck could make out individual faces beneath the round helmets of the knights they rode boldly on scanning the rocks for the first sign of attack some were sweating beneath their heavy mail the water glistening in the sunlight as it dripped down their necks and into their padded leather tunics both bran and rhoddi had arrows nocked and ready well wait until they come directly below us bran was saying the first to fall will even as he was speaking there came the whining shriek of an arrow followed by the hard slap of an iron head striking home in the same instant one of the knights was thrown so far back in the saddle he toppled over the rump of his horse no muttered bran between clenched teeth not yet who did that he demanded looking around furiously rhoddi tuckdid you see who did that there said tuck it came from up there he pointed to a place where the road crested the ridge and there four men could be seen kneeling in the middle of the road the ffreinc knights saw them too and those in the fore rank lowered their spears put spurs to their horses and charged take them cried bran and before the words had left his mouth two arrows were streaking towards the attacking knights the missiles struck sharp and fast dropping the foemen as they passed beneath the rocky outcrop two more knights appeared and joined the first two in the dust of the kings road the archers on the road seemed unconcerned by the commotion their appearance had caused they calmly loosed arrow after arrow into the body of knights now halted in the road still some distance away from the place bran had set for the ambush tuck said bran furious that his plan had been spoiledso needlessly and so early get down there and stop them hurry while bran and rhoddi worked to keep the knights pinned down tuck scrambled back into the forest and tearing through the undergrowth and bracken made for the top of the ridge where the unknown archers had placed themselves hold he shouted tumbling into the road put up friar tuck tuck recognized the voice brocmael god love you man get out of here we saw some ffreinc down there and thought to put the fear of god into them friar theres a battle on the friar told him he glanced at the young mans companions follow me before the whole ffreinc army falls on your foolish heads greetings bishop balthus said the man nearest him ifor bless your unthinking head thats king william the reds army youve attacked and theyll be on us like bees on honeycomb by the time the newcomers reached the rocks bran and rhoddi were slinging arrows down into the road as fast as they could draw shouts and screams of men and horses crashing and thrashing echoed along the rock walls of the defile already the bodies were thick on the ground brocmael and his companions took one look at the chaos below and joined in cenau brocmael said bran as the young man came to stand beside him as good as it is to see you i could have wished youd held your water a little while longer forgive me my lord i did not know you were lurking hereabouts have we spoiled the hunt for you a little bran admitted sending feathered death into the churning mass of soldiers below would you have taken on the kings army by yourself i thought it was just a few knights out for a jaunt in the forest he paused to consider is it really the kings army then the king and his many minions yes put in tuck along with a right handsome multitude of knights and menatarms so they wont be lonely another sheaf tuck called bran loosing the last arrow from his bag tuck hurried to the pile and taking a bundle under each arm climbed up to the archers he opened one bundle for bran and placed one nearby for rhoddi then took two more to owain across the road the arrows streaked through the sunbright air as scarlet and tomas and their two farm lads loosed and loosed again in deadly rhythm many of the knights had quit their saddles and were trying to scale the rocks weighed down by their heavy mail coats they moved slowly and were not difficult to pick off but more and more soldiers were streaming up the hill to the fight how many are with you bran asked the young lord drawing and loosing in the same breath besides iforonly geronwy and idris answered brocmael good bowmen both i would like to have brought more but we had to sneak away as it was i expect bran began drawing and loosing again the arrow sang from his bow into the heaving chaos below that your uncle will not be best pleased then he must accustom himself to displeasure replied the young nobleman it is the right and honourable thing to do and now gentlemen all said rhoddi picking up his bundle of arrows the right and honourable thing for us to do is to leg it into the greenwood he started away and tuck risked a look down into the chasm the dustdry road where it could be seen was taking on a ruddy hue and was now made impassable by the corpses of men and horses piled upon one another the knights and soldiers coming up from the rear were scaling the rocks in a courageous effort to get at the archers above even as he looked over the cliff a spear glanced off a nearby rock throwing sparks and chips of stone into the air before sliding back down into the road duly warned tuck scuttled back from the edge bran gave out a loud shrieking whistle and waved with his bow to scarlet and the others on the high bank across the road in a signal to abandon the attack and then they were running for their lives into the deepshadowed safety of the greenwood chapter amad scramble through the forest brought them to a tiny clearing where bran and his men paused to regroup we had the devils trapped and trussed brocmael said breathing hard from his run we could have defeated them there are too many rhoddi countered we dare not stay in one place very long or theyll surround us and drag us under like crossing a mud flat said tuck hands on knees his lungs burning the longer you stand the deeper you sink he shook his head ah bless me i am too old and fat for this will they come in after us do you think wondered geronwy leaning on his longbow oh aye answered rhoddi count on it there was a clatter in the wood behind them just then and scarlet followed by llwyd and beli tumbled into the clearing the two farm lads were looking holloweyed and a little green clearly for all their skill with the bow they had never killed beforeat least thought tuck not living men while bran and the others exchanged battle reports tuck undertook to gentle the skittish newcomers putting a hand on each of their shoulders he said defending your people against the cruel invader is a good and laudable thing my friends this is not a war of your making god knowsdoes he not the two glanced at one another and one of them llwyd found his voice we never killed before not like that added beli if there is sin in it tuck told them then there is also grace enough to cover it you have done well this day see you remember your countrymen whose lives depend on you and let your souls be at peace overhearing this bran turned to address the newest members of his tiny war band to me everyone he said believe me when i say that i wish no one had to learn this cruel craft within the borders of my realm but the world is not of our choosing we have many battles to fight before this war is through and your lives may be required long since he spoke softly but in grim earnest you are men now warriors and part of my grellon so grasp your courage and bind it to your hearts with bands of steel his twisted smile flashed with sudden warmth and i will pray with every shaft i loose that all will yet be well and you will live to see elfael at peace my lord said llwyd bending his head beli went one better and bent the knee as well your servant he said then bran addressed those who had come with brocmael greetings friends and if youve come to stay then welcome but if now that youve had a taste of this fight and find it bitter in your mouth then i bid you farewell and god go with you we came to help you fight the ffreinc my lord said brocmael as you know me know my cousins this is geronwy he put out a hand to a slender sandyhaired youth holding a fine bow of polished red rowan my lord rhi bran said geronwy we have heard how you bested earl hugh and would pledge our aid to such a king as could humble that mangy old badger in his den the other not waiting to be presented spoke up saying i am idris and i am glad to lend my bow to your cause my lord it seems to me that either we fight the ffreinc with you here and nowor we will fight them by ourselves later a stocky lad with a thick tightknit frame he seemed roughcarved of the same yew as the sturdy bow in his hand scarlet listening to the sounds echoing up from the road and forest behind them called we must fly if we are to stay ahead of the chase this way our horses are back there brocmael jerked a thumb in the direction of the road leave them bran said hurrying after scarlet horses are a hindrance in the forest anyway it isnt far the archers started away again disappearing into the closegrown trees and bramble and hawthorn undergrowth it soon became clear that bran was leading them along a stony trail up the long slope of the ridge where in no more than a few hundred paces the path suddenly erupted in outsized stones and boulders big as houses all tumbled together to form a sizeable cairna natural fortress of stone in the gaps and crevices between the rocks grew holly and briar into which had been driven stakes of ash whose ends were sharpened to narrow spear points find a place to hide and wait for my signal called bran disappearing into a holly hedge at the base of the cairn up we go lads called scarlet get snugged in good there are arrow sheaves in the hideyholes keep em close to hand brocmael glanced at his cousins gave a shrug and followed the others up into the storied heap of rocks they picked their way carefully among the thorns and stakes to find that in amongst the spaces between rocks small wooden platforms had been prepared where the archers could stand the warriors found bundles of arrows tied to the timber supports and stuffed into crevices within easy reach i told you rhi bran was cunning clever brocmael declared to his kinsmen and here is the proof did we ever doubt you said idris shh hissed scarlet taking his place on a nearby stand sharp and quiet lads theyll likely try to come by stealth so be ready for the signal what is the signal wondered brocmael aloud youll know it when you hear it answered scarlet for youve never heard the like in your whole sweet life entire and when you hear it said tuck squirming up onto one of the lower platforms be sure you take no fright for it is only our bran distracting our foemen from the task at hand if theyre about thinking they can run us to ground added rhoddi theyll soon be thinking twice about chasing blind through the phantoms wood the phantom said geronwy rhi bran y hudis that who you mean one and the same replied scarlet youve heard of him everyone has heard of him answered the young warrior are you saying he is real brace yourself boyo said tuck youre about to see for yourself fitting arrows to strings the cymry settled down to wait the sounds of the chase grew louder as the ffreinc drew nearer until with a thrashing of branches and bushes the first wave of armourclad foot soldiers reached the base of the rock wall there they paused to determine which way to go and in that briefest of hesitations were doomed for as they stood looking at the boulders in their path there arose a thin bloodless crylike that of the wind when it moans in the high tree branches but no kindly breeze lifted the leaves the soldiers glanced around furiously trying to discover the source of the sound the cry became a shriek gathering strength filling the surrounding woodland with a call at once unnatural and unnerving full of all the mystery of the greenwoodas if the forest itself had taken voice to shout its outrage at the presence of the ffreinc they were still looking for the source of this fearsome cry when there appeared near the top of the wall of stones a strange dark shape that in the green halflight of the forest seemed far more shadow than substance a great birdshaped creature with the body of a man and the wings of a raven with a naked round skulllike head and a long wickedly sharp beak this phantom moved with uncanny grace among the rocks pausing now and again to utter its scream as a challenge to the wary halffrightened soldiers on the ground one of the knights took up the challenge and rearing back loosed his spear lofting it with a mighty heave up at the strange creature sliding among the rocks the bravely launched spear struck the smooth face of a boulder and the iron tip sparked at the same moment a black arrow sang out from the dark recess of the stones struck the knight and with a sound like the crack of a whip threw him onto his back dead before his body came to rest in the bracken it took a moment for the rest of the knights to realize what had happened and by then it was too late three more arrows sped to their marks with lethal accuracy dropping the enemy in their tracks the phantom of the greenwood gave out a last triumphant scream and disappeared once more as the arrows began to fly thick and fast filling the air with their hateful hiss the ffreinc fell back and back again stumbling over one another over themselves over the corpses of the dead to escape the feathered death assailing them from the rocks those still coming up from behind choked off the escape holding their unlucky comrades in place thus sealing their fate and then it was over the last soldier an arrow in his thigh pulled himself into the undergrowth and all that could be heard was the clatter of the ffreinc knights in fulltilt retreat and then only the distant croak of gathering crows and the soft whimpering moans of the dying chapter coed cadw the war between bran ap brychan and king william for the throne of elfael continued as it beganwith short sharp skirmishes in which the grellon unleashed a whirlwind of stinging death before disappearing into the deepshadowed wood these small battles were fought down in the leafy trenches of greenwood trails down amongst roots and boles of closegrown trees and the thicktangled undergrowth where ffreinc warhorses could not go and swords were difficult to swing the welsh rebels struck fast and silently sometimes it seemed to the beleaguered knights that the cymry materialized out of the redolent forest air the first warning they had was the fizzing whine of an arrow and the crack of the shaft striking leather and breaking bone and although there was never any telling when or where the dreaded attack would come the result was always the same arrowpierced dead and wounded norman soldiers lurching dazed along the narrow trackways of the greenwood after a few disastrous running battles the ffreinc knights whose fighting lives were spent on horseback quickly lost all interest in facing king raven and his men in the dense forest and on foot in this coed cadw lived up to its namethe guardian woodproviding the rebels with an immense and allbut impenetrable defensive bulwark against an enemy whose numbers far exceeded their own many times over without the use of their horses and forced to traverse unknown and difficult terrain the knights supreme effectiveness as a weapon of war became nothing more than a blunt and broken stub of a blade they might thrash and hack along the borders of the wood but could do little real damage and the elusive king raven remained beyond their reach still the king of england was determined to bring this rebel welsh cantref to heel he insisted that his commanders pursue the fight wherever they could even so rather than send yet more men to certain death in the forest they made endless sorties along the road and told themselves that at least they controlled the supply route and enforced the peace for travellers king raven was more than happy to grant william the rule of the road since it allowed his archers time to rest and the grellon to make more arrows and increase their stockpile as it became clear that there would be no easy victory over king raven in the forest king william moved to take the vale of elfael the ffreinc army set up encampment in the valley between the forest and saint martins laying siege to the welsh fortress at caer cadarn william invaded the town of saint martins with a force of five hundred knights and menat arms with himself in the lead there was no resistance the invaders discovering only monks theremost of them french under the authority of an ageing bishop asaph and a few wounded soldiers and frightened townsfolk with little enough food to supply those already there simply declared the town conquered and effectively reclaimed for the kings domains caer cadarn was not so easily defeated the occupying ffreinc troops quickly learned that they could not approach nearer than three hundred paces of the timber walls without suffering a hail of killing arrows but as the old fortress itself seemed to offer no aid or support to king raven and the rebels in the wood william decided to leave it alone and trust to a rigorous siege to bring the stronghold into submission day gave way to day and sensing a cold wet winter on the near horizon with no advancement in his fortunes and the time for his departure for france looming ever closer the king decided to force the issue he called his commanders to him our time grows short autumn is at an end and winter is soon upon uswilliam announced standing in the centre of his round tent with his earls and barons ranged around him he looked like a bear at a baiting surrounded by wolves with extravagant appetites we must leave for normandie within the fortnight or forfeit our tribute and we will have this rebellion crushed before we go hands on hips he glared at the grim faces of his battle chiefs daring them to disagree well we will have your council my lords and that quick one of the barons stepped forward my lord and king he said may i speak boldly speak any way you wish lord belleme replied william a thickskinned warhorse himself he was not squeamish about any criticisms his vassals or subjects might make we do solicit your forthright opinion with all respect majesty began belleme it does seem we have allowed these rebels to run roughshod over our troops the earl of shrewsbury could be counted on to point out the obvious what is needed here is a show of strength to bring the welsh to their knees he made a half turn to appeal to his brother noblemen the savage welshman respects only blunt force and yours would be blunter than most remarked a voice from the rear of the tent mock me if you will sniffed belleme but i speak as one who has some experience with these welsh brigands a show of forcethat will turn the tide in our favour perhaps suggested earl de reviers of devon stepping forward you might tell us how this might be accomplished when the enemy will not engage they strike out of the mists and disappear again just as swiftly my men half believe the local superstition that the forest is haunted by this king raven and we fight ghosts bah barked earl shrewsbury your men are a bunch of old women to believe such tales and yet replied devon how is this show of strength to be performed against an enemy who is not there he offered the craggy shrewsbury a thin half smile no doubt this is something your vast experience has taught you shrewsbury gave a muttered growl and stepped back the rebels refuse to stand and fight put in le noir of richmond that is a fact until we can draw them out into the open we will continue to fail and our superior numbers will count for nothing to be sure agreed the king and meanwhile our superior numbers are eating through all our supplies were already running out of meat and grain more will have to be brought in and that takes time time we do not have to sparewilliams voice had been rising as he began to vent his rage my lords we want this ended now we want to see that rebels head on a pike tomorrow your majesty ventured another of the kings notables i would speak william recognized his old friend the earl of cestre lord hugh he said if you see a way out of this dilemma we welcome your wisdom hardly wisdom sire answered hugh more an observation when facing a particularly cunning stag you must sometimes divide your party in order to come at the beast from unexpected quarters meaning inquired william who was in no mood for hunting lessons only this my lord that unless these rebels are truly spirits they cannot be in two places at once sending a single large force into the wood is no useas we have seen so send three four five or more smaller ones come at them from every direction hes right affirmed lord rhuddlan they cannot defend all sides at once we can cut them down before they can escape again we never know where they are complained another lord how can we muster troops on the flanks and rear if we cannot tell where they will attack we must create a lure to draw them into battle suggested earl hugh and when the bastards take the bait were ready to sally in from the rear and flanks and slice them up a treat there was more discussion then about how this might be best accomplished but the plan was generally accepted and agreed the kings army would adopt a new tactic they would abandon their normal course of moving into the forest in a single large force and would instead advance in smaller groups towards a single destination using a body on horseback as a lure to draw the rebels into a fight whereupon the individual parties would rally to the fight and sweeping in from the flanks quickly surround them cutting off any escape the king satisfied that this plan offered a better way forward gave his blessing to the scheme and ordered all to be made ready for it to be implemented the following morning then in a far better mood than he had enjoyed since his arrival in elfael he ordered a good supper for himself and earl hugh and a few others to celebrate their impending victory at dawn the next day six separate hunting parties rode out with a seventh larger body of knights and menatarms to serve as the lure to draw the rebels into the trap upon reaching the forests edge they dismounted and proceeded on foot the six smaller bodies fanned out around the main group and proceeded with all stealth it was slow and arduous work hacking through the vines and branches searching out pathways and game trails through the dense woodland but just after midday their determination was rewarded when the main body of knights encountered the welsh rebels they had been stalking through a rocklined rill following the stream when suddenly the canopy of branches seemed to open and begin raining arrows down upon them the soldiers took shelter where they could pressing themselves against the rocks and stones all the while sounding blast after blast on the trumpets some of them were carrying the attack continued much as previous assaults but faltered when there arose a great shout and a second body of ffreinc knights entered the battle from behind the rebel position this was quickly followed by the appearance of a third body of knights that drew in from the left flank and mounted a fierce resistance to the killing shafts the battle lasted only moments and ended as abruptly as it had begun there was a rustling in the branches overheadas if a flock of nesting rooks had just taken flightand the arrows stopped as the kings men reassembled to gather up their wounded and reckon their losses they found a longbow lying among the rocks in the streambedone of the rebels weapons what is more it had blood on it and there was no ffreinc body in sight after the ruinous ventures of the previous encounters this was deemed a triumph it shrank in significance however when the victorious troops returned to their camp in the vale of elfael to learn that the other three search parties had become lost in the forest and unable to join the battle as planned in their confusion they had stumbled upon a hidden settlementa cluster of crude huts and hovels made of sticks and skin around a great oak tree and a stonelined well together with a few storehouses and a pitiful field caught unawares the inhabitants scattered but the knights did manage to kill one of them as they fledan old woman who seemed to be in some way guarding the place with only a wooden staff chapter tuck half carried half dragged the wounded tomas through the wood pausing now and then to rest and listen for sounds of pursuit he heard only the nattering of squirrels and birds and the rapid beating of his own heart the spear so far as he could tell had been hurled in blind desperation up into the branches where the soldier had marked the arrow that killed the man beside him by chance the missile had caught tomas in the soft place below the ribs on his left side tuck had been hiding in a crevice behind the tree and saw tomas fall the archer landed hard among the roots of the tree and tuck heard the bonerattling thump without a moments hesitation tuck rushed to the warriors aid and with a shout to alert the others hefted tomas up onto his shoulders and started for home he paused at the nearest stream to get some water and to assess the injury the spearhead had gone in straight and clean and by the look of it not too deep there was plenty of blood however and tuck wet one of the cloths he carried in his satchel and pressed it to tomass side can you hold that he asked tomas his face ashen nodded how bad is it he asked between clenched teeth not so bad tuck replied for all i can see angharad will be able to put it right is there much pain tomas shook his head i just feel sick yes well that is to be expected is it not replied the friar he offered the archer another drink get a little more water down you and well move along tomas drank what he could and tuck hefted him onto his feet once more draping the injured mans arm across his own round shoulders so as to bear him up they continued on the way was farther than he remembered but tuck kept up a ready pace his short sturdy legs churning steadily as he walked he said the our father over and over again as much for himself as for the comfort of the man he carried after two more brief pauses to catch his breath tuck approached cel craidd he could see the lightningblasted oak that formed an archway through the hawthorn hedge which helped to hide the settlement almost there tuck said a few more steps and we can rest there was a rush and rustle behind him tuck how is he the friar half turned bent low beneath the warrior whose weight he bore iwan thank god youre here he glanced quickly around is anyone else hurt no he replied only tomas here tossing aside his bow he helped ease the weight of the wounded man to the ground tomas now only halfconscious groaned gently as they stretched him out lets have a look i lost my bow moaned the injured warrior no matter tomas replied iwan well get you another lie still while we have a look at you tuck loosened the young mans belt and pulled up his shirt the wound was a simple gash in the fleshy part of his side no more than a thumbs length blood oozed from the cut and it ran clean not too bad iwan concluded youll be chasing ffreinc again before you know it to tuck he said lets get him to a hut and have angharad see to him as the two lifted tomas between them the rest of the war band appeared were clean away reported rhoddi breathing hard from his run no one gave chase scarlet owain and bran were the last to arrive bran glanced around quickly counting his men was anyone else injured only tomas here said iwan but he before the words were out of his mouth there arose a piercing shriekthe voice of a womanfrom the settlement beyond the concealing hedge the cry came again a highpitched desperate wail noin shouted scarlet darting forward he dived through the archway of the riven oak and disappeared down the path leading into cel craidd the men scrambled after him flying down into the bowl of a valley that cradled their forest home at first glance all appeared to be just as they had left it earlier that morning but there were no people none to greet their return as on all the other days when they had gone out to do battle with the ffreinc where are they wondered owain the shuddering wail came again this way scarlet raced off along one of the many pathways radiating out into coed cadw only a few steps down the path he found his wife standing in the path bent almost double her shoulders shaking with the violence of her sobs noin scarlet rushed to her side noin are you hurt she turned her face stricken and crumpled with pain although she appeared to be unharmed and then will looked at the bundle she cradled in her arms it was little nia her arms and legs limp and still the child appeared to be asleep eyes closed her features composed there was a dark ugly purple bruise on her throat will scarlet put his ear to the little ones face shes not breathing oh will sobbed noin as scarlet gathered them both in his arms bran shouted rhoddi over here a few dozen steps farther along the path lay another larger bundlea shapeless mass of bloody rags as if a sack of meat had been rolled and crushed beneath a millstone beside what was left of this body lay the banfaiths staff bran halted in midstep staring his face frozen angharad he cried rushing swiftly to the body he sank to his knees beside the pathetic heap of rag and bone and gathered it into his arms he knelt there rocking back and forth cradling the corpse of his beloved teacher and advisor his confidante his best and dearest friend after a time bran collected himself somewhat he lowered the body to the ground and gently smoothed the hair from the old womans face and then cupped her wrinkled cheek in his hand farewell mother he whispered gazing at the wizened features he had come to know so well he placed the tips of his fingers to her eyes and drew her eyelids shut then bent his head in sorrow as his tears flowed freely owain and the others raced off to make a search of the path and surrounding wood bran gathered up the broken body of the wise banfaith in his strong arms and returned to cel craidd scarlet and noin came after bearing their beloved daughter tuck ministering to tomass wound looked up as bran and scarlet returned with the little girl and the old woman he rose and ran to them as they lay the corpses beneath the spreading boughs of the council oak who is it who he said and stopped in his tracks lord have mercy he sighed when he saw who had been killed christ have mercy turning to noin and scarlet he gathered them in a gentle embrace and prayed for them then and there that the lord of life would give them strength to bear their loss he did the same for bran and seeing as there was nothing more to be done just then he returned to tending the wounded tomas bran was kneeling by the still body of angharad when owain came to him we found no one else injured rhi bran i thinki hopeeveryone got away he was silent for a moment watching bran straighten the old womans battered limbs do you think they knew it was king ravens home they attacked those knights werent looking for this place but they found it anyway but do they know what they found asked owain perhaps not allowed bran but if they do come back theyll come in force and we will not be able to defend it we will stay here tonight and abandon cel craidd in the morningand pray we have at least that much time he folded one of the old womans wrinkled hands over the other tell everyone to prepare to leave well take only what we can carry easily bundle up all the arrows and extra bowsget brocmael and ifor to help you secure all the weapons tell siarles to set sentries in the usual places go we must be ready to move at first light tomorrow owain nodded where will we go my lord it is a big forest he said brushing a wispy strand of hair away from angharads face well find someplace to camp it was early evening and the sun had tinged the sky with a crimson hue when noin finally brought herself to speak about what had happened which was that after the war band had departed the grellon went about their daily chores she and cia had gone to gather blackberries in the wood she had taken nia with her and the three of them had spent the morning picking when they had filled their bowls they started back nia was so excited noin said shed gathered more and bigger berries than ever before and she wanted to show angharad so she went ahead of us i tried to call her back noin paused choking back the tears but she didnt hear me and anyway she knew the path i let her go her voice faltered scarlet grim with grief put his arm around her shoulders and pulled her close bran offered her a cup of water after she had swallowed a little she continued we started back cia and i were talking then we heard shouts and voices scared we met some of the grellon on the path running away cel craidd had been discovered they said the ffreinc had found us everyone had scattered and everyone had got away what about nia did anyone see my little girl noin shook her head her lips trembling no one had seen her i started running toward the settlement but it was all over she shook her head in bewilderment the ffreinc were gone there was no one around i began calling for nia but there was no answer i started looking for her calling her i thought i hopedmaybe one of the others picked her up in the confusion someone had taken her to safety i searched one path and then another until she let out a wrenching sob and lowered her face into her hands i found her on the pathjust before you came i think she got trampled by a horse one of the hooves struck her head she turned eyes full of tears to the others how could anyone do that to a little child how could they bran and tuck left noin and scarlet to their grief then and went to see what could be done for tomas the wounded warrior had been laid out on a bed of rushes covered with a cloak he is sleeping rhoddi told them i did as you said friari put a clean cloth and some dry moss on the cut it seems to have stopped bleeding thats a good sign i think said tuck bran nodded he raised his eyes the tops of the tallest trees were fading into the twilight we must bury nia and angharad soon i will dig the graves allow me my lord said rhoddi bran nodded well do it together i want to help said tuck is it wise to leave him alone said rhoddi with a nod towards tomas tuck glanced at the sleeping warrior beside him well hear him if he wakes he said so the three went off to begin the bleak task of digging the graves one pitifully small for nia and another for angharad iwan and scarlet came to help too and all took their turn with the shovel while they were at their work some of the grellon who had fled the settlement began coming backone by one and then in knots of two or threeand they gave their own account of what had happened the settlement had been discovered by a body of ffreinc knights on horsebackeight or ten maybe morewho then attacked the forestdwellers fled with the knights in pursuit they would have been caught all of them but angharad turned and blocked the trail they had last seen her facing the enemy with her staff raised high a cry of challenge on her lips and though it cost her life the enemy did not follow them into the forest the returning grellon were shocked to find their good bard had been killed and dear little nia as well the tears and weeping began all over again the women attended noin helping her wash and dress little nia in her best clothes they combed her hair and plaited flowers in the braids and laid her on a bed of fresh green rushes they washed the blood from angharads body and dressed her in a clean gown and brought her staff to lay beside her bran made a cross for the graves using arrows which he bound together with bowstring meanwhile tuck moved here and there comforting his forest flock giving them such solace as he possessed he tried to instil some hope in the hearts of the grieving and show a way to a better day ahead but his own heart was not in it and his words sounded hollow even to himself when the graves were ready scarlet came and taking noin by the hand said it is time my heart noin nodded silently he knelt and gathered up his daughter and carried her to the newdug grave noin walked beside him her eyes on the bundle in her husbands arms iwan and owain bent to angharad but bran said wait bring her bird spirit cloak and put it on her and her staff we will bury her as befits the last true bard of britain owain fetched the blackfeathered cloak and helped bran wrap it around the old woman and the two bodies were laid to rest in the soft earth iwan brought angharads harp to place in the grave but bran prevented him no he said taking the harp this i will keep as he cradled the harp to his shoulder his mind flashed with the memory of one of their last partings all that needs saying have i said his wise banfaith had told him now it is for us to remember he held the harp and his mind returned to the time of their first meetingin the old womans winter cave hidden deep in the forest there she had healed his body with her art and healed his soul with her songs a raven you are and a raven you shall remainuntil the day you fulfil your vow bran murmured remembering the words of the old story he turned his eyes one last time to the face of his frienda face he had once considered almost unutterably ugly the wide downturned mouth and jutting chin the bulbous nose the small keen eyes burning out from a countenance so wrinkled it seemed to be nothing but creases lines and folds death had not improved her appearance but bran had long ago ceased to regard her looks seeing instead only the brightburning radiance of a soul alight with wisdom she called me a king my lord said iwan did you say something she had never done that before you see not until now darkness deepened in the greenwood the grellon lit pitch torches at the head of each body and began a service for the dead which tuck led praying softly through the psalms and the special prayers for those recently deceased it was a service he had performed as many times as christenings and weddings combined and he knew it by heart the mourners held vigil through the night bran scarlet and noin kept watch while others came and went silently or with a few words of comfort and condolence twice in the night bran was heard to groan his shoulders heaving with silent sobs the tie that had bound him and angharad together was strong and it had been cruelly severed the wound deep and raw then at sunrise the grellon gathered at the graveside tuck said another prayer for the dead and for those who must resume life without them noin and will wept as the dirt was replaced and heaped over the mounds bran pressed the small wooden crosses he had made into the graves and then knelt solemn but dryeyed and said a last silent farewell to the woman who had saved his life then while the rest of the forestdwellers prepared to abandon cel craidd tuck went to look in on tomas bran joined him a little later to ask after his injured archer my lord said tuck softly i fear we have lost a good warrior no sighed bran his wounds were greater than we knew the friar explained i think he must have died in the night i am sorry he looked sadly at the still body beside him if my skill had been greater i might have saved him and if there had been no battle and he had not been wounded bran shook his head and let the rest go unsaid he pressed a hand to tomass chest and thanked the dead warrior for his good service and released him to his rest then bidding tuck to have the body prepared for burial he rose and went to dig another grave chapter caer rhodl when were you going to tell me that friar tuck had been here asked merian her tone deceptively sweet or did you plan to tell me at all brother mine i did not think it any of your concern answered garran dismissively he leaned back in his chair and regarded his sister with suspicion and then the thought struck him but how did you know they had come here merian offered garran a superior smile bran has been a visitor to these halls more often than you know did you really think he would leave without seeing me the king of eiwas remained unmoved you said you wanted to speak to me i hope it was not merely to berate me if so you are wasting your breath i did not come to berate you but to tell you that there is no need to keep me locked up i will not try to escape or leave caer rhodl without your permission and blessing coming to your senses at last dear sister intoned garran may i ask what has brought about this change of heart i have come to see that there is no point in leaving here without you and your war band to accompany me garran opened his mouth to reject that possibility outright but merian did not give him the chance bran and his people are fighting for their lives in elfael we must help them we must ride at once garran held up his hand we have had this discussion before he said and i have not changed my mind even if i was so inclined to raise the war band for them the time for that is past i fear past inquired merian why past king william has raised his entire army and now occupies elfael himself it is said he has more than a thousand knights and menatarms encamped in the valley what of bran and his people is there any word only that they fight onfoolishly it seems to me since no one has come to their aid then that is all the more reason to raise the war band merian insisted clasping her hands before her she stepped nearer her recalcitrant brother you must see that garran we have to help them ride against king william and his army laughed garran there is no force in all britain that could defeat him now there came a knock on the door of the kings chamber and luc the kings seneschal entered forgive me sire but baron neufmarche has come and would see you most urgently he says before the servant could finish baron bernard himself pushed past him and stepped into the room one glance at merian brought him up short he stared at her as if at a ghost then collected himself i see i am intruding he said i am sorry i will come back in pray do not leave baron said garran merian noticed her brothers french had become quite fluentas had her own since returning to caer rhodl stay this concerns you too i think merian here is urging us to raise an army and ride to the defence of elfael she thinks we should take arms against the king of englands forces for the sake of bran ap brychan and his pitiful band of rebels the baron raised his eyebrows but did not condemn the notion does she indeed he said stepping farther into the room i would like to hear her reasons he made a stiffly formal bow to the young woman please speak freely my lady i assure you no harm will come of it garran was quick to protest with all respect baron my sisters fancies cannot be seriously entertained fancies snapped merian please replied neufmarche he appealed to merian if you would kindly explain i would like to hear your reasons fearing some kind of trap was being laid for her she replied baron you have the advantage here sending our war band to aid bran against the king is treason and if i were to argue such a course before one of the kings noblemen it would be to my deathif such a thing were to be reported in any event aiding elfael would go against your own interests and i cannot think you or anyone else would willingly choose such a course exactly crowed garran do not be so hasty cautioned the baron as it happens aiding elfael may sit with my interests very nicely garran stared at his fatherinlaw and patron momentarily lost for words does this surprise you wondered the baron so long as we are speaking freely the king is not always right you know william rufus is not the man his father was he makes mistakes one of his early mistakes was to cross the neufmarchesbut that is not at issue here he began pacing before the young kings chair to merians mind the very image of a man wrestling with an intractable problem she watched him hardly daring to hope that something good might come from what he was about to say it comes to thisthe king has ordered me to attend him and support him in this war against the rebel cantref to aid the king is to undo all i have worked for in wales for the last ten years or more this i will not doespecially since my own grandchildren when they arrive will be welsh and yethe raised a fingerto fail to respond to a royal summons is considered treason and my life and lands are forfeit if i do not ride to the aid of the king the baron regarded merian as he concluded the king has left me with a very difficult choice but a clear one garran did not see it but merian did which would be asked the young king you know it my lady said neufmarche holding her in his gaze i suspect youve known it for some time merian nodded you must march against the king surely not complained garran we cannot hope to achieve anything against william and all his men perhaps not replied bernard but that is mythat is ouronly choice if we hope to hold onto what we have we must defeat the kingor at least hold him off until peace can be reached a peace volunteered merian that will include justice for elfael and pardon for all those who have fought for what is right amnistie royale oui replied the baron but we risk everything garran pointed out our only hope of keeping what we have is to risk it all agreed neufmarche garran fell silent contemplating the enormous jolt his life and reign as king had just taken and that i suspect continued the baron after a moment is why the welsh noblemen have come cymry noblemen said merian here mais oui neufmarche assured her it is the reason i intruded just now a number of welsh noblemen have arrived and are seeking audience with the king i asked luc to bid them wait a little because i wanted to speak with my soninlaw first he smiled so you see cest fortuit non corrected merian lest la providence she turned to her brother freshening her appeal in welsh dont you see garran riding to the aid of elfael is the only way and with the barons help we cannot fail the young king was far from convinced but as client to the baron he knew he must do whatever his overlord commanded still he sought to put off his consent a little longer perhaps he suggested before going any further we should see who has come and hear what they have to say they have been brought to the hall said baron bernard and the serving maids instructed to give them refreshment he held out his arm to merian who after a slight hesitation took it garran went ahead of them and the baron followed with merian on his arm as soon as garran had left the room the baron turned to her and whispered lady merian he said hear mewe have not much time i do most humbly beg your pardon for i have not always had your best interest at heart i pray your forgiveness my lady and vow that in the days ahead i will make every effort to find a way to make up for my past mistakes you are forgiven my lord baron replied merian nicely what is more your determination to aid bran and elfael absolves a great many trespasses i pray now that we are not too late so pray we all replied the baron they followed king garran and his seneschal into the hall where they found the benches full of strangers some of the kings men had already gathered to host the visitors and all rose to their feet when the young king appeared my lord king said one of the visitors stepping forward at once in the name of our saviour jesus christ i give you good greeting i am lord llewelyn of aberffraw at your service he gave a small bow of deference i present to you my lord king gruffydd of gwynedda tall lean man stepped forwardand with him my lord king dafydd ap owain lord of snowdona sternfaced battle chief stepped forward and putting a hand to the hilt of his sword gave a nod of his headand iestyn ap gwrgan king of gwent the last of the great welsh noblemen stepped forward and made his obeisance to the young king peace and welcome to you all said garran deeply impressed that such renowned men should have come to beg audience with him you honour me with your presence my lords please be seated again and fill the cups i am eager to hear what has brought you to eiwas and to my hall lord garran if it please you said the lanky nobleman called gruffydd i speak for all of us when i say that we are grateful for your friendship and would like nothing more than to sit with you and drink your health and that of your people his eyes shifted to the baron and he hesitated for a moment then continued unfortunately we cannot partake of that estimable luxury time presses do not think me rude therefore if i decline your hospitality we are passing through your lands on our way to elfael elfael remarked garran with a glance at his sister who was quietly translating for baron neufmarche it does seem to be a busy place of late i will be brief said gruffydd we go to join forces with bran ap brychan to aid him in his fight to reclaim the throne of elfael from the ffreinc as god is my witness lord bran has done me a very great service which i can never hope to repay in full but i go to do what i can moreover it has been borne upon me with some considerable forcehere he glanced at lord llewelynthat if any of us would be free in our own land we must all be free to that end i have persuaded these lords to join me he put out a hand to his august companions and their commanders who filled the benches at the board he stepped before garran to address him more directly i would persuade you too my lord he regarded the young king steadily join us rhi garran help us right a great wrong and win justice for elfael and all who call cymru home against the ffreinc and their overreaching king one of the lords stepped near to gruffydd just then and whispered something in his ear the king of gwynedd squared himself turned and gazed boldly at the baron it seems i have spoken too freely gruffydd said i am informed that we have a ffreinc baron among us had i known that he was here truly said garran there is no harm done he turned and beckoned the baron and his sister nearer my lords i present baron neufmarche my liege lord and with him my sister lady merian my lord baron said gruffydd in stiff acknowledgement of neufmarche his hand went to the sword at his side and stayed there as the baron is my overlord garran continued it is well that he has heard your intentions for himself how so said gruffydd suspiciously for the fact that this was the very course he himself was urging only moments before we joined you here mes seigneurs et mes rois said the baron cest vrai merian translated for the welsh kings and explained that the baron had defied red williams summons and had come to eiwas instead and that he and garran had just been discussing the need to aid the rebels of elfael in their struggle against the crown after a quick consultation with bernard she concluded baron neufmarche wishes you to know that he stands willing to pledge his men to the aid of elfael and asks only to be taken at his word this provoked a hasty and heated discussion among the welsh noblemen merian watched as the debate seemed to roll back and forth it was swiftly over and the welsh lords turned to face the baron with their answer gruffydd said we have argued your offer lord baron and it is most unexpected to be surebut no less welcome for that we will accept your pledge and thank you for it the baron expressed his gratitude to the welsh kings for placing their trust in him and then through merian asked how soon can you be ready to march we are already on the march replied gruffydd our men are on their way to elfael even now then replied the baron when he had received gruffydds answer we must make haste to overtake them among my people it is counted a very great shame for a commander to lead from the rear chapter rhoddi scrambled through the upper branches of the greenwood canopy skittering along the hidden path of the sky way to drop deftly into the little clearing where the grellon had set up camp after abandoning cel craidd the day before he searched among the sleeping bodies huddled in their cloaks on the ground for the one he sought and hastened to kneel beside it bran he said leaning close owain says to come at once bran sat up it was early still the feeble grey light barely penetrating the heavy foliage of oak and elm round about reaching instinctively for his bow he rose to his feet trouble rhoddi shook his head theres something moving on the kings road he said quietly something you should see will called bran softly rousing the forester begin waking the others and get everyone ready to move ill send word back to rhoddi he said lead the way the two climbed up the rope ladder onto the interconnected arrangement of limbs and boughs planks and platforms that the grellon maintained to move easily and quickly to and from the kings road overlook a swift and precarious dash brought them to the place where owain was perched high up among the rocks on the bank of the cliff overlooking the road what is it asked bran climbing up beside him more troops aye replied owain it is more troops sire but there is something odd about these ones he pointed down the road to where a column of knights was just coming into view a scouting party passed just a little while ago i think this is the main body just coming now ffreinc yes said bran i see them what is so odd about them the scouts were cymry said owain cymry said bran are you sure as sure as i can be they were welshborn i swear on jobs bonesand all of them carried longbows same as us not good muttered bran our own countrymen going to join king williamnot good at all before his companion could offer a reply bran grabbed his arm look he pointed down to the second rank of mounted soldiers riding behind a double row of menatarms on foot i know that mani know his standard saints in heaven who is it wait said bran straining forward let them come a little closer he slapped the rock with his hand yes do you recognize someone my lord it is baron neufmarcheor i am the archbishop of canterbury said bran still squinting down into the road and god help us that is merian beside him are you sure bran squirmed around on the rock and called down to rhoddi waiting below go get scarlet tell him to bring every man who can draw a bow tell him i want them to be ready to fight when they get here well have to take them on the fly hurry man go in the road below the soldiers came on slowing as they neared the place where the road narrowed beneath the overhanging rocks do you think they know were here wondered owain perhaps replied bran withdrawing an arrow from the bundle and nocking it to the string come closer proud baron he whispered pressing the belly of the bow forward just a little closer and youre mine but when the riders resumed their march it was not neufmarche who advancedit was merian and another riding beside her the two advanced together who is that with her said owain bran stared hard at the mounted warrior beside merian after a moment owain observed he doesnt look like a ffreinc he isnt concluded bran he is cymry do you know him bran lowered the bow and eased the string that is gruffydd lord of gwynedd though what he is doing here in the company of baron neufmarche is a very mystery maybe neufmarche has taken them captive suggested owain by way of reply bran drew and loosed an arrow into the road it struck the dirt a few paces ahead of the two oncoming riders merian reined up she lifted her face to the rock walls rising to either side of the road and then placing a hand to her mouth called rhi bran are you here she waited a moment then said bran if you are here show yourself we have come to talk to you owain and bran exchanged a puzzled glance bran moved to rise but owain put a hand on his arm dont do it my lord it might be a trick from anyone but merian replied bran i will talk to themkeep an arrow on the string just in case bran stood on the rock he lofted the bow and called down to the riders in the road here i am bran cried merian thank god are you well merian have they hurt you i am well bran she called beaming up at him i have brought help she twisted in the saddle and indicated the ordered ranks of troops behind her we have come to help you and neufmarche said bran what is he doing here he has joined us said gruffydd speaking up greetings rhi bran greetings gruffydd i never thought to see you again for that i am full sorry replied the lord of gwynedd but i beg the chance to make it up to you i have brought friendsand yes baron neufmarche is one of them you will forgive me if i am not wholly persuaded remarked bran could you come down do you think asked gruffydd i grow hoarse and stiffnecked shouting up at you like this slinging his bow across his chest bran prepared to meet them on the road keep an eye on them he said to owain when scarlet and the others get here position the men on the rocks there and therehe pointed along the rocky outcroppingand tell them to be ready to let fly if things are not what they seem god with you my lord said owain putting an arrow on the string well wait for your signal bran lowered himself quickly down the rocks dropping from ledge to ledge and lighting on the edge of the road a hundred paces or so from where merian and gruffydd were waiting behind them stood the ranks of the barons knights and menatarms and bran was relieved to see that none of them had moved and seemed content merely to stand looking on unslinging his bow he put an arrow on the string and advanced cautiously keeping an eye on the troops for any sign of movement he had walked but a few dozen paces when merian spurred her horse forward and galloped to him throwing herself from the saddle and into his embrace her mouth found his and she kissed him hard and with all the pentup passion of their weeks apart oh bran i have missed you im sorry i could not come sooner merian i but look she said kissing him again ive brought an army she flung out a hand to those behind her theyve come to help save elfael truly replied bran still not entirely trusting this turn of fortune how many are with you i dont knowover five hundred i think baron neufmarche has come in on our side and rhi gruffydd is here and garran and votre dame est la plus persuasif said neufmarche reining up just then king garran rode beside him it is true said garran my sister can be very persuasive she would not rest until we agreed to come help you king gruffydd rode up and took his place beside the baron seeing gruffydd and neufmarche side by side seemed so unnatural bran could hardly credit what he saw and his native suspicion returned full force instinctively he stepped in front of merian that is close enough baron said bran raising his bow aros rhi bran said gruffydd you are among friendsmore than you know the baron has pledged his forces to your aid indicating the troops amassed behind him with a wide sweep of his hand he said we have come to confront king william and his army and would be much obliged if you would lead us to them if you have truly come to fight the ffreinc said bran you will not go home disappointed i can show you all you care to see king gruffydd climbed slowly down from the saddle he walked to where bran stood and then in full sight of everyone there went down on one knee before him my lord and friend he said bending his head i pledge my life to you and to this cause my men and i will see you on the throne of elfael or gladly embrace our graves one or the other will prevail before we relinquish the fight this is my vow drawing his sword he laid it at brans feet from this day my sword is yours to command rise my lord i began bran but his throat closed over the words and overcome with a sudden heady swirl of emotions he found he could not speak in all that had happened in the last days and weeks he had never foreseen anything like this the help he had so long and so desperately needed had come at last and the realization of what it meant fair whelmed him over gruffydd rose smiling i owe you my life and throne and more blind fool that i am it took me a little time to see that taking bran by the arm he pulled him away but come llewelyn is herehe has been most persuasive tooand ive brought some others who are anxious to meet the renowned rhi bran y hud the next thing bran knew he was surrounded by knights and noblemenboth cymry and ffreincall of them pledging their swords to him he greeted all in turn his thoughts churning emotion running high as he tried to comprehend the magnitude of the good that had just befallen him baron neufmarche remained a little apart looking on from his saddle he motioned merian to him and had a brief word she hurried to bran and said no one is happier than i am for this glad meeting but the baron wishes me to say that it would not be the wisest course to be caught on the road just now he asks if you might lead us to your camp where the commanders can discuss the ordering of the troops and prepare the battle plan the baron is right allowed gruffydd is it far your camp my settlement was destroyed oh bran no said merian was anyone i am sorry merian bran put a hand to her shoulder to steady her for the blow angharad was killed protecting cel craidd and little nia by accident it happened when we were on a raid tomas is dead toofrom a ffreinc spear merians face crumpled bran slid his arm around her shoulders later my love he whispered his mouth close to her ear we will grieve them properly later i need your strength just now nodding she lifted her head and rubbed the tears from her eyes what would you have me do tell the baron there is a place farther on along the road where we can gather he shook his head the troops will have to spread out into the forest and find places to camp of their own my men can lead them bran raised his bow and loosed a shrill whistle that pierced the forest quiet and resounded among the rocks from every side appeared his fighting men scarlet tuck rhoddi owain ifor brocmael idris geronwy and beli and llwyd they clambered down the rocks to join the company on the road and receive the good news moments later brans new army was on the move with bran himself leading themthrough the gorge and beyond it to a place where the land flattened out once more the forest thinned somewhat around a stand of great oaks and elms and here bran gave orders for rhoddi and owain to lead the army into the wood round about and let them rest tuck he said snatching the friar by the sleeve as he greeted merian stay with meand you too scarlet we are going to hold council to plan the battle while men and horses and wagons trundled into a glen in the wood there to establish a rude camp the kings and noblemen sat down with bran to learn the state of affairs in elfael and the strength and position of king williams troops thus the council began and it was long before each of the great lords had their say and all points of view had been taken into account the sun was a dull copper glow low in the west and the first stars were beginning to light up the sky when a plan of battle that all agreed upon began to emerge bran was by turns impressed with the expertise of his new battle chiefs and irked at the necessity of biding his time while they hammered out details he would have settled long ago but all in all as the last light of day faded he declared himself pleased with the plan and confident in his commanders the scouts would go out at dawn and make a final assessment of the enemy position ahead of the battle then the rebel forces would take the field against the kings army led by the cymry archers supported and guarded on the flanks by baron neufmarche and his knights as soon as the council concluded the lords went to find food and drink with their men bran sent scarlet and tuck to tell his own war band what had happened and then sought merian it is the answer to prayer long in coming he told her she stepped easily into his embrace feeling the living warmth of her in his arms he confessed his voice faltering slightly i never hoped to see you again i thought we had parted for good shhh she said i will never leave you again she gave him a lingering kiss and then said tell me all that has happened while ive been away they talked then and the twilight deepened around them they were still talking when tuck came upon them unwilling to intrude on their intimate moment he settled himself on the root of a tree to wait thinking what a strange and wonderful day it had been and here were bran and merian such a good match there would be a wedding soon if he had anything to say about it and he thought if they were all still alive this time tomorrow leaning back against the rough bole of the old elm he closed his eyes from the depths of misery over the recent loss of angharad tomas and nia who could have foreseen that their fortunes would rise to such heights so quickly even so the victory was not yet wonfar from it there were battles to be fought and the lives of many swung in the balance death and destruction would be great indeed oh merciful lord he sighed inwardly if that could somehow be prevented let this cup pass from us he prayed softly ah tuck said bran interrupting the friars meditation youre heregood still holding merian he turned to the little friar i have a job for you chapter dawn was still but a whisper in the pale eastern sky when tuck finally reached saint martins he paused below the brow of a hill a short distance from the little town and dismounted he trudged wearily up to the top of the hill and there stood for a time to observe the moon bright still illuminated the hills and filled the valleys with soft shadows nothing moved anywhere he yawned and rubbed his face with his hands this friar is getting too old for these midnight rambles his empty stomach growled too right he muttered at brans behest tuck had ridden all night making a wide careful circuit of the valley to avoid being seen by any ffreinc sentries or watchmen posted on the outer perimeter of king williams sprawling encampment which lay between the forest and elfaels fortress caer cadarn now coming upon the town from the north he paused to make certain he could continue to the completion of his mission having come this far it would not do to be caught now there did not seem to be any ffreinc troops around he could not see anyone moving about the low walls the town was quiet asleep well tuck my man time to beard the lion in his den struggling back into the saddle he resumed his errand descending the hill and starting up the gentle slope to the town keeping his eyes open for any sign of discovery at his approach but there was no one about and he entered the town alone and for all he could tell unobserved he dismounted and tethered the horse to an iron ring set in the wall of the guardhouse then quickly and quietly started across the deserted market square towards the abbey the abbey gates were closed but he rapped gently on the door and eventually managed to rouse the porter i have a matter of utmost urgency for the bishop he announced to the priest who unlatched the door take me to him at once the young monk yawning shook his head it was then tuck recognized him odo wake up boyo its me tuck i have to see bishop asaph without delay god with you friar said odo rubbing his eyes the bishop will be asleep there is no time said tuck pressing himself through the gap it is life and death odo well have to wake him tuck took the young monks elbow spun him around and started walking towards the palatial lodge abbot hugo had built for himself never fear brother i would not disturb the good bishops rest if it was not of highest importance this way then said odo and led tuck not to the main entrance but around the side to a small room where the secnab had lodged he prefers a less ostentatious cell explained the young scribe knocking on the door there came a sleepy voice asking them to wait and in a moment the door opened there stood the wizened elderly priest barefoot his haze of white hair a wispy nimbus on his head one look at tuck and he said how may i serve you brother bishop asaph said tuck it is brother aethelfrithdo you remember me the old priest studied his face in the moonlight then recognition flooded into the pale eyes brans friend yes i remember you but tell me has something happened is he well all is well father replied tuck or soon will be i have come asaph shivered come in brother aethelfrith and let us sit by the fire tuck thanked odo and stepped inside the old priest showed him to a stool by a tiny fire in the hearth these old bones are hard to keep warm explained the bishop my advice brother do not get oldand if you do see you keep a little fire going in the corner it works miracles ill remember that replied tuck now then said asaph what has kept you from your bed this night bran has sent me with a message replied the friar and went on to explain about the miraculous arrival of gruffydd and the cymry kings and that is not allfar from it he remarked baron neufmarche has joined the rebellion he is lending the full force of his troops to the cause it is i think the only way he can hope to hold on to his estates bishop asaph gasped with a sharp intake of breath lord almighty his eyes grew round then it is soon over praise be to god one way or another yes replied tuck and perhaps sooner than you know the cymry mean to attack tomorrow we have not the supplies and such for a prolonged clash the troops are ready and the weather is good we will have the higher ground he paused in short there is no point in waiting that is what i came to tell you the battle attack will come in the morning when the sun has risen above the trees so that it will be in the eyes of the ffreinc troops god have mercy asaph shook his head i will make ready to receive the wounded of course yes agreed tuck and one other thingwe must get word to iwan and siarles at the fortress they must know so they can be ready to strike from the rear if and when the opportunity arises he paused bran has asked if you will take the message to them me blustered asaph well of course but have the kings men made any trouble for you no no replied the bishop quickly it has been very quiet they come here for prayer and confessionand to ensure the wounded are receiving good care but they leave us alone well then concluded tuck perhaps you might take two or three brothers with you and go to the caer take a bell and ring it as you go so the ffreinc will know youre on holy business asaph nodded slowly what if they make bold to stop us simply tell them that you are going up to shrive the cymry in the stronghold yes you can do that too once youve delivered the message can you not the old churchman considered this for a moment then making up his mind he said if there is to be a battle soldiers must be shriven men facing their eternal destiny have no wish to die with sins unconfessed dragging their souls into perdition the ffreinc understand this thank you father said tuck they talked a little more then and tuck gave the bishop a lengthy account of all that had taken place in the last daysthe running battle with king williams troops in the forest leading up to the unexpected return of merian bringing king gruffydd and the baron they talked of the difficulties looming in the days aheadcaring for the injured and wounded in the aftermath of battle finding food for the survivors and rebuilding lives and livelihoods destroyed by the war finally tuck rose and with great weariness of body and spirit made his farewells and moved to the door god with you brother aethelfrith said asaph with deepest sincerity and also with you father replied tuck may the good lord keep you in the hollow of his hand amen said asaph i will leave you to make your own way out i want to pray for a while before we go up to the caer tuck left the monastery without bothering odo again he slipped out of the abbey gate and started across the deserted square of the stillsleeping town as he was passing the church he heard the sound of horses approaching and turned just as four or five riders entered the square ffreinc soldiers he was caught like a ferret in a coop instinctively he dived for the door of the church it was dark and cool inside as he knew it would be a single candle burned on the altar and the interior was filled with the sweet stale odour of spent incense and beeswax the baptismal font stood before him square and solid the cover locked with an iron hasp that was vile hugo locking the font lest any poor soul be tempted to steal a drop of holy water gazing quickly around the empty space for a place to hide he sawcould it be yes in the far corner of the nave stood a strange curtained booth oh these normanschasing every new whim that whispers down the road a confessional tuck had heard of them but had never seen one they were it was said becoming very fashionable in the new stone churches the ffreinc built the notion that a body could confess without looking his priest in the eye all the while seemed faintly ludicrous to tuck nevertheless he was grateful for this particular whim just now he crossed quickly to the booth it was an open stall with a pierced screen down the centre on one hand was a chair for the priest on the other a little low bench for the kneeling penitent a curtain hung between the two and another hid the priest from view tuck could not help clucking his tongue over such unwonted luxury not for the norman cleric a humble stool no nothing would do but that hugos priests must have an armchair throne with a downfilled cushion bless em said tuck pulling aside the curtain he stepped in and closed the curtain again then settled himself in the chair thanking the good lord for his thoughtful provision no sooner had he leaned back in his chair than the door of the church opened and the soldiers entered tuck remained absolutely still hardly daring to breathe the footsteps came nearer they were coming towards the confessional one of the knights was standing directly in front of the booth now and tuck braced himself for discovery the soldier put a hand on the curtain and pulled it aside the soldier saw tuck and tuck saw the soldieronly it was no ordinary knight the squat thick body the powerful chest and slightly bowed legs from a life on horseback the shock of flaming red hair it was none other than king william rufus in the flesh tuck pressed his eyes closed expecting the worst but the king turned away without the slightest hint of recognition in his pale blue eyes and called over his shoulder to the two with him le pretre est ici he said me partir the priest is here thought tuck translating the words in his headgod help me he thinks i am the priest to hear his confession king william dropped the curtain and settled himself on the kneeling bench pere entendre mon aveu he said wearily knowing he would have to speak nowand that his french was not up to the challengehe said mon seigneur et mon roi anglais sil vous plait there came a heavy sigh from the other side of the curtain and then the king of england replied ouiof course i understand my anglais is not so good forgive moi eh god hears the heart my lord offered tuck it makes no difference to him what language we use would you like me to shrive you now oui pere that is why i have come the king paused and then said forgive me father a sinner today i ride into battle and i cannot pay for the souls of those who will be slain the bloodprice is heavy and i am without the silver to pay eh it took tuck a moment to work out what william was talking about and he was glad the king could not see him behind the curtain i see he said and then it came to him that william rufus was talking about the peculiar norman belief that a soldier owed a blood debt for the souls of those he had slain in battle since one could never know whether the man he had just killed had been properly shriven the souls of the combat dead became the survivors responsibility so to speakhe was obligated to pray for the remission of their sins so that they might enter heaven and stand blameless before the judgement seat of god oh yes intoned tuck as understanding broke upon him the king like many great lords was paying priests to pray for the souls of men he had slain in battle praying them out of purgatory and into heaven by the virgin the cost is heavy muttered william intolerable eh it is all i can do to pay my fathers debt and i have not yet begun to pay my own a very great pity yes tuck allowed pitie oui sighed william tres grande pitie begging your pardon mon roi said tuck i am but a lowly priest but it seems to me that the way out of your predicament is not more money but fewer souls eh said william only half paying attention fewer souls do not kill any more soldiers the king laughed outright you know little about warring priest un innocent i like you soldiers get killed in battle that is the whole point so i am told replied tuck but is there no other way it could all be settled tomorrowdieu sang todayif the blasted welsh would only lay down their weapons but they have raised rebellion against me and that i will not have a great dilemma for you conceded tuck i see that before he could say more william continued this cantref infortune has already cost me more than it will ever return and if i do not collect my tribute in normandie in six days time i will lose those too philip will see to that tuck seized on this all the more reason to make peace with these rebels if they agreed to lay down their arms and swear fealty to you et payer le tribut royal added william quickly yes and pay the royal tribute to be sure agreed tuck your majesty would not have to feed an army or pay for the souls of the dead also you could go to normandie and collect the tribute that is dueall this would save the royal treasury a very great load of silver would it not par le vierge save a great load of silver yes tuck hardly daring to believe that he was not in a dream but unwilling to wake up just yet decided to press his luck as far as it would go again forgive me mon roi but why not ask for terms of peace this rebelking raven i believe they call himhas said that all he wants is to rule his realm in peace even now i believe he could be convinced to swear fealty to you in exchange for reclaiming his throne there was a long and tuck imagined baleful silence on the other side of the curtain he feared the king was deciding how to slice him up and into how many pieces finallywilliam said i think you are a man of great faith the wistful longing in that voice cut at tucks heart if i could believe this believe it sire said tuck for it is true if i am seen to allow rebellion every hand will be raised against me perhaps granted tuck but if you are seen to practice mercy it would inspire others to greater loyalty would it not he paused the sword is always close to hand helas cest vrai granted the king alas yes it is too true there was silence again then tuck could not tell what was happening beyond the curtain he prayed william was seriously considering the idea of suing for peace when he spoke again the king said will you yet shrive me that is why i am here bow your head my son and we begin replied tuck and proceeded with the ritual when at last the king rose to depart he thanked his priest and walked from the church without another word tuck waited until he heard the sound of horses in the square and then crept to the door king william and his knights were riding away in the grey dawn of a new day he waited until they were out of sight and then ran to his own horse and flew to the greenwood as if all the hounds of hell were at his heels chapter the sun was well up and climbing towards the tops of the higher trees by the time tuck reached the safety of the greenwood the combined armies of cymry rebels were already amassing at the edge of the forest hampered by the trees and undergrowth tuck worked his way along the battle line searching for bran by the time he found him the sun was that much higher and the assault that much nearer bran cried tuck thank god ive found you in time he slid from the saddle and ran to where bran was waiting with scarlet owain and his own small war band engulfed and surrounded by king gruffydds troops and those of the northern lords i bring word be quick about it bran told him i am just about to give the command no said tuck almost frantic forgive me my lord but do nothing until youve heard what i have to say very well bran agreed he called across to gruffydd and llewelyn who were standing a little apart stand ready to march as soon as i have returned to tuck he said come with me he led them a little way into the wood to a place where they would not be overheard well is the bishop able to get a message to the caer it took a moment for the priest to recall his original errand oh that yes tuck licked his lips and swallowed i have seen the king the king red william the same replied the friar and explained what had happened in the townhow he had been surprised by ffreinc riders and hid himself in the church how william had mistaken him for one of the abbey priests and asked to be shriven and their talk about the rebellion did you shrive him i did yes but so that means they intend to attack today concluded bran well done tuck it confirms us in our plan we will strike without delay he started away that is not all said tuck the king was distraught about the cost of this war it weighs heavily with him he stands to lose his tribute money from normandie good above all else he desires a swift end to this conflict tuck explained i believe he would be moved towards peace that he will not have declared bran and you are certain bishop asaph will warn iwan and siarles at the fortress he will then all is ready he commended tuck for his diligence and returned to the battle line where he gave a nod to gruffydd llewelyn and the others god with you today my lords and with us all he called and raising his warbow he gave the signal to move out the massed armies of cymry archers and ffreinc soldiers under the command of baron neufmarche slowly moved out from the shelter of coed cadw the knights on horseback and the cymry on foot they marched down the slope and into the vale of elfael their appearance threw williams troops into a chaos of frantic activity as the alarms were sounded through the various camps the knights menatarms and footmen were well trained however and hastily mustered for battle as the cymry drew nearer the ffreinc moved to meet them first one division and then another until the gaps in the line were filled and they had formed a single dense body of soldiersthe knights in the centre flanked by the footmen tuck with his staff taking his place behind bran and scarlet found himself walking beside owain whatever happens today said the young warrior i would have you say a prayer for me friar and here i have been praying for us all since first light have i not then said owain i will pray for you friar tuck do that boyo agreed tuck you do that the cymry moved slowly down from the forest spreading out along the rim of the valley a little north of the kings road so that when they attacked the sun would be at their backs and in the eyes of the enemy they came to the steepest part of the slope and stopped so that williams troops would have to toil uphill to engage them while they could rain arrows down into the ranks of advancing knights as well as those behind king williams barons and earls each in command of his own men formed the battle line filling in the gaps between the separate bodies until the knights rode shoulder to shoulder and shield to shield spears raised and ready to swing down into position when the order was given to charge the footmen scrambled into ranks behind the knights and prepared to deliver the second assault when the knights broke the enemy line up on the slopes across the valley the cymry archers took handfuls of arrows and thrust them pointfirst into the turf before them ready to hand when the order came to loose havoc on the advancing ffreinc baron neufmarche at the head of his troops drew into position to the northwestready to swoop down upon the unprotected flanks of williams army the moment the charge faltered under the hail of shafts if however the knights survived the charge and carried the attack forward he would come in hard to protect the archers retreat come on you ugly frogfaced knaves muttered scarlet he stretched and flexed the stiffness from his injured hand then plucked a shaft from the ground and nocked it to the string a little closer and youre mine other men were speaking nowsome in prayer and others in derision of the enemy banking courage in themselves and those around them bran stood silent watching the slow steady advance of the ffreinc line he suddenly found himself wishing angharad were alive to see this day he missed her and the knowledge that she was upholding him in her mysterious and powerful way closing his eyes he prayed that she was gazing down on him and would intercede with the angels of war on his behalf and sustain him in the battle he was still occupied with this thought when he heard gruffydd say here now whats this bran opened his eyes to see that the ffreinc had halted just out of easy arrow flight the early sun glinted off the polished surfaces of their shields and weapons there was a movement from the centre and the line broke parting to the left and right as a small body of knights rode forward two of the riders carried bannersone bearing the royal standard of king william a manytailed flag with a red cross on a white field and a strip of ermine across the bottom separating the body from the green blue and yellow tails the other knight bore the standard of england the cross of jerusalem in gold surrounded by smaller crosslets of blue its tails were green gold and blue each tail ending in small gold tassels these banners preceded a single knight riding between them two more knights followed the lone rider and all advanced to a point halfway between the two armies and there they halted saints and angels said gruffydd whats the old devil about i think bloody william wants to talk replied llewelyn i say we give him an arrow in the eye and let that do our talking for us declared gruffydd he nudged llewelyn beside him your aim is true cousin let fly and well see that rascal off right smart no said tuck pressing forward begging your pardon my lords i do believe he wants to beg terms of peace peace scoffed gruffydd never the old buzzard wants to sneak us into a trap more like i say give him an arrow or two and teach him to keep his head down my lord pleaded tuck if it is peace he wants it would be the saving of many lives bran gazed across the distance at the king sitting on his fine horse his newly burnished armour glinting in the golden light of a brilliant new day if he does want to talk bran decided at last it will cost us nothing to hear what he has to say we can attack as soon as the discussion is concluded he turned to gruffydd i will talk to him you and llewelyn be ready to lead the assault if things go badly he motioned to will scarlet saying come with me will and you too tuckyour french is better than mine baron neufmarche speaks french better than any of us tuck pointed out send for him maybe later allowed bran well see if theres anything worth talking about first together the three of them walked down the grassy slope to where the king of england had established himself between his billowing standards perhaps the friar is right suggested will scarlet it would not hurt to have neufmarche with us we will call him if we need him allowed bran william speaks english tuck told them does he indeed said bran a little anywaymore than hell admit to then we will insist bran decided that way we can all be very careful about what we say to one another they came to within fifty paces of the knights on horseback mon roi said bran with a glancing nod of respect parlerezvous oui replied king william je veux vous parler de la paix he wants to talk to you about making peace said tuck bon said bran to tuck he said tell him that we will speak in english and that you will relay my words to him tuck did as he was commanded and a strange expression passed over the kings face you he said have i seen you before youve seen us all before you muleheaded varlet muttered scarlet in welsh steady on scarlet said bran were here to listen oh indeed yes sire replied tuck we met first in rouen last yearwhen my lord bran came to warn you of the plot by your brother against your throne william nodded somewhere else i think yes said tuck i was at wintan cestre when you gave your judgement against baron de braose and count falkes and delivered this cantref into the care of abbot hugo rainault and sheriff de glanville william squinted his eyes and regarded the little friar with a suspicious lookas if trying to decide if the priest was mocking him in some subtle way no somewhere else realization came to him and his eyebrows raised le sang vierge you were that priest in the church this morning true majesty answered tuck that is a fact i cannot deny good lord tuck whispered scarlet youve been a busy fella the king frowned then said cest la viei am glad you are here turning his attention to the task at hand he said to bran good day for a battle eh none better replied bran through tuck what is this about you ah desirer the throne of this godforsaken cantref you have caused me the very devil of trouble my lord with respect sire answered bran i want only what is rightfully minethe throne my family has occupied for two hundred years hmph sniffed william unimpressed that is finished britain is a norman country now i made my decision can you not accept it tuck and bran conferred and the friar said again with respect sire my lord bran would remind you that the two of you made a bargain in rouena throne for a throne that is what you said bran helped you save your throne now he wants the one he was promised king william frowned he took off his helmet and rubbed a gloved hand through his thinning red hair after a moment he said your priest here he jabbed a stubby finger at tuck says you will swear fealty to me is that true oui said bran yes if i restore you to the throne william said you will cease this rebellionis that so again bran and tuck conferred that is what i intended from the first this miserable little cantref has already cost me more than i will ever see out of it grumbled william what you want with it god knows but you are welcome to it your majesty gasped one of the barons attending william i fear you are making a grave mistake the knight moved up beside the king and the forestdwellers recognized him for the first time you had your say long ago gysburne tuck told him ferme la bouche you cannot just give it back to them insisted marshal gysburne not after what theyve done can i not growled the king who are you sir to tell me what i can do the priest is rightshut your mouth turning to bran he said it grows hot and i am thirsty can we discuss this somewhere out of the sun i have wine in my tent come let us talk together i would like nothing more replied bran when tuck had told him what the king said however i would like to choose the place of discussion where then the fortress is just there said bran pointing down the slope to the caer on its mound in the near distance we will talk there but the stronghold is full of your warriors the king pointed out some warriors yes allowed bran but farmers and herders toothe people who have suffered under de braose abbot hugo and sheriff de glanville these last years am i to go into this den of wolves alone said the king bring as many of your knights as you wish bran told him the more who see us swear peace with one another the better it will be for everyone when king william and his knights rode into the fortress yard at midday bran and his people were ready to receive them bran with merian on one hand and tuck on the other was flanked by iwan and siarles on the right and will scarlet and alan adale on the left behind him were other members of the grellonnoin owain brocmael and ifor and most of the forestdwellers baron bernard neufmarche stood a little apart with two of his knights holding sheriff richard de glanville bound at the wrists between them beside the knights stood bishop asaph gripping the oaken shaft of his brasstopped crosier and odo clutching a big bible the king of england was accompanied by a dozen knights marshal guy of gysburne amongst them around the perimeter of the yard stood the people of elfael outside the walls of the fortress the army was drawn up and waiting beyond them on the heights above the valley the cymry kings and their archers kept watch on the proceedings if williams army moved to attack they would move to prevent it william rufus rode to the centre of the yard where his personal canopy had been set up he dismounted and was greeted by bran merian and baron neufmarche joined them to make certain that no misunderstandings arose because of a simple lack of language on either side a small table had been set up beneath the canopy and two chairs on the table was a jar and a single bowl your majesty said bran if it please you sit with me we will drink together i would like nothing better said the king seeing neufmarche he stopped and turned to his wayward vassal baron do not think that your part in this will be ignored the baron inclined his head in acceptance of the kings charge but replied what i have done i did for the greater good ha scoffed the king your own good most of all i do not doubt by the virgin man how could you turn against me it was not so much turning against you sire replied the baron but protecting myself even so it is fortunate that we did not have to try one another in battle fortunate eh said the king we will talk of this another time he moved to take his place beneath the brightly coloured canopy bran joined him and sat down with merian on one side and tuck on the other the baron stood to one side between the two kings and acting as steward poured wine into the bowl he handed the bowl to bran who took it up drank a draught and then offered it to william red william accepted the bowl and drank then returned it to bran the backandforth continued until the bowl was drained whereupon baron neufmarche refilled it and placed it on the table between them god with you your majesty said bran who between merian and the baron was able to make his thoughts known and though we might both wish that the occasion was otherwise i do bid you welcome to caer cadarn and elfael it is my hope that we rise from this table better friends than when we sat down let us cut to the bone replied the king in english what are your terms bran smiled i want only what i have always wanted your precious throne yes answered the king you shall have it what else full pardon for myself and my grellon and any who have aided me in returning the realm to my rule said bran and that will include baron neufmarche the king frowned at this last part when it was explained to him but gave a grudging nod of assent what else nothing more said bran only your seal on a treaty of peace between our kingdoms william gave a bark of disbelief when neufmarche translated brans last remarks nothing else no reparations no silver to pay your soldiers my warriors are mine to repay said bran we cymry take care of our own i wish every fiefdom took care of itself by the blood replied william he leaned back in his chair and gave every appearance of beginning to enjoy himself if you have nothing else then hear my terms i require your oath of fealty and a tribute to be paid each year on he tapped his chin as he thought then caught a glimpse of tuck and said you there priestif you are a priestwhat is the nearest holy day to this one tuck moved a step forward that would be gwyl iwan y coed he replied the feast of saint john the baptist in plain english john le baptiste oui said neufmarche passing this along to the king henceforth on the feast of saint john the baptist a tribute of he looked around at the rude fortress and the mean common dress of the halfstarved inhabitants and the grim determination he saw on their faces and made his decision a tribute of one good longbow and a sheaf of arrows to be presented to the royal court at londein and given over to the care of the chief justiciar merian gasped with joy and tuck who caught most of what was said chuckled and told the others standing round about oh bran breathed merian giving brans shoulder a squeeze tuck relayed the terms to the grellon and all those looking on the king has decided to be generous baron neufmarche and the king exchanged a brief word and the baron said king william will accept the release of his sheriff now he summoned the knights forward and de glanville was marched to the table as a token of the peace we have sworn between us i release him to your authority said bran he motioned to his champion standing behind friar tuck iwan cut him loose the big warrior stepped forward and grinning with good pleasure at the astonishing turn events had taken drew the knife from his belt and began cutting through the bonds at the sheriff s wrists the rawhide straps fell away and with a sweep of his hand iwan indicated that the prisoner was free to go as iwan replaced the knife and made to step back de glanville snatched the dagger from his belt and leaped forward in the same swift movement he drew back his hand and prepared to plunge the dagger into brans unprotected neck the naked blade flashed forward and down tuck saw the arcing glint hard in the bright sunlight and gave out a yelp of warning iwan startled put out his hand but it was too late the knife slashed down a killing stroke then even as the cruel blade descended to its mark the sheriff s hand faltered and appeared to seize in its forward sweep halted it hovered in midstroke the knife point quivered then fell to the ground it happened so fast that almost no one saw what had arrested the knife until sheriff de glanville let out a shriek of agony and crumpled to his knees only slowly as if in a dream did the stunned onlookers discover will scarlet standing over the sheriff his own hand clamped tight over de glanvilles he gave the captured hand a squeeze and there was a meaty crunch and pop as the sheriff s fingers gave way de glanville gave out a roar of pain and anger and swung at scarlet with his free hand tuck snatching the crosier from bishop asaphs hand grasped it like a quarterstaff and swung it once around his head and brought it down with a solid thump on the top of the sheriff s head de glanville crumpled to the ground where he lay on his side whimpering and cradling his broken fingers stand him up commanded william with an airy wave of his hand turning to bran he spoke with some sincerity his majesty offers heartfelt apologies neufmarche translated he asks what you would like him to do with the rogue i will leave that to scarlet replied bran looking to will for an answer broken fingers are a long and painful reminder of a mans failure replied the forester as i should know i am satisfied if he takes that away with himso long as we never have to see him again thats a far sight more mercy than he deserves said bran and more than he ever showed you will and is my husband not the better man said noin taking wills arm brans decision was delivered to king william who merely grunted this man is no longer one of my sheriffs remove him from our sight then rising he held out his hand to one of his knights your sword he said the knight drew his blade and handed it to the king who turned to bran he spoke and indicated a place on the ground before him his majesty is saying that he must leave now if he is to reach normandie in time to collect his tribute baron neufmarche explained he says there is but one more thing he must do before he goes sire said bran again the king spoke and indicated the place on the ground at his feet he says you are to kneel and swear your fealty to him said neufmarche bran called bishop asaph to him father will you see that it is done properly of course rhi bran said the old man it will be an honour as the bishop took his place beside king william bran knelt and stretched out his hand to grasp the kings foot william holding the sword upright in both hands directed his newest vassal in the ageold ceremony which bound man to lord and lord to king bishop asaph lofted his crosier and offered a prayer to seal the vow and the simple rite was concluded william touched the edge of the sword to the back of brans neck and told him to rise you are now my liegeman and i am your liege lord the king told him and merian standing near interpreted rule your realm in peace as god gives you strength in the strength of god replied bran i will as he said those words he felt merian slip her hand into his and then he was caught up in the tremendous sea wave of acclamation that rose up from the longsuffering folk of elfael whose joy at seeing their king triumphant could not be contained king william called for his horse to be brought and his men to depart we will meet again no doubt he said on the feast of saint john the baptist replied bran rule well and wisely said the king in english he searched the crowd for a face and found it and see you keep this man close to your throne he said pulling tuck forward he has done you good service if not for him there would be no peace to celebrate this day in truth your majesty said bran i will keep him with me always that night rhi bran ap brychan celebrated his return to the throne with the first of what would become many days of feasting song and merriment and went to sleep in his own bed and though in the days ahead he would often return to the greenwood to visit angharads grave and tell his wise banfaith how his kingdom fared he never spent another night in the forest so long as he lived epilogue nottingham rumour had it that king john had come north to hunt in the royal forest at sherwood his majesty was lodged with high sheriff wendeval in the old castle on the mound overlooking the river thomas adale following the royal progress had come to nottingham hoping for a chance to perform for the king and add a royal endorsement to his nameand a handsome fee to his slack purse as he walked along the dirt track humming to himself he recalled the last time he had been here it was with his father when he was a boy learning the family trade as he remembered he had juggled while his father played the psaltery and sang the songs that made his family a fair living thomas remembered nottingham as a goodsized city with a lively market and plenty of people from whom to draw the crowds a minstrel required passing quickly through the town now he saw that the market was just opening and merchants beginning to set out their wares including a pie man who carried his steaming gold treasures on a long plank from the bakery oven to his stall the aroma brought the water to thomass mouth and he felt the pinch in his empty stomach still hungry as he was he did not dally he marched straightaway to the castle and presented himself at the gate god bless you right well sir he addressed the gateman is the lord of the manor at home he is replied the grizzled veteran controlling the castle entrance a man with one eye and one hand both lost in some nameless battle or other not that it is any business of yourn oh replied thomas lightly that is where you mistake me sir i am a minstrel thomas adale by name ive performed before the crowned heads of many a land and now ive come to entertain the lord high sheriff and the king what makes you think the king is here queried the gateman sizing up the wanderer with a long oneeyed appraisal that is all the talk of the countryside answered thomas you can hear it anywhere do you believe everthing you hear and do you believe everything you see countered thomas producing a silver penny from his purse he held it up between thumb and finger for a moment before placing it on his eye squinting to hold the coin in place he showed both hands empty palms out then with a shout he clapped his hands and the coin vanished the gateman gave a snort of mild amusement and said wheres it gone then by way of reply thomas opened his mouth and showed the silver penny on his tongue thats a goodun that the old man chuckled you have more o those japes simlar as many as you like said thomas and more of these too he added offering the man the penny for a fella who speaks a good word of me to his lordships steward tonight i reckon im that fella answered the porter plucking the penny from the young mans fingers you come back at eensong bell and youll find a welcome good man until then replied thomas god be good to you sir having secured his employment he returned to the town square and found a place to sit while he watched the market folk when the first rush of activity was overthe wives and maids of wealthier households first in line to buy the best on offerthe market assumed a more placid easygoing air people took time to exchange news and gossip to quench their thirst at the tavern keepers ale vat and to more casually examine the contents of the various booths and stalls lining the square thomas pulled his psaltery from its bag on his back and began tuning the strings humming to himself to get his voice limbered and ready then slinging the strap around his neck he strolled among the marketgoers plucking the strings and singing snatches of the most fashionable tunes one by one folk stopped to listen and when he had gathered enough of an audience he cried who would like to hear the tale of wizard merlyn and the dragon king a clamour went up from the throng i sing all the better with the sweet clink of silver in my ear he placed his hat on the ground before him and strummed the psaltery in a moment the chink of coins did ring out as people pitched bits of pennies and even whole coins into the minstrels hat when he reckoned he had got all there was to get he began the song a spirited and very broad tale with many humorous and unflattering allusions to the present reign thinly disguised as the antics of king arthurs court when he finished he thanked his patrons scooped up his hat and made his way to a quiet place to count his takings he had managed three penceenough for a pie or two which he bought leaving the market he strolled down to the river to find a shady spot to eat and rest he took from his bag an apple he had found in the ditch and ate that along with his pork pie having slept badly in the hedge beside the road the night before he napped through the warm afternoon waiting for the long summer day to fade at the appointed time thomas roused himself washed in the river gave his clothes a good brushing combed his hair and proceeded up the track to the castle once more where he was admitted and led to the great hall the meal was already in progress but it would be a while yet before the crowd was ready to be entertained he found a quiet corner and settled back to wait snatching bits of bread and cheese meat and sweets from the platters that went past him he ate and tried to get the measure of his audience in the centre of the high table resplendent in blue silk sat king john called lackland by his subjectsnot well liked but then truth be told few monarchs ever were while still alive johns chief misfortune seemed to be that he was not his brother richard called coeur de lion the lionhearted king was better regardedperhaps because he had hardly ever set foot in england during his entire reign and where richard was remembered as tall and robust john was a squat thicknecked man with heavy shoulders and a spreading paunch beneath his tightstretched silks his best years were behind him to be sure there was silver showing among the long dark locks that his shapeless hat could not hide the high sheriff lord william wendeval was a bluff old champion who was said to rule his patch with an authority even the king himself could not claim he was a tall rangy fellow with long limbs and a narrow horsy face and short grey curls beneath his hat of soft green velvet the king and his sheriff had been drinking some time it would seem for both men wore the rosy blush of the vine across cheeks and nose and both laughed louder and longer than any of the revellers around them slowly the meal progressed as the many dishes and platters circulated around the tables musicians trooped into the hall and sent a fine commotion coursing among the throng at table this thomas considered a good sign as players always gave an evenings roister a more festive air when men enjoyed themselves the money flowed more easily and never more easily than when they were in a celebratory mood he watched and waited listening to the happy clatter around him and idly tuning the strings of his instrument and when he judged the time to be right he rose and walked to the high table my lords and ladies all he cried aloud to make himself heard above the raucous revel a songster a songster hear shouted the high sheriff rising from his chair and pounding on the board with the pommel of his knife hear him hear him we have a minstrel in our midst when the hall had sufficiently quieted thomas faced the high table and with a wide sweep of his hat bowed low his nose almost touching his knee my lord high sheriff my best regards he said he bowed again lower still and said your majesty i beg the honour of your attention on this splendid festal evening turning to the rest of the company he waved his arm my lords and ladies gentlefolk all it is my good pleasure to sing for your amusement what will you sing called the sheriff resuming his seat tonight i have prepared a special surprise right worthy of this splendid occasionbut more of that anon i will begin with a tune that is sure to please your majesty he began strumming and soon the hall was ringing to the strains of a song called the knight and the elf queens daughter it was an old song and most minstrels knew it though not the most taxing on a songsters abilities it had a soothing effect on a restive audience and made a good prelude to better things the song concluded and the last strains were still lingering in the air when thomas began the lay known as the wooing of ygrainalso a firm favourite among the nobility what with its themes of flirtation and forbidden love he sang two more short songs and then pausing to retune his psaltery he announced majesty lord sheriff distinguished lords and ladies hearken to me now tonight in your hearing for the first time anywhere i give you a song of my own composinga stirring epic of adventure and intrigue of kingdoms lost and won and love most fair and wondrous i give you the ballad of brave rhiban hud in fact it was not strictly speaking the first time he had sung this song he had laboured over its verses true but in the main it remained much as it had been composed by his grandfather and sung by his father indeed the song had earned his familys reputation and never failed to find favour with an audience so long as the singer took care to adapt it to his listeners dropping in names of the local worthies the places nearby that local folk knew any particular features of the countryside and its peopleit all helped to create a sense of instant recognition for those he entertained and flattered his patrons thomas strummed the opening notes of the song and then lifting his head sang come listen a while you gentlefolk alle that stand here this bower within a tale of brave rhiban the hud i purpose now to begin the song began well and proceeded through its measured course pulling the audience into the tale very soon the listeners were deep in the singers thrall the various lines drawing by turns cheers and cries of outrage as events unfolded thomas knowing full well that he had captured them proceeded to bind his audience with the strong cadences of the song for tonights performance the tale was set in nottingham and the forest was sherwood william rufus and the welsh march and richard de glanville never received a mention tonight the king of the tale was john and the sheriff none other than sheriff wendeval himself it was a risky change of castnoble hosts had been known to take umbrage at a minstrels libertiesbut thomas perceived the mood was light and everyone thrilled to the daring of it god save the king quod rhiban to he and them that wish him full well and he that does his true sovereign deny i wish him with satan to dwell quod the king thine own tongue hast cursed thyself for i know what thou verily art thou brigand and thief by those treasonous words i swear that thou lyest in heart no ill have i done thee quod rhiban to king in thought or in word or in deed better ive served than the abbots foule men who robbed from them in sore need and never i yet have any man hurt that honest is and true only those that their honour give up to live on another mans due i never harmed the husbandman that works to till the ground nor robbed from those that range the wood and hunt with hawk or hound but the folk you appointed to rule my stead the clergymen shire reeves and knights have stolen our homes and impoverishd our kin and denyd us whats ours by full rights the good king withdrew to consider the case and did with his counsellors sit in very short time they had come to agree on a ruling all saw justlie fit king bran thenceforward full pardon shall have by order of royal decree and the lands that his fathers and grandsires kept have no other ruler than he quod rhiban praise christ this suits me full goode and well it becomes of us both for kings must be eer protecting their folk so hereby we swear you our troth and vow we this day to the end of the earth shall grief neer come tween us twain and the glory of rhiban hud eke his king ithis worldsrealm always shall reign thomas led the crowd a merry chase through the greenwood and the exploits of the noble rogue rhiban and his struggle to regain his birthright justice denied and at last redeemed was a theme that always swayed an english crowd and it seemed now as if he played upon the very heartstrings of his audience as blithely as he plucked the psaltery both king and sheriff listened with rapt expressions there were occasional sighs from the ladies and grunts of approval from the men deeper and deeper did the spell become recounting those days long agotimes all but forgotten now but kept alive in his song inevitably stanza gave way to stanza and the song moved to its end and thomas singing for his king as he had rarely sung before delivered the final lines the seasons pass quickly in the realm of king bran as seasons of joye always do john and will scadlocke many children now owne and each have another past due strong sons and fayre daughters to them and their wyves the good lord upon them has blest but the fairest and strongest and smartest who is none of them eer has guessd and rhiban the hud now feasts in his hall for married now has he beene and summer has settled in clear peaceful lands for merian reigns as his queene but we see not the fryer who wedded them two what has become him his luck lo newly installed in the bishopric there is one bishop fryer tuck good gentlefolk all we have finished our laye a song of brave rhi bran the hud taking only from others what never was theirs he restored his land to the good but one final ride has our rhiban to make before his and our paths shall part see he has outlived his queene and his friends and bears he within a sadde heart he rides on his steede with a bow by his side much as he has done of olde his long hair is white and his eyesight is weak but he calls in a voice strong and bold once again o my fine merrye men we shall in the greenwood meet and there well make our bowstrings twang a music for us very sweet authors note the high cost of heaven and so the legend grew extending its reach far beyond the place and time of its birth not only did it travel it changed in the telling as poets singers and wandering storytellers the likes of alan adale and grandson thomas charmed their audiences by adjusting their tales to more closely conform to current local tastes rhi bran y hud the british freedom fighter may have faded in the processtransformed at last into robin hood the loveable outlawbut the legend endured and still delights some readers may bridle at the central premise of this series that a scant handful of homegrown volunteer warriors could successfully stand against the combined might of an entire army of heavily fortified professional soldiers as unlikely as it seems this exact scenario was repeated time and again in british history one of the best examples took place in in what has become famous as the battle of agincourt not only did a vastly inferior british force confront the best and boldest knights of france on a muddy farm field a stones throw away from the little northern town but the beleaguered british dealt them a blow never to be forgotten henrys ragged nohope army was largely made up of volunteers and vassals most of them sick with dysentery and exhausted from a summerlong campaign in miserable weather harried and hopelessly outnumbered they prepared to face the flower of french nobility a few miles from agincourt the french army under king charles vis commander constable dalbert numbered in excess of twenty thousand men mostly knights opposing them king henry v commanded around six thousand ragged and starving menbut of those five thousand were archers and most of them welsh on that bright saint crispins day in october the great french army was massacred accounts of the battle read like a what not to do handbook of combat the french produced blunder after blunder in bewildering array so many as to be almost literally incredible even so it would have taken a military miracle for french horsemounted knights to succeed when by some estimates upwards of seventytwo thousand arrows were loosed in the first fateful minute of the conflict of this devastating power historian philip warner writes fear of the longbow swept through france its deadly longrange destruction made it seem an almost supernatural weapon prayers against it were offered in churches at the time this was a last resort for nothing else came close to stopping it britains losses that day in the fields of agincourt numbered around one hundredand many of those were noncombatants unarmed defenceless baggage boys and chaplains who were slaughtered out of extreme frustration by the alreadybeaten french who attacked the supply wagons encamped a mile or so from the battle field on the other side of the equation the french lost around two thousand counts barons and dukes well over three thousand knights and menatarms and more than one thousand common soldiers for a tally in excess of six thousand dead these numbers are conservative some accounts of the time estimate that as many as twelve thousand were killed or captured that day in any event it was a defeat so devastating that it would be a generation or more before france could regain its military confidence against the british as military historian sir charles oman put it that unarmoured men should prevail against men cased with mail and plate on plain open ground was reckoned one of the marvels of the age decisive as it may have been agincourt was not by a very long shot the first battle to be decided by the longbow nor would it be the last but it was perhaps the most powerful demonstration of a now littleremembered law of medieval combatnamely that when two opposing forces met those with the most archers would invariably win a sort of corollary stated that when both sides boasted roughly the same number of archers the side with the most welsh archers would win such was the highly recognized talent of the cymry with the longbow and their renowned fighting spirit as we are once again reminded by the british chronicle of the saxon kings the brenhinedd y saesson the men of brycheiniog and the men of gwent and the men of gwynllwg rebelled against the oppression of the ffreinc and then the ffreinc moved their host into gwent and they gained no profit thereby but many were slain in the place called celli garnant thereupon soon after that they went with their host into brycheiniog and they gained no profit thereby but they were slain by the sons of idnerth ap cadwgan namely gruffydd and ifor this rebellion provoked a reaction in that year king william rufus mustered a host past number against the cymry but the cymry trusted in god with their prayers and fastings and alms and penances and placed their hope in god and they harassed their foes so that the ffreinc dared not go into the woods or the wild places but traversed the open lands sorely fatigued and thence returned home emptyhanded and thus the cymry defended their land with joy it was precisely this fierce and tenacious spirit that the normans faced in their illadvised invasion of wales the unrivalled talent with the longbowthough born in the forests and valleys of waleswas honed to lethal perfection in the white heat of contention following william iis decision to extend the dubious benefits of his reign beyond the march it was a decision which sparked a conflict that was to sputter and flare for the next two hundred years or more and provided the fertile ground from which sprang the legends featuring that shrewd archer robin hood wily welsh archers were not the only plague in williams life however he also suffered from that acute affliction of his time fear of purgatory like a great many prominent menwilliam rufus found himself in continual debt to the church paying out huge sums of money for prayers to be said for the departed under his purview all throughout the middle ages abbeys and monasteries large and small did a roaring trade in penitential prayer employing their priests on a perpetual roundtheclock basis the holy brothers prayed for their patrons and their patrons families of course and also for the souls of those unfortunates their patrons might have killed for the right fee the local abbot could guarantee that the requisite time in purgatory would be shortened or even excused altogether and no one would have to suffer eternal damnation quaint as it might seem today buying and selling prayers for cash was a business conducted in dead earnest at the time for it would be difficult to overestimate the fear of hell and its attendant horrors for the medieval mind as tangible proof of this deepseated and widespread phobia the abbeys rose stone by ornately carved stone to dominate the medieval landscape of europe these beautifully wrought works of art can still be visited a thousand years later belief made physically manifest though greatly reduced in every way now all through the middle ages the monasteries amassed enormous wealth on the exchange of prayer for silver becoming ever more powerful extending their influence into all areas of medieval life and commerce it was to be their downfall in the end for when the wealth and power grew so massive as to exceed that of the monarchy the threatened kings fought back for william ii bucking the trend was not an option he was caught in the stifling embrace of a system he could neither control nor ignore he was not the last monarch to discover that the need for money to pay his debt to the church would intrude on if not dictate his political agenda decisions of polity often bowed before the expediency of keeping the clergy cheerfuleven in weightier matters such as war and peace the medieval king might not like it but more often than not he swallowed his resentment and did what was necessary to pay up whoever said heaven would come cheap keep reading for an excerpt of the paradise war book one in the song of albion trilogy available in bookstores everywhere chapter an aurochs in the works it all began with the aurochs we were having breakfast in our rooms at college simon was presiding over the table with his accustomed critique on the world as evidenced by the mornings paper oh splendid he sniffed it looks as if we have been invaded by a pack of freeloading foreign photographers keen on exposing their filmand who knows what elseto the exotic delights of dear old blighty lock up your daughters bognor regis european paparazzi are loose in the land he rambled on awhile and then announced hold on have a gawk at this he snapped the paper sharp and sat up straightan uncommon posture for simon gawk at what i asked idly this thing of hisreading the paper aloud to a running commentary of facile contempt scorn and sarcasm well mixed and peppered with his own unique blend of cynicismhad long since ceased to amuse me i had learned to grunt agreeably while eating my egg and toast this saved having to pay attention to his tirades eloquent though they often were some bewildered scotsman has found an aurochs in his patch you dont say i dipped a corner of toast triangle into the molten center of a softboiled egg and read an item about a disgruntled driver on the london underground refusing to stop to let off passengers thereby compelling a train full of frantic commuters to ride the circle line for over five hours thats interesting apparently the beast wandered out of a nearby wood and collapsed in the middle of a hay field twenty miles or so east of inverness simon lowered the paper and gazed at me over the top did you hear what i just said every word wandered out of the forest and fell down next to invernessprobably from boredom i replied i know just how he felt simon stared at me dont you realize what this means it means that the local branch of the rspca gets a phone call big deal i took a sip of coffee and returned to the sports page before me i wouldnt call it news exactly you dont know what an aurochs is do you he accused you havent a clue a beast of some sortyou said so yourself just now i protested really simon the papers you read i flicked his upraised tabloid with a disdainful finger look at these socalled headlines princess linked to alien sex scheme and shock horror weekend for bishop with massage parlor turk honestly you only read those rags to fuel your pessimism he was not moved you havent the slightest notion what an aurochs is go on lewis admit it i took a wild stab its a breed of pig nice try simon tossed his head back and laughed he had a nasty little foxbark that he used when he wanted to deride someones ignorance simon was extremely adept at derisiona master of disdain mockery and ridicule in general i refused to be drawn i returned to my paper and stuffed the toast into my mouth a pig is that what you said he laughed again okay okay what pray tell is an aurochs professor rawnson simon folded the paper in half and then in quarters he creased it and held it before me an aurochs is a sort of ox why think of that i gasped in feigned astonishment an ox you say it fell down oh my what wont they think of next i yawned give me a break put like that it doesnt sound like much simon allowed then he added only it just so happens that this particular ox is an iceage creature which has been extinct for the last two thousand years extinct i shook my head slowly where do they get this malarkey if you ask me the only thing thats extinct around here is your native skepticism it seems the last aurochs died out in britain sometime before the romans landedalthough a few may have survived on the continent into the sixth century or so fascinating i replied simon shoved the folded paper under my nose i saw a grainy badly printed photo of a huge black mound that might or might not have been mammalian in nature standing next to this illdefined mass was a grimlooking middleaged man holding a very long curved object in his hands roughly the size and shape of an oldfashioned scythe the object appeared to be attached in some way to the black bulk beside him how bucolic a man standing next to a manure heap with a farm implement in his hands how utterly homespun i scoffed in a fair imitation of simon himself that manure heap as you call it is the aurochs and the implement in the farmers hands is one of the animals horns i looked at the photo again and could almost make out the animals head below the great slope of its shoulders judging by the size of the horn the animal would have been enormouseasily three or four times the size of a normal cow trick photography i declared simon clucked his tongue i am disappointed in you lewis so cynical for one so young you dont actually believe thisi jabbed the paper with my fingerthis trumpedup tripe do you they make it up by the yardmanufacture it by the carload well simon admitted picking up his teacup and gazing into it youre probably right you bet im right i crowed prematurely as it turned out i should have known better still it wouldnt hurt to check it out he lifted the cup swirled the tea and drained it then as if his mind were made up he placed both hands flat on the tabletop and stood i saw the sly set of his eyes it was a look i knew well and dreaded you cant be serious but i am perfectly serious forget it come on it will be an adventure ive got a meeting with my adviser this afternoon thats more than enough adventure for me i want you with me simon insisted what about susannah i countered i thought you were supposed to meet her for lunch susannah will understand he turned abruptly well take my car no really listen simon we cant go chasing after this ox thing its ridiculous its nothing its like those fairy rings in the cornfields that had everybody all worked up last year its a hoax besides i cant goive got work to do and so have you a drive in the country will do you a world of good fresh air clear the cobwebs nourish the inner man he walked briskly into the next room i could hear him dialing the phone and a moment later he said listen susannah about today terribly sorry dear heart somethings come up yes just as soon as i get back later yes sunday i wont forget cross my heart and hope to die cheers he replaced the receiver and dialed again rawnson here ill be needing the car this morning fifteen minutes right thanks awfully simon i shouted i refuse this is how i came to be standing in st aldates on a rainy friday morning in the third week of michaelmas term drizzle dripping off my nose waiting for simons car to be brought around wondering how he did it we were both graduate students simon and i we shared rooms in fact but where simon had only to whisper into the phone and his car arrived when and where he wanted it i couldnt even get the porter to let me lean my poor battered bicycle against the gate for half a minute while i checked my mail rank hath its privileges i guess nor did the gulf between us end there while i was little above medium height with a build that before the mirror could only be described as weedy simon was tall and regally slim well muscled yet trimthe build of an olympic fencer the face i displayed to the world boasted plain somewhat lumpen features crowned with a lackluster mat the color of old walnut shells simons features were sharp well cut and clean he had the kind of thick dark curly hair women admire and openly covet my eyes were mouse gray his were hazel my chin drooped his jutted the effect when we appeared in public together was i imagine much in the order of a live beforeandafter advertisement for natures own wonder vitamins amp handsome tonic he had good looks to burn and the sort of rugged and ruthless masculinity both sexes find appealing i had the kind of looks that often improve with age although it was doubtful that i should live so long a lesser man would have been jealous of simons bounteous good fortune however i accepted my lot and was content all right i was jealous toobut it was a very contented jealousy anyway there we were the two of us standing in the rain traffic whizzing by buses disgorging soggy passengers on the busy pavement around us and me muttering in lame protest this is dumb its stupid its childish and irresponsible thats what it is its nuts youre right of course he agreed affably rain pearled on his driving cap and trickled down his waxedcotton shooting jacket we cant just drop everything and go racing around the
