the bone house stephen lawhead previously our story thus far concerns an underemployed but agreeable young fellow named cosimo christopher livingstone who much prefers to go by the name of kit he is related by birth to an anachronistic old gentleman named cosimo who is in fact his longlost greatgrandfather long lost in that owing to circumstances arising from the phenomenon known as ley travel about which more later he disappeared more than a hundred years or so ago while on a routine visit to the local shops cosimos return was greeted by kit with disbelief astonishment and chagrin the elder relations insistence that kit should accompany him on a quest of great significance was rebuffed and after a fleeting taste of this heretofore unheard of ley travel kit retreated to the arms of his unpleasant girlfriend wilhelmina klug due to the time drift involved in ley journeys he arrived quite late for a longpromised shopping excursion when the explanation for his tardiness failed to convince this young woman kit endeavoured to provide her with a practical demonstration owing to his inexperience the demo went horribly wrong and poor wilhelmina was lost in the transition however kit was found once more by cosimo who introduced him to a stalwart colleague by the name of sir henry fayth together the three of them set out to find wilhelmina and return her to her proper place and time laudable as their concern may have been it ultimately proved misplaced wilhelmina landed on her feet in seventeenthcentury prague where she was befriended by a kindly soul named engelbert etzel stiffelbeam a baker from rosenheim who had travelled to bohemia to seek his fortune the two joined forces and opened a bakery the success of which remained elusive until they introduced an asyetunheardof commodity to the capital coffee the grand imperial kaffeehaus was an immediate success and soon all of old prague was abuzz over the latest sensation the coffeehouse brought wilhelmina into contact with members of the court of emperor rudolf ii and among these a coterie of alchemists who were dutifully employed in the pursuit of arcane studies in what is to this day known as the magick court now we come to the concept of ley travel or ley leaping as lady fayth sir henrys mercurial niece is wont to call it ley travel consists of utilising or manipulating lines of electromagnetic force that are to be found embedded in the earth thereby employing these lines of force by methods yet to be described by science to effect great leaps in not only distance but dimensional reality and consequently time as well the reader is asked to bear in mind that ley travel is not the same as time travel strictly speaking although it must be admitted that owing to the fact that time is relative to the reality being visited ley travellers do come unstuck in time which leads to a sort of chronological dislocationan unavoidable side effect of ley leaping it would be pleasant to report that all times everywhere in the universe are the same and that each reality links up perfectly endtoend but that is not the case for reasons described below each separate reality has its own history and progression in its own time thus travelling to a different dimension involves a sideways slip in time as well as place but that is not the same as travelling backwards or forwards along a single timeline in a discrete reality how many ley lines there are and where they lead nobody really knows nor is it known how they are produced or why but one man knew more than most the explorer arthur flinderspetrie an intrepid soul who made countless trips to other worlds and meticulously recorded his discoveries on a map so that he could always find his way home again and so that he could never be separated from his map he had it tattooed onto his torso in the form of coded symbolsnot the most original plan of course but highly effective and productive too in that it allowed him to meet and marry his chinese tattooists charming daughter xianli arthur shared with his new wife his passion for exploration introducing her to the arcane secrets of ley travel on one such early trip to egypt tragedy struck in the form of nile fever and the stricken xianli succumbed and died at some later time arthur died also and in order that his discoveries should not die with him the map was removed and carefully preserved for among the many wonders he encountered in his travels there was one that was so amazing so staggeringly important that arthur kept it a closeguarded secret from all but his nearest and dearest kin through circumstances yet to be explained the map was divided into sections and those sections scattered across the multiverse happily the skin map and its tantalising secret endure flinderspetrie has a nemesisarchelaeus burleigh the earl of sutherlandan unscrupulous dastard who is wholly obsessed with possessing the map and learning its secrets he and his nefarious crew will stop at nothing to discover the treasure at the end of our first instalment of this tale kit and his companion giles were facing imminent demise in the tomb of anen at the hands of lord burleighthe same tomb that had already claimed the lives of dear old cosimo and sir henry wilhelmina whose presence in the chase had been understated up to that point made a sudden and welcome appearanceall the more so because lady fayth had proved too fickle loyalty it seems is a rare and precious commodity in whichever reality one occupies with those things remembered we return to our story in which some things are best forgotten part one the book of forbidden secrets chapter in which some things are best forgotten from a snug in the corner of the museum tavern douglas flinderspetrie dipped a sop of bread into the gravy of his steak and kidney pudding and watched the entrance to the british museum across the street the great edifice was dark the building closed to the public for over three hours the employees had gone home the charwomen had finished their cleaning and the high iron gates were locked behind them the courtyard was empty and outside the gates there were fewer people on the street now than an hour ago he felt no sense of urgency only keen anticipation which he savoured as he took another draught of london pride he had spent most of the afternoon in the museum once more marking the doors and exits the blind spots the rooms where a person might hide and remain unseen by the night watchmen of which there were but three to cover the entire acreage of the sprawling institution douglas knew from his researches that at eleven each night the head watchman retired to his office on the ground floor to make tea he would be duly joined by his two underling guards and the three would enter their observations in the logbook and then spend an enjoyable thirty minutes drinking their tea eating pies and exchanging gossip while they were thus occupied he would strike the pub was quiet tonight even for a damp thursday in late november there were only five other patrons in the place three at the rail and two at tables he would have preferred more peopleif only so his own presence would not be so noticeablebut he doubted it would make much difference in any event there was nothing he could do about it everything all right sir douglas turned from the window and looked up the landlord having little to do this evening was making the rounds and chatting with his customers never better replied douglas in a tone he hoped would dismiss further intrusion but the man remained hovering over the table mr flinderspetrie is it not sir indeed so he offered a bland smile to cover his annoyance at being recognised on this night of all nights i fear you have me at a disadvantage i was not aware that my name would be common knowledge the landlord chuckled no i suppose not but do you not recognise me sir douglas looked more closely at him there was a vague familiarity about the fellow but no he could not place him cumberbatch sir the landlord volunteered i worked for your father i did oh quite a few years ago at douglas dubious expression he said i was his footmansilas silas certainly i remember you douglas lied do forgive me yes of course now that you remind me course i was younger then and you were away at school and university and whatnot the landlord wiped his hands on the towel around his waist and smoothed it out as if this put the matter to rest happy days they were yes yes agreed douglas amiably he was aware that the other patrons were watching them and actually relieved now that the place was not more crowded happy times indeed pardon my asking sir said cumberbatch leaning nearer the table he lowered his voice if you dont mind theres something that ive always wanted to know id be most obliged id be happy to help if i can silas what is it did they ever find the man who killed your father to buy himself a little space to think douglas took a drink of his ale then placing the glass carefully on the table said i am sorry to say they never did oh dear oh dear cumberbatch shook his head thats a right pity did they never have a suspicion then suspicions yes replied douglas but nothing more the coroners verdict at the time of the inquest reads unlawful killing by person or persons unknown at this late date i fear it is likely to remain a mystery ah dear me sighed cumberbatch that is a shame that is he was a good man your fathera very decent chap if you dont mind my saying a solid and upright fellowalways treated me well and thats a fact that is yes well as you say it was all a long time ago perhaps it is best forgotten no doubt sir im with you there cumberbatch brightened once more but it is good to see you mr flinderspetrie here now can i get you another pint thank you but no i on the house sirfor old times sake it would please me no end very well then thank you silas i would enjoy that coming right up sir the landlord beetled off to pull the pint douglas drew his pocketwatch from his waistcoat and flipped it open it was half past nine in another hour he would make his move until then he had a warm place to wait and watch the landlord returned with his pint and after another brief exchange he was left alone to finish it and his meal in peace it was after ten thirty when he finally rose and promising to return for another visit next time he was in the neighbourhood retrieved his black cape from the coatrack and went out into the mist and drizzle the weather was perfect for his purposesa miserable night meant fewer folk around to notice any peculiar comings and goings the gas lamps hissed and fluttered pale orbs that did little to cut the allpervading fog perfect he smiled to himself as he walked to the corner of montague street turned and proceeded along the side of the museum to where the service alley joined the street at the rear of the building there he paused to observe the street one last time a lone hansom cab rattled away in the opposite direction and two men in top hats staggered alongone in the gutter the other on the pavementoblivious of their surroundings singing their way home from an evenings celebration satisfied he ducked into the alleyway and hurried quickly and unerringly in the dark to the back of a town house opposite the rear of the museum there lying in the lane beside the house was the wooden ladder with swift efficiency he placed it against the high iron railing climbed to the top of the fence balanced on the upper bar while he pulled over the ladder then climbed down once on the ground he hurried to a window near the corner of the enormous building where even the lowest windows were eight feet off the ground positioning the ladder he climbed up and rapped on the glass counted to ten and then rapped again as he finished the second tap the window slid open from inside and a pale face round like a solemn little moon appeared in the darkness of the opening well done snipe said douglas hand me in the stocky boy reached out and with strong arms pulled his master through the open window now then said douglas drawing a small tin from his pocket he flipped open the lid and shook out a few congreves selected one and swiped the head against the roughened top of the tin the slender stick of soft pine erupted with a pop and spluttering red flame the lantern snipe the youth held up a small paraffin lamp douglas raised the glass and touched the match to the wick then lowered the glass and waved the spent stick in the air to cool it before placing it back in the tin let us be about our business by lanterns glow they made their way through the darkened stacks of the smirke bequesta small shelflined chamber off the great cavernous hall of the reading room this cosy enclave was given to certain exceptional volumes from the libraries of wealthy patrons who had donated or bequeathed their collections to the national archive for the general benefit of their fellow men this evergrowing collection housed a particular volume that had long eluded douglas flinderspetrie it was this book he had come to acquire the rare books room as it was more commonly known was strictly forbidden to all but the most eminent scholars and then entry was granted only in the company of the keeper of antiquities or one of his assistants who would unlock the chain at the doorwaythere was no door so that the books could be viewed from a distance even if they could not be perusedand usher the chosen one into the inner sanctum white cotton gloves were to be worn at all times in the room and no one was permitted to remain alone in the stacks at any time whatsoever douglas having observed this exacting protocol on his survey trips to the museum decided to forego the formalities and visit the room outside of public hours it had then been a matter of finding a place for snipe to hide until well after closing a storage cupboard in room on the upper floor was adequate to the purpose and so during a lateafternoon viewing of the nineveh alabasters douglas had deposited his able servant in the closet with a cold pie and an apple to wait until the clock in saint bartholomews chimed eleven at the appointed hour snipe had crawled out and made his way down to the rare books room to let douglas in through the window so far so good go to the door and keep watch douglas commanded directing the glow of the lantern towards the nearer stacks as the servant moved to the doorway douglas began scanning the shelves the books he quickly discovered were arranged in a loose chronological orderno doubt owing to their primary interest as artefacts rather than for the value of their contents he found the proper historical period and started working down the line book by book what should have been a task of moments however dragged on far longer than he planned owing to the fact that many of the older books had no titles on their spines or covers and had to be drawn out opened and thumbed to their title pages before being placed back on the shelf he was only partway through the s when he heard a sibilant hisslike that of gas escaping from a leaky pipe he stopped held his breath waited the sound came again and was repeated he quickly turned down the lantern wick and put the lamp on the floor then hurried to the doorway where snipe stood behind the doorpost peering out into the great hall of the main reading room someone coming douglas whispered snipe nodded and held up two fingers two of them right douglas turned and retreated into the stacks follow me they crept off to the farthest corner of the room placing the main body of stacks between themselves and the door get down whispered douglas the two pressed themselves flat to the floor and waited voices drifted into the room and then footsteps could be heard as the watchmen made their rounds of the reading room shadows leapt from the stacks as one of the guards paused and shone his lantern into the room with a practised sweep then the footsteps receded and the voices resumed the watchmen were moving off thats better sighed douglas back to work the two returned to their respective places and began again midway through the s douglas found the book he was looking forexactly as he had pictured it from his researches one glimpse of the strange cipher writing and he knew he had it come to me my pretty he whispered carefully placing the light on the shelf beside him with trembling fingers douglas opened the book to reveal page after page of tightly ordered script in the most fancifullooking letters he had ever seen you little beauty he mused brushing his fingertips lightly over the script he might have spent a happy hour or so paging through the old curiosityand he wouldbut now was not the time he slipped the slim volume into an inner pocket of his cape retrieved the lantern and hurried to fetch snipe ive got it come awaytime to make good our escape they climbed out the window closing it carefully behind them and retraced their inward journey replacing the ladder at the rear of the town house opposite before walking back down the alley to montague street douglas mind was so filled with the book and the treasures it was certain to yield that he failed to see the policeman standing in the pool of light under the streetlamp emerging from the darkness of the alley like the guilty thieves they were the pair naturally drew the interest of the policeman who raising his truncheon called out well well what have we here oh gasped douglas spinning around to face the officer good evening constable you quite gave me a start did i now he looked the pair up and down his expression suggesting he did not care for what he saw might i ask why you were lurking in that alley at this time of night douglas hand went to the gun in his pocket is it that late he asked affably i hadnt realised yes i suppose it is he glanced at snipe beside him the boys lip was curled in a ferocious scowl its the lad here he offered he ran away earlier this evening and ive been looking for him ever sinceonly just found him a few minutes ago the constable frowning now stepped closer that your son then good heavens no replied douglas hes a servant im taking him home with me as if to underscore this fact he put his hand to snipes collar the policemans brow furrowed as he caught a glare of almost pure hatred playing over the boys pallid features certainly there was something odd about the youth that he could never have been mistaken for anyones beloved son i see concluded the police officer does he run away often then no no never before douglas hastily assured him there was a bit of a kerfuffle with the housekeeper you see and the lad took umbrage a simple misunderstanding i think ive straightened it out well said the policeman these things happen i suppose he returned the truncheon to the hook on his belt you best get yourselves home its high time all respectable folk were abed just what i was thinking constable a pot of cocoa and a biscuit wouldnt go amiss either i daresay douglas released his hold on the pistol but maintained his grip on the boys collar i will wish you good night douglas started away pulling the glaring snipe with him gnight sir the policeman watched them as they moved away mind how you go he called there are thieves and such about its weather like this brings em out youre not wrong there matey murmured douglas under his breath come away snipe tonight we let him live chapter in which a wander in the wilderness is good for the soul kit stood staring down the avenue of sphinxes feeling very much alone it was early yet and there was no one else around he drew the clean dry air into his lungs deeply relieved to have been rescued from looming death by wilhelminas unexpected yet timely intervention he nevertheless could not help feeling slightly bruised by her brusque manner in fact she had socked him on the arm as soon as they were free of the wadi and the tomb that had held them captive to lord burleighs whims ow kit complained he had not seen the smack coming what was that for that was for abandoning me in that alley back in london she told him that dark stinky alley in the rainstormremember i remember but it wasnt entirely my fault she smacked him again it wasnt very nice sorry kit rubbed his upper arm i forgive you she smiled then hit him once more for good measure yikes now what that is so you remember never to do it again right okay i get it im sorry and i wont desert you ever again i promise good now pay attention weve got some ground to cover and we dont have much time she had then told him about luxor and what he was to do there he had been instructed to go to the winter palace hotel and ask for a mr suleyman at the front desk upon presenting himself he would be given a parcel and a letter with further instructions wilhelmina had been very precise dont stop to think or look around hit the ground running get to the location secure the parcel it is imperative that you retrieve the package and follow the instructions to the letter why cant i go with you kit had asked we have to split up she told him the burley men will soon be on our trail and theyll follow me if you peel off now they wont knowtheyll think were all still together what about giles hes going with me if they catch up with us ill need someone to help me fight them off i could help kit insisted i dont think its a good idea to get separated where are you going anyway its best if you dont know but if i she had put a hand to his face do you trust me kit of course i trust you mina its just thati mean we only just met up i dont see why if you trust me then believe me when i sayshe pinched his cheek between her thumb and fingerwe dont have time for this discussion the ley is active now and any minute burleigh and his goons will learn of your escape when they do we must be as far away from here as possible but im not going very far kit pointed out you said i was just to go to luxorthats only a few miles away if you do exactly what i told you youll soon be in a different time zone she said pinching his cheek harder now stop fussing and just do what i say ow okay okay ill do it he rubbed his cheek i dont like it but ill do it good she released him and gave him a pat we can talk about all this once ive given them the slip and done what i have to do she smiled relax its going to be fine she started down the broken pavement towards giles who was standing guard at the end of the avenue of sphinxes just pick up the package and do what youre told she called half turning back as she walked if all goes well itll only be a few daysyour time youll be busy enough dont worry a few days said kit right no more than a week or two she hedged weeks objected kit wait a minute a month at most wilhelmina turned and hurried to join giles ive got to go ill see you kit had watched her retreating figure feeling like a child abandoned in a parking lot at the end of the paved walkway leading to the ruined temple she gathered giles taking him by the arm sir henrys former footman cast a quick glance behind to kit raised his hand in farewell then fell into step beside wilhelmina the two proceeded down the centre of the avenue passing between the double row of statues at a fair clip there was a gust of wind a swirl of dust both figures turned fuzzy and indistinctas if viewed through the combined haze of heat and dustand then they vanished altogether kit drew another breath and held it listening for sounds of pursuit but heard only the thin warble of a solitary bird on a distant cliff top satisfied that he was alone for the moment he let out his breath again still raw and reeling from the loss of cosimo and sir henry and the prospect of his own demise narrowly averted kit stood contemplating his next leap and thinking that everything was happening way too fast off to the east the sun was just breaching the ragged hill line if he did not go soon he would have to wait until evening and that would very likely be an invitation to disaster might as well get on with it he muttered to himself mina had told him to start his walk at the fifth sphinx from the end of the row and to be at full stride by the eighth ramheaded statuea distance of thirty or so paces if he had not made the crossing by the time he reached the eighth sphinx he was to stop dead in his tracks carefully retrace his steps and try again wilhelmina had been most emphatic about that making the leap at the precise spot on the avenue would bring him to the predetermined time periodgive or take a few hours days or perhaps weeks any more than that and he would be wildly off course in time if not in place as well he paced back to the appropriate sphinx at the end of the avenue farthest from the temple turned and paused to locate the eighth statue in the long double rank ready or not here i come he said and started walking briskly he felt the air quiver around him and sensed a prickling on his skin the wind gusted sharply as he approached the designated statue stepping up his pace he drew abreast of the eighth ramheaded statue and braced himself for the transition nothing happened against all natural inclination he forced himself to stop as instructed by wilhelmina terrific he turned stepped off the ley and hurried back to the starting place second time lucky he muttered and strode off again once again he felt the nowfamiliar tingle on his skin as when just before a lightning strike the air becomes electrically charged the wind gusted driving fine grit into his eyes which instantly started watering so that he had difficulty seeing where he was going he must have unconsciously slowed a step because he reached the eighth sphinx and still had not made the leap bugger he muttered had he lost the knack the thought that he might be stuck in s egypt with the burley men on his tail did not bear thinking about so he dashed back to the starting point and took his place putting his toes to an imaginary line lowering his head like a sprinter awaiting the gun he muttered third time lucky and shot off this time with a determination absent from the first two attempts he willed himself to leap perhaps it was this heightened resolve that turned the trick for upon approaching the eighth sphinx he felt the air quiver the ground beneath his feet trembled and the world around him grew dim and indistinct but only for the briefest of instantsthe merest blink of an eye he lurched forward and like a drunk who has misjudged his footing tottered dizzily for a few steps before righting himself and stopping when his head cleared he found himself standing almost exactly where he had been standing beforein the centre of the avenue at the eighth sphinx the temple at the end of the avenue was still a ruin and empty the ragged hills just as arid and dusty as before but the sun was now high overhead and blazing down on him with a ferocity that brought tears to his eyes the discomfort of the crossing quickly passed he noted with satisfaction that with each jump he was a little less nauseated and disoriented the first had left him dazed and confused and upchucking over his shoes this last spate of dizziness was nothing compared to that now to get himself to luxor assuming that the leap had been successful and that he was in the time zone anticipated by wilhelmina he knew in general what he had to do get to the river and follow it downstream until he came to the town which was ten miles or so as the crow flewdepending of course on the crow then he was to make his way to the hotel and collect the package simple minas letter would tell him what to do next he set off reaching the river meant working his way up and over the hillsno easy task as he soon discovered following a goat track he slowly climbed the barren slopes and was soon panting with the exertion the heat bounced off the pale rock all around scorching through his clothing sweat ran down his face and neck the fat drops raising little dust puffs with every step mina had given him a skin of water for the journey but as the heat took hold he worried that it would not be enough so he nursed it carefully taking only tiny sips of the nowwarm slightly brackish liquid to take his mind off his hike he thought about where he was going and what he might find when he got there he wondered what year it was and why he had remained in egypt when always before when using a ley the traveller ended up in a startlingly different location it probably had something to do with the length of distance travelled along the ley he decidedfor lack of any better explanation maybe that was why mina had been so adamant about making the leap between the fifth and eighth sphinxes if he had missed that mark where would he have ended up more to the point without a map how would he have found his way back that was the question finally if somewhat belatedly he was beginning to gain a more fundamental appreciation of arthur flinderspetries singular courage and the awful importance of his skin map dont leave home without it kit mused aloud to himself other questions bubbled to the surface what era had he landed in now there was no way to judge from his bleak surroundingsthe desert had not changed in a few thousand years so far as he could tell what epoch was it here was another poser how had wilhelmina found her way to rescue him and giles from pretty near certain death at the hands of burleigh and his goons she did not seem to have a mapeven a paper oneor any other sort of guide how had she accomplished this feat more to the point how had she become such an expert on ley travel the last time kit had seen his former girlfriend she had been bawling in a london alley as a freak storm drenched her head to heel they had been separated then he went one place and she ended up who knew where and kit still didnt know because she had not had time to tell him these and other questions occupied him to such an extent that he was surprised when he looked up and saw shimmering like a mirage in the near distance the nile a gently undulating line of silver nestled between two verdant strips and cradled by bonecoloured hills and desert highlands on either side the sight was so arresting that he paused to treat himself to a long drink of water before starting the climb down in the shade of a rock overhang he sat and closed his sundazzled eyes instantly the image of the corpses in high priest anens tomb came winging back to him the bodies of his poor dead greatgrandfather and sir henry fayth laid top to tail in the lidless sarcophagus shocked by their deaths and mindful of his own close call he still felt a little stunned in their haste to make a clean escape he had not yet had time to mourn them properly instead what he felt was not grief exactly but was closer to a churning animosity towards burleigh at the wicked waste of those good mens lives so far as kit was concerned the earl and his men were vile lowlife scum evil through and through in his burgeoning fantasies of revenge kit concocted inventive and agonising punishments for them all this was the first sign of the new attitude rapidly crystallising in kits character call it stalwart determination perhaps at last one could detect the vestiges of a sturdier more robust backbone although it took little more than the form of a swiftly hardening resolve to discover the secret of the skin map still it was a beginning taking up the quest in dead earnest he decided would be the best tribute he could offer cosimo and sir henry they deserved that much at least whatever else could be said they did not deserve to die like that stricken down by the contagion of the tomb some airborne plague germ or somethingwasnt that what killed howard carter and those other archaeologists who opened king tuts tomb whatever infested the tomb dear old cosimo and sir henry had succumbed to it and if wilhelmina had not turned up when she did no doubt he and giles would have suffered the very same fate he wondered if he had caught the bug already truth to tell he did not feel any too strong just now what i need he breathed to himself is a good meal and a restful nights sleep to see me right thats all was that too much to ask kit did not think so with this thought in mind kit roused himself and fortifying himself with another swig of water started down the long meandering path into the broad nile valley upon rejoining the rockstrewn way the heat hit him anew and he considered taking off his shirt and wrapping that around his head turbanstyle but that would just be trading a present misery for the future one of sunfried shoulders he would get a good hat at the first opportunity picking his way over the shattered landscape he dropped lower into the valley the air grew slightly more humid the closer he came to the river his progress though steady was not as swift as he hoped it would be distances could be deceiving in the desert he knew and for all kits donkeylike progress he seemed to come no nearer his destination as the sun drifted lower and ever lower in the western sky kit watched his shadow stretch out before him over the rocky waste mesmerised by his everlengthening silhouette he was brought once more to his senses when a chorus of barking dogs announced his arrival in a small riverside village chapter in which an omen is proved true turms the immortal opened his eyes on the eight thousand and thirtyfirst day of his reign rising from his gilded bed he bathed in the sacred basin beside the door his lips moving in silent prayer as he laved perfumed water over his face and limbs his ablutions finished he dried himself on clean linen and drew on his crimson robe a house servant appeared with his golden sash and tall ceremonial hat turms allowed the servant to belt the sash and then put on the hat and went out to greet the crowd that had gathered with gifts and offerings to receive his judgement and blessing he moved though the marbletiled rooms of his lodge to the portico stepped across the threshold and passed between the sacred blue pillars and quickly down the three cleanswept travertine steps as he stepped onto the path he chanced to see a small black pebble lying precisely in the centre of the path a stone worn smooth and round by many waters an almost perfect sphere beside the stone lay three long needles from the nearby pine trees the three formed a neatly placed arrow the priest king of velathri paused to contemplate this small marvel the pebble he knew had come from the seashore a few miles distant a bird had picked it upa seagull perhapsand then flown inland to drop the stone before his door the arrow of green needles directed his attention to the west it was an omen a sign to him from the world beyond the meaning of which came clear to him as he gazed upon the simple beauty of the pebble for turms could comprehend all manner of omens the meaning was this he would soon receive a visitora guest arriving by way of the sea from the westa foreign visitor then whose friendship he would do well to accept turms closed his fist over the pebble and thanked the gods for their continued blessing of his long reign this little stone would be added to all the others in the jar of his days tucking the omen stone into the wide sleeve of his robe he continued down the long sloping ramp of the artificial hill on which the royal lodge was constructed he walked slowly down the cypresslined path enjoying the astringent fragrance of the tall trees the earlymorning sunlight deepened the colour of the soil to a rich rusty red that contrasted nicely with the brilliant blue of the sky down below at the foot of the ramp his attendants and acolytes waited two apprentice priests and four temple servants the latter each held a pole attached to a corner of orange cloth the canopy beneath which the priest king would receive his faithful subjects upon the kings approach the attendants bare to the waist stretched out the canopy and turms took his place before the small crowd pressing the palms of his hands together he raised his arms above the heads of the people and said may the blessings of this day be yours in abundance then he greeted them saying it pleases me to receive your gifts on this most auspicious morning come near to me for this is the acceptable hour who will be first he lowered his hands and looked around him at the hopeful faces of his subjects he saw a young girl with blue cornflowers in her hair holding a sprig of laurel you little one what is your desire the girl nudged forward by her father stepped timidly closer she did not dare to meet the gaze of the king but kept her head bowed her eyes upon the laurel clasped in her trembling hands is this for me asked turms bending near the girl nodded i thank you he said gently taking the laurel sprig and the gods thank you he placed a hand on her head and felt the gentle heat there what do you want me to do for you she hesitated and he said speak child all heaven stands ready to do your bidding it is my mother replied the girl head low her voice faint as a whisper yes tell me what is in your heart she is very sick your mother is sick and you would see her made well againis that your desire the little girl nodded glancing up turms addressed the father who was now standing behind his daughter how long he asked two days my lord king replied the man turms nodded he straightened raised his face to the sky and covered his face with his hands he stood in silence for a moment and then lowering his hands once more smiled and said there is nothing to fear he reached towards the girl and took her chin between his finger and thumb lifting her head your mother will be well this illness will pass in three days her strength will be renewed thank you lord said the man relief visible on his face turning to one of the acolytes turms said send one of the court physicians to this mans house with a potion for sleep and the easing of fever to the man and little girl he said go in peace the gods are pleased to grant your petition bowing from the waist the man backed away through the crowd drawing his daughter with him thanking his king as he went who will be next asked turms a man dressed in the short tunic and sandals of a day labourer stepped forward and went down on his knees he stretched forth his hands holding a heavy bunch of ripe purple grapes my lord and king hear me i am in need directing one of the acolytes to take the offered gift turms asked what is your need my friend it is for justice my king i am listening speak freely i have been working for a man who promised to pay me each evening when work was completed i have worked two days without pay and last night he dismissed me when i complained that i was not paid he set his dogs on me they tore my clothes he indicated a ragged rent in the hem of his simple garment i seek the promised wages gazing down at the man who still had not raised his head turms asked what reason did he give for dismissing you none whatever my king did he have cause to dismiss you without pay inquired the priest king gently theft perhaps or drunkenness or laziness my king said the man bridling at the insinuation that he might have been in some way to blame for his troubles i am an honest man and do an honest days work i earned my pay and now i am hungry and my children are hungry how much are you owed twentyfive denari replied the man readily turms looked into the fellows eyes for a moment and the man returned his gaze unwaveringly i am satisfied declared the king turning to one of the acolytes he said give this man fifty denari out of the treasury then send the master of the rolls with two soldiers to collect the same from this mans employer the acolyte picked up his wax tablet and with a rosewood stylus recorded the kings judgement in the soft wax other petitioners came forward thensome seeking a judgement others in search of a decision or knowledge of the most favourable time to begin some undertaking or another still others for healing of various ailments each brought an offering that was added to the growing heap just as every judgement and decision was dutifully recorded on the tablet then as the ranks of supplicants thinned there came a commotion from the rear turms in the middle of a pronouncement sensed a ripple of excitement pass through the remaining crowd he finished quickly and then turned to address his people what is happening here why this unseemly murmuring someone has come lord king offered a nearby subject a stranger he is asking to see you a stranger has come wondered turms his fingers felt for the pebble couched in his sleeve make way and let him appear before me at the kings command the gathering parted to allow the newcomer through striding towards him was a tall man in strange colourless clothing that bisected his long bodywhite above and black belowbut the face was open and friendly moreover it was a face he knew behold called king turms raising his hands in exclamation my foreign visitor has arrived the stranger went down on one knee then rose and was recognised by his friend arturos is it you the sight of you gladdens my heart and makes my spirit soar replied arthur flinderspetrie reciting the ancient greeting response i have longed to see you my lord king my people said the king i present to you my friend arturos make him welcome among you during his sojourn with us there were murmurs of assent all around and others called greetings which arthur returned in kind turms turned to one of the acolytes and said guide my esteemed visitor to the royal lodge and command my house servants to make him welcome and give him refreshment to arthur he said the days audience is nearly finished i will join you soon as you must agreed arthur i have no desire to interrupt your holy offices with that the acolyte led the kings guest away up the long earthen ramp to the royal lodge where his arrival was announced arturos you have returned cried the master of the kings house rushing out onto the broad porch of the lodge on behalf of my king and all the people of velathri i bid you peace and welcome it pleases my heart to see you pacha said arthur feeling his way back through a longdisused corridor of language i had hoped to return sooner but he shrugged life is a constant turmoil for men in the world offered the kings housekeeper but you are here now and i trust you will stay long enough to allow tyrrhenia to soothe your soul laying a finger to his lips he paused then added i think a libation of sweet wine will prove efficacious in this regard indicating a low couch covered with red cushions he said if you will please make yourself comfortable i will return shortly you are too kind pacha replied arthur i am happy to look after myself the royal housekeeper bowed and backed away he disappeared clapping his hands and calling to the kitchen servants to attend him at once arthur sat down on the couch and stretched his long legs before him he did not feel like relaxingthe opposite in fact no doubt he could persuade turms to take a walk with him in the vineyards and olive groves later after weeks aboard ship it was a little light exercise he wanted the voyage from england had not been easy the weather had been against them almost from the start and the conditions aboard ship were primitive to say the least it was not his preferred mode of travel to be sure but the other wayley travelwas out of the question at the moment the dangers were just too great indeed he had pressed it as far as he dared just to get here arturos stand up and let me see you arthur glanced up to see turms in the doorway a tall imposing figure almost gaunt beneath his ceremonial robe his oncesmooth face showing lines of age his hair greying at the temples hung straight to his shoulders his forehead shaven in the manner of the priestly caste turms removed his ceremonial hat and unbelted the golden sash then turned to receive his friend arthur rose to his feet and was gathered into a firm and friendly embrace my heart soars at the sight of you said the king kissing him on the cheek mine too replied arthur happily indeed my soul has been singing since i set foot on tyrrhenian soil this very morning he spoke with greater ease and confidence as his former skills like birds returning from migration came winging back to him across the years how long has it been since i was here he wondered five years six over twenty i fear said turms shaking his head slightly too long my friend ah me sighed arthur i had hoped to return much sooner but events overtook me and it was not possible still you are here now the king turned away suddenly and called pacha bring wine and sweetmeats we must welcome our guest he turned back and taking arthur by the arm led him to the couch i was made aware of your coming he said taking his place beside his guest just this morning i received an omen foretelling your arrival i did not know it would be you of courseonly that i would receive a foreign visitor before days end turms smiled and here you are indeed i am said arthur and i could not be happier i will have a house prepared for youa new one this time the old one will be more than satisfactory said arthur quickly if it is available no no i will not hear it that house is too far away i want you close by so that distance will not impede our lessons your generosity o king is as wide as your wisdom said arthur bowing his head in assent but you may change your mind when i tell you that i did not come alone this time he leaned forward i have a wife you are married i am but where is she still aboard the ship what exclaimed turms you keep her waiting like a bundle of cargo on the deck of a stinking ship what a thoughtless uncaring husband you are please turms i meant no disrespect to either yourself or my dear wife in truth i was uncertain of my reception i hope you know you can trust our friendship said turms my regard for you has never altered it was not you or your friendship i doubted replied arthur believe me that thought never entered my mind but i wanted to see how things stood here ah turms nodded with appreciation very wise yes i remember nowat the time of your last leaving the latins were threatening our borders you might have returned to a very different place than you last visited he made a laudatory gesture in the air with his hand i commend your caution pacha approached leading a servant bearing a bronze tray with silver goblets and a delicate glass jar of pale ambercoloured liquid there were bowls of honeyed almonds as well the servant placed the tray on a threelegged stand and backed away as the master of the house poured the wine sipped from the goblet then handed it to the king he repeated the process for the kings guest then retreated quietly i am glad to see that all appears peaceful now the realm prospers under your reign for now yes the bellicose latins have been tamed or at least discouraged the prime instigators have been caught judged and either executed or exiled the umbriansan altogether more reasonable tribehave taken over administration of ruma city at present you have no need to fear becoming ensnared in a battle between warring nations peace that everfragile flower blossoms in profusion across the land since that is the way of things said arthur rising once more i will inform my wife she will be most heartily glad to leave the confines of the ship arthurs manner became grave xianli is the reason i have come my wife is with child you see a glance at his visitors face told turms that all was not well what should be a joyous occasion has been clouded for you in some way i can see it what has happened xianli has had a troubled time replied arthur simply i have come to you for advice i have told her of the skill of etrurian physicians and she is most eager to meet you i will go fetch her now you will do no such thing my friend said the king i will send pacha to the ship with my bearers and they will bring her in my chair he raised his hand and summoned his servant arthurs wife is waiting aboard the ship in the harbour take my chair to her at oncebut see the bearers employ the utmost care the lady is with child it will be done my king pacha bowed and hurried away soon his calls urging the bearers to speed could be heard echoing down the hillside while awaiting the arrival of xianli the two sat and talked and drank their wine renewing old bonds of friendship casting their memories back across the intervening years to the time when turms had been but a lowly prince third in line to the throne and arthur his student assigned by king velnath to teach the exotic visitor the language and customs of the tyrrhenian people the two young men had quickly become fast friends and though it had been a long time since they had last seen one another their high regard for one another had not diminished you have not changed at all remarked turms regarding arthur closely nor have you my lord king careful he wagged a scolding finger it is a dangerous thing to lie to a king but see here for you i put off my crown when we are together i am only turms we will turn back the years and be what we once were as you will agreed arthur i would like nothing more they talked about the time when they had both travelled the country as part of arthurs schooling turms father had seen in the young foreigner a source of knowledge he was determined to utilise the old king had died before the summer was outkilled by a latin assassins blade turms brother had ascended the throne and in vengeance declared war on the latins forcing the two young men to abandon their travels and return to velathri where turms under command of his elder brother had entered the priesthood with the country deep in preparations for war arthur had made his farewells and departed with the promise to return in a year or two when peace had been restored and now you are king said arthur grinning with pleasure to find his old friend in such an exalted position you must tell me how that came about that is a tale i am keen to hear it is nothing replied turms fanning the air as if waving away a fly taking up his cup he said do you remember the last summer we were together it was in many ways the most glorious summer of my life how could i ever forget two keen and ardent souls without a care in the world the days we spent in ruma and reate turms chuckled shaking his head at the memory the nights sabine girls are the finest in all the world say the sages and from experiencelimited as it may bei can in no way disagree i should have married one when fortune smiled it is not too late arthur pointed out never too late turms smiled perhaps not chapter in which tea and sandwiches are encountered giles sensing that her companion was no longer with her wilhelmina spun around to find him on hands and knees heaving the contents of his stomach into the soft pine matting of the pathway she returned and knelt beside him take a deep breath and relax the worst is over she put her hand on his back thats righta slow deep breath he did as she instructed and wilhelmina felt his ribs expand and contract as the breath went in and out of his lungs again she advised glancing back the way they had come do you think you can walk we have to move along burleighs men may catch our trail any moment giles nodded and dragged a sleeve across his mouth good she put her hand under his arm and helped him to his feet it really does get easier with practice she smiled but youd better brace yourself we have two more jumps before were in the clear right now we have to get off this ley she turned and started into the trees lining the path giles on wobbly legs followed they walked a fair distance before wilhelmina paused to listen there were no sounds of a chase so she resumed at a slower pace allowing her queasy companion to gain a little strength the next ley is in the valley beyond that hill she told him it is about an hours trek there is a brook in the valley and we can get a drink before we jump giles nodded again youre not one to wear out a persons eardrums are you my lady i mean you dont talk much no my lady please call me mina she smiled and extended her hand to shake his just mina she began walking again its this way she led and he followed a halfstep behind so that she had to raise her voice to talk to him you were sir henry fayths valet she said is that right i was his footman and driver giles corrected and i take it you havent made all that many jumps my lady at his blank expression she rephrased her question in the more formal style of address of an earlier age am i to understand that you have but limited experience in ley travel yes my lady this was only my second time i see has anyone explained to you about the time slipthats what i call it you know the way time slips around when you make a jump no my lady but i know sir henry made many such leaps he and mr livingstone often travelled together and i understand that the places they visited were not in the present day and timeif you see what i mean yes well i just want to warn you that we will be returning to britainbut it will not be the country it was when you left she cast a quick glance at her sturdy companion what year was it when you left england the year of our lord sixteen and sixtysix if i have it right then it will have changed are we going back to london not just now were going to scotlandedinburgh to be exact you should recognise many thingsthere is much that remains unchanged from one era to the next but the britain we are going to visit lies about a hundred and fifty years into the futurethat is your future is that where you live no she smiled my home isor wasthree hundred years further still into that particular future but dont worry we wont be going there at least i dont expect we will does a body always go to a different place a different world or dimension you mean mina considered this i think so she replied at least so far as i know even so it is possible to make a jump and remain in the same geographical area so to speak if kit followed the instructions i gave him he has made a jump that keeps him in egyptonly it will be a different egypt in a different time from the one he left it took me a long time to work that out but it is incredibly useful giles accepted this without comment they proceeded up the long ramping incline of the hill to the top where they paused to look down into the valley beyond if there was an old straight track down there it was well hidden after taking in the view for a moment giles asked what is this place to tell you the truth i dont know i have not explored this world i only use it as a sort of steppingstone to get from one ley to another there are many such as theseunknown worlds i call them she laughed mostly because i dont know anything about them are there people hereabouts a few replied mina farmers and the like i have seen them working in their fields beyond those hills just there once or twice i have encountered them herding sheep in the valley as well i dont know what country this is or what language is spoken i hope we wont be here long enough to find out she pointed to the silver sliver of water coursing along the wide valley bottom the ley is just on the other side of that little stream once we reach it well be on our way soon their feet were swishing through the bracken that covered the hillside all the way down to the banks of the stream where they stopped to refresh themselves before moving on there it is wilhelmina said indicating a rough stone shaped like a magicians hat rising from the weeds near the bank that marker is where it begins you will see the line once you are on the path it is not very long so we must be in step and up to speed when we reach the stone and this ley will take us to scotland im sorry giles no we must make two more jumps to get there from here she pulled from her pocket a small brass object shaped like a river stone twisted a tiny dial and held the thing in the direction of the marker giles watched and when nothing seemed to happen mina cast a glance at the sky observing the clouds and the position of the sun i think we have an hour or two to wait before the ley becomes active she announced stuffing the little device back into the pocket of her trousers we might as well rest and try to sleep a little we may not have much chance when we get to edinburgh they rested then and when mina again tried the device a tiny blue light flickered on the brass casing satisfied she said the ley is not yet at full strength but it is active she explained that they must be in step and make the jump on the ninth pace from the marking stone this is important she told him if you feel that it is not working stop at once do not take another step we will hold hands so that we do not become separated she saw his worried expression relax giles i wont lose you she held out her hand ready yes my lady then here we go she started for the stone in long measured strides that after three or four paces giles matched easily they reached the stone and wilhelmina counted off the steps between the fifth and sixth the light dimmed as if a cloud had passed before the sun at the seventh step the wind whipped up between the eighth and ninth there arose a screeching howl and rain lashed out from nowhere and then the ground dropped from beneath them and they stepped into thin air but only for an instant their feet touched the ground with a jolt that carried up through the bones of their legs giles staggered but mina held him up and they walked on into the sunlight of a crisp autumnal morning beneath scattering grey clouds on a promontory above a wide sweeping bay the sea was dotted with whitecaps as the wind blustered out of the west the next jump took them to a barren desert in the middle of a storm biting wind swept over a dunefilled desolation kicking up gouts of sand and red dust thankfully their sojourn in this inhospitable place was shortlived the next ley was only a few hundred meters away and guided by wilhelminas homing device they found it easily and were able to use it at once without waiting sorry about that giles she said upon completing the jump that was a shortcut it saved us a lot of time he coughed dust from his lungs and wiped grit from his eyes where are we now he asked taking in his new surroundings they had arrived in what appeared to be a wellmaintained parklanda long green lane of mown grass between rows of mature elm trees rising behind them was the broad shoulder of a steep hillside the rest of the park was obscured by the trees welcome to edinburgh mina said cheerily or midlothian at least look at you she said patting his arm you forgot to be sick youll soon be a master of ley travel giles looked around taking in his surroundings with a wary expression have you ever been to scotland i have never travelled beyond the cotswolds he told her before joining mr livingstone that is he glanced around warily and confided but i have heard that the scots are barbarians who eat their young only in the highlands she teased and began walking down the wide grassy lane in the capital folk can be most refined youll see the year is with any luck and we have come to see a man called thomas young he is a doctor a physician with a practice in londonbut hes here with his wife eliza visiting his wifes sister and family dr young is an important man wondered giles falling into step beside her yes very besides medicine he has gained an international reputation as a leading scientist he speaks thirteen or fourteen languages and has written on everything from geometry physics medicine and mechanics to philosophy colour and music in short he will become known as the last man on earth to know everything is that why are we going to see him indeed it is among all his other accomplishments which are considerable in themselves dr young is also the worlds leading authority on all things egyptian they left the grassy lane and entered a more public area of the park walking easily among trees and bushes coming into the full leaf of high summer dr young is currently conducting expeditions to egypt he goes there every autumn to excavate and advance his studies into archaeology and hieroglyphs she glanced at the taciturn young man beside her you know about the skin map he nodded what do you know i know that sir henry set great store by it my lady and i know he and mr livingstone were killed for it yes well dr young is going to help kit find the skin map he knows where it is wilhelmina shook her head no he doesnt but if the map is to be found in egypt he is the man to find it the park run ended in a wide expanse of lawn behind a brooding baronialstyle edificethe house of a wealthy shipping magnate this way said mina turning away from the stately house they are a bit touchy about trespassers we best stay out of sight she led them to a low iron fence swung easily over it and started down a rutted road were still a few miles from the city but with any luck there will be a coach along and we can catch a ride the expected carriage did not appear however and they reached edinburgh through its grubby suburbs of low mean houses their whitewashed walls darkened by the smoke and soot of auld reekywhich in no way prepared giles for the impact of the sprawling city itself by the time they reached city centre the effect was complete giles took in the grand red stone buildings lining the streets and the citizens going about their business a sprawling castle soared high above them on a sheer rock cliff right in the heart of the town and giles could only stand and gape in mute wonder what do you think asked wilhelmina it is a fine and handsome place giles concluded looking around greater even than londonmore buildings of stone and the carriages are bigger thats just the beginning just then a clock high up in the tower of a church at the far end of the street began striking the hour three oclock we best hurry along we dont want to disturb them at home over tea again the puzzled expression played over the young mans broad features do they not go to the teahouse mina sensed the cause of his confusion oh sure there are still tea shops aroundloads of them but increasingly people take their tea at home also they take a light afternoon meal along with it giles accepted this explanation with his customary nod she turned to him and began walking at a pace along the street speaking of mealsare you hungry we have just time enough to grab a sandwich she regarded the blank look on her companions face and guessed its source sorry i forgot you wont know about those yet but dont worry youll like them three ham cheese and mustard baps two mugs of milky tea and a carriage ride laterthe tea was drunk at a cab stand and the sandwiches devoured in the back of the carriage by a ravenous giles who pronounced the experience a very marvelthey arrived on the steps of a large stone house on charlotte street wilhelmina yanked the bellpull and in a moment the black enamelled door was opened by a young woman in a serving maids blue uniform she gazed at them impassively but said nothing we have come to see dr thomas young mina announced i believe he is staying here i am to say that dr young is with his family he is not seeing patients today we are not patients replied mina crisply we are fellow explorers rest assured we would not disturb him unless it was of the highest importance and interest to him please inform dr young that we have come from egypt with important information about his forthcoming expedition if you please to wait herethe girl turned awayi will tell him a minute later the door was opened againthis time by a bewhiskered man wearing round steelrimmed glasses and a black frock coat good day to you friends how can i be of service good day dr young thank you for agreeing to see us we will try not to take up too much of your time am i to understand that you have information regarding my expedition to egypt information yes affirmed wilhelmina and a proposition for you to consider the doctor made no move to open the door nor admit them a proposition he said flatly taking in her curious garb am i to know the nature of this proposition it concerns the discovery of the tomb of anen high priest of amun and the recovery of a wealth of treasures many of which have never before been seen the kindly doctor smiled knowingly im sorry but you are mistaken dear lady there is no such tomb i must beg to differ doctor the tomb exists but has not yet been discovered however i can assure you that it will be mina leaned forward and imparted her secret and you are the man who will discover it he gazed at her benignly from behind his glasses his professional manner firmly in place clearly he was accustomed to dealing with people in all manner of debilitating mental and physical states may i presume to ask how you can possibly know this because replied wilhelmina offering her most sincere and confident smile i am from your future chapter in which a guest is honoured kit strolled into the village a small farming hamlet consisting of low mudbrick houses strung along the banks of the slow silent nile and surrounded by darkly fertile fields of beans and squash onions leeks melons sesame and the likeall of it guarded by a noisy greeting party of mongrel dogs the houses he noted were mostly unadorned mud brick though some featured the occasional wall daubed blue or green the buildings were uniformly doorless windowless and most had small beehiveshaped ovens in their bare backyards the more prosperouslooking dwellings had small clothcovered palmlined pavilions on the roofto make use no doubt of any errant cooling breezebut the roofs of the more humble dwellings were topped with heaps of sunblasted rubbish any discarded usedup household items ended their useful lives roofside along with the accumulated garbage and detritus of daily life he glimpsed the first dog as he passed the third house on the edge of the hamlet the animal was quickly joined by two more which were in turn trailed by a pack of curious children they all stared at him dogs and kids with wide dark eyes kit smiled and waved which sent the youngsters racing off to find their elders setting off a general commotion of greeting for a stranger who had wandered out of the desert kit was mightily relieved to discover that his first attempts at communication were met with success whatever time he had landed in westerners were apparently a common enough sight among the locals that it did not provoke instant alarm at least his appearance did not send them reaching for weapons or running for cover instead as the small crowd of villagers gathered around a darkskinned older fellow with stubbly grey hair stepped forward and handed kit a clay cup full of water which kit accepted with a smile and nod kit tipped the cup to his lips and guzzled it down the man watched him then said deutsch francais english replied kit wiping his mouth parlez vous english non said the man he laid hold of a nearby boy and spoke a quick command that sent the lad racing away turning back to kit he said francais no replied kit passing back the empty cup the man sighed with weary resignation and then everyone stood looking at each other and at kit until a slender young man in a white kaftan appeared hello sir he said pushing his way through the throng i am khefri you speak english the young man nodded gravely what is your name sir call me kit he said kit livingstone how can we help you kit livingstone i am travelling hereabouts replied kit i am on my way to luxor do you know of anyplace where you are on foot yes you have been in the desert yes thats right i you have been in the desert on foot yes you see i am looking for someone you are looking for someone repeated khefri his large dark eyes narrowing in disbelief in the desert on foot as it happens yes said kit feeling that this line of questioning could go on for quite some time but now i am on my way to luxor you have money wondered khefri a little replied kit wilhelmina had given him a handful of coins not much this is my father said the youth indicating the older man who was now smiling and nodding in welcome he is head man of this village you will stay with us tonight and i will take you to luxor in the morning great said kit terrific i mean thank you very much it is pleasure the cost will be six dinar khefri exchanged a few words with his father then said you are invited to come now and share a meal with us my father would speak to you of your england i would be delighted said kit trying on his most charming manner but i do not wish to put you to any trouble it is not trouble for us replied khefri hospitality is a duty if you will please to follow me i will take you now the darkeyed young man turned and pushed his way through the onlookers crying for them to make way kit followed in his wake in a procession that displayed all the qualities of a twoman parade you speak very good english kit pointed out from his place a few steps behind his guide where did you learn in my school i went to a mission school in alqahira he explained the brothers there they teach me good ill say i finish school two years ago now i work in luxor what do you do i am guide sometimes he replied sometimes i help my cousin with his boat my cousin he speaks french we help each other i see nodded kit appreciatively so together you cover the waterfront here is our house kit looked up to see that they were standing outside of the largest house in the village oil lanterns were alight along the rooftop illuminating a sizeable cloth marquee khefri led him to the front door please to come in he said kicking off his shoes you are guest my thanks said kit removing his shoes if you dont mind my asking what year is it khefri regarded him quizzically you wish to know the year if possible it is the year twelve hundred and thirtyfive replied the young man with a shrug ah said kit his heart sinking at the thought that he had seriously overshot the mark and wound up in medieval egypt but that erroneous assumption was swiftly overturned by the bald facts the mission school the oil lamps the guide business and all the rest by the calendar of england khefri continued it is the year one thousand eight hundred and twentytwo thats more like it said kit not at all certain what conditions might greet him in whatever they were they would have to be more amenable than those that existed in the middle ages please to enter now the interior of the house was dark and the air thick with the oily scent of heavily spiced cooking his mouth watered and his empty stomach rumbled whatever they were making kit was certain he could eat his weight of it he padded after his young host who led him through the lower floor which featured a single large room divided by a woven curtain rugs covered the floor and cushions of various sizes were strewn about the perimeter in the centre of the room stood a low table with a large round top of hammered brass khefri led him out to the back of the house where two women and two young girls were tending a charcoal fire over which a very large and very black cauldron was bubbling one of the women was spreading a thin layer of dough over the bottom of a round castiron vessel to make flat bread she looked up as khefri approached concern visible on her round face a word from him and she lowered her head then taking up a newly cooked round of waferthin bread she tore it in half rose and stepping around the fire presented it to kit this is my mother khefri informed him her name is mariam kit accepted the warm bread with a smile and nod how do you say thank you in egyptian shukran replied his young guide just say shukran kit repeated the word and added her name saying shukran mariam the young mans mother hid her mouth and laughed then made a comment to her son before returning to her cooking what did she say wondered kit my mother says you are very tall and not too ugly answered khefri she thinks you would make a good husband for betthat is my oldest sister please tell her that when i decide to find a wife i will come here first kit said this remark when translated was the cause of much sniggering among the women around the fire the two younger girls stole glances at their visitor and laughed behind their hands khefris father arrived just then and with a show of pride laid a hand to his chest and said i am ramesses pleased to meet you and i am very pleased to meet you ramesses replied kit extending his hand you have the name of a very famous pharaoh the elder man smiled and nodded he does not speak english khefri told him that is all he knows tell him that ramesses is a very famous pharaoh everyone in england has heard of him he knows that ramesses is not his real name the young man explained his real name is copt very old fashionedtoo difficult to pronounce everyone knows him as ramesses copt wondered kit we are copts yes khefri explained christians ah kit nodded please thank your father for allowing me into his home i am honoured this was done under ramesses benevolent smile he spoke to his son who translated may the peace of god be with you while you sojourn in our land shukran replied kit the village patriarch beckoned his son and guest to follow him up to the rooftop where kit was given a prime place in the little paviliona simple structure of cloth and boards on three sides and covered with palm fronds to keep off the sun rugs had been spread and cushions arranged for reclining while the elder man busied himself with lighting a small charcoal fire in a brass bowl kit leaned back and watched the stars come out in a little while when the coals in the bowl were glowing one of the daughters brought out a hookah or as kit knew it a hubblebubble pipe and a small packet of some unidentified substance that would be smoked the father prepared the pipe and giving it a few draughts to get it going passed the hose and nozzle to kit indicating that he should have a puff not wishing to offend his host kit took an exploratory draw on the tube and was rewarded with a mouthful of cool curiously mentholflavoured smoke on which he promptly chokedto the roaring delight of his host thanks gasped kit that was nice khefri took a draught and passed the hose back to his father who then proceeded to puff away happily while plying his guest with questions as interpreted by his son how was the health of the king did kit think the king would come to egypt how many horses did kit own did he live in a castle was it true that it rained in england every day had he ever met the king to these and many more kit gave simple goodnatured answers albeit some of his replies were decidedly vague since he was not certain which king was on the throne nevertheless his forthright responses seemed to satisfy his inquisitive host who smoked away like a happy sultan all the same kit was grateful when the meal arrived in big brass bowlsa spicy stew of mutton and aubergines with lentils apricots and pine nuts this was served alongside fine yellow couscous and eaten with the fingers the men dipped into a communal dish while the women and girls flitted around filling drinking cups with the local beera watery sour brew that went down astonishingly well they continually replaced the torn bread with new warm loaves when the men finished the women made their meal of the remains kit was yawning and thinking seriously about bunching up a few cushions and closing his eyes when the entertainment for the evening arrived four men two with drums one with a lutelike instrument and one with a rattle the musicians had been engaged solely for kits benefitan honour befitting the guest of the head man of the villageand there proceeded a lively thumping ruckus that drove all thoughts of sleep from kits weary head a few of the neighbours showed up to lend a hand and dancing broke out much to kits chagrin he was pulled into the festivities and forced to stomp about with the men while the women clapped in time to the music and laughed it was latemuch later than he wishedwhen the musicians finally laid aside their instruments they were all treated to jars of beer and then paying their respects to their host departed ramesses rose and with the pomp of a proper pharaoh wished his guest a good night kit thanked him for a wonderful evening i dont know when i have had a more enjoyable time he said meaning every word salaam said ramesses as he disappeared down the steps still humming a tune the musicians had played you will sleep here tonight khefri told him there is a cloth if you get cold i am sure i will be just fine i will come for you in the morning we will leave at sunrise ill be ready declared kit good nightand khefri thanks thanks for everything it was just what i needed pleasure replied the young egyptian good night khefri slipped away quietly and kit dragged some of the cushions together and shook out the blanket in the space of one daywas it really only a single dayhe had been imprisoned and in fear for his life then hot and thirsty and alone in the desert now here he was full of good food and song and the unstinting hospitality of people that before this night he had never imagined might exist just as he stretched himself out and pulled the blanket over him the doganddonkey chorus beganeach setting the others off until the entire nile valley reverberated with the barking and baying cacophony since sleep seemed to be the last activity any creature was allowed to pursue in this place kit lay on his back and stared up at a sky ablaze with far more stars than he had ever seen in any one sky the milky way never so much as glimpsed in his london and most often seen elsewhere as a thin dusting of stars was in the arid atmosphere of egypt a bright band of luminous cloud he watched in wonder as the dazzling show slowly wheeled across the gleaming dome of the sky spinning majestically around the fixed bright point of the nail of heaven and although the moon was late rising the fulgent starlight radiating from the cloudless heavens cast hard shadows on the earthly landscape below how very bright this empire of stars he mused which poet had said that the illimitable star field stretched away in every possible direction everywhere alive with constellations he had never seen before with names he did not know here and there he picked out familiar conjunctions of stars but the glowing firmament was largely unknown to him easily outstripping the smattering of astronomy he had learned as an elevenyearold member of his middle schools stargazer club he had attended all of three meetings before glomming onto the most basic fact that the pursuit of this hobby took place mostly at night in the cold when winter skies were brightest he remembered but little of the various stellar arrangements mostly he recalled hopping from one foot to the other and blowing on his hands in a futile effort to keep warm while awaiting his toobrief glimpse through mr hendersons sixinch telescope in thisas in everything else of latehe wished he had paid more attention to his studies still he considered it was not too late to learn and he would learn he would find someone to teach him failing that he would find some way to teach himself because in all likelihood his life depended on it if even a portion of what cosimo and sir henry believed was true about whatever it was that lay beyond those glittering stars the future of the world might just depend on it his last thought as sleep overtook him was that it was true what cosimo had said the universe was far stranger than anyone imagined or could imagine chapter in which the pregnant question is asked though she felt obliged to protest at being carried in a chair like the empress of china xianli actually enjoyed the attention being lavished on her by the bearers and their overseer after weeks aboard a fetid ship lurching about on uncertain seas the slow swaying of the chair was a pleasant change arthur had explained that the ruler of this land on the italian peninsula had once been a good friend to him in younger days but that was many years ago he said things can change just to be safe i will go ashore and assess the situation if all is well i will return for you thus the arrival of the chair though unexpected was a sign that the situation at court was as good or better than arthurs hope she lay back on featherstuffed pillows surveying a land whose gentle hills above a silver sweep of sea made her feel as if she were coming home as the bearers made the climb up from the harbour and into the town she felt a sense of peace and calm overtaking her a sensation of warmth and relaxation she had not known for many weeks now after the initial jump arthur had insisted that further ley travel was simply too dangerous in her delicate condition xianli had her doubts another leap or two seemed far preferable to the voyage she had begun to think would never end by the time the bearers and their officious little overseer reached the long sloping path leading to the royal lodge on the hill she was already firmly under the spell of etruria meeting the king whose easy charm and welcoming manner so delighted her she completely forgave the hardships she had endured getting there xianli my love said arthur upon presenting her to the king i would have you greet turms he is lord and king of velathri and a very old and dear friend of mine i am your servant my lord replied xianli beginning a curtsey the movement made awkward by her advanced pregnancy unbalanced her and she swayed dangerously the king reached out took her elbow in a firm grasp steadied her and helped her to her feet we will not suffer any more ceremony in this house he told her you are most kind she said when arthur had translated the kings words turms still holding her arm led her to his place on the red couch i think you will be more comfortable here he said helping her to sit i commend you on your choice of bride my friend he told arthur she is exceedingly beautiful you are a lucky man at xianlis questioning glance arthur said he says you are very beautiful and that i am a fortunate fellow tell the king that i fear for his eyesight i am a hideous bloated whale turms laughed when he heard this may all whales be so ugly to behold he said come let us share a drink together and begin a season of gladness in one anothers company the king called for wine to be brought at once and pacha bring the silver cups sire those cups are only ever used on holy days the servant pointed out in a terse whisper indeed cried the king so you are right to remind me what occasion i ask you can be more holy than this welcoming of friends new and long absent in honour of this glad day we shall drink the best wine and sup on the finest festal dishes i turms the immortal declare this a day of celebration in this house it shall be done o great king pacha bowed and scurried away turms winked at xianli he is a most capable housekeeper but he does forget his place and must be reminded more often than is seemly he laughed another king would have had his head on a stake long ago but i like him as the wine was served they talked of xianlis homeland turms listened with great interest having heard that traders had begun calling on chinese ports but he had never known anyone who had been there much less seen a native of that faroff realm he wanted to know how the rulers of her country comported themselves how they governed what they wore and ate and how they directed their affairs he listened closely as arthur translated nodding now and then storing away the knowledge he obtained when arthur announced that he would like to walk around the grounds of the lodge and see some of the countryside they moved their discussion out into the groves and vineyards of the royal estate gradually their talk came around to the reason for their visit arturos has told me that this journey has been provoked by a matter of some importance what else has my husband said wondered xianli with a glance of mild disapproval at arthur as he delivered her words to the king only that what should have been a time of joy and anticipation for you has been troubled in some way he said that he has come to seek my counsel turms stopped walking turned to her and smiled it is my hope that i may repay that confidence xianli looked to arthur when he explained what turms had said go on arthur urged her tell him it is as my husband has said began xianli licking her lips i have had some difficulty twice i have narrowly averted miscarrying the baby but then it seemed that all was well and everything was proceeding as it should i have felt strong and my health has been very good and now wondered turms at arthurs translation it has been a month since i felt the baby move xianli replied her voice quivering slightly as she spoke i fear the child may be in difficulty ah sighed turms as arthur finished relating what his wife had said i understand you want me to tell you if this is true you wish to know if the infant will be born alivehis voice softenedor dead i would not have presumed on our friendship for anything less arthur told him but i could think of none better to advise us on the correct course turms turned and began walking down the row of neatly tended vines he stopped at one vine and lifted a heavy bunch of blueblack fruit in his hand and with his finger rubbed away some of the waxy white coating on the nearest grapes i am sorry if we have began xianli arthur touched her shoulder and shook his head to silence her in a moment turms turned and walked back to where the worried couple stood of course i will advise you i only wished to see if this request lay within the realm of foreseeable knowledge i have been asked many things in my time as king but never this and it is something you can foresee so i believe turms replied in any case the answer is within my power to seek they resumed their stroll among the vines taking in the warmth and beauty of the day xianli soon became tired and they returned to the lodge where rooms had been made up for the use of the kings guests then when they had been settled to his satisfaction turms put on his robe of state and went down to the temple at the base of the sacred hill to speak to some of the priests about organising the necessary items for the divination the chief priest a venerable old man with a slight hump in his back shuffled into the audience room just as the king was taking his leave may peace abound in your company my lord and king said sethre i only just learned you were here or i would have come sooner greetings sethre i did not wish to intrude on your meditations replied turms i came only to prepare for a divination this evening all is in order there was no need to disturb you your presence is never a disturbance o king replied the aged priest with polished deference i have good news for you your tomb is almost finished that is good news said turms nodding with approval the building of a tomb was the priest kings first highest and most sacred duty his own plans modest in comparison to some few of his predecessors had nevertheless been fraught with complications of many kinds the delays resulting from these difficulties had pushed the completion further and further into his reign the artists assure me the tomb will be ready before the equinox said the old priest the inauguration can take place in the spring well done sethre your experience and service have been invaluable it was true the old man had guided the construction with an unflagging determination what turms did not say was that it was an error on sethres part that had resulted in the first setback the site chosen along the sacred way had proven wholly unsuitable owing to an unseen fault in the tufa stonea fault that should have been detected in the divination ceremony long before construction ever began i knew you would be pleased he gave a bow then turned to go hesitated and asked the rite you are planning tonight my king would you like me to assist there is no need replied turms it involves the birth of a child a simple matter then i have a dove that will serve not as simple as we could wish said the king who went on to describe the fear that the child might be dead inside the mother have you ever encountered such a request only once my king it was many years ago he put a finger to his pursed lips i used a ram then as i recall i dont think i would use a ram now no a lamb would be better he said or even a kid with an older animal you risk too many complicating factors it could cloud the issue unnecessarily you want a young beast and a healthy one wise counsel sethre i yield to your judgement said turms yes as i think about it now i would like you to assist me this evening see that an unblemished lamb or kid is prepared as you will my king satisfied that all was in order for the ceremony turms returned to the lodge and after informing pacha that no one was to disturb him he helped himself to a plum from a bowl on the table outside his chamber he removed his robe hung it on the stand beside the door then lay down on his bed and closed his eyes but he did not sleep instead he turned the events of the day over in his mind and was instantly overcome with a sense of the rightness of all things everything that happened in life happened for a reason his long acquaintance with arturos for example the happy years they had spent together in one anothers company and later his own troubled ascendancy to the kingship and the years of intense study and preparation that followedperhaps it had all been leading to this day a day when that friendship could be called upon in a time of need turms was impressed once again as he often was how even the most seemingly insignificant and trivial actions and associations could in the fullness of time command great import despise not the day of small things was that how it went it was a saying he had learned in alexandria from a bearded eastern sagea wise man of the cult of yahwehthe god it was claimed who reigned above all others who ordained and sustained all things for his creation and who was worshipped by hebrews to the exclusion of all others turms the immortal thought about this and his heart soared anew on the knowledge that in the eyes of the wise there were no small things in a little while when the sun had begun descending into a sea like molten bronze he rose stripped and made his ablutions from the bronze bowl performing each action three times then dressed in his crimson robe and seers hat he departed leaving orders for pacha to bring arturos and his wife at the appropriate time for the ceremony the king walked slowly down to the temple with deliberate measured steps his mind already searching the myriad pathways of the future for the sake of his friend chapter in which december proves the cruellest month two lonely figures muffled and wrapped against the cold shuffled through the snowcovered streets of the unfamiliar city of harrogate a mother and her young son they were newly arrived having travelled by night coach from london stand up straight and tall the mother advised mind your manners as i showed you she glanced down at him doubtfully will you do that promise me the boy nodded his small face pinched tight against the cold you will be a gentleman soon she added softening her tone think of that what if i dont like him the little boy wanted to know of course you will like him she chided anyway he is your father it doesnt matter if you like him or not why because hes your father thats why she told him in a tone that let him know there were to be no more questions about it they walked on the earlymorning streets were still dark in the frozen depths of december light came late to northern towns beneath a flickering streetlamp they paused to rest a little and warm themselves by stamping their feet and blowing on their bare hands a few paces up from where they stood a baker unlocked his door stepped out in his flourdusted apron and proceeded to take down the shutters covering the windows of his shop the aroma of fresh bread wafted out into the street on a gush of warm air im hungry piped the little boy his eyes wide as he gazed at the bakery we will eat soon advised his mother your father will give us a nice meal i expect he has all kinds of good things to eat for he is a fine gentleman and lives in a great house with butlers and maids and footmen and a carriage and horses taking his small cold hand in hers she pulled him along past the bakery come along archie we best move on before we get too cold they slogged on through the slushfilled streets of the town it had been a long and sleepless journey in a cold and uncomfortable coach and she had used almost all of her meagre funds to purchase the tickets that had brought them this far there was nothing left over for niceties like a cab or necessities like hot rolls to keep her young sons mind off the hunger and cold his mother told him stories about his father and the mansion he would soon enjoy as part of his birthright eventually they left the high street and entered a broad avenue lined with large redbrick houses here they stopped to rest again im tired complained the boy it is just a little farther said his mother we are almost there she pointed to a large grey stone house at the far end of the street three stories tall sprawling with outflung wings to the right and left and surrounded by a high iron fence it stood in impressive solitude amidst an expanse of gardens at the end of a grand sweeping drive see archie that is his house it is called kettering house and it is very fine indeed she had been there only twice but knew the place well the first time she had come was as an uninvited guest to a summer party on the lawn the occasion had been the birthday of a prominent minor royal and peer of the realm and she newly arrived from london to visit her best friend had simply tagged along do come gem her friend had urged it will be such fun there will be ever so many peopleno one will even know youre there and vernon ashmole is the most handsome man youve ever seen egged on she overcame her innate reluctance and the two young women went along together and while it did seem that half the town turned out to help celebrate this illustrious citizens birthday someone did notice that she was there only a few minutes after slipping into a garden festooned with chinese lanterns and red silk bunting the pretty young women attracted the intense interest of his lordships son a glass of wine in his hand and a knowing smirk on his wellfeatured face he stared at the two young ladies with the predatory gaze of a lean and hungry wolf and then downing his wine in a gulp tossed aside the glass and strode to where they stood halfhidden inside a rose trellis how is it he began looking directly at gem that i know everyone here but i dont know you oh vernon i didnt see you sneaking up on us gasped her friend nonsense juliana replied the heir apparent never taking his eyes off the strange interloper now tell me who is this ravishing creature this is my dearest friend gemma burley said juliana somewhat taken aback by the young mans interest in her friend shes come up from london for a few weeks visiting i asked her to join me as i didnt want to come alone i hope you dont mind oh but im afraid i do mindterribly he protested it is a very grave infraction of the fearfully strict ashmolean code of social conduct my dears you simply cannot come barging into one of lord ashmoles festive celebrations unbidden there are dire consequences you see juliana laughed pay him no mind gem she said putting her flamered head near gemmas own dark curls hes joking i never joke about such things he insisted there are penalties what pray tell are the penalties laughed juliana with forced gaiety for such a grave social infraction gemma smiled nervously uncertain how to take this bold fellow whatever else he was juliana was right vernon ashmole was a most handsome young man you must dance every dance with me said vernon with a wink a punishment all out of proportion to the crime but there you are reaching for gemmas hand he coaxed her from the flimsy shelter of the arbour and out onto the lawn where tables had been set up with food and drink and a wooden floor had been laid over the grass a string ensemble was playing a strauss waltz and gemma was pulled into the gracefully spinning wheel of dancers the rest of the night passed in a giddy whirl of music wine and laughter vernon proved an engaging and attentive companion and before the long summer evening was over gemma burley was well and truly smitten the blossoming love affair was too much for juliana who ended their friendship that very night even so four years later gemmas most cherished memory was of that one magical evening when his lordships son had danced with only her the second time she had been inside the door of kettering house she preferred not to think about it was after she had been driven from the family home by her father who could not face the ignominy of an unmarried pregnant daughter vernon had brought her home to announce their matrimonial intentions to his own father the resulting scene was so harrowing gemma refused to dwell on itrelegating the unhappy memory to the outer darkness along with the regret recrimination and disappointment of the last four years but now this day a new future lay before them the misery and unhappiness of their plight was over when vernon saw them standing there on his doorstep he would instantly realise the difficulty his tardiness had caused he would embrace them and welcome them into his home their homeand they would assume their rightful place in his affections for there was no question that vernon loved her there had never been any question of thatshe had letters bundles of letters to prove it letters in which he vowed his undying adoration and devotion to her she had other letters he had written promising that they would be married as soon as it became possible and whenever he came to london on business vernon made time to visit herat first in the magdalene home and then at the flat he rented for them in bethnal green he sent them money too they would have been married long since but for the angry objection of vernons father the old lord archibald ashmole who took violent exception to what he considered his wastrel sons illicit dalliance and threatened to disinherit vernon if he so much as looked at gemma again nothing would do for the old lord but that his son should marry a woman from an aristocratic northern tribeespecially one whose family held extensive industrial assets in mining say or shippingdefinitely not some southern slattern from the wrong side of the thames needless to say the old lord knew nothing about the letters the visits or the flat and then against any such expectation the elder ashmole had dropped deadhustled off the worlds stage by a virulent case of the spanish influenza that had scourged the nation last year it had taken a few months for the dust to settle but vernon had come into his full inheritance and was now firmly installed as lord ashmole taking his place in the family pantheon of patriarchs moreover he was free to marry as he wished there was nothing now to prevent gemma and her sontheir sonfrom joining him at last and becoming the family they were always meant to be she had waited thinking any day that he would come for them a month went by and then another the money stopped gemma wrote letters they were unanswered two more months passed and finally at the end of her resources she had decided to come to him stepping boldly to the door she passed a motherly eye over the small boy beside her licked her thumb and rubbed a smudge from his little chin there thats better stand up straight and tall be a big boy now she told him then her hand shaking gemma took a deep breath and knocked on the door she waited a moment and knocked again there came a click from the other side and the great mahogany door swung open a servant in a black coat gazed imperiously at them yes he said his manner implying the opposite if you please melton she said its me gemma burley ive come to see vernon forgive me madam intoned the servant i did not recognise you he opened the door to allow them entry if you dont mind waiting here he said i will see if his lordship is receiving were expected gemma declared of course madam the two were left to stand in the vestibule was that my papa asked the boy when the servant had gone no my sweet that was one of your fathers servants he has many servants youll have to learn all their names i expect im tired said the boy i want to sit down not just yet said his mother in a little bit well all sit down together wont that be fine im hungry well have something good to eat very very soon i promise they waited the little boy fidgeting until they heard the sound of quick footsteps approaching here he comes archie smile and shake hands as i showed you gemma vernon cried almost bounding towards them what in heavens name are you doing here hello vernon she said trying to keep her voice steady as relief coursed through her like a rare tonic they had surprised him to be sure he was still in his silk dressing gown with his shirt collar open i wrote to tell you we were coming didnt you get my letter no my dear i received no such communication she studied his face and did not like what she saw there arent you glad to see us us he said distractedly archie and me she told him we simply could not wait any longer the darkhaired handsome man glanced down at the small round face peeking out from behind his mothers skirts how do you do said archie extending a small hand hello archibald you have grown a bit replied vernon bending to grasp the hand he held it for a moment then released it you should not have come he said rising once more to address the mother what do you mean its awkward i can explain but i thoughtthat is now that your father has passedyou said i know what i said he growled i said a lot of things we all say things you know that well never mind what is to be done about it now glancing down he gave the boy a thin smile we must find a way to get you home again vernon gasped gemma what are you saying weve left london for good weve come here to be with you to live with you im afraid that is not possible replied the lord stiffly things have changed my circumstances have changed i think it would be best if you were to take a room at the hotel near the station and i will come to you later and explain a hotel gemma could not help shrieking the word what has happened what has changed you said we would be married you promised lord ashmole became stiffly officious now listen to me take a room i will come to you later and well talk this over he turned and summoned melton to attend him the lady and her son are leaving he informed the valet send for a cab to take them to the hotel of course sir dont bother snapped gemma burley well find our own way she spun on her heel and marched to the door almost yanking the little boy with her outside she paused to gather her wits and little archie bewildered and frightened about what had just taken place began to cry his mother picked him up and holding him close for comfort and warmth murmured to him there now its going to be all right there has been some mistake is all im sure everything is going to be all right she was still standing there when the door opened again vernon in slippers stepped out his dressing gown billowing behind him as he ran at first she imagined he had come to confess that it was all a dreadful misunderstanding that he had repented of his folly and would now make it right then she saw the wallet in his hand i simply cannot bear to see you leave like this he said here take this he shoved the leather pouch at her please vernon she said her voice trembling why i cant im sorry gem he replied i meant to tell you i tried he thrust the wallet into the crook of her arm where she held their whimpering child it is all i have at the moment take it i dont want your money i cant give you anything else im sorry he took a step backwards already distancing himself from them but why vernon you loved me once we could have been happy we can still be happy together its over gem we come from such different worlds he spoke as if the words had been rehearsed until all meaning had leached from them my father was right it would never have worked out between us surely you can see that there was no reply she could make to that rejection he turned and without another word stepped back inside and closed the door on them gemma stunned simply stood in the cold and gazed at the tightly shut door as she turned to leave she caught a reflection in the bay window overlooking the porch and realised she could see into the roomthe morning room inside seated at a table spread for breakfast was a young lady she recognised juliana she gasped her empty stomach turning over as she watched vernon entered the room and pausing to kiss his new bride resumed his seat at the table gemma felt the earth shift beneath her feet as her world crumbled around her juliana in a silk dressing gown buttered her toast as if nothing had happened gemma had seen enough struggling to keep her head high she started down the long drive placing one foot in front of the other as if it somehow mattered now that her life was over stunned and confused her mind numb with shock she paused at the great iron gates at the entrance and glanced back over her shoulder for one last glimpse of what might have been a little later she came to herself once more they were in the town and people were passing them in the street im hungry whined archie tugging on her sleeve mummy im hungry well get something to eat now she said gathering her thin coat around her she looked at vernons wallet in her hand and opened it inside were three tenpound notes thirty pieces of silver she said absently staring at the money mum she stirred herself then taking the young boys hand come along my sweet one lets go find that bakery part two auspicious meetings chapter in which the aid of a good doctor is sought keep your mouth shut and your eyes open said douglas casting a critical eye over his accomplice the soupbowl haircut was good a little lopsidedsnipe refused to sit still beneath the shearsbut seemed all the more convincing for that and snipes sullen demeanour seemed especially wellsuited for the portrayal of a grudging medieval lackey im giving you a knife and i want you to keep it hidden right he slapped the youth on the cheek to centre his attention look me in the eye and listenthe knife is only to be used in extreme emergency i do not want a repeat of last time hear the lad ran his thumb along the blade drawing a bead of blood which he licked off yes its sharp enough douglas continued keep it out of sight i do not expect trouble but you never know he released his servant to finish preparing for the leap and turned to his own disguise he pulled the coarsewoven robe over his head adjusted it on his shoulders and knotted the simple corded belt his enquiries into the dress and manners of his hopedfor time and place had led him to believe that impersonating a travelling priest accompanied by a junior brother would be unlikely to raise comment or suspicion from the locals douglas felt as he always did a rising sense of anticipation and wondered if all the flinderspetrie men experienced the same sensation when thinking about their impending interdimensional expeditions certainly his father and grandfather had intimated as much for him it was like the turning of a tide a feeling that events were no longer stagnant but beginning to move in a single inexorable direction towards an inevitable destination a surge that in this particular instance would carry him to a longforgotten time and place oxford in the year if he had marked the positions along the ley correctly on previous factfinding trips he reckoned they had a decent chance of fetching up a month or two either side of october when the university would be active and the object of their quest easiest to locate this journey was the most ambitious he had made to date necessitating a lengthy and elaborate research process including among other things the rental of a town house on holywell street to serve as a staging area while he studied prepared snipe and gathered the sundry materials they would need for their assault on early medieval academia he had hired theatrical seamstresses and outfitters to provide him and his assistant with the necessary costumes he told them he was auditioning for a performance of one of shakespeares lesser known plays cymbeline and wanted sturdy serviceable clothing that not only looked authentic but could stand up to hard wear as he anticipated many performances he also demanded hidden pockets concealed in the voluminous sleeves and ample hem of the garments he engaged a medievalist from kings college london for a series of private coaching sessions to perfect the forms of address and chief customs of the day diligent practice and unstinting repetition had led to a flirting familiarity if not a complete mastery of the conventions of that faroff timeat least so far as could be determined with any accuracy at a remove of six hundred years or so the clothes and manners were the easy parts an outward appearance could always be made to correspond however roughly to an acceptable norm and modified as necessary communication however would be much more difficult in that it unerringly revealed the thought processes of the individual and the society of which any man is part and these change over time a nineteenthcentury businessman does not think or speak like a seventeenthcentury farmer much less like a thirteenthcentury priest thus communicating with a living person from a distant era would be most taxing to that end douglas had spent three years steeped in the study of early medieval latin happily experts in that arcane subject were thick on the ground in the university just now and he had no difficulty pursuing the rigours of the language as far as his own considerable intellect could carry him he had also taken great care to assemble an unassailable cover story to explain any glaring discrepancies or oversights on his partmistakes in his preparations which could not be foreseen but were sure to crop upand in this he schooled himself and snipe until both could recite it in their sleep they were visiting monks from clonfert in eire and had come to oxford to consult with scholars regarding some of the finer points of various doctrinal issues such as transubstantiation and angelic hierarchy such rustic monks while steeped in learning eschewed the ways of the world and were on the whole ignorant of current fashions and opinions maintaining as they did lives of semiseclusion and freedom from financial necessity on the other side of the equation douglas placed much hope in the assumption that the average englishman of the early medieval period was sufficiently uninformed of the world beyond the shores of england that any anomalies discrepancies or irregularities perceived in either himself or snipe would simply be accounted to the fact that they were strangers in a strange land snipe of course was the weak link in the closeforged chain douglas had so painstakingly constructed the young man could not read or write simple english let alone latin and it was always an open question whether the youth fully comprehended even the most basic points of human interaction or whether he just did not care to accommodate any manner of civilised discourse this was the reality of working with snipe and douglas had taken it fully into account accordingly he proceeded on the premise that if anyone should happen to overhear them speaking to one another the eavesdropper would simply conclude he was hearing some dialect of thirteenthcentury irish and not modern english should the need arise douglas stood ready to assist this false impression in sundry ways as for the various creature comforts he had provided himself with a small personal cache of silver and goldcast in tiny ingots or sticks as described in old manuscriptswhich he kept in a kidskin bag in the satchel but as common priests were not expected to carry much in the way of worldly wealth he would keep that out of sight and resort to it only as needed for most things he would depend on the kindness of strangers and the largesse of mother church the last but by no means least item to be secured was the location of the ley that they would employ to make the leap into medieval oxford initially this had posed an intractable difficulty try as he might douglas could not find any reference to a ley that had oxford as its destination or even southcentral england in the early middle ages none of his fathers papers or books none of the usual sources upon which he relied had so much as a mention of where such a ley might be found to be sure he did possess that portion of the skin map he had liberated from sir henrys trunk in the christ church crypt this was at present virtually worthless to him because the map was in his greatgrandfathers peculiar code which he could not read the very reason he aspired to in the first place douglas had begun to suspect the problem was insoluble when he remembered alfred watkins book the old straight track in the pages of that book he found not only a reference to an oxford ley but a simple handdrawn map of it as well ordinarily he would not have looked twice at this for after all ley lines always led to other places and times did they not the idea that there could be a ley in a certain place linking that same place to its otherdimensional counterpart had never occurred to him could there be selfconnecting leys he did not know yet it was a very simple theory to test all he had to do was find the oxford ley and try it and this he did one morning before dawnand before the traffic virtually consumed the roaddouglas armed with a diagram he had copied from watkins book walked out onto the high street a few false tries a lot of pacing retracing and sidestepping but he eventually sensed the tingle on his skin that told him he had located a ley after another attempt or two he achieved a successful crossinga fact not completely realised until he reached the crossroads and saw torches burning outside saint martins church douglas hurried to the crossroads he knew as carfax and paused to search for any clue that might establish the date of this particular iteration of oxford the buildings were mostly the same ones he recognised but of more recent age the streets were not paved with tarmac but with cobblestones heaps of dung mouldered at the street corner there was no one else around so he could not derive a guess from clothing he might have been able to delve a little deeper into this mystery but the sun was just rising and he knew that he must either depart again at once or spend at least one day and maybe more in this place he was not prepared for that so he ran back to the ley and made the jump back to the home worldalbeit three days later by the calendar over the next few weeks douglas made many more excursions calibrating by trial and error the distance coordinates along the ley that corresponded with what he thought of as the otherworld timescale in the end he succeeded in locating the era that formed the centre of his search as confirmed by the roll of vicars plaque on the wall of saint mary the virgin church satisfied that he had done all he could to prepare douglas pulled the hood over his robe settled it on his shoulders and stepped to the mirror the image reflected there was of a healthy and wellnourished man of middle height and weight dressed in a good serviceable robe of a country priest the newly shaved tonsure on his head completed the effect he smiled at his reflection come along snipe he said stepping quickly to the door it is time to go they walked out from the town house and proceeded towards the centre of oxford it was just before daybreak but being a busy modern city there were already a few people about they passed a milkman and his mule and some blackgowned students asleep in doorways at broad street a rag and bone man with his pushcart trundled along and on turl street the lamplighter with his pole was putting out the last lights if anyone marked the strange apparition of a pair of medieval monks flapping towards city centre they did not show it in a place like oxford where students still wore the vestiges of medieval robes to tutorials and their professors still addressed formal assemblies in latin things that might have been considered an oddity to be remarked upon anywhere else were merely too common to be afforded attention they followed turl street to the end and turned onto the high joining the ley line as it ran towards carfax here douglas paused ready snipe he asked do not be afraid and do not make a fuss you have done this before remember when this brought no response douglas gave him a light slap on the cheek remember the surly youth shook his head good then hold on he extended his hand to the lad who gripped it tight here we go they began walking very quickly along the street and douglas counted off the steps as he fell into the optimum stride he looked for the marker he had chalked on the base of gill the ironmongers shop a few meters from the corner as they approached the crossroads a gaggle of studentseither hastening to their studies or returning from the nights revelsstraggled by douglas first instinct was to turn and fleeto have his sudden and inexplicable dematerialisation publicly witnessed seemed far too risky he wavered on the brink of abandoning the attempt that impulse was swiftly jostled aside by another what did he care if a passel of blearyeyed scholastics got an eyeful what did it matter if they talked what difference would it make he saw the chalk mark and stepped up his pace a sound like a banshee howl reached them falling through the upper atmosphere in the same instant a stiff wind gusted out of nowhere driving a sudden rain shower the street and buildings the bus and its passengers all the world around them grew misty and indistinct then they were falling through darknessbut only for a moment the fractional interval between one heartbeat and the nextbefore striking solid earth again snipe stumbled upon landing and went down on hands and knees his lips curled in a curse that was interrupted by a gagging sound as his stomach heaved douglas too felt the incipient nausea bile surged up his throat but he swallowed it back down resisting the urge to shut his eyes he tried to maintain contact with some physical object fixing his gaze on the steeple of saint martins church rising like a dagger blade pointing towards the heart of heaven the queasy sensation passed and he drew fresh air into his lungs breathe snipe he advised the heaving boy beside him dont fight it will pass he glanced quickly around a pair of figures moved among the shadows a short distance awaytoo far to have seen them arrive he thought indeed the only living thing to have seen the translocation was a scrawny dog standing in the road a little way off its head lowered and hackles raised douglas kicked a dirt clod in its direction and the animal scurried off the light was dimbut was it early morning or evening he looked to the east and saw only darkness yet the western sky still held a glimmer of light nightfall then stand up snipe he commanded wipe your mouth we made it we are here the youth climbed to his feet and the two moved slowly on towards the church douglas paused at the crossroads to look both ways up and down each street getting his bearings much of the town that he knew was herein a general sense as old oxford of the medieval period remained in the outlines of the modern cityand he recognised it he knew where he was now to find out when that was the first item of businessto find out the exact date and time as the two travellers hurried across the road a monk carrying a large candle appeared in the doorway of the church the fellow proceeded to light the torches in the sconces either side of the door he turned saw the strangers and called to them in a language douglas assumed was some local dialect he had his reply ready pax vobiscum he said folding his hands before him and offering a small bow from the waist summoning his practised latin he said may grace attend you this night brother the monk responded likewise peace brothers he made to retreat into the church once more may god be good to you a moment brother called douglas striding forward we have just arrived in this place and have need of information the monk turned back and waited for them to come nearer have you travelled far he said his latin tinged by his broad oddly flattened accent far enough replied douglas i am charged with a duty to find one known as dr mirabilisa fellow priest i have it whose writings have reached us in eire the monk rolled his eyes you and all the rest of the world am i right in thinking that he reside hereabouts he does replied the monk without enthusiasm he has rooms in one of the university innsi cannot say which one he turned and started into the church perhaps you can tell me how best to find him douglas called after him he put on an expectant expression in the hope of coaxing more information from the reluctant fellow i must beg your pardon brother but no replied the monk over his shoulder however that is no hardship for unless you are supremely blessed you cannot safely avoid him chapter in which full disclosure takes a drubbing t he rumbling growl of the young cave cat announced the arrival of the new day waking the sleepers the burley men roused themselves and set about their allotted daily chores one to feed baby one to make breakfast one to see to the prisoners dex had drawn that last straw so slipping his feet into sandals and pulling on his desert kaftan he shuffled out of the tent the sun was up though still so low that the earlymorning light did little to penetrate the shadows of the wadi he drew a deep breath of clean morning air and yawning started for the tomb entrance since burleigh had ordered that no more food or water was to be given to the captives until they agreed to talk he did not bother filling the water can or food pan nor did he bother firing up the generator for the lights what he needed to learn could be discovered in the semidarkness of high priest anens tomb pressing a hand to the stairwell stone he descended the narrow steps into the tombs vestibule paused a moment to allow his eyes to adjust then proceeded into the first chamber he crossed the empty room to the door of the smaller second room wherein lay the remains of the great granite sarcophagus that had once contained the coffin of the high priest this room was secured by an iron grate all was quiet in the darkened chamber he approached no one stirred at his arrival dex stood listening for a moment but heard nothingneither the brush and rustle of men moving about nor even the intake and exhalation of sleeping men breathing the tomb was silent wakey wakey he called his voice loud in the emptiness youre wasting the best of the day he smiled at his little jest there was no response are you dead in there he called and considered that this was only too likely to be the case and that the captives had succumbed in the night following cosimo and sir henrytwo right royal pains in the arse if ever there wereinto the grave splendid now he would have to go and fire up the generator turn on the lights and then get the key and come back and deal with the bodies bloody bother muttered dex inwardly but before he went to all that trouble he decided to make sure the two remaining captives were not merely sleeping after all thinking to rattle the iron with a sound loud enough to rouse them he put his hand to the grate and gave it a shake the door swung open at his touch the burley man pushed it open and stepped inside he could dimly make out the great bulk of the stone sarcophagus in the centre of the room but the rest of the chamber remained steeped in darkness he could not see into the corners but a heavy stillness lay all about and the air reeked with the sickly pungent sweet stench of death pressing the back of his hand to his nose dex turned and fled the room what are we doing in this awful place anyway he wondered whats the point back outside he sucked in clean air then went to the equipment room to crank the generator to life and switch on the lights he paused at the mess tent to dip the hem of his kaftan in some vinegar then returned to the tomb this time with the lights on and the vinegarsoaked material over his mouth and nose he confirmed what he feared the captives were gone spinning on his heel he ran back up the stairs and out into the wadi shouting the prisoners have escaped con and mal were still in the bunk tent and seemed unimpressed with this news pipe down will you muttered mal a hand to his head its too early to be yelling like that whatre you on about asked con the prisoners arent in the cell theyre gone they must have escaped somehow you sure mal regarded him with suspicion of course im sure idiot okay okay keep your shirt on what about the other two asked con they still there which other two the dead ones who do you think yeah theyre still there they still dead wondered mal shut up snarled dex im warning you they cant have got far con said well find em you better hope soand before tav gets back he wont like this the three trooped out into the canyon ill get baby said con maybe she can track them down i doubt it said dex leave her go get the guns instead those two yobs dont know their way around the wadi so we should still be able to catch them before they work out how to get out of here armed and keen to recover their charges the three burley men set off to work their way along the two main branches of the dry ravine mal you check out the back way ordered dex and conyou come with me well take the big wadi the other stood looking at him well lets get cracking mal turned and soon disappeared along the winding path that was the canyon bottom dex and con made their way towards its mouth moving quickly senses alert to any stray sight or sound they passed the burial niches of a former age and civilisation quickly searching those large enough to hide a fugitive or two after walking at least halfway to the end they stopped to reassess the chase maybe they went up over the top suggested con if theyd have come this way we would have picked up some trace of them by now could be youre right agreed dex and we would have heard mals signal if hed found anything lets go back theres a cutting back there at the bend we can climb up that way and have a good look round the two retraced their steps following the undulating gorge back towards the camp at the benda great curving bank of mottled sandstonethe wadi made a lazy quartercircle from southwest to a more northerly direction a deep natural crevice in the rock face had been widened by the tomb builders at some time in the past and shallow steps were cut in the stone to form a crude staircase leading up out of the wadi to the plateau above the two scrambled up the crease eventually gaining the top whatever they hoped to glimpse from that high vantage they did not see a quick scan of the surrounding area revealed only the drearily unchanging landscape sunblasted rocks and shattered hills stretching into the heatdazzled distance in every direction of the fugitives there was neither sign nor trace still they waited awhile shielding their eyes from the sun surveying the empty duncoloured landscape for any sign of movementany sign of life at all there was nothing now what con wanted to know he wiped the sweat from his face if they were anywhere around wed have seen em from up here we should get back to camp dex said tav will return soon well have to give him the bad news burleigh aint going to be happy con observed no he wont be happy it aint our fault dex shrugged it aint con insisted you tell him that you get on so well with him he listens to you right you can tell him how it wasnt our fault the prisoners let themselves out while we were asleep con muttered an oath under his breath lets get back dex started for the rockcut staircase leading down to the wadi floor whats so almighty important about those two anyway con asked growing sullen they didnt look like no threat to me pretty near hopeless in fact dex shrugged again i guess thats another thing you can discuss with the boss me i keep my mouth shut and do as im told the boss has his ways i stopped trying to figure it all out years ago by the time they reached the camp mal was waiting for them his search had been no more successful and he had nothing to report looks like they got clean away dex concluded looks like agreed mal im starving im going to get something to eat good idea agreed con the two started for the mess tent dex with nothing better to do followed the sun had long since passed midday by the time tav returned the men heard the rattling sputter of the truck echoing down the canyon long before it came into view they instinctively assembled themselves before their tent weapons at their sides to await his arrival the claptrap vehicle came to a dry scrunching halt in a cloud of dust the door swung open and burleighs righthand man stepped out one glance at the others standing at loose attention roused his suspicions what is it he asked what have you done its the captives replied dex are they dead then theyre gone gone his glance took in the others who hung back waiting to see how he would greet this news tav frowned escaped i see tavs eyes narrowed his frown grew fierce we searched both ways up and down the wadi volunteered con we even went up top we searched half the morning but we couldnt raise so much as a footprint you looked everywhere youre sure everywhere confirmed dex i swear it then theres nothing to be done about it now concluded tav strike the camp load it upeverything boss wants it all cleared out were done here weve got until sunset so jump to it what do we tell the boss asked con the truth replied tav he wont like it con had an uncanny ability to grasp the obvious and of all the implications of the situation this was the one that had taken firm root in his mind he wont like it at all i dont expect he will confirmed tav then i say we dont tell him we have to tell him countered mal why demanded con hell find out eventually suggested dex so if he ever does find out we just say they were still alive when we left here they must have got out somehow after we packed up that might work agreed dex im with con telling burleigh they escaped will only get us in trouble and it wont make a beans worth of difference anyway what about you mal are you with the other two mal shrugged i guess tav was quiet for a long moment he raised his eyes to the sky and seemed to contemplate the faint horsetail wisp of high cloud he saw drifting there the silence became an oppressive force and the burley men were already wincing with anticipated pain when tav drew a deep breath as if preparing himself to deal out desolation in heavy doses and said thats it then dont breathe a word of this to the boss if he finds out we know nothing about it which isnt far from the truth anyway just then a roar that resounded down the wadi walls announced that a very hungry cave cat had not yet been fed and was growing exceedingly peeved at the situation con see to baby it wont do to have that creature scrapping at everyone along the way what about the generator wondered mal what are we supposed to do with that i dont care what you do with it just get rid of it wipe out any trace that we were ever here got it when no one moved tav added what are you waiting for move as if startled into life the burley men jolted away each hurrying off on his own separate errand it was not the first time they had decamped at a moments notice and it would not be the last where are we going called dex backing off a step at a time never you mind tav answered were done herethats all you need to know chapter in which an identity is mistaken a fortnight of rain and indecent weather had left the horses lethargic and indifferent to the commands of the rider what they wanted was a good fast chase across the downs to get their pure blood racing again and remind them what sort of creatures nature intended them to be at least that was lady fayths assessmenta view upheld by her father capital cried lord fayth when informed of his daughters wish to ride across the estate to the next village tell her that i will accompany her we will take tea on our return of course my lord replied chalmers sir edwards butler shall i notify the stables of his lordships intentions no need i shall do it myself i will be going out as soon as i finish reviewing the accounts as you will sir after a light lunch of kippers and toast sir edward went to the stables where lady fayth was checking the straps and harness on her mount hello my darling he bussed her cheek then noticed the saddle i hope you are not thinking to ride with that he said distaste tugging down the edges of his mouth hello father she replied sweetly why whatever do you mean she glanced around at the saddle is there something wrong with the tack i have chosen in all honesty haven if you insist on riding like a man i do believe you deserve whatever fate befalls you the only thing likely to befall me today is a splash of mud on my new boots she lifted the hem of her dress and extended one shapely booted foot for his inspection do you like them yes very nice but see here no you see here do you really expect me to ride sidesaddle in a samite gown and wimple you think this a cause for levity do you perish the thought my lord i assure you i give this matter all the seriousness it deserves seeing there was no arguing with herthere was never any way to gain the upper hand with the headstrong girllord fayth relented have it your way my dear he said but do not come crying to me when you find yourself a wizened spinster of twentyfive because all the eligible young men have shunned you as a pariah is that likely to happen she seemed to consider this and then smiled no she laughed i cannot foresee that at all in any event it is years away and by then the shocking indiscretion of this day will be long forgottenif not overshadowed by some other ever greater transgression so come father dearest she looped her arm through his let us ride while the sun is shining and we still have our good name i will race you to the village green the ride over the open hills and uplands of the western portion of clarivauxs vast acreage was an exercise in exhilaration lady fayth whose regard for her mount was suspect at the best of times gave herself to the race and easily outdistanced her fatherwhich was not entirely surprising for a man with both weight and age against him she was strolling on the village green when he joined her you ride like a hellion he told her bluntly it will be a miracle if you do not break your pretty neck one day thank you father she replied but i thought you were constitutionally unable to believe in miracles your brother henry believes enough for both of youis that not what you always say hmph lord fayth patted the neck of his mount and looked around i fancy a tot of ale let us have a drink none of that his daughter chided it is much too early in the day and besides we will have tea waiting for us at home remember he gave another snort and dismounted lady fayth strolled to her father and took his hand someone has to keep an eye on your wellbeing my lord what will you do without me do without you he wondered it is what to do with you that keeps me awake nights i am in earnest sir she pressed her fathers hand for emphasis you know i only have your best interest at heart who will look after you while i am away i daresay i shall survive the ordeal my dear onerous as it may be i only hope henry can say the same when the year is out all being well i shall come up to london for christmas across the green his lordships eye caught the sign of the village bakery if we are not to imbibe a stirrup cup let us at least bring home something tasty to have with our tea they tethered their horses on the green and strolled to the bakery where lord fayth selected an assortment of sweetmeats and fruited breads to be boxed and taken back to the manor as an accompaniment to afternoon tea owing to his seat on the board of the east india trading company lord fayth like his father before him enjoyed a ready supply of the new commodity and saw it as his sworn duty to propagate the use of the substance in every way possible upon their return they saw that another horse had joined theirs on the green the rider was nowhere to be seen there is a splendid animal sir edward said approvingly the man who owns that knows something of horses i daresay lady fayth regarded the creature with its shiny black coat white fetlocks and white blaze star in the middle of its broad forehead she did not share her fathers passion for all things fourlegged but knew a good nag when she saw one it is a fine specimen she agreed i wonder whom it belongs to as if in answer to her question they heard a voice calling to them and turned to see a man just then emerging from the inn i say hello there he called again they stopped and waited for him to approach is this your horse sir asked lord fayth indeed it is sir replied the stranger lady fayth cast an appraising glance over the tall man striding quickly across the green towards them he carried himself with a bold confidence that seemed wellsuited to his dark good looks this is aquilo he said indicating the horse lady fayth regarded the man instead with his long black hair proud moustaches and flamboyant sideburns the stranger gave every appearance of one who was part horse himself i hope you do not mind sharing a bit of the green before either of them could answer the fellow bent his long torso in a crisp bow archelaeus burleigh earl of sutherland at your service whom do i have the pleasure of addressing i am sir edward fayth and this is my daughter haven answered her father lady fayth smiled and offered her hand which the man who called himself burleigh accepted and after the briefest hesitation raised to his lips his eyes however never left her face charmed he said as she pulled her hand from his grasp you are a long way from home sutherland observed lord fayth mildly what brings you to our patchif i may be so bold not at all sir it is a long storywhich i shall not presume to inflict on youbut suffice to say that i am thinking of buying a property hereabouts it is so very cold and dreary in the north i have reached the time in life where i believe one must have a southern redoubt if one is to survive from one winter to the next indeed sir barked sir edward all amiability and smiles i could not agree more if not for the tenants i would consider a more permanent southern sojourn burleigh explained almost apologetically but with such a great many of them what with seven towns and villages within the glen ardvreck boundaries he paused forgive me i am woolgathering northern habit i fear i am sorry think nothing of it sir offered lord fayth grandly i quite understand this is a beautiful corner of the world i say he brightened with a sudden thought if you are at a loose end this evening would you like to come to dinner nothing fancy mind just an informal private supper bring lady burleigh of course and anyone else in your party lord burleigh glanced at lady fayth and hesitated well i ah i have sprung it on you thoughtless of me i suspect you have another engagement no no nothing like that burleigh countered hastily i am so newly arrived i have no other engagements at present and as for lady burleigh welli am entirely on my own my dear wife died several years ago and i have never remarried he offered a wistful smile i am entirely without encumbrance at present and i would be delighted to accept your kind offer capital replied lord fayth moving towards his horse we will expect you around half seven i will be there they left the earl of sutherland on the village green lady fayth made a point not to look at him again there was something about the man she did not trust entirelya touch of ruthlessness around the mouth a coldness in his dark eyes something she could not name but which put her on her guard later when they had returned their horses to the stables and were walking back to the house lord fayth observed good man that burleigh oh really she stopped walking you had heard of him then how should i have heard of him he said himself hes only just come south indeed he is an earl my dear asserted his lordship sits a peg or two above our station i daresay a fine gentlemanas anyone can plainly see he glanced sideways at his daughter do you disagree i do not profess to know the man i fail to see how anyone can form a cogent opinion based on a few pleasantries muttered in passing ha her father continued striding across the gravelled yard obviously you are no judge of character my dear breeding always tells these words were still echoing in her mind when after their cosy meal of cold mutton and turnip mash talk turned to families and mutual connections the men might share the three were sitting in her fathers study where a fire had been laid the men were sipping brandy and haven was pretending to occupy herself with a swatch of needlepoint the same piece she had been working on for over a year to no appreciable effect she was listening to their talk and trying to decide where to place burleigh precisely in her estimationan ordinarily simple matter for a young woman of strong opinion and quick judgement but for some reason the earl was proving extremely elusive in this regard every time she felt she had gained an understanding he would say somethinga turn of phrase an observation a single word eventhat confused her and put her usually reliable feminine intuition out of joint of course burleigh was saying as he swilled his brandy around the rim of the bowl as a student of the natural sciences myself i am sure i would find your work fascinating i hazard a surmise that we might even share some of the same interests my work lord fayth frowned i must confess that i do not dabble in the sciences sir these modern men of inquiry he sniffed and took a sip of brandy not worth a boot rag the lot of them if you ask me for the first time that evening burleighs expression betrayed confusion and something else shock whatever it was haven thought she had glimpsed something of the real man beneath the veneer of aristocratic indifference perhaps i misunderstand you sir he suggested delicately and his manner resumed its easy bonhomie i do not think i could be any clearer on the subject this science will be the death of us all father said lady fayth speaking up i think our guest has confused you with sir henry oh is that so lord fayth turned to burleigh once more ah yes i see of course sir henry wondered burleigh my lunatic brother henry faythhes completely taken in by all this natural science tosh a wicked waste of a mans time if you want my opinion before burleigh could respond to this provocative sentiment lady fayth challenged her fathers assertion he is not a lunatic dear father far from it uncle henry is one of the wisest men i know she smiled at burleigh adding my uncle is a charming and gracious manand one of the leading lights of the new sciences mad as a march hare put in edward always has been lives alone in london like a monk in a cella miserable hermit never married claims it would interfere in his valuable work though what that is god knows cant make head or tail of his gibberish father really chided haven you give our guest entirely the wrong impression please i assure you i have formed no impression whatsoever offered burleigh i prefer to take things as i find thema practice that has served me well all my life good for you sir affirmed lord fayth he reached for the decanter more brandy my lord earl conversation moved on to local matterschiefly farming horses and houndsand lady fayth having endured enough of what she considered boorish blather announced that it was time for her to retire i will leave you two to set the world to rights she said lightly lord burleigh it was very nice making your acquaintance i pray your stay in the southlands is entirely to your edification and profit i thank you my lady he said even in my short acquaintance i have found the folk hereabouts very much to my liking edification will surely follow in its course he rose from his chair and took her offered hand i wish you a good night and pleasant dreams he patted her hand then kissed it until we meet again i very much doubt that we shall replied lady fayth i am away to london in the morning and plan to be there for some time but inasmuch as i expect you and my father will find all sorts of pursuits with which to occupy yourselves you shant miss me in the least chapter in which wilhelmina learns the ropes before egypt long before travelling to that time and placeor any otherbecame even a remote possibility mina had paid her dues haltingly painstakingly maddeningly transplanted entirely on her own and completely unexpectedly from her twentyfirstcentury london home to seventeenthcentury bohemia and having no cosimo or sir henry to guide her she acquired her knowledge and skill through hard graft and a long and exhausting process of trial and error it was an exacting apprenticeship and it began back in the grand imperial kaffeehaus in prague on the day she took delivery of the device her friend gustavus rosenkreuz had made for her using the plans given him by lord burleigh it began the moment the young alchemist placed the curious object in her hand now as she stood alone on a hilltop north of her adopted city wilhelmina studied the odd device neatly rounded like a stone and of a similar size shape and heft it reminded her of just that a surftumbled cobble whose edges have been blunted and streamlined by the endless wash and worry of the waves that however is where the similarities ended stones were not made of burnished brass their surfaces were not chased with a lacy arabesque of filigreed lines wavetumbled rocks did not feature a curved row of tiny holes along one side nor sport a knurled dial moreover beach stones did not possess a central aperture that resembled a squinting eye from which radiated a gently pulsating indigo lightat least not in minas experience this last she had not seen herself but had it on gustavus authority that it was so the substance inside gives off light when it comes into contact with certain ethers the young alchemist had told her mina had no idea what these ethers were but how the device was to be used was another matter as she pored over the peculiar instrument she mustered the scant facts she possessed and tried to imagine how they might be applied to the task at hand the instrument had been made according to a design supplied by lord burleigh to be employed by him for what the alchemists called astral exploration if her hunch was right the earls explorations were connected in some way to ley travel the peculiar phenomenon that had plucked her from the twentyfirst century and dropped her so rudely into the seventeenth from what she could recall of the information kit had impartedfractured and confused as it wasand her own limited experience ley travel was a thoroughly unpleasant and wholly unpredictable exercise that nevertheless could yield serendipitous results and she was determined to repeat the procedure and if possible master it although she no longer wished to return home to londona lack of desire that she could not explain even to herselfas an unwitting transplant in an alien world she felt it something of a duty to learn more about the means and mechanisms by which she had come to take up residence in another time and place burleighs device she supposed had something to do with facilitating such leaps or calibrating them in some way and this was where she would start she had decided that her experiments should take place in solitude reasoning that whatever happened it would be best if it happened out of sight so as not to alarm any casual passersby so after thoughtful deliberation on how to safely embark on the venture at hand she had told etzel that she wanted to go breathe some country air and perhaps collect some wildflowers it was after all in the country that she had landed following her first and only ley jump leaving the coffee shop she took the wagon out of the city and up into the surrounding hills the day was bright and fine an unseasonably warm spring was swiftly melding into summeras good a day as any for an experiment in ley travel holding the device in her hand she puzzled over how to start as she recalled her first leap had been made simply by walking with purpose so mina began striding along the hilltop holding the device before her as if it were a flashlight and she was trying to find a darkly hidden path she stepped off fifty paces turned and walked back when the expected result failed to materialise she did the same thing in another direction and obtained the same disappointing result the mechanism remained happily inert and uninvolved in her efforts undeterred she took herself to a new spot farther away and tried again this went on for some time and with no different result after a while mina began to feel discouragednot that she had expected to conquer the device easily but she felt her efforts entitled her to some small reward for her determination if not for the considerable effort she had made to obtain it in the first place in the end she slipped burleighs gismo into the pocket of her smock collected a large bouquet of wildflowers and bundled them into the wagon for the drive back to town over the next few weeks she would try her experiments again in various locations around the outskirts of the city each time she returned better for the exercise but no closer to unravelling the mystery of ley jumping then one day it happened quite by accident and on another errand entirely she was walking along a sunny open stretch of the moldau the river dividing the city she strolled through the lower town and out into the fields and farming hamlets of the countryside and as always had thoughts of the coffee house percolating away on the back burner of her mind she had an eye peeled for a new source of honey for the bakery her city purveyors all bought theirs in bulk from rural sources and offered it to her at a price that included a tidy profit for themselves well and good but engelberts recipes were using more and more sweetening as their patrons demanded pastries to compliment the natural bitterness of the coffee honey was the costliest ingredient and mina had begun thinking about contracting directly with country beekeepers to supply the commodity fresh from the source by cutting out the middleman both she and the beekeeper would get a better price and she could guarantee a constant ready market she walked along beneath a sky of birdsegg blue past fields of ripening barley beets turnips and beans small herds of cattle flocks of sheep and geese the river rolled away to her right its long slow currents barely ruffling the quiet jadegreen surface mother ducks surrounded by a flotilla of halfgrown ducklings paddled among the weeds growing long at the banks the little ones dibbling for insects and bits of edible flotsam a dairyman walking beside his donkey cart approached on the lane that ran along the bank he tipped his hat as he passed the air was momentarily filled with the slightly sour milky scent of the dairy and wilhelmina was instantly plunged back into a time and place she scarcely remembered ever having been a farm in kent when she was barely six years old it was a school trip and her class had visited a farm that produced the milk she and her classmates drank every day from little bottles the farmer had shown them into the separating room to see the huge machines at work dividing the raw milk from the cream the smell of the roomstrongly pungent and steeped in the sharp rancid odour of fermenting cheesehad so overwhelmed her young senses that it remained with her ever after she greeted the farmer and then paused to watch him on his way breathing in the scent as he passed mina was still thinking about that school trip so long forgotten but vividly revived when the lane turned to follow a bend in the river and passed into a beech wood copse the sunlight through the trees threw dappled shadows on the path and she was looking at the pattern as she walked she happened to slip her hand into her pocket and brushed burleighs device to her surprise it was warm to the touch she looked down and saw a deep blue light burning through the fabric of her smock the thing was glowing she stopped and with trembling fingers drew out the brassencased device a strong blue light streamed through the little holes that lined the curve of one side and through the central halfmoon aperture as well something had stirred the instrument to life but what mina gazed around her she noted the trees the leafshadowed lane the wide sweep of the river and even the cloudspotted sky above and the birds soaring there she regarded everything yet saw nothing she supposed might trigger the sudden awakening of the curious little gismo that was even now filling her hand with an appreciable warmth slowly keeping her eyes on the object she began walking again the lane curved as it followed the river and gradually the light in burleighs object faded she kept walking until the last little glimmer of blue light died she turned and retraced her steps as she half expected after a few steps the glow rekindled a few more steps and the glow grew brighter she marched a dozen swift paces along the lane moving out from the shelter of the copse the softly glowing blue light slowly faded once more and the device cooled in her palm she stopped and certain that she stood on the brink of discovery made a slow aboutface and moved once more into the copse the deep indigo light returned and this time she imagined she heard a small squeaking soundalmost like the chirp of a baby bird still walking slowly she held the device to her ear and confirmed that yes indeed the thing was speaking to her instinctively she put her finger to the tiny knurled nub on the surface of the device and gave it a twist the peeping sound grew louder hello she muttered to herself its a volume knob still walking slowly she noted when the blue glow began to fade once more then instead of waiting until it went out altogether she spun on her heel and headed back the opposite way still holding the instrument out in front of her at the exact place where the light was brightest and the sound the loudest she stopped burleighs mechanism was obviously marking the place but try as she might she could not see why she stood perfectly still and gazed at the little woodland glade around her what was different or special about this place what was the gismo trying to tell her she cast her mind back to the first time she had made a leap something that kit had said about lines etched on the landscape came drifting back into her consciousness and she looked for anything that might resemble a line although it took a few moments the realisation finally dawned on her that she was in fact staring right at it a perfectly straight course through the beech copse a thin trail with trees on either side and the merest trace of a path on the ground like that wild animals madea fox run perhapsbut straight as an arrow until losing itself in the deep shade of the little wood wilhelmina swallowed and found that not only had her mouth gone dry but her heart was beating very fast this is it she said to herself this is one of those leys her feet were already on the path before she had even decided what to do walking steadily into the grove her eyes fixed on the stoneshaped instrument she noted that the glowing light began to pulse gently with every step the faint chirping sound did not grow louder but the squeaks came faster she stepped up her pace and the chirps came more quickly a breeze stirred the nearby leaves the branches overhead moved with a sudden gust and darkness descended over heras if she had moved into the deep shade of a large tree just that nothing else three more steps carried her out from the shadow of the tree and into a broad sunlit glade the beechy copse was gone the curving riverbank was gone too along with the surrounding fields and hills instead she stood in a pool of bright sunlight at the bottom of a deep canyon behind her stretched a long incline etched into the cliff face leading to the grassy sward on which she stood towering over her on every side were high limestone cliffs and directly below her a shallow river sloshed around the huge stones and boulders littering the valley floor she heard a ragged screech and glanced up to see a hawk soaring through the cool bright air mina youre not in bohemia anymore she whispered her voice falling softly in the silence of the glade the device in her hand still glowed softly but was no longer sounding what a clever little thing she thought and then what shall i call you ley lamp she decided on a whim and the name seemed to fit curious about where she had landed wilhelmina proceeded to look around taking care not to wander too far lest she lose her bearings she tucked the ley lamp into her pocket and continued down the path to the bottom of the canyon around the next bend the valley widened the limestone walls receded someone had planted fields of corn on the rich flat ground either side of the river a short distance ahead she could see a few stone and timber buildings but there was no one about as mina approached the buildings the riverside trail became a twintrack road that ran through the tiny settlement and on through the little farmyard and around another bend since no one seemed to be about she paused to look inside one of the buildings as she passed it was a simple animal shed with straw covering the floor and an empty manger below a squared hole in the wall which served as a window she moved on following the road as it wound round the bend in the heights above her another hawk had joined the first and both soared in slow wheeling circles just around the bend she saw that someone had made a dam of river rocksa primitive construction of stones heaped one atop another across a narrow part of the river the water pooled nicely behind this simple barrier forming a wide placid pond on a rock ledge just above the pond stood a stout stone building which on closer inspection turned out to be a ruin the roof was gone and two of the four walls had tumbled into rubble but the remains of a great wooden wheel and several grindstones lay amongst the jumble of wreckage a mill mina surmised the thing had long been derelict weeds grew in the rubble and grass had seeded itself on the upper courses of stone and the ledges of what had been windowsills but someone still used the pond for she saw a rope tied to an iron ring in the wall overlooking the water and on the end of the rope a wooden bucket she stood for a moment wondering where she was and when so far as she could tell she could be anywhere at nearly any time the things she saw around her certainly had an antique air about them but little more than that the surrounding landscape gave almost no clue to her whereabouts it was nowhere she had ever been but it could have been in any number of countries still something about the construction rude as it was seemed european rather than say south american definitely not asian what to do now she raised her eyes to the sky the light had taken on the golden sheen of late afternoon and the already faint warmth in the air was fading the shadows of the canyon walls were lengthening and deepening towards evening she did not care to be caught wandering around in the dark so she turned and hurried back the way she had come upon reaching the spot where she had entered the valley mina pulled the ley lamp from her smock and holding it as before started walking quickly up the long ramplike trail angled towards the top of the canyon walls after a halfdozen steps the bronzecased instrument began to glow with its eerie indigo light a few more steps and she heard the faint chirping sound she kept walking the path rose between two rock stacks which stood as pillars on either hand wilhelmina passed through this crude gateway and into a shadow for an instant all was darkness and an absence of air her breath caught in her throat and she stumbled forward and into the little beech wood with its narrow fox run of a trail she stood blinking as her eyes adjusted to the light the air was soft and warm and sunlight streamed through the leaves in shafts which dappled the grove around her she was home halfway back to the city it occurred to her to wonder if she had returned to the same time she had left was it still the seventeenth century was rudolf still on the throne was the bakery still there would etzel be waiting for her her heart sank and for a good few minutes she entertained a wild variety of frightening thoughts about all the things that could have gone wrong she kicked herself for how stupid she had been what after all did she really know about this ley line business but then she heard church bells the sound rang out filling the streets and echoing across the river and beyond the familiar sound called her back to her senses and somehow she knew that all was well she quickened her steps as she passed through the city gates and hastened to the old town square when she saw the good greenandwhite facade of the grand imperial kaffeehaus she smiled etzel was there in his flourdusted apron just as she had left him he looked up as she came in his round face beaming as she bustled into the shop although there were several patrons lingering over their afternoon coffees she went up and gave the big baker a fat kiss on his smooth cheek mina he exclaimed cupping a floury hand to her face i thought you were going for a walk i did he regarded her askance but you only left a moment ago mina shrugged i changed my mind i would rather be here with you but you are with me all the time he pointed out i know she kissed him again and went upstairs to her room there with the door closed she removed the ley lamp from her pocket and crossed to the large chest where she kept her clothes and the few valuable things she owned she unlocked the chest and wrapped the brass instrument in a stocking i wonder she thought as she tucked the bundle under her spare nightdress at the bottom of the chest what else can it do chapter in which sheer bloodyminded persistence is rewarded it would be a happier world where each child enjoyed the love and care of two devoted parents to supply a firm foundation on which to build a solid and productive adult life but sadly that is not our world and it is not the world into which archibald burley was born little archies story is darker more desperate and yet drearily familiar how not we have heard it all before a story old as time and repeated daily the world over we can recite it by heart for the plight of unwed mothers is too too predictable and gemma burleys descent from prim and respectable kensington to noisome crowded bethnal green is almost too banal to report in detail still that is the task before us if we are to understand all that flowed from that initial rejection of her and her son by the boys father and all that was to come after archie moaned gemma her voice ragged and low archie come here my darling i need you the boy crept to the doorway slender shoulders hunching already dreading the request he knew was coming im out of medicine you must run and get me some more she held out her hand here is some money aw mum he whined do i have to look at me archie he raised his eyes to her ravaged face hair filthy and matted her dress soiled missing buttons she no longer looked like the woman he knew im sick and i need my medicine she insisted strength coming to her voice now you come here and take this money moving slowly to the side of her bed he regarded his mother her face haggard dark circles under her dull eyes her forehead pale there was sweat on her upper lip and her flesh looked waxy he had seen her this way before and knew with a sinking heart that there would be no supper for him tonight he held out his hand for the few coins she gave him now you be a good boy and run along head down the slender body turned and feet dragging the lad started away dont dawdle archie promise me i wont theres a good boy off with you now and hurry back well have bread and cheese for your tea the sooner you come back the sooner you can have your bread and cheesewell toast it too you like that dont you archie you like your bread and cheese toasted i know you do thats what well have as soon as you get back you run along now she sank back exhausted theres a good boy outside archie flitted down the cinder path behind the house he and his mother shared with other itinerant lodgers his fist closed tight on the three coins she had given himtwo farthings and a sixpence piece tucking the coins into his pocket he darted down the alley dodging puddles of standing water and fresh slops emptied from kitchen buckets and chamber pots at the end of the alley he picked up his speedhed have to hurry now to still have time enough once hed got the medicine to make it back to the greengrocer and buy or steal another apple or two to sell on the bridge before the bakery closed then again if luck smiled on him there would be dayold bread out back and he could get that for free and besides stale bread was better for toasting anyway once on the street archie ran to the nearest chemist and knowing better than to go in hurried round to the back he pounded on the door until it rattled keep yer shirt on mate growled a voice from the other side a chain was unlatched and a bearded face pressed itself into the space between doorpost and door oh said the man with undisguised disappointment its you what is it this time no let me guessyou want more laudanum please sir its for me mum shes terrible sick you got money the boy held up the silver sixpence wait here said the chemist the door closed archie stood in the backyard shifting from one foot to the other aware that the sun was lowering the daylight soon fading it would be late before he could reach the bridge with an apple or two to sell in a moment the door opened once more let me have it said the man shoving out his hand archie dropped the coin into the extended palm which was withdrawn and replaced by a small brown jar tell yer mam she still owes me for last time hear ill tell her archie was already running back to the lodging the jar safely in his pocket his mother was up waiting for him at the door when he returned berating him for being slow he handed over the jar and dashed away again before she could detain him further he heard her call something after him but ignored it and ran on once on the street he flew pellmell down the beaten dirt road dodging the carts and pedestrians until he reached the shops at the wide intersection the greengrocer was already closing up for the day and the boy had a hard decision to makewait until the shop was closed and try to find something in the refuse heap in the alley behind or bargain with the grocer using the two farthings he had left the evening lull was coming on the time between the days traffic and the nights was no time to be selling fruit if he did not hurry he might not get another sale today and night was no time to be abroad though only eight years old archie already knew that nothing good happened on the streets of bethnal green after dark digging in his pocket he snatched up the two farthings and ran to the shop the greengrocer was just doing up the last shutter three apples he gasped breathless im closed up boy please sir no come back tomorrow please sir theys fer me mum he whined putting on his best street urchin accent it was the one hed learned since arriving in the neighbourhood a year or so ago and most useful for wheedling and begging shes full sick she is an asked me to fetch her some apples to help get her well like cant you see ive closed up i got moneyi can pay yers the shopkeeper straightened turned and looked at the boy for the first time youre the brat as been thieving my stock of late no sir lied archie i ent nivver stole nuffin you look like the one archie extended a grubby hand with the two small coins its just three apples he offered a forlorn smile fer me sick mum see god help us sighed the greengrocer i must be going soft in the head he turned back to the door of his shop wait here archie stood on the pavement at the door while the shopkeeper rustled about inside the fellow reappeared a moment later with three goodsized apples there he said holding them out the boy reached for them the money first he said archie delivered the coins and received the apples he stuffed two of them in his trouser pockets and ran away again a word of thanks would be in order shouted the greengrocer after him thanks called archie without breaking his stride he ran until he reached the bridge taking up his customary spot as he suspected the traffic passing from one side of the city to the other had already begun to dwindle there were few foot travellers and carts and even fewer horsedrawn carriages yet there were still some making their way from the city to the suburbs he polished up an apple until it shone and then went to work approaching each carriage as it passed and calling loudly buy an apple from an orphan buy an apple help an orphan with the better prospectscarriages containing welldressed ladies and gentlemenhe often ran beside the vehicle a little way sometimes when they saw his determination they stopped and he made a good sale he did not bother approaching pedestrians or any of the hundreds of handcart pushershe never got anything from them but blunt abuse he tried each coach that came his way but the passengers of the first two did not even look out to see him the third and fourth vehicles likewise rolled on without stoppingas did the next three he had to wait for the next carriage to come by but when it did he managed to make three pencethis from a whitebearded gentleman in a tall silk hat after that there were no more carriages to be seen in either direction archie waited for a while watching the shadows deepen around him and listening to the wash of the river beneath the bridge there were still a few handcart pushers coming his way and some workers and others on foot but no carriages he wondered if it might be a good idea to run along the embankment to the next bridge maybe the traffic there was better and he might still make a sale just as he was about to abandon his post a lone coach bumped onto the bridge from the opposite end archie polished the apple on his shirt once more and put on his most abjectly hopeful expression one more sale would mean supper for tonight with maybe a little left over for breakfast as soon as the horses came abreast of him the boy leapt to the side of the carriage with his plaintive song help an orphan buy an apple the vehicle rattled on so he began to jog alongside holding up the apple and calling to those inside after the third plea he heard someone call out to the driver who brought the horses to a halt archie stood at the carriage door as the window slid down please sir he called buy an apple help a poor orphan a face appeared in the window a youngish longnosed fellow with a shock of fair hair falling over a high forehead he wore a knotted silk cravat with a gold stud let me see the merchandise commanded the young gentleman reaching a gloved hand through the window archie dutifully handed over the apple saying its a fresh one sir very good fer yer appetite sir ha sneered the young gentleman ill be the judge of that he took a big bite from the middle of the apple chewed it swallowed it then took another fully half the apple was gone in two bites this apple is bloody rotten cried the gentleman flinging the apple into the gutter he gave a rude guffaw ta you little blighter archie heard the twitter of female laughter from inside the coach driver shouted the man drive on the coachman laughing at archie snapped the reins and the horses jolted away oi thats not fair shouted archie you ate my apple you owe me yahboo the young toff waved his arm out the window offering archie the vee sign with upturned fingers as the carriage rumbled on the boy scooped the apple from the gutter drew back his arm and let fly the apple struck the broad back of the carriage but missed the window thief shouted archie you stinking bloody thief shaking with anger he watched the back of the retreating carriage and the thought came to him of running to catch it jumping on the back he had heard the older boys talking about this once a wealthy occupant had been identified the boys hitched a ride and rode it to its destinationmost often a great house or large town house where they disembarked before anyone was the wiser and waited for an opportunity to enter the house and steal whatever valuables they might find to carry off in this instance archie felt the thievery justified the young aristocrat had stolen from him first archie gathered himself he was just drawing breath to start his run and scramble up onto the footmans stand of the coach when he heard someone call from the pavement a few paces away theyre gone lad the damage is done let them go archie glanced around to see that he was being watched by a man in a long black coat and oldfashioned beaverskin top hat the man had dark full moustaches and a little pointed beard shaped like a heart he appeared to be of middle age and stood with his back to the bridge rail holding a cane upright over one shoulder embarrassed that his humiliation had been observed and his attempt at retaliation so nearly discovered archie felt the colour rising to his cheeks he turned aside quickly and started to run away he still had an apple left if he hurried he could get to the next bridge and maybe still make a sale before dark a moment called the man in the black coat a moment more of your time archie looked over his shoulder to see that the man was following him ignoring the man he ran on wait i say insisted the man come back i want to talk to you cant stop now called archie i shall definitely make it worth your while offered the man although archie did not fully understand what was being said to him something about the mans dry clipped tones suggested an aristocratic bearing that compelled him to pause and turn backif only to try selling his last remaining apple he hurried back fishing out the apple as he ran i saw what happened called the man a most deplorable cad that fellow he should be publicly horsewhipped would you like to buy an apple sir asked the boy rubbing the red skin of the fruit on his filthy shirt he held it up to be admired are you really an orphan yes sir orphaned these four years he pushed the apple higher you like this apple sir very good for you tell me the truth lad are you an orphan i have a particular reason for asking when the boy hesitated the man insisted the truth now archie shook his head no sir but its just me and me mum im not really a orphan as i thought replied the man crisply and not a street rascal either though no doubt well on your way here now dipping his fingers into a waistcoat pocket he withdrew a coin and flipped it to the ragged boy that is for telling the truth archie saw the glint of yellow metal in the fading light and caught the coin in midair he opened his hand and his eyes nearly started from his head on his palm was a solid gold sovereigna coin he had never seen before but dreamed about often clutching the coin archie extended the apple its too much sir he said his throat going dry in truth he knew there had to be a mistake and when the man realised what had happened he would cry thief and archie would face a beating or worsehed be taken by the bailiff and thrown into gaol please sir its too much you made a mistake no mistake said the man regarding him keenly keep it thank you sir archie whipped the coin out of sight the man still held him with a fierce attention the boy squirmed growing uncomfortable beneath such unwonted scrutiny how would you like a job i dont understand sir replied archie still holding out the apple a job ladwork and wages the man smiled suddenly there are more gold sovereigns to be had archie said nothing well come now i could use a persistent resourceful lad like you how about it i dont know how to do nuffini mean anything do you know marlborough house do you know where to find it archie shook his head no sir well youll have to ask someone come to me there first thing tomorrow morning and we will discuss your future he gave the boy a stern look hear me lad this could be the most important decision you are ever likely to make do you understand me archie understood the part about more gold sovereigns so nodded slowly and you will come to me at marlborough house i will sir good i will take you at your word when you come ask to see granville gower said the man taking the apple at last until tomorrow then chapter in which an impossible birth is celebrated serenity seemed to flow over etruria in wave after wave like the gentle surf of an endless ocean of blissful calm never had xianli felt more at peace although she still had not felt the baby move she no longer feared the worst turms continued assurance that all would be well served as a restorative tonic it was as if the ceremony performed by the king to learn the likely fate of the unborn child had driven off the clouds of doom and disaster that had gathered so thickly about her and dispelled any lingering doubt since that night everything had changed she held the memory of the strange ceremony as a rare and precious gift they had stood in the temple portico before a small stone altar the king was attended by a fellow priest and one identified as the netsvis dressed in a blue robe with a tall conical hat similar to the kings he would conduct the augury a few curious onlookers had also come to observe the ceremony in the last rays of the days sun a young lamb had been brought to the temple its legs bound with a golden cord and laid upon the altar after a brief incantation turms splendid in a crimson robe and tall hat trimmed in gold stooped low and thanked the animal for the sacrifice of its life with a nod to arthur and xianli he beckoned them to the altar and instructed them to place their hands upon the lamb he then drew a knife made from black volcanic glass across its throat the small creature lay still and expired without a sound then while attendants eviscerated the carcass a golden bowl in which some of the blood had been collected was passed to turms he lifted the bowl and drank then offered the bowl to both arthur and xianli after she had taken a sip he pointed to her stomach and said open your gown just there she did as instructed and bared a section of her rounded belly the priest king dipped a finger in the stillwarm blood and with the tip of his finger drew a small circle on her stomach he dipped again and added a cross inside the circle of blood as he did so he breathed a single word imantua the netsvis approached and with a bow of deference to the king offered up a golden dish bearing several of the animals internal organs the two exchanged a few private words whereupon the king announced as you have seen the animal died at peace and without distress this is a good omen the liver and entrails were pristine and perfectly formedthis too bodes well for our inquiry we will now conduct the augury he passed the dish to the seer who carried it back to the altar where he began to examine the contents standing with one foot on a block of uncut stone that had been placed beneath the altar other attendants gathered around and all leaned near to study the organs and determine from the signs what could be told of the unborn childs future twilight overtook the ceremony so torches were lit arthur and xianli stood waiting while the priests continued their deliberations amid much mumbled discussion this continued far longer than xianli might have expected she watched with dread fascination as one of the priests took up the obsidian knife and began to divide the liver into sections subjecting each section to minute examination the first stars were shining in the east when the netsvis finally turned and offered his judgement turms listened his head bowed nodding now and then as the bluerobed seer spoke the king thanked him for his counsel then summoned an attendant who brought forth a censer on a chain the attendant blew on the coals in the bowl then dropped a pinch of something onto the glowing charcoal fragrant smoke billowed from the bowl turms bowed at the waist as the censer was swung before his face he closed his eyes and breathed in the smoke once twice three times he made a gesture as if he were washing his hands in it then placed his hands over his face palms pressed to his eyes he grew very still xianli began to think he had fallen asleep on his feet when turms opened his eyes and gazed at her with the glint of a rising moon shining in his dark eyes he said i have seen the life light of the child stretching far into the future like a radiant silver cord the end of this cord cannot be seen it is lost to view in the unformed darkness of the distant future he smiled i believe this signifies a long and meaningful life for the child soon to make his appearance in the land of the living arthur squeezed his wifes hand the child will be born alive he said more a question seeking confirmation than a statement the birth will be blessed with success and the resulting infant will thrive the king assured them in a tone that allowed no room for doubt i turms the immortal have seen this thank you o king breathed xianli then the tears began to flow as the fear that had held her these last weeks released its unforgiving grip thank you i have seen something else turms continued after this child your womb will be closed there will be no more children for you arthur darted a glance at his wife to see how she would receive this blow but her smile did not alter i understand she murmured resting her hand on her belly i will cherish this one the more the ceremony moved to its conclusion but xianli remembered little of what happened after the pronouncement that night she slept better than she could remember and rose the next morning at perfect peace the house was still asleep when she slipped out unseen she walked down the path to the temple and there as the first rays of the sun touched the temple steps she knelt and gave thanks for the life of her unborn child now as the first pangs of birth came upon her xianli recalled the serenity of that sacred moment her heart rose and she pressed a hand to her swollen belly soonbefore another day had dawnedshe would hold her babe in her arms when the next quiver of pain came upon her she reached over to her sleeping husband and let her hand fall upon his shoulder she did not shake him but let the warmth of her body gently awaken him it is time she said when he raised his head from the pillow beside her he sat up with a jerk now she smiled soon in a little while lie down beside me he put his head down again and closed his eyes she closed hers too remembering that day a few weeks after the ceremony when over a dinner of roast quail and greens turms had announced it would please me to have the child to be born here in the royal palace before either she or arthur could reply the king had quickly added it is a long time since this house heard the sound of a babys cry i would consider it an honour if you agreed to this request after all you have done for us the honour would be mine she had said picking out the words in his languagethe first time she had spoken to him on her own this surprised and delighted their noble host we accept she has been learning arthur told him i am impressed you have done so much for us already said arthur we are in your debt how can friends ever be indebted to one another thus xianli had completed her time in the best place she could have imaginedluxuriating in the sun and warmth the food and company and all the accoutrements of the palace had she been a queen she could not have been treated more royally and the knowledge that she would be delivered of a living child made it all that much more to be cherished the final weeks had passed and now it was time for the child to be born she was ready when later in the day she was in the throes of birthing the baby and surrounded by skilled etruscan physicians she knew that all was as it should be there was a rightness to things that surpassed understanding but she knew beyond all doubt that in each and every circumstance her feet had been guided along this path and to this place a favourite saying in chinawhich she had heard on occasion from her own grandmotherwas that the threads of life are easy to weave but difficult to untangle xianli knew for arthur had shown her that the threads of her life were being woven by a master of the loom it was arthur who having spent the better part of an anxious day sitting outside the birthing house appeared at her bedside to receive his first glimpse of the newborn well done xianli he said beaming with pride we have a son yes a son she whispered somewhat dizzy with exhaustion is he not the most beautiful child xianli pulled back the edge of her robe which swaddled her baby to reveal a small pinched red face with a mass of spiky black hair resembling the glistening pelt of a bear the infants eyes were shut tight and its tiny lips pressed firm as if the child was determined to sleep through any efforts that might be made to introduce him to this strange new world he is perfect murmured his father arthur leaned close and gave his wife a kiss thank you he said she reached for his hand and squeezed it what shall we call him he asked perching on the edge of the bed his hand resting on the tiny lump beneath her robe they had been so preoccupied with the troubled pregnancyand truth be told in some part of their deepest hearts they had not fully believed turms prediction of a successful birththat they had utterly neglected the important task of selecting a name whatever the reason they now realised this oversight he is your son said xianli brushing the infants forehead with her lips you should choose husband very well agreed arthur do you have any suggestions she shook her head the son of an englishman must have an english name whatever pleases you will please me also he gazed at his newborn son hoping for inspiration but nothing came to him i dont know he confessed there are so many she laughed he needs only one he rubbed his hand along his unshaved jaw this is going to take some thought the etruscans had a custom that a newborn infant should not be named until seven days had passed on the eighth day turms told arthur the child receives his name this is a very old tradition the eighth dayit is the most propitious day for naming beginning a new venture or undertaking a journey arthur liked that idea since it allowed him plenty of time to think it did not however make the thinking any easier in his search he conjured before him the faces of all his male ancestorsall those he could remember alive or deadto see if any of them had qualities he admired and whose names he might borrow and commemorate this proved a useful exercise but all the time devoted to the project failed to bring him any closer to a final decision when after four days had passed xianli asked him what he was thinking he was forced to admit that while he had begun drawing up a list he had not yet chosen a name he told her what turms had said about refraining from conferring a name until seven days had passed she accepted this but warned ponder as much as you like but you have only four more days his ruminations carried him to the final hour of the final day the king has asked me to inform you that tomorrow morning at sunrise we will hold the naming ceremony the kings chief housekeeper told him i am to come and wake you at the appropriate time ah replied arthur wondering where the days had flown thank you pacha please tell the king we will be ready so as the night ended and the moon began to set over the tyrhennian sea arthur and xianli walked down the moonlit path to the little temple at the bottom of the hill xianli carried the infant asleep in her arms it was the first time she had been out since the baby was born and it felt good to move and feel the soft night air on her face and to see the world once again turms had come to see her several times since the birth and she wanted to thank him for his thoughtfulness when they reached the temple however he was not there in fact no one was about except a young acolyte who had been charged with the task of informing them that the naming ceremony would not take place in the temple i am to ask you to follow me he said it is not far but there is a donkey ready if you would like to ride it feels good to walk xianli said when arthur had relayed the offer thank you but we will walk arthur told the youth lead the way they continued along the path towards the town and soon came to a small pillar standing to one side the acolyte paused here and turning to them said they are gathered at the kings tomb it is on the sacred road indicating the little pillar he said you are to wash before you enter the sacred way the top of the pillar had been hollowed into a shallow depression and this was filled with water the young man demonstrated how to make the symbolic gesture by dipping his hands and then passing them over his head and face also the child he said when they had done as instructed xianli dipped her fingertips in the water and pushing away the unruly shock of hair dampened the childs forehead and wet his curled little hands the young acolyte led them off the path towards what appeared to be nothing more than the edge of a small defilea place where the ground had crumbled away or where a stream had cut through the soft earth over time they quickly discovered however that it was not a natural feature at all but manmade steps had been cut in the soft tufa stone that lay beneath the ground this hewn staircase led down and down passing between narrow walls until they could no longer see the surface they had left behind at the bottom the steps joined a passage wide enough for two horses to pass abreast the passage stretched away on either hand torches had been lit and set in simple sconces carved into the towering stone walls this is the sacred road the young man informed them where does it lead asked arthur it joins other sacred ways in other places replied the acolyte there are many such throughout the land they walked along the passageway cast in deepest gloom though the sky above held the faint glimmer of the rising sun they passed an elaborate doorway that had been carved into the tufa columns also carved supported a triangular pediment that bore the sculpted image of a man in long robes lying on a low couch there was an inscription which seemed to be a name carved into the architrave the doors were of stone and sealed what is this asked arthur it is the tomb of lars volsina answered the youth he was a king of our people many years ago they passed another doorway set in a niche on the opposite side of the sunken road then two more as they continued along there were more of these elaborate facades some larger grandly decorated porticoes with steps and columns others simple posts and lintels framing a stone door are they all tombs wondered arthur all these doorways yes all are tombs of kings and noblemen the deepcarved passageway wound gently down curving as it went as it straightened again they saw a short distance ahead a group of people standing before another of the rockcut tombs this one somewhat larger than the others and more elaborate with stone steps leading up to a covered porch a fire had been lit in an iron bowl supported by a tripod and torches attached to the columns and walls of the sunken roadway gave the tufa a warm ruddy glow there was a stone plinth covered with an orange cloth in front of the steps king turms stood before it flanked on either side by women in long white linen gowns both had their hair braided in such a way as to fall over each shoulder one of them held a golden bowl the other a knife with a blade of black glass welcome friends called turms as they came to stand before the plinth this rite is best observed on the sacred way in the presence of venerable ancestors he explained this is a most auspicious place at arthurs sceptical expression he said i suppose it will seem strange to you that the celebration of new life should take place amongst the tombs even so this like the road you have taken to come here represents the journey of life itself we are travellers and each of us body and soul together are companions for lifes journey one day we will part company as we must the body grown weary will take its rest at last turms lifted a hand to the surrounding tombs but for those whose spirits are alive to the purposes of creation he continued there is no final destination for such as these death is merely a pause an interlude where one can gather strength for new and greater journeys friends we are created travellers i ask you what true traveller ever arrived in a new place who did not wish to explore it and in exploring did not continue his travels seeing new sights learning new ways breathing the air of a new land under new skies and rejoicing in new discoveries turms the immortal priest king of the velathri turned and motioned to the woman with the bowl she stepped forward placing the bowl on the orangedraped plinth though the body you bring before me in this most favourable hour will one day grow weary and die the new spirit which has entered the world in this body is immortal and will never die know this my friends we areall of usimmortal he held out his hands give me the child xianli who had been following turms explanation with arthurs whispered translation extended her arms and gently placed her newborn son in the kings hands turms raised the infant above his head then passed it to the woman who had held the bowl she unwrapped the baby and presented it naked to the king who cradled it in his arms as the last stars of the night fade into the dawn so begins a new day in the dying of the old this is as it must be turms dipped a little water from the bowl and wet the babys head we welcome you little soul into the life we all share in this world he said his voice growing soft as a mothers extending his hand to the woman with the knife he said yours is not a solitary life little one with a quick deft stroke he pricked the sole of the infants foot with the point of the knife xianli stifled a gasp and the child gave a squeak of surprise at the sudden fleeting pain a big drop of bright red blood welled up on the little heel turms dabbed the blood with a forefinger and made a spot on the babys forehead then repeated the gesture three times placing a spot first on xianlis forehead then on arthurs and finally on his own this sign is to remind you that your life is not yours aloneit is mingled with your parents and with all those who came before you and will come after but it is mingled with others too just as their lives are mingled with still others in this way we are all part of one another the baby growing cold and uncomfortable in the morning air squirmed and gave out a growl like that of a kitten or a cub the king smiled and returned the child to the woman holding the swaddling cloth she gathered the infant once more into the soft folds and returned it to the king turms placed his hand on the infants head and said our hope for you is that you will grow to be strong and virtuous in spirit and deed and that whether the length of your journey through this world is short or long it will be a boon to you and all those around you learn well little soul so that the knowledge and wisdom you gather on your way can strengthen and sustain you in the life to come turms raised his eyes and asked arthur by what name will this child be known arthurs mouth framed the word benjamin a name he had decided on that held some resonance for him curiously his tongue uttered benedict the king nodded taking the infants curled fist in his he dipped the tiny hand into the water and then pressed that little fist to its chest from henceforth you will be called benedict xianli glanced at her husband and mouthed the question benedict the ceremony was completed and turms handed the child back to its mother the two women attendants took up the bowl and knife once more wait said arthur i meant to say benjamin turms smile grew broad and he put back his head and laughed and yet you did not but arthur started to object it is done my friend the king told him and it is right the name you have given is what was chosen for him all is as it must be arthur gave in to the decision with rueful acceptance they all walked back to the palace to eat a celebratory meal in honour of the newly named infant retracing their steps along the sacred way passing the silent tombs they mounted the steps and upon reaching the top the rising sun broke above the horizon for a moment dazzling them arthur felt as if having spent the night in the tomb he was rising to new life on the way back up the hill xianli leaned close to her husband why benedict she wondered what does it mean im not exactly sure confessed arthur blessing or blessed one i thinksomething like that xianli smiled and held the infant up before her to look at him he is our blessing she decided and the awkwardness of the mistake dissolved in that moment the world settled into place once more chapter in which the truth cannot be ignored a few scrawny cats and a beggar scrabbled among gently smouldering heaps of rubbish a swirl of black vultures circled overhead in lazy loops keeneyed for anything dead or dying the naked sun slammed down like a hammer upon the poor anvil that was kits throbbing head smiting through the thin cloth of his sweatsoaked turban my kingdom for a straw hat he muttered blinking in sunlight so hot it dried his eyeballs in their sockets an endless avenue of pale humanheaded sphinxes stretched before him its end lost in the shimmering heat haze somewhere in that wavering mirage lay the ruins of one of the ancient worlds wonders the great temple of amun it was somewhere in the temple complex at the end of the avenue kit had been informed that he would find the man he had come upriver to meet squinting his eyes against the glare bouncing up from the whitepaved street he started walking after only a minute he was wishing he had not been quite so hasty in rejecting khefris suggestion that he hire a donkey for the journey its a straight shot to the temple right he had said how bad can it be to take his mind off the heat he tried to imagine why wilhelmina had been so insistent that he meet this man what did young know that could help them he also wondered how much wilhelmina had told this fellow about the quest they were conducting and consequently how much he might risk saying that kit decided would be the first thing he must discover after a leisurely boat ride down the nile and a brief stop to haggle for the turban kit and khefri had shaken hands and parted company at the steps of the winter palace hotel shukran my friend kit had said if i have need of a boat i will come looking for you may god be good to you kit livingstone replied the young man farewell the last kit had seen of him the young man was hurrying back to join his cousin in the boat following wilhelminas instructions he had presented himself to the concierge at the reception desk and asked for the parcel that all being well was waiting for him the concierge a robust egyptian in a black frock coat and fez disappeared into an office returning a moment later with a package he held it in his hand and regarded kit dubiously could this be the parcel sir why yes i believe so the fellow hefted it in his hand but made no attempt to deliver it may i have it please do you have anything for me ah no answered kit slowly i dont think so nothing at all wondered the fellow no nothing at all why was i suppose to have something for you i was not given anything a small gift perhaps he regarded the parcel in his hand oh said kit as understanding broke upon him yes i see the concierge smiled but i am terribly sorry kit offered i dont have any money ive been in the desert you see he turned out an empty pocket nada nothing sorry with a shrug the fellow handed over the small packet and kit wandered into the lobby to open it about the size and thickness of an oldschool exercise book it was wrapped in brown paper and tied with string a small handlettered note had been stuck in where the ends of the string were tied in a neat bow and it was addressed to him it read kit do not open this package take itunopenedto dr thomas young at the karnak temple dig just outside luxor you will find him there from late spring to early autumn the parcel will serve as your letter of introduction he will know what is to be done remember do not open this package not even a little he turned the parcel over the folded flaps were sealed with a blob of oldfashioned sealing wax beside the seal was a message do not even think about opening this package okay got it muttered kit sheesh what a nag i wont open the stupid package tucking the packet under his shirt he had then made his way to the old temple when he finally arrived at the shattered remains of the temple gate he was perspiring from every pore the sweat drying almost instantly as it hit the dry desert air the huge blocks of the fabled pylonsthe great slantbacked walls flanking the temple entrancelay tumbled on the ground though the parts of the wall extant rose to the height of several stories many of the courses still bore their original paint and the colours glowed in the fierce light through the nowempty gate he could see collapsed pillars and more jumbled heaps of rubble across a very lumpy landscape most of which was covered with low acacia bushes stunted palms of various sorts and coarse scrubby saw grass more beggars reclined idly in the broken doorways while in the shadows he could see the furtive shapes of feral cats kit wiped beaded sweat from his face put his hand to the cargo he carried beneath his shirt and started into the temple courtyard climbing over a heap of rubble and into what had once been an immense expanse of gargantuan columns shaped like bundles of papyrus some of these stood upright proudly supporting their connecting lintels as if bearing the weight of the clear blue sky above his presence was quickly seized upon by the more enterprising beggars who hobbled to greet him with toothless whines and filthy palms outstretched la shukran he told them as firmly and politely as he could sir sir one of the beggars called in english you need a guide sir no thank you im fine kit did not even look up since to do so would only encourage the fellow thanks all the same you are looking for someone maybe at this kit glanced around to see a wizened egyptian in a very dirty kaftan and skin like creased leather standing perfectly still a little apart from the importuning gaggle of his comrades in rags you are looking for someone the man repeated i think so yes admitted kit instantly regretting his lapse i am looking for someonean englishman actually you are looking for dr thomas young perhaps suggested the bold fellow the very man confirmed kit pulling up short do you know him i know him sir the egyptian raised his voice and shouted a single word of command and the others promptly ceased their mewling and silently drifted away to kit he said your friend is not far thanks said kit much relieved but i dont want to put you to any trouble if you could point me in the right direction id be much obliged the man smiled his teeth a flash of white in the tangle of his matted beard it is no trouble please follow me despite his obviously much reduced state the man held himself with great dignity walking through the crumbling ruinsshattered monuments on every sideas through a palace entire treading lightly on the stones beneath his feet kit trailed along behind him stumbling now and then over the rough uneven surface mindful of the treasures buried only a few feet underground he had a vague memory of having seen photos of what in his day wasor would becalled the temple complex of karnaka vast acreage of honeycoloured buildings inscribed with every manner of hieroglyphs imaginable the tumbled remains of the oncegreat temple now trampled underfoot would one day rise again the acres of broken blocks would be set one atop another once more the carvings would be lovingly restored the walls and lintels obelisks and innumerable statues of gods and men would be reclaimed from the waste and wilderness of uncaring eons and the whole made accessible to the tourists who would fill the hotel boats that would be built to ply the nile and spill their human cargo over the ancient sites in a living flood but this this wracked ruin was how the place looked before excavation became a big business in the land of the pharaohs considering what the sprawling temple complex would eventually becomeyet another heritage site swarming with shortshorts and baseball capskit much preferred seeing it like this a forest of halffallen columns and collapsed structures many still bearing their original paintwork with here and there a smaller temple or storeroom completely intact standing firm against the ravages of time aside from the beggars and stray dogsdid the two always go togetherthere was no one not a single tshirt shop or cocacola sign in sight and kit was the only foreigner the beggar guide led him through the haphazard maze of devastation past primitive campsites of squatters and mounds of garbagethe locals dumped here obviouslyand over fallen remnants of mighty ramesses imperious statues at last reaching a small square building the front of which was obscured by a toppled obelisk around the back of this structure kit glimpsed a white flap of canvas a ramshackle leanto of timber and canvas had been set up over a sizeable hole six or eight men in dirty blue kaftans and black turbans stood around the edge of the hole ready to receive baskets full of sand and rock that were being lifted up to them here is the man you are looking for said his guide kit regarded the ring of workers and thought there must be some mistake and was about to say as much when a voice called up from the hole shukran shukran that will be all for now a white straw hat appeared at the edge of the hole followed by a round whiskered face flushed red by the mans recent exertions the fellow took one look at kit and put out a hand greetings friend i am thomas young how do you do stepping to the edge of the hole kit bent and extended his hand to receive a hearty handshake kit livingstone sir i am well thank you would you mind terribly asked dr young still gripping kits hand a small assist would be most useful not at all replied kit who gave a solid tug the fellow scrambled out of the pit and patted the dust from his beige linen suit that is better he straightened and hands on hips stood regarding kit his grey eyes keen behind small round steelrimmed glasses a compact tightly knit man he gave the impression of barely contained energy like a coiled spring beneath his tropical linen he wore a white shirt and a waistcoat of yellow silk the boots on his feet were of the heavy serviceable type a military man might favour so he cried at last here you are here i am indeed confirmed kit the physician stood gazing at him as at a prize exhibit in a zoo until kit growing uncomfortable under the mans scrutiny blurted i believe we have a mutual friend yes agreed thomas young amiably i rather believe we do wilhelmina striking girl said thomas stirring himself most remarkable young woman possessed of a strength of will one encounters only rarely a genuinely unique individual shes all that conceded kit come sir it is the heat of the day we must not stand out here jawing like a pair of yahoos i have a jug of lemon water standing by splendidly refreshing will you share a drink with me in my tent i would be delighted replied kit falling into the more formal rhythms of nineteenthcentury speech i am positively parched khalid shouted thomas we are retiring to my tent rest the workers now and give them something to eat and drink tell them we will resume at the usual time when you have done that join us please the servant made a slight bow and then turning clapped his hands for attention as the workers moved off kit observed you sent him to look for me i did replied the doctor leading the way to a large tent that had been erected in the scant shade of twin palm trees every day at this time he went to look for you i thought if you came at all it would be in the morning it is just too hot later it is still early in the season he said and already it is beastlymuch too warm for this time of year he stepped to the entrance of the tent and held aside the opening flap i fear i shall soon be forced to suspend excavations pity kit ducked under the flap and into a commodious wellventilated space that was less tent than opensided marquee two sides were hung with gauzy material periodically a servant would come by to sprinkle it with water using an olive branch and a wooden paila primitive but surprisingly effective form of airconditioning the reprieve from the heat and hammering sun was instant and welcome and kit could not help offering up a sigh of relief the interior was divided into two distinct areas a working place with a desk and lamp three folding chairs and a wicker settee and a sleeping place with a cot shrouded by insect netting the two were divided by a standing screen of woven palm fronds the slightly uneven floor was covered by heavy egyptian carpets laid one atop another it was kit decided the temporary abode of a wellseasoned traveller one who knew and understood his surroundings this was further demonstrated when the doctor removed the lid of a covered bowl and drew out a roll of wet cloth put this around your neck he said passing the roll to kit he took one for himself and draped it around the nape of his neck kit did likewise and instantly felt the better for it beside the desk stood a small tripod bearing a large oval tray of brass on the tray were a painted pottery jug and several upsidedown glasses a shallow bowl of almonds sat beside the jug and it was to this that thomas young was first drawn here my good fellow get some of these into you he said offering the bowl kit took a few of the heavily salted almonds and popped them into his mouth his host did the same you need the salt in this heat its good for you prevents heat prostration returning the bowl to the tray he waved kit to a chair please sit down mr livingstone we will rest awhile and chat kit lowered himself into the canvas chair and accepted a glass of the pale yellow liquid it was tepid but the sharp tang of the lemon made it palatable thomas settled into his chair behind the desk and sat gazing at his guest from behind an untidy mass of papers and various drawing utensils kit sipped his water and waited for his host to begin do i dare ask if you have brought something for me wondered thomas at last as it happens replied kit he placed his halfempty glass on the tray and fumbling at the buttons on the front of his shirt produced the brown paper package he had retrieved from the hotel i was instructed to deliver this to you unopened as you can see i have obeyed these instructions he rose and holding it in both hands ceremoniously placed the paperwrapped bundle on the desk before his host i am happy to pass this to your care thomas made no move to pick it up but sat with his hands folded before him regarding it quizzically do you know what is inside the wrapping no sir i do not replied kit i was not told do you in part thomas raised his eyes to kit and then returned to his survey of the parcel if it is what i think it is kit waited the archaeologist neither altered his gaze nor made any move to pick up the packet he simply sat staring at the stringbound square dr young said kit after a moment is anything the matter if this is what has been promised history will change he raised his eyes once more his round glasses glinting in the soft light of the tent you know that do you not the world will change right kit nodded he could wait a little longer for that outside the braying of a donkey echoed across the ruins as if in response to the sound the doctor drew a sharp intake of breath and pulled the package closer he lifted it diffidently balanced between his handsthe very picture of a man trying to delay an action he might well regret kit could sympathise who could guess what wilhelmina had put in that parcel the thing must be done i suppose thomas said and with trembling fingers untied the string and peeled open the paper wrapping to reveal a curious assortment of objects an old shilling coin a letter a newspaper clipping and several printed pages that appeared to have been torn from a bookmore or less what might be found in the average scrapbooknothing that appeared likely to be of much importance let alone worldshattering consequence kit watched as his host examined the coin then put it aside and lifted the letter scrutinising it front and back the letter was in minas hand and addressed to christopher kit livingstone in the care of dr thomas young the white envelope was sealed and stamped but the stamp had not been cancelled thomas placed the letter before him on the desk this alone would have been enough he murmured sir wondered kit see here thomas said pointing to the stampa simple black postage stamp with an engraved silhouette of a young queen victoria with the words one penny beneatha fairly unremarkable example to kits eye the stamp yes this stamp as you call itthomas touched it lightly with a fingertiphas never been seen beforeat least not by me may i said kit picking up the letter i see the letter is addressed to me by all means said the doctor you must open it at once kit slid his finger under the flap and drew out a single piece of plain white paper that read kitif you are reading this you have met dr thomas youngthe last man in the world who knows everything trust him with your life ever yours mina and that was all thomas in the meantime had picked up the coin and now held it between his thumb and forefinger turning it over and over with a look of bewilderment on his facean expression kit guessed was highly unusual for the man he passed the shilling piece to kit for examination the silver coin bore the profile of victoria on one side and on the other a crown with the simple words one shilling beneath below victorias disembodied head was the date have you ever seen the like asked thomas yes i have replied kit handing back the shilling many times the english gentleman simply nodded and laid the coin beside the letter he picked up the newspaper clipping glanced at it and then looked at kit have you ever been to kew gardens he asked once or twice replied kit it is a wellknown attraction people go there for picnics and a pleasant day out the doctor set aside the clipping and placing his hands flat on the printed pages torn from the book he said this i believe will be the ultimate test kit could not think how to respond to this so remained silent unless i am very much mistaken our mutual friend will have provided me with undeniable proof that what she has claimed outrageous though it seems is in fact the naked truth he then lifted the pages and with a slightly trembling hand offered them to kit would you read it to me please taking the loose sheets kit scanned the top one quickly on both sides it was merely the title pagetorn hastily from the spine it would seem judging from the ragged edge the reverse contained part of an acknowledgement by the author you want me to read this please replied thomas young removing his glasses and closing his eyes kit cleared his throat and began a course of lectures on natural philosophy and the mechanical arts by thomas young md a new edition with references and notes by the rev p kelland ma frs london and edinburgh printed for taylor and walton upper gower street kit glanced up at his audience young was sitting very still his eyes closed kit turned the page over and continued reading having undertaken to prepare a course of lectures on natural philosophy to be delivered in the theatre of the royal institution i thought that the plan of the institution required something more than a mere compilation from the elementary works at present existing and that it was my duty to digest into one system everything relating to the principles of the mechanical sciences that could tend to the improvement of the arts subservient to the conveniences of life he paused for breath and waited in a moment thomas nodded and kit resumed i found also in delivering the lectures that it was most eligible to commit to writing as nearly as possible the whole that was required to be said on each subject and that even when an experiment was to be performed it was best to describe that experiment uninterruptedly and to repeat the explanation during its exhibition hence it became necessary that the written lectures should be as clearly and copiously expressed and in a language as much adapted to the comprehension of a mixed audience as the nature of the investigations would allow the doctor gave out a groan and kit broke off thomas young sat still as a sphinx eyes closed outwardly composed the only sign of an internal struggle was to be seen in his hands which were clasped so tightly together the knuckles were white would you like me to continue asked kit his voice breaking into the intense reverie of the man behind the desk is everything all right no breathed the physician nothing is right he opened his eyes and looked at kit with an expression of wonder and despair it is from a book my book that is what your wilhelmina has brought me as proof of her assertions yes so i gather but that is the trouble thomas stretched a finger towards the page in kits hand and gestured mutely at it as if at the certificate of his own death this book is not yet published in fact it is not even finished kit could imagine how that might be a problem oh he said trying to sound sympathetic i see thomas glance became sharp do you he demanded i submit that you do not see the half sir this he snatched the page from kits grasp this scrap of paper comes to me from another world and a future not my own a world where all i have thought and done is already pastwhere i am dead and buried and the things i see before me now worn with age are yet to be the doctor shook his head again do you see it yet time is out of joint and reality merely a delusion all i have believed about the world is a mirage a chimera a fantasy my work my science worthless how he asked his voice falling to a lament how am i to live in light of that part three coming forth by day chapter in which an apprenticeship is begun xianli thrust her hand into the bowl cradled on her hip she smelled the dry sweet floury scent of the cracked corn as she filled her palm then flung the handful in a wide generous arc around her the chickens already flocking to her squawked and fluttered as they scurried to snatch up the kernels she had scattered she watched their sleek heads bobbing as they pecked at the corn a simple chore feeding chickens yet she took great pleasure in itknowing that it was something her mother and grandmother had done all their lives the uncomplicated act linked her to generations past and present and yet to come and that gave her a comfortable feeling i thought i would find you here said arthur a slight reproof in his tone she turned and smiled as he came to stand beside her we have servants to do this you know he said you are the lady of the house you dont have to feed chickens i enjoy it she flung another handful to her circle of plump brown hens and they like it he caught her wrist as she returned it to the bowl your hands my love he said lifting her palm they are getting rough you do too much i do what pleases me husband she countered would you deny me that he kissed her palm and released it it will be tomorrow he said after a moment he felt her stiffen beside him i cannot put it off any longer but he is only six years old xianli declared her face clouded and her lips pursed in objection he is old enough arthur waited watching the chickens scratching for errant kernels they had missed in the first flurry of feeding weve always known this day was coming it is time he began his apprenticeship but he is only a child she complained resisting what she knew to be true the boy must learn arthur was adamant he must be taught xianli turned and flung another handful of grain to her flock he wont be going alone said arthur pointing out the obvious do you imagine for a moment i would let any harm to come near him she frowned her normally smooth brow furrowed now xianli he said softly it is time she sighed lowering her head in submission to assuage her anxiety he added besides he must have some experience of it if we are to consider taking him to see your father and sister in macau you are right husband i worry too much but if anything happened to arthur interrupted before she could finish the thought i know since coming back to england xianli had taken charge of the small holding that had been in arthurs family for over a hundred years tucked away in the cotswold countryside she had devoted herself to her family and made a good life for herself and arthur and little benedictaway from the judgemental stares of city sophisticates who considered her a member of an inferior race to the country folk of oxfordshire xianli was a curious and somewhat exotic novelty whose presence among them provided interest in what was often a drearily mundane existence as people in the neighbouring holdings and settlements had grown to know her they accepted her according the family a higher rank and status in respect of arthurs learning and manners arthur became known as the squire and benedict affectionately rechristened ben by the locals became the young squire the boy was their sole pride and joyall the more so because both xianli and arthur knew there would not be another child later arthur took his turn at tucking little benedict into bed so he could deliver the good news tomorrow he said we are going on a journey ben looked up excited are we going to town no his father shook his head we are not going to banbury or whitney or even oxford were going somewhere far away from england china the little blackhaired boy rose up in bed no not china not this time that is a difficult journey and you must be older for that where are we going we are going to egypt egypt thats right remember i told you about my friend anen who lives in egypt the boy nodded we are going to pay him a visit and i can go too yes his father assured him you will come with me this time there is much to learn and it is time your lessons were begun the boy sat up in bed again and clapped his hands his father pressed him back down we must leave very early in the morning and you must get your rest now say your prayers and blow out the candle morning will be here soon enough when arthur came to wake him the next morning he found his son already awake and dressed shirt laced shoes buckled you look a fine traveller arthur told him did you sleep at all last night ben nodded are we leaving now right this very minute replied his father the carriage is ready we can eat our breakfast while timothy drives he tucked in the boys shirttails and tightened his belt now run and kiss your mother goodbye then put on your coat i will be waiting for you in the yard outside ben ran downstairs his feet clumping heavily on the wooden floorboards as he ran arthur followed retrieving his own coat and hat on the way xianli was waiting for them in the yard a bag of provisions in her hand arthur gave her a farewell kiss and pressed both her hands in his never fear i will take good care of him of course you will she said forcing a smile daybreak was still some time off when the coach rolled out from their farm and into the gently folded hills and valleys of the cotswolds their farm on the edge of the village of much milford was only a little way off the main thoroughfare linking the nearby towns and hamlets timothy the farm manager drove along the deeprutted road letting the horses trot along easily while keeping a sharp eye for any holes likely to break a wheel or an axle arthur opened the bag xianli had prepared for them and passed his son a barley cake which had been split and buttered he took one for himself and leaned back in his seat papa said little benedict thoughtfully will we see god why do you ask you said we will jump up beyond the clouds and stars to a new place he said picking off a bit of his barley cake he chewed for a moment and observed that is where god lives can we see him arthur recalled the previous conversation with his son when he had just returned from one of his travels benedict only four years old at the time had asked where he had been and arthur had told him in a lighthearted way that he had been to a place beyond the clouds and stars in his childish way the boy considered this just one more way people travelled whenever they went on long trips to distant places would it surprise you arthur replied to know that god cannot be seeneven up among the stars why not because he is a spirit and spirits are invisible no one can see god vicar de gifftley does ben pointed out he talks to god all the time i do not doubt it allowed his father but even the vicar does not see god with his eyes vicar says that if you see jesus then you see god countered ben lots of people have seen jesus well yes but that was a long time ago arthur enjoyed these little talks challenging as they so often did his own assumptions of the universe and its exceedingly odd mechanisms when we take a journey using the force lines we will see people from other times the man we are going to visitanen remember me telling about himhe lived a very long time ago will we see him anen noi mean jesus will we see jesus no we wont see him why not well because jesus lived in another place and time from the one we are going to visit he watched his son puzzling over this and resisted the urge to say more it had long been an ambition to find the line of force that might lead to the holy land in the time of christ he had yet to find it but knew it was out there somewhere the search went on and arthur contented himself with the thought that his relentless mapping of the cosmos would eventually yield the location to this end arthur still faithfully recorded the coordinates of his travels on his skin through the tattoos he gathered and meticulously refined with every journey into the ether he watched his son eating the barley cake one day soon he would share with benedict the meaning of the strange runes that covered his torso and how to read thema secret known only to one other his own dear wife xianli how long will it take to go to egypt guessed arthur not long as i told you it happens in the blink of an eye it is travelling to the jumpingoff place that takes all the time the jumpingoff place for this journey is very close to our farm black mixen tump offered ben stuffing the remainder of his barley cake into his mouth that is right arthur scrutinised his son closely how do you know about that i heard you and mother talking ben told him can i have another barley cake later have a little cheese or an egg instead arthur dug into the bag and brought out a lump of cheese wrapped in muslin and a clutch of eggs boiled in the shell he offered an egg to his son and took one for himself he tapped it on the window ledge of the carriage and began to peel it tossing the shards out the window they talked of what they would see in egypt and how ley travellers were expected to comport themselves on their journeys we must always be respectful of the people we meet it is their world and we are guests we never do anything to call unwanted attention to ourselves we try to be good guests we mind our manners he regarded the boy willing him to understand promise me youll always mind your manners son i promise papa good said arthur now look outside you can see black mixen tump from here the great hulking eminence of the stone age mound stood out as an ominous dark shadow a hill in a landscape of hills it was a place apart sacred to the ancients who had built it earlymorning mist wreathed the broad base and swirled up along the winding trail leading up the steep slope to the strangely flattened top the three trollsthe trio of great old oak trees guarding the topstood out against the greying dawn sky black mixen still kindled in arthur a singular dread in spite of his long familiarity with the place what power the site contained he hardly knew but he suspected he had only skimmed the surface of its manifold energies timothy brought the coach to a halt on the west side of the mound and waited while his passengers climbed out then handing down the leather satchel his employer always carried he said i will wait until you have gone sir just to make certain no one comes byif you know what i mean thank you timothy replied arthur he reached out for benedicts hand ready son the boy pulled his hand away no now son i dont want to go he crossed his arms over his chest staring balefully at the great conical hump of black mixen rising before them why said arthur weve come all this way i dont want to nothing bad is going to happen arthur assured him im afraid there is nothing to be afraid of i dont like the trolls the trolls are treesjust ordinary trees now come along and stop this foolishness at once excuse me interrupting sir said timothy speaking up he indicated the sky with a tilt of his head the sun is coming we must go it is time to be a brave boy arthur said firmly now take my hand and come along i will be right here beside you there is nothing to fear the two travellers followed the serpentine trail to the summit and arthur quickly located the stone he had planted a few years ago to mark the location of the prime energy field taking his customary stance on the stone he placed his son before him and said put one hand to my belt the boy did as he was told and snaked his fingers around his fathers wide leather belt with the other hand he held tight to his fathers free hand thats right now whatever happens do not let go remember what i told you about the wind and rain i rememberthe wind will scream and the rain will sting and i will feel a bump a bump yes who told you that mum said she is right you will probably feel a bumplike a little jumpbut do not worry you wont fall i will be there with you to catch you and i wont throw up you might his father advised slinging the satchel strap over his shoulder but if you do it is nothing to worry about just go ahead and throw up and you will feel better clasping his sons hand tightly arthur raised his arm in the air above his head he felt the familiar shimmer of the force field on his skin the hair on his arms and on the back of his neck stood up the air crackled with the presage of lightning and a heavy mist descended around them the wind howled down as if descending from distant blizzardscoured heights hold on he cried shouting into the whirling maelstrom of forces writhing around them he tightened his grip on the boys hand ready here we go the familiar english hilltop dimmed and the rain flew sideways in stinging torrents arthur felt his feet leave the marking stone but only for an instantthe lurch between steps on uneven groundand the solid ground of a new land rose beneath them it was done the wail of the wind died away and the rain ceased abruptly the mist cleared the hill was gone the trolls the grey english skyall replaced by the soft warmth and gleaming bright blues and golds of a desert morning they were standing in the centre of an avenue lined with crouching sphinxes benedict his eyes wide stared at the long double row of statues and the empty white desert and rockbare hills beyond he gave a cry of delight and darted forward remembered himself and halted far from being made sick by the experience the boy positively enjoyed the wild disorienting leap across the dimensional divide here was something new in arthurs experience perhaps the very young did not experience the effects of what was for older folks a most uncomfortable transition it had taken him a fair few journeys before he finally became inured to the more unpleasant sensations the minor inconveniences of extreme temporal dislocation no longer bothered him lets do it again ben chirped his earlier anxiety entirely forgotten we will do it again yes replied arthur when it is time to go home just now we are going to visit anen is this egypt its hot it is very hot arthur opened the satchel and pulled out two lightweight linen cloths he wrapped one around his sons head and then fashioned a turban for himself there thats better he held out his hand come along we should be on our way before it gets even hotter when we get there anen will have a cool drink for us chapter in which ruffled feathers are smoothed engelbert folded the edge of his apron over the hot baking tray and lifted a fresh batch of muffins from the oven he turned and closed the oven door with the heel of his shoea move both deft and quaint and which never failed to amuse wilhelmina he removed his soft hat and wiped his face with the back of his hand and glancing up noticed her watching him etzel smiled his plump cherubic face flushed from the heat these are the best yet liebste he said placing the tray on the table our people are going to love them he rarely called them customers anymore he spoke of the grand imperial clientele as our people as if they were tribesmen or family members the muffins smell wonderful she assured him you have mastered the recipe in no time at all jawhohl he agreed his broad goodnatured face alight you have good ideas mina introducing muffins to seventeenthcentury prague was wilhelminas idea that was true but the design of the baking trays and the execution of the recipe were all due to engelberts singular expertise since opening the coffeehouse the german baker had gone from strength to strength as his confidence rose and his skill was rewarded by the success the shop enjoyed a steady and lucrative tradeenough to keep eight helpers busy three servers dressed in green livery two additional bakers to help with roasting the beans mixing dough and preparing pastry fillings a general helper to prepare fuel feed the ovens and run errands a dishwasher and a cleaner from the moment the shutters opened at dawn until they closed again at dusk the grand imperial kaffeehaus was heaving with activity wilhelmina had taken the position of chief overseer of the enterprise maintaining a gentle but firm control over the business but she also indulged her latest and necessarily secret passion ley exploring since making that first successful journey she had attempted three more using her copy of burleighs device discovering two new leys in the process one leading to an arid desert of red earth and towering rocks and cacti and one to a bleak steppe treeless and windswept beneath low grey skies she had also made a second trip using the ley she had discovered previously which led to that massive limestone gorge though she still could not yet fit a name to that destination nor a time she had nevertheless begun to nurture a growing insight into ley travel in general as well as finer points such as how individual lines might be manipulated for while she was content with merely mapping the leys and trying to determine how to calibrate her crossings wilhelmina had begun to wonder about the incredible possibilities of her new avocationas well as the inherent implications and problems for example what would happen if she attempted a double crossusing two ley lines in two separate dimensions to travel to a third she had no idea but was intrigued by the possibility nonetheless once she felt secure in using the leys she knew she would push the boat out a little so to speak with her experiments very occasionally she thought about returning to her home in londonif only to reassure anyone who might be concerned about her disappearance and to wrap up her affairs however that would obviously mean returning to the ley that had brought her to this dimension and that was several long days journey away from prague when it came down to it the prospect always seemed like a huge bother for such a piddling payoff then too she was not at all certain she could return to the same london she had left what if she got the time horribly wrong there was no guarantee she could even get back to the twentyfirst century anyway the plain truth was she missed nothing about london or her mundane drudging life therenot when set against the possibility of roaming a multidimensional universe with its offer of infinite worlds awaiting her discovery that being the case she could effortlessly think up a thousand more exciting things than returning to her flat to examine the mound of junk mail piling up on the doormat chocolate for one wilhelmina was ever mindful of the fact that she had quite unwittingly introduced coffee to prague and was now reaping enormous benefit from that happy accident not only was she half owner of the first coffee shop in bohemia she was also a partner in an increasingly successful shipping company that supplied her coffee beans lately she had begun to think of importing beans of another sort cocoa it was only a matter of persuading herr arnostovi her principal partner to expand their import business to other commoditiesspecifically sugar and cocoa beansand if that likewise proved successful her future would be secured for if she could secure sufficient quantities of those two items she could make chocolate a luxury as yet unknown in this europe the main problem with the scheme was getting her hands on a ready supply of the raw materials which meant forging a partnership with a spanish shipping company tricky but not impossible and well worth attempting when she considered the rewards that would flow from that revelatory introduction even her most modestly placed estimate was well nigh astronomical there was simply no telling how rich she could become from a venture like that and once loosed from the constraints of having to work to earn a living she would be free to travel and explore plus of course she would have chocolate these thoughts were in her mind as she placed the freshbaked muffins on a cooling rack as she finished she turned just at the moment that her accomplice entered the shop the emperors assistant chief alchemist was wearing his customary green robe with purple stole and fox trim and his hat shaped like a collapsed bag with a brim he took a seat in his usual placethe farthest corner of the room near the kachelofen and folded his hands on the table in a moment one of the serving girls hurried to take his order and wilhelmina placing a fresh muffin on a plate went to greet her friend greetings mein herr she said perching on the edge of the chair next to him here i want you to try something she pushed the plate in front of him it is a new kind of pastry we are thinking of introducingone that has never been seen before in prague gruss gott fraulein wilhelmina he smiled wanly at her swiped off his hat and dipped his head in a polite bow very interesting he said peering at the speckled little cake he prodded one of the tiny black specks with a fingertip those are poppy seeds she informed him theyre good youll like them i have no doubt whatsoever that it is very nice he said looking at the plate doubtfully what is wrong mein fruend is something the matter at the palace oh nothing of consequence he answered quickly i am very busy just now and he hesitated and she prodded go on we are friends you can tell me whats wrong it is that manthat englander he blurted as if releasing a pressure valve it took a moment for wilhelmina to think whom he was talking about lord burleigh you mean she guessed the english earl ja he is insufferable no doubt conceded wilhelmina mildly but why do you trouble about him he has returned has he indeed ja he has returned with even greater demandsimpossible demands that is bad enough but he treats us with utmost disdainas if we were mere slaves bound to do his bidding the man is a tyrant and a bully if he were to fall down a well i would not lift one finger to fling him a rope wilhelmina gazed at her companion clearly he was frustrated and angry it was probably good to allow him to vent a little steam and she was more than happy to assist the process anything she could learn about burleigh and his dealings with the imperial court she counted to her advantage well have some of this muffin she urged in a soothing voice nudging the plate nearer taste it and tell me what you think if enough people like them we will begin selling them in the shop very soon gustavus broke off an edge and lifted a bit of the freckled yellow cake to his mouth he chewed it thoughtfully and announced it is very good moist and sweet what are you going to call this kleiner kuchen we have not decided yetbut we are open to suggestions he nodded and ate some more the maid appeared with his coffee put down the little pot and cup and at a nod from mina retreated again here said mina pouring his coffee taste it with this and tell me what burleigh has done to upset you so gustavus sipped his coffee and recovered some of his usually placid demeanour it is not seemly to take on as i have he said gazing into his cup forgive me fraulein i did not mean to inflict my personal concerns on you i am sorry nonsense she said reaching across to pat his hand what are friends for come now eat some more of this cake and tell wilhelmina what is bothering you the young alchemist did as he was told and in a moment began to relate how early that morning the mysterious earl had appeared at the palace the visitor had spent a long time in close consultation with the lord high alchemist while gustavus continued with his work in the laboratory then he said all of a sudden i am summoned and told to abandon my present work in order to undertake a new commission from herr burleigh but i am deeply engaged in a most delicate experiment i tell them i will be finished in a day or twoand i must not lose all the work i have already completed but no it is not to be nothing will do but that i must sweep everything aside and begin at once on this new projectand they will not even tell me why it is so important that it cannot wait another day he puffed out his cheeks in exasperation months of the most exacting labour gone up in smokepoof just like that most upsetting sympathised wilhelmina what do they want you to do it is to be another device answered gustavus like the one i made beforeto aid in his lordships astral investigations ja but this one is a little bigger and more powerful and more complex in every way i see wilhelmina feigned a mild interest inside her pulse quickened at the news she let him enjoy some more of the muffin and drink some more coffee then said did they tell you the purpose of this new device no he shrugged then gave her a sly smile but i overheard them talking about it when they thought i had gone he sucked in his breath with an audible clutch they treat me like a child tch mina gave her head a derisive shake that is a very shame but i hope you know that i have the utmost respect for your intelligence and skill i am grateful for your expertise she paused then offered i suppose they hope to keep such important work a secret it is to be similar to the first device in many respects offered gustavus but this one i believe is to be used to locate people as well people wondered wilhelmina which people fellow travellersif i overheard them correctlythose who likewise journey on the astral paths the earl says he wishes to meet those who share his explorations the chief underalchemist leaned forward but i do not trust him i think this lord burleigh is not what he appears you could be right wilhelmina frowned there was no question but that she had to get her hands on a copy of burleighs latest mechanism whatever it was and add it to her collection at the same time she thought it best not to let on how badly she wanted the new gismo she was thinking how best to phrase the request when the young alchemist asked would you like me to make one of these new instruments for you well i dont know wilhelmina began not wanting to sound overeager i appreciate you are in a very precarious position i would not like you to put yourself at risk in any way i will do it gustavus slapped the table with determination i will make a copy for you he saw her hesitation and offered you will not have to pay me anything it will be my gift to you i am not worried about the cost mein freund she told him it is you i am worried about gustavus it is such a big risk if the earl discovered what you were doing he could cause a great deal of trouble for you i would not like to see you come to any harm do not worry fraulein no one will ever know of this i am quite certain he took another drink of coffee i am a scientist i have devoted myself to years of study i have mastered the arts of my profession and i refuse to be treated like an ignorant stable hand to be commanded at every idle whim he smiled ruefully excuse me i seem to be forgetting myself it is nothing wilhelmina assured him drink your kaffee and i will bring another pot we have a few more things to discuss chapter in which a burden shared is a burden halved the dig at karnak was abandoned for the rest of the day in favour of other more pressing investigations dr young having recovered from the shock of kits revelations was now in the grip of scholarly excitement and in a fit of exuberance treated kit to a meal at luxors newest sensation the golden ibex hotel recently erected to cater to the citys nascent tourist trade there on a table spread with clean linen he fed his new friend on substantial egyptian fare and began a preliminary examination of the nature and mechanisms of his latest discovery ley travel unfortunately the scientists enthusiastic queries very soon outstripped kits own very limited experience and understanding i honestly wish i could tell you more kit finally confessed as they sat staring at the remains of the meal the real expert was cosimo my greatgrandfather he is the one who got me involved in this and the one who knew the most about it im sure he could have told you far more than i can he sounds like a man after my own heart said thomas i should have liked to meet him if only that were possible replied kit gloomily sadly cosimo is no longer with us thomas catching the note of grief in his companions voice raised his eyebrows am i to understand that his passing was quite recent then kit suddenly unable to speak merely nodded thomas sat back regarding kit across the table forgive me but i am puzzled i had assumed that he must have passed many years ago the doctor nodded cosimo and sir henry died only a couple days ago my dear fellow said thomas his physicians manner coming to the fore he reached across to pat kit on the arm i am truly sorry please accept my sincerest condolences kit thanked the doctor for his sympathy and proceeded to tell his host about the untimely demise of cosimo and sir henry thomas listened to the sorry tale hands folded beneath his chin as kit unburdened himself of the weight he had shouldered since landing in burleighs clutches it is up to uswilhelmina myself and giles that isto carry on the work of those two good men a most noble ambition affirmed thomas i salute you sir moreover i stand ready to aid the enterprise in any way i can thanks you dont know what a relief it is to hear you say that a whitecoated waiter in a blue turban came to remove the dishes dr young spoke a few words of arabic to him and then rose come we will continue our discussion in the garden the walk will do us good they crossed the dining room to a pair of french doors that opened onto a canopied terrace a pebbled path led into a palmshaded garden lush with tropical vegetation they strolled among limegreen tree ferns and dwarf figs peace returned to kits soul after a moment he asked what did wilhelmina tell youabout all this i meanhowever did she explain it well sighed thomas she said the most outrageous thing i have ever heard uttered from a rational human being she told me in no uncertain terms that she was a traveller from another dimension who had come to enlist my aid in helping her locate a very valuable artefact which was believed to be buried somewhere in egypt wilhelmina can be very forceful i thought her demented of course replied the physician in my professional practice i occasionally encounter people suffering from various forms of delusion and insanity however those were merely her introductory remarks i offered her refreshment and sought to keep her talking so that i might observe her better and improve my diagnosis of her particular hysteria he smiled suddenly that was where she captured me the dear girl literally the more she talkedlucidly calmly with animation intelligence and fervour but entirely lacking any of the more explicit signs of mental aberrationthe more fascinated i became in short i allowed her to spin me such a splendidly impossible tale that i confess i was wholly taken in by the audacity of her creative invention thomas raised a finger in his own defence not that i did not arguei put forth numerous and vigorous objections which she could not entirely answer neither did she back down from her assertions in the end we made a bargain in exchange for my help she would provide me with undeniable proof that her claims were genuine thomas young glanced at kit and his voice softened with awe i thought it all a splendid lark i never dreamed what she said might have even the slightest smidgen of veracity in it just thinkthe ability to travel at will through time and space his gaze lost focus for a moment as he contemplated anew the enormity of the implications of the new reality that had broken in upon him you must excuse me he said i still find it all but impossible to credit so do i kit assured him and ive made the leap a few times you must teach me this skill at the earliest opportunity i do insist upon it well why not said kit but getting back to wilhelmina and the bargain you made with her why did you go along with it if you believed it was some sort of mental illness because my dear fellow miss wilhelmina made me give her my word as a gentleman that providing her assertions proved true i would help you he chuckled to himself she can be a most persuasive and determined young lady the proofthe coin the clipping and the pages from the bookthat convinced you observed kit not forgetting the postage stamp added thomas yes i am convinced you see king george sits on the throne of england at the moment princess victoria is a mere child and not even in the direct line of succession yet apparently she is to become queen with her image on every coin extraordinary but the book is the thing that removes all doubt that book has been in my mind for quite some time as president of the royal society ive been collecting my papers and organising them of course for the last several years but i have not submitted them to be published as they are nowhere near ready yet and more remains to be done they reached the end of the path turned around and started back the other way the afternoon had dwindled and the heat of the day was fading somewhat as they walked together kit felt he had found a true friend a person of integrity one whom he could trust he was still uncertain about how much to reveal about the problem of burleigh and his thugs but that was more out of a genuine concern than any wish to obfuscate or deceive having just secured a new and trustworthy ally he did not want to risk scaring him away so they strolled in companionable silence watching the shadows lengthen on the path as evening hastened on thomas pensive and brooding over the earthshaking revelations of the day at last confessed just when i begin to imagine i have achieved some pinnacle of understanding reached the summit of the highest climb i scramble the last few feet to the top only to see that i have merely gained a foothold on a narrow plateau and that entire new mountain ranges rise before me serried ranks of peaks each one higher than the last he laughed softly to himself i feel that way now kit nodded in commiseration i feel that way all the time time strange stuff mused thomas time is the central mystery of our existence it confines and defines us in many ways we are obedient to its inexorable mechanism throughout our lives and yet we know almost nothing about it why does it flow in only one direction what is it made of how is it regulated is it everywhere the same for everyone or might its substance or speed be altered by mechanisms as yet undiscovered i think albert einstein had something to say about it put in kit who i do not believe i know the gentleman no said kit i dont suppose you would but he caused quite a stir in my world tell me about your world what is it likeis it very different the future well where to begin wondered kit i guess things are young stopped on the path no wait do not say another word no whatever you tell me could have unforeseen implications there could be disastrous repercussions he pulled on the corner of his moustache i must think about this i must consider it most carefully okay agreed kit you know best where were we you were talking about the mystery of time indeed sometimes i think that if we could only gain a knowledge of the working of time at its most fundamental level we might at last begin to understand something of the mind and purposes of god im not so sure kit replied it seems pretty random to mebut im no expert thomas regarded his companion for a moment then turned his gaze up into the clear blue sky do you know why i am here in luxor to dig up history study the pastthat sort of thing partly said thomas but only in that all this digging and study serves a far greater ambition which is to unravel the mystery of tombs the pharaohs tombs all tombs at kits quizzical expression he said since the human creature became a conscious being we have made tombs and graves for our dead is this not so i suppose it is a fact from one end of the world to the other and in every successive age from the dawn of human consciousness until now and from the simplest societies to the most sophisticated we have made graves and tombs for our dead have you ever stopped to consider why thomas peered at him expectantly why engage in such an expensive and ultimately pointless activity if death is the final irrefutable answer to all of lifes questions maybe kit ventured thinking of how he rued leaving cosimo and sir henry unburied and unmourned we dont do it for them but we do it for ourselves thomas commended this response very good yet if we do it for ourselves alone what do we hope to gain by such taxing endeavour for if annihilation is all there is at the end of life then tombs ultimately make no sense whatsoever true kit allowed true unless countered thomas quickly there is something more than mere physical existence something that lies beyond the grave something even our most primitive ancestors knew that we moderns seem to have forgotten what did our ancestors know that is the riddle of the tombs declared thomas and that is what i am trying to discover kit considered this for a moment after all your work you must have some theories oh i do thomas assured him with a laugh in my avocation as a scientist there is no shortage of theories indeed it is the one commodity we have in admirable abundance so whats your theory about the tombbuilding it is all of a piece with the very plain and simple fact that we are immortal i dont feel very immortal admitted kit a little unsettled by the turn the conversation had taken but you areand so am i thomas declared all human beings by virtue of having been born into this world are immortal beingsnot our material bodies those are sadly quite fragile inasmuch as they are bound by the laws of matter and time the spirit however is indestructible it obeys different laws dr young turned on the path and started back to the restaurant do you have a place to stay he asked not as such then you will be my guest he glanced at kit unless you have any objection none whatsoever kit replied thanks he looked at the hotel facade rising above the palms you have rooms here my dear friend chided thomas lightly i am but a simple london doctor i cannot afford to stay in such luxurious accommodation besides it is not convivial to my work instead i have a dahabiya im sorry thomas chuckled it is a kind of sailboat you will have seen them on the river as it will soon be dark i suggest we go there now if you have no objection lead on doctor they mounted the steps and made their way through the hotel lobby and out onto the street where three lonely muledrawn carriages waited for passengers thomas called a few words to one of the drivers they climbed into the carriage and they were soon clipclopping along the road fronting the river the sun was low turning the hazy sky a warm golden orange and the nile to molten bronze they passed through a marketa chaos of shops no bigger than broom closets flimsy kiosks constructed of cloth and palm branches and held together with so far as kit could see bits of raffia twine and street sellers whose place of business was merely a hands breadth of cloth spread out on the ground to showcase their meagre wares the press and confusion of people were daunting the cacophony of voices alarming the carriage slowed to a crawl thomas bought a bag of dates from one of the sellers and some onions from another the carriage did not stop for these transactions but squeezed through the heaving throng of merchants and customers at a pace slower than walking dr youngs boat was moored a little distance downriver away from the noisy centre of the town once away from the crush the coach rolled briskly past a row of large and very ornate colonialstyle buildings that housed government administration offices it isnt time travel said kit repeating to himself what cosimo had told him why was that so hard to keep in mind ley travel is not the same as time travel we have to keep remembering thatat least i do you are right of course agreed thomas what you said about being dead and buried and everything being worthless and allthats not exactly true i suppose not forgive me i was not thinking very clearly and spoke in haste you were right about time being out of joint the different worlds overlap somehow and history gets a little slippery but just because wilhelmina found your book already published in one world doesnt mean that what youve done in this one is worthless none of us ever knows what impact we have on the world around us he shrugged we can only live the life weve been given and we have to do the best we can with itno matter what is happening in any other world or universe just do the next thingthats all we can do anyway i expect the work youve done here is just as valuable to this world as it was in the world where mina picked up your book that is a gladsome thought observed the doctor i shall accept it in that generous spirit he thought for a moment then asked do you suppose that if i were to visit that worldwhere our wilhelmina retrieved my booki should meet myself composing it kit frowned is it possible to meet yourself in another world the thought had crossed his mind but he had never asked cosimo for clarification on this precise point there was still so much to learn maybe he conceded cosimo never told me one way or another i dont know well allowed thomas we shall add that to the growing list of questions to be investigated when we are more at leisure to do so they talked on and soon the carriage rolled to a stop at a large mooring it is called the blue lotus said thomas gazing down the line of low feluccas and stately dahabiyas tied up along the riverbank it is just here he charged off along the riverbank kit followed falling into step beside him there is still one thing you havent told mewhy wilhelmina wanted us to get together i thought you knew things got a little rushed she didnt exactly have time to fill me in on everything reflected kit in fact she didnt tell me very much then allow me to enlighten you please the young lady was as i say most intent on recovering a certain artefact he peered at kit with a hopeful expression am i right in assuming you know the object in question i have a pretty good idea this artefact she believed was to be found in a particular tomb of which she had a certain knowledge she wanted me to organise the excavation of said tomban experience she suggested that would prove invaluable to my ongoing work he glanced at kit for confirmation she also said you would be my guide am i to take it you know the location of the tomb of which she spoke im pretty sure i could find it again kit felt his stomach squirm and a clammy feeling washed over him and you will show me kit nodded the thought of returning to the scene of his recent ordealand the decaying corpses of cosimo and sir henryfilled him with dread but he did not see that he had any choice in the matter just now and then he saw it the sheer beauty of wilhelminas plan and it brought him up short dr young saw him stop and turned to ask is anything the matter call me a slow coach but i just realised that wilhelmina is some kind of genius now that he saw it her plan was as obvious as the nose on his face how many times did he have to remind himself this was not the same world he had left behind mina had sent him to an alternate egypt where in the year the tomb of anen had not yet been discovered much less excavated the notion of snatching the map from the tomb before it could be found by anyone else was a shrewd bit of guile the girl was canny give her that i think were in for a real treat kit said we can leave whenever you like is it far this tomb not too far with transportation less than a day splendid the physician rubbed his hands his steelrimmed glasses glinting in the pale evening light ah here we are the blue lotus dr young stopped beside a lowslung rather boxylooking boat with a broad open deck and twin red sails which were furled to the masts for the night a gangplank extended from the bow at the foot of which three sailors in pale blue kaftans squatted around a hookah pipe which gurgled as the smoke bubbled up a most acrid smoke drifted on the soft evening breeze salaam called thomas he greeted the captain and crew of his vessel by name and then climbed the gangplank this way watch your step a servant appeared bearing a tray with a jar and glasses welcome aboard my friend said thomas pouring fresh lemonade into the glasses and passing one to his guest please make yourself at home mehmet here will show you to your quarters i have only the one guest cabin all the others are filled with the accoutrements of my work kit gulped down his lemonade and followed the servant to the companionway below deck and to the guest quarters please to refresh yourself sir said mehmet ushering kit inside i will sound the gong for dinner the cabin was snug and contained two narrow beds at one end and a small water closet at the other there was a round porthole window and between the beds a night table with two candles the beds were laid with clean white sheets and there was a lace curtain at the porthole the floors and walls were teak with brass fittingsall in all a trim and tidy little stateroom well kit old son said kit gazing around with approval it looks like weve landed on our feet a basin of fresh water sat on a stand stepping to the porcelain bowl he dipped his hands and washed his face then wet the linen towel and kicking off his shoes stretched out on the bed with the damp cloth over his eyes thank you wilhelmina he sighed at the invocation of her name he mused what was it she called dr young the phrase from her letter came back to him the last man in the world to know everything chapter in which a visit to prague is wangled lady haven fayth sat on the edge of the bed and laced up her shoesgood sturdy hightop boots to protect her feet from the hazards of unfamiliar roads in lands and times unknown burleigh had promised to teach her the intricacies of what she called ley leaping and so far the black earlas she thought of himhad been as good as his word he had taken her on several of his journeys to various worlds and shown her how to recognise some of the more subtle elements of ley lines under his somewhat haphazard tutelage she had begun to master a few of the basic skills necessary not only for making such leaps but for finding her way around strange new places if not exactly a fount of valuable wisdom at least the earl was reliable in that the things he chose to show her worked even so it was clear to her that there was much more to be learned and that he was withholding far more than he was telling for example she knew from her long association with her uncle that there was a prize of inestimable value associated with the cause and which burleigh and his men were determined to find the earl was careful never to make mention of this fact directly and haven thought best to pretend ignorance of it too she let on that so far as she knew it was only ever about the exploration of the other worlds connected by the leysabout discovering and mapping she also knew burleigh was desperate to get his hands on the skin map but that he had not yet achieved even so much as a glimpse of the genuine articlea fact that surprised her given his enormous expenditure of money time and energy then again the only two people she knew who had ever possessed a piece of the fabled map were now lying in an egyptian tombdead at the black earls hand and for that haven fayth would loathe him to the end of time as for the restabandoning kit and giles well regrettable as that might be it had been simple expediency and could not be helped in that dreadful tragic situationmade prisoners and entombed with poor dead cosimo and her dying uncle henry to remain locked up with the others would have been death to stay alive gave her a fighting chance it was as simple as that and if she were able to stay alive long enough to master the technique of ley leaping and gain the necessary knowledge there was every chance that she could return to the tomb in time to rescue her friends so far as haven was concerned there had been only one choice she did not regret making it but she hated burleigh for forcing the issue the man was a dastard and a brute outwardly she pretended to be a compliant accomplicea willing ward to his stern and watchful warden she feigned a friendly regard for him and in a mildly coquettish way led him down the primrose path towards a belief that given time and the right incentives she could become something morea paramour perhaps she appealed to her darkly handsome companions ego and vanity allowing him the impression that he as the older and wiser master was winning her admiration she used her beauty and her feminine wiles to appeal to his innate masculine pride and haven fayth as she had learned long ago could be very very appealing just now was a case in point for burleigh against his initial reluctance was allowing her to accompany him to bohemia this was not the first time he had gone there and he much preferred going alone the precise destination haven had yet to learn that was no matter the bare fact that burleigh wanted her to stay home made her all the more determined to go and through charm alone she had won her way this will not be a simple journey he told her as they climbed into the carriage later that morning three leys are employed the first is some miles from here and the second and third require a strenuous march in point of fact well have to walk a fair distance before we get there are you certain you want to put yourself to all that it is not too late to change your mind and miss the wonder that is prague she said smiling sweetly as she handed him her rucksack who told you we were going to prague no one she snipped i deduced it on my own am i correct get up there burleigh said opening the carriage door are we to expect any of your hirelings to attend us as well she asked as she settled in the seat facing him not now they will meet us there later he knocked the top of the carriage the driver cracked the whip and the coach lurched into motion burleigh regarded her doubtfully i only allow the men to come when they can be of use in fact i should not have let you talk me into allowing you to come ohshe pulled a pretty poutwhere would be the fun in that it is so stultifyingly tedious when you are away and you are forgetting that you promised to teach me everything there is to know about ley leaping i intend to hold you to that promise well he huffed see that you make the most of the trip we will not be there very long then why go at all she challenged if it is putting you to so much bother as all that what pray is the point because he said growing irritable it is an errand of some importance if you must know i have commissioned a special instrument to be made and i am going to pick it up straight in and straight out again she had pushed him far enough it was time to retreat and leave him the field the merest possibility of seeing such a fabulous city is satisfying enough for me she said favouring him with a smile i am certain that it will be worthwhilehowever much time we have to spend we shall see he said softening somewhat beguiled by her winsome and innocent smile he added perhaps we can do better than that the palace is impressive and the rathaus then there is the emperor himself of courserudolf is an enthusiast of the first order very grand extremely generous and also a complete ninny you will enjoy meeting him if the chance should come your way and would you know it there is now a coffeehouse in the old square the first one in europe i believe i believe we have coffeehouses in london yes i am sure of it of course i have never visited such an establishment myself but i would dearly love to see such a place and taste some of this coffee for myself we shall see he allowed we shall see did you bring a change of clothing as i told you we cannot have you traipsing around prague dressed as you are he meant in her travelling clothes which consisted of a simple drab linen dress and hightopped boots you cannot be presented at court looking like a milkmaid to be sure she agreed blithely as instructed i have packed silk and lace suitable for just such an occasion a short while later they reached the first ley and burleigh sent the carriage away the first leap took place in the usual way and as usual haven experienced the acute disorientation and nausea resulting from such sudden and violent dislocation they landed in a rural landscape that seemed to be a wooded river valley in some remote place devoid of any sign of human habitation where are we she asked when she could speak again i have no idea whatever burleigh replied impatiently are you quite finished we have a fair way to walk i am truly sorry if my discommodious behaviour has inconvenienced you my lord she replied tartly she dabbed her mouth with her sleeve i assure you it cannot be helped although she was growing more used to what she thought of as the seasickness accompanying the leaps it still had the ability to momentarily immobilise her and burleigh had little patience for such weakness come along when you are ready he said striding off are there people about she asked when she had caught up with him none that i have ever seen how odd not at all if you care to think about it rationally for a moment there is nothing remotely unusual about it see here he said stumping along our world has not always been so populous as it is at present indeed the reverse is more the rule since for long epochs of human history vast areas of landscapewhole continentswere devoid of human presence thus i suspect that we have arrived in this world at a particular time in its history where this place is still virgin territory in short there may be people on this worldi should be surprised if there were notbut there are none around here and you have never undertaken to explore this world at all a bloody waste of time he sneered waving a hand at the empty plains there is nothing of interest here so it is only a connecting place thena station on the way a way station yes in my experience there are many such places he told her while they may have other uses to me they merely serve as a means of getting from one ley to another he walked on a little farther then continued the next ley is a few miles distant and between the one we have just used and the next one there are no towns or villages farms or whathaveyou that i have ever seen how did you know to come here my dear he said offering her a sardonic smile i am not without resource you know i have been about this business for some considerable time the parts i know i know very well such as those in egypt yes he agreed egypt in several of its epochsat least the ones that interest me he walked on a few steps then added so far although lord burleigh did not use any external references for travelling to places he knew haven was making her own map using sir henrys green book as an inspiration she had begun writing down descriptions of the places she had visited the locations of the leys and any salient features she deemed important to remember as yet it was a fairly wordy affair with directions and orientations for setting and location and such but she was working on a way of coding the information in a more compact and precise form it was a good mental exercise and she had the distinct feeling that it would prove useful in days to come if nothing else it filled the idle hours when she was alonewhich happened more frequently than she liked burleigh did not take her everywhere most of his journeys were made without her and for reasons he kept to himself for despite whatever he might say to the contrary the earl maintained a fierce secrecy around his plans and doings far from discouraging her it only made her the more determined to discover what he knew that he did not care for her to know or was not prepared to share what burleigh hoped to gain from their liaison was also something of a mystery as yet he had not made any untoward demands or advances on her he seemed content to allow their rapport to develop in its own good timean expectation haven was happy to encourage so long as it proved a useful ploy they walked along beneath a low grey sky into a freshening wind the air was clean and cool and laden with the scent of rain at the edge of the wood they came to a rise which led up and out of the shallow river valley and onto a grassy plain far in the distance a range of low hills rose in a ragged line but on the plain itself there was nothing to be seen save the grass undulating in waves like a wide green ocean haven took one look at the formless expanse and asked however did you find a ley out there i have my ways my dear he put his head down and started out into the prairie by that she thought he meant a map though she had never seen him use one she followed in his wake listening to the swish of their feet through the tall grass after a time they came to a narrow crevicea veeshaped cleft in the ground like a miniature fault line running west and east cutting through the plain in an unwavering line here it is burleigh said holding out his hand hold on this wont take long she took his hand and they walked a halfdozen steps while physical contact was not strictly necessary she had learned that it made for more accurate leaps or at least lessened the chance that they might become separated why this should be she had yet to discover in the space of those first steps the sky seemed to dim and the prairie grew hazy around them the wind gusted flattening the grass driving down along the fault line rain spattered sharp and heavy there came a shriek from a great heightas if the sky were being tornand then all turned black she landed with a jolt that sent a tremor up through her bones the gorge rose in the throat but since she had nothing to throw up she gagged it back swallowing hard she wiped the rain from her eyes and looked around the landscape was dark the evening stars bright in the east they seemed to have arrived on a promontory above a crescent bay there were boats lined up on the beach below and at the point of the cove some distance ahead she could see the lights of a village kindled against the gathering evening gloom time is against us today burleigh said well have to stay there tonight and get an early start in the morning the ley is a few miles the other side of that headland the village said haven as they started towards the lights does it have a name trondheim i think were in norway they speak danishor some dialect of it so far as i can tellbut were not in norway too far south i suspect it is a trading colony established by danish settlerssomething like that fishing boats call in here for supplies and water there are two inns and several taverns the people are friendly enough for all you can understand them what will they make of us who knows i pay in good silver that is all they care about true to form they were welcomed at the inn and enjoyed a hearty supper of fish pate on brown bread followed by stewed mutton and greens they were given rooms at the top of the house which was quiet enough though haven alone in her lumpy bed was kept awake by raucous singing late into the night the two travellers slipped out of the inn and were back on the trail again before sunrise burleigh located the ley and as the first rays of the new morning broke over the hilltop to the east they made the leap to bohemia burleigh had marked the ley using small white stones in a line beside the trail which was delineated by a standing stone a burial mound a notch in a distant hilltop and of all things a gallows beside a lonely crossroads the earl had calibrated the leap preciselyhaven heard him counting off the steps under his breath as they walked briskly along the line there was a blur of cold mist and a screech of wind and they landed on a quiet sunny hillside a few miles from the city of prague they walked through a countryside of young green fields and arrived at the city just as the gates were being opened for the day once on the road they fell in with the ordinary traffic of merchants and travellers arriving for the days business they passed through the city walls down some narrow streets and across a wide and handsome bridge where burleigh stopped at last it is very like london observed haven gazing around approvingly smaller and better paved cleaner to be sure but not without similarities the palace is up on the hilltop he said indicating the bulking eminence commanding the high point of the town who is the emperor rudolf the second replied haven crisply everyone knows that i am astonished you should ask i was just making sure you knew he started off again just as the bells in the cathedral tower began to ring within moments every other church bell throughout the city began chiming as well urging the faithful to attend mass will we see his majesty asked haven after a moment i should very much like to it is possible burleigh allowed if he happens to hear that i have come for a visit he may demand an audience he fancies himself leading a renaissance of science and likes to keep a finger in every pie is that why you have chosen prague to have this instrument made burleigh cast a quick sideways glance at his companion she was a quickwitted lass beneath those russet curls was a mind as quick and supple as any he had ever met very good my dear yes the science here is in its infancy but their craftsmanship is more than adequate to my purpose they are amenable and do not ask many questions he paused then added unlike yourself you flatter me sir she replied brightly the street rose steeply before them and began winding its way up the hill to the palace precinct passing rows of tidy houses and shops the people going about their business seemed reasonably welldressed and prosperous and above all clean the front steps of the dwellings were washed the windows tooeven the streets were swept and the rubbish left in neat little piles for the refuse cart to collect as they walked along haven kept an eye out for the coffee shop hoping to inveigle burleigh into stopping for a cup of the fashionable elixir but she did not see it and they climbed higher into the city very soon arriving at the palace gate which was open to allow visitors to pass through unimpeded they crossed the yard and were met by two guardsmen in gleaming silver breastplates and helmets they crossed their long pikes in a ceremonial barring of the way until burleigh speaking in rough german stated his name title and business whatever he told them the guards raised their weapons and allowed the two visitors to continue they passed beneath the statue of saint george slaying the dragon and into the great vestibule of the palace there they were intercepted by one of the imperial ushersyouths whose duty it was to conduct the emperors guests to their desired destinations again burleigh spoke a few words and they were escorted deeper into the warren of rooms and buildings that was the imperial residence how is your german asked burleigh as they progressed along a seemingly endless gallery why sir i have no knowledge of the language at all confessed haven readily you know more than you think you do the earl informed her since you speak english you already know a thousand words or more however you will not be required to speak just pay attention and you can pick up most of what you need to know by way of gesture and situation just remember the bohemians are very formal people they arrived at a large panelled door and stopped the usher knocked on the door for them and a voice from inside answered whereupon the usher bowed and stepped away indicating that they should enter after you my dear said burleigh chapter in which a threecup problem is expounded kit woke from the first deep and restful sleep he had known in weeks he lay for a while listening to the sound of water slapping gently against the hull of the dahabiyasuch a serenely peaceful sound rousing himself he sat up and realised that the boat was moving wearing the nightshirt the doctor had given him he crept from his room and up the companion way to the deck above it was almost dawn and the captain was taking the boat upriver luxor was behind them already and ahead only the green banks of the nile with date palms and fields of flowering sesame on either side good morning my friend called a voice from the raised quarterdeck at the stern of the boat fancy a drop of tea dont mind if i do kit answered moving to the steps leading to the higher deck he saw thomas in a silk dressing gown enthroned in a large rattan chair with a gently steaming mug between his hands on a low table beside his chair was wilhelminas letter kit joined him drawing up another of the rattan chairs from its place at the rail i do my best thinking this time of day thomas told him cooler more conducive to clear thoughts he removed the cosy from a painted ceramic pot poured another mug and passed it to kit whenever i am faced with an intractable problem i find tea helps concentrate my mind nothing like the first cup in the morning agreed kit is there milk in the jug please help yourself as kit poured he added its camel milk by the way kit took an exploratory sipsweet and mildly nutty he decided but wholly acceptable the two men drank in silence for a moment watching the riverbank slowly slide by beneath a sky the colour of rose petals after a while the doctor said i have been awake half the night thinking about your problem mehmet the steward came with a fresh pot of tea and took away the old one the doctor refreshed their cups settled back in his chair and said what are you prepared to tell me about this artefact we hope to find in the tomb kit thought for a moment you know about ley travelas described by wilhelmina interdimensional transportation yes young became keen his steel glasses flashed in the earlymorning light that is an area i intend delving into in far greater depth but for purposes of this present discussion we will consider it amply demonstrated he took a sip of tea continue well the phenomenon was discovered or at least actively pursued by a man named arthur flinderspetrie who roamed around exploring the various ley connections and their destinations he recorded his findings on a map a very prudent fellow approved the doctor i like him already in order to preserve the map and i suppose have it ready in any circumstance he had it tattooed on his body kit ran a hand over his chest and torso that way the map was permanent and could never be lost ingenious they call it the skin map and it takes the form of a very sophisticated symbol code i have seen some of the symbols but i dont know how to read them yet you have seen this map of skin not exactlyi mean i have seen an imitation of it my greatgrandfather cosimohe had found a portion of the map and kept it under lock and key but when we went to look at it we found someone had stolen the original and substituted a poor copy instead the copy was worthless you said it was only a piece thomas pointed out do you mean that the map has been apportioned in some way it has confirmed kit cosimo thought the original map had been divided into at least four pieces why it was divided and who divided it we have no idea there was a suggestion that it was cut up to protect the original secret of the map in some way but i dont think anybody really knows nevertheless in the years cosimo spent in the chase he succeeded in finding one piece i never learned how a pity thomas drained his tea and reached to pour another i can see this is going to require at least one more cup kit held out his cup for a refill but the map is only the beginning i daresay thing iskit grew earnestflinderspetrie found somethingsomething incredibly unimaginably valuablea treasure of some sort he kept hidden from the rest of the world truly breathed the doctor wholly caught up in the tale as if the secret of ley travel were not enough kit nodded solemnly cosimo pledged himself to discovering that treasure and it killed him in the end as ive explained were not the only ones looking for the map he went on to tell more about lord burleigh earl of sutherland and his men describing how they always showed up at just the wrong time what they were like and what he knew about them he ended his account saying unfortunately bad as they are they arent the only ones in competition for the map after all someone stole cosimos portion of the map and it wasnt the burley men the doctor was silent for a long moment then said am i to take it that the object we hope to find in the tomb is in fact a piece of the map nothing less confirmed kit cosimo and sir henry gave their lives to the quest the map is part of it and i have pledged myself to carry on their work its as simple as that thomas young pondered what had been said for a moment then replied the scientist in me is begging for confirmation can any of this tale of the map be proven factually i think ventured kit that when we excavate the tomb well find the factual confirmation you needproviding the map exists in this present reality of course we wont know that until we look thomas considered this please do not misunderstand i believe you implicitly the proofs already in evidence are enough to swing the balance in your favour he waved a hand at the letter on the table that along with the stamp the coin the pages from my book of essays which have yet to be published these have more than satisfied me thomas leaned forward his voice rising with excitement but see here the implications of what you have shown meand what we hope to learn from the tombare nothing short of worldshattering if confirmed this discovery leads directly to a radical new understanding of the universe youre telling me said kit quietly but the scientist was not finished enthusing about the connotations of a universe full of multiple alternative worlds this is perhaps the greatest scientific discovery of all time we must begin a systematic study of ley travel and determine its driving mechanisms he raised a finger in the air as if lecturing that is of utmost importance for when we have gained a thorough mastery of that we will have gone a very long way towards unravelling the mysteries of the universetime space reality he smiled as a new thought occurred to him perhaps even the very nature of existence itself kit was all for advancing scientific knowledge but allowed himself a slight frown it starts with getting our hands on the map to that end i will underwrite the venture with funds i have at my discretion all i ask is to plot and catalogue the find and to requisition any objects of special interest for further study be my guest said kit just so long as we secure the map ill be happy while the two continued their discussion mehmet appeared on the quarterdeck to say that the captain required kits direction in locating the village there are five settlements on the west bank of the river mehmet said the captain wishes to know which is the one you seek kit thought for a moment the third i think i remember passing two as we came downriver but ill know it when i see it we are coming to the first one now said the steward kit rose and went to the rail he saw tall date palms their spindly trunks high above a collection of low mudbrick hovels women were washing at the waters edge their children playing in the shallows atop the bank two men loaded a donkey to twice its height with new green rushes and another led a buffalo along the path to pasture while dogs barked at his heels this isnt the place kit announced after a quick survey mehmet relayed the message to the captain and then announced that breakfast would be served kit and the doctor returned to the main deck where beneath a striped canopy a table had been set up and places laid i hope you are as hungry as i am called thomas we must eat a hearty breakfast if we are going into the desert today it will be too hot to eat until after sundown they enjoyed a good breakfast of fruit and sweet breads tiny red sausages spiced with paprika and onions yoghurt and coffee while they were eating the boat approached another riverside settlement which after a cursory inspection kit decided was not the right village third times a charm he said returning to the table they finished their meal as the boat rounded a slight bend and the next hamlet hove into view he saw the well and the stone steps leading down to the rivers edge he saw the boat that had taken him downriver to luxor this is the one declared kit from the rail he pointed to the tallest structure in the village there is khefris house the captain brought the boat to moor and the crew put out the gangplank ready asked thomas donning his white straw hat ready as ill ever be replied kit then lead the way down the gangplank up the bank and into the village where thanks to khefri and his father ramesses the requisite negotiations for labourers and animals were begun by the time the sun was standing directly overhead the expedition had swelled to respectable proportions with the acquisition of four donkeys two mules and six additional workers to undertake the excavations they then set about assembling the necessary provisions for the men and animals khefri had wangled himself a job as overseer and interpreter for the workers and took his new role with a seriousness that thomas admired while kit and thomas stood in the shade of a date palm the young egyptian organised the party and supervised the packing by the time all was ready the sun had long since begun its descent into the west ramesses who had done quite well out of the negotiations invited kit and thomas to supper they spent another night aboard the boat and set off the next morning with kit and khefri leading the way all i know kit confided to his new colleague a few minutes after setting off is that the tomb is in a wadi to the west of herebeyond the ruined temple he glanced at khefri you know the temple of course but there are many wadis khefri told him it is not possible to know which one you mean i was afraid youd say that kit thought for a moment this particular wadi is very large and splits into two branches after a few hundred meters or so also there are small tombs and burial niches carved in the walls all along the way why did you not say this at the beginning kit livingstone you know the place of course everyone knows this place if you can get us there i can find the tomb they spent the night in the desert camped outside the ruined temple kit showed his new benefactor the avenue of sphinxes and the ley line it contained the leys seem to be time sensitive he explained as the two stood looking down the straight path between the paws of the crouching lions early morning and evening seem to be the best times to attempt a leap i can sometimes feel when it is active extraordinary the scientist squatted down and put a hand to the broken pavement do you feel anything now kit shook his head not at the moment no he cast a glance to the sky the sun was well down the night stars rising in the east it may be too late maybe when we have found what we are after i can show you how it works i will look forward to a demonstration with keenest anticipation the next morning khefri led them to the wadi entrance and the expeditionary party proceeded down the long winding stone corridor of the gorge they reached the divide and a little farther along began seeing the burial niches they came to the steep cutting where kit and giles and lady fayth had climbed up to await their assault on the tomb in the illfated attempt at rescuing cosimo and sir henry shortly after that they arrived at the place where the main channel split into east and west tributaries this is the place said kit gazing around here is where we make camp the bowlshaped gulley was much the same as he remembered it with only slight variationsso slight in fact that kit had difficulty remembering that this was not the place he had been before in this world it was and there were neither tents nor burley men and no excavated tomb either just the sheer dustcoloured rock walls and the dry and empty wadi floor winding away on either hand the great empty temple was there and still emptythough the interior when inspected later bore signs of scavenger activity indeed there was no guarantee that anen had even lived in this world much less that he had been buried in the wadi are you certain this is the place thomas sweating beneath his big white straw hat patted his brow with a handkerchief and looked around doubtfully i have to say i have never heard of a tomb located in such a remote and inaccessible location i would never have thought of digging here if the tomb is here at all it will be in this wadi kit assured him somewhere he paced along the eastern branch a few dozen steps and stopped at a bend in the rock that looked faintly familiar just about here id say he pointed to the base of the curtain wall somewhere along here is the entrance there are steps leading down to the burial chambers below he looked along the seamless wall for any sign of the tomb but saw nothing to betray a hidden entrance at least thats the way i remember it from the other place then that is where we will begin the doctor told khefri to have the men unload the animals unpack the equipment and set up camp soon the area resembled a bedouin village complete with low wingshaped tents and a tiny campfire of twigs and dried dung over which flat bread baked on the bottom of an upturned pot sweet acacia smoke drifted on silvery threads into the air and as the sun sank below the surrounding hills an air of peace and calm descended over the ancient burial ground while the evening meal was cooking the doctor took a long thin iron rod and began probing the sandy floor of the wadi where kit had indicated thrusting the tip of the rod deep and waggling it around searching for any fissure or other anomaly that might betray a manmade structure this is how we begin thomas explained you would be surprised what can be learned by literally poking around working methodically he applied the rod along the base of the wadi wall when he finished he had identified a halfdozen places where exploratory trenches would be dug kit was satisfied that at least one of them would turn out to be the sealed entrance of the tomb darkness claimed the day and after their simple meal the men rolled in their cloaks to sleep and soon the camp was at rest in the silence of the desert kit himself spent a restless night troubled by dreams of finding the bones of cosimo and sir henry or worse being locked in the tomb with their rotting corpses those unhappy thoughts cast a dark cloud over his soul that lingered through the next day until at the third trench the diggers uncovered a large capstone set in the wadi floor khefri came running with the news sir sir come quickly dr young is calling for you what is it kit was lying on his grass mat in the shade of the tent having completed a tiring stint at the second trench have they found something it is the entrance of the tomb khefri dashed away again hurry kit jumped to his feet and rushed after the swift egyptian thats what im talking about now the fun begins chapter in which the infant science of archaeology is radically advanced it took two days to clear the rubble from the tomb entrance and the small forechamber filled as both were with sand and rocks and bits of shattered pottery on the morning of the third day of the dig thomas and kit stood together and viewed the main chamber of high priest anens tomb someone was in a terrible hurry thomas pronounced upon seeing the extent of the wreckage a new worry snaked through kit you mean the tomb has been robbed oh no that is not my meaning at allquite the reverse if i am not mistaken then kit puzzled over this but the sense eluded him what the burial crew would seem to have been in some haste to discharge their duties and seal the tomb before it could be discovered see herehe gestured at the boxlike room filled chockablock with debrisin a funeral of state the priests would have taken care to preserve the sanctity of the tomb egyptians loved ostentationhave you noticed how they decorated every inch of every available surface in a temple with all manner of paintings and carvings i have yes it was true thought kit egyptian temple art was nothing if not spectacularly busy it is the same with their tombs ordinarily the chambers are filled floor to ceiling with objects the deceased required for his journey through eternity a high priest would have anticipated a sumptuous afterlife surrounded by the objects he valued and all that was most needful for his eternal existence but they didnt do that here said kit grasping for the meaning because they didnt have time precisely affirmed thomas he gestured towards the great heap of broken stone the remains of building rubble we may learn the reason for their unseemly hurry when we have cleared all the chambers there are two more i believe thats right kit pointed across the room to a barely visible wall he tried to visualise the chamber as he last saw it the room were interested in is somewhere back there at least it was the last time i was here correct me if i am wrong suggested thomas his steelrimmed glasses glinting in the faint light as he turned to address kit directly but strictly speaking you have never been in this tomb strictly speaking youre right the tomb kit remembered was in a different dimensiona fundamental fact but one he had trouble remembering we will begin clearing this chamber today thomas said rubbing his hands in anticipation but we want more workers i think i shall send khefri back to fetch khalid and his crew from luxor have you any objection none whatsoever youre the doctor three days later khefri returned with the new workersseven expert excavators including khalidand three donkeys and five pack mules laden with additional tents tools water and provisions for an extended stay in the desert after half a days rest from the journey the dig shifted into a higher gear and kit was glad to see the work progressing by leaps and bounds at the end of the second day the main chamber was cleared of rubble and the back wall fully exposed to reveal an expanse of white plaster with vertical bands of hieroglyphs in black and yellow there is a door to a smaller chamber kit explained stepping to the wall he ran his hands along the surface turning his palms white from the plaster it should be right about here he brushed his hands on his trousers and turned to dr young but you have to remember none of this was here when i saw it before the plaster will be removedstarting in the area you have indicated thomas told him that will be tomorrows exercise the labourers were sent out to sift the rubble for any fragments of interest while the doctor assembled his drawing instruments and drew up a scaled representation of the wall then thomas kit and khefri set about painstakingly recording the hieroglyphic bands covering the area of the hidden doorway a task that occupied them far into the nightand would have taken far longer but for khefris native facility with rendering the old symbols the next day they were back at work before sunrise the more skilled workers were detailed to chisel away the plasterwork covering the doorway to the hidden chamberbut only after thomas was satisfied he had matched every symbol against the rendering copied the night before i will save these to decipher at my leisure he explained rolling up the last long scroll of paper he gave a nod to khalid who commanded the workmen to ply the hammer and chisel to the wall do you know how to read them wondered kit watching as the first blow of the hammer erased a line or two of ancient pictorial text it is devilishly difficult at best allowed young but we are making progress each new discovery adds to our store of words and the knowledge of the ancient text increases there are some here i have never seen before but i can foresee the day when we will be able to read the old script as easily as the daily newspaper the ones you have deciphered prompted kit what do they say they seem to be prayers of a sort addressed to various godsinvocations of protection for the tomb and for the ka that is the soul of the deceased others seem to be petitions for guidance on the journey to the afterlife some of the writings i have seen undoubtedly show incidents from the life of the deceasedlists of properties and assets descriptions of family members notable events and that sort of thing because we are beginning to see certain collections of symbols repeated in the tombs and on sarcophagi we surmise that the prayers seem to follow what we believe is a rote formula kit nodded what little he knew about egypt he had learned in school visits to the british museum from the book of the dead perhaps he volunteered a large chunk of plaster tumbled to the floor and smashed into pieces disclosing bare stonework behind ah you have heard of it but of course you would in your time it must be very well known tell me is egyptology a wellstudied discipline in your world it is very popular kit allowed thinking primarily of mummies and movies about mummies archaeology is big business in the home world and do its practitioners solve the many riddles posed by hieroglyphic writing well i would say began kit no do not tell me i should not know it was wrong of me to ask i have already pressed you far enough he smiled nervously please excuse my impetuosity i sometimes forget myself no harm done replied kit amiably whats a little professional curiosity between friends all the same professional curiosity could lead to some very unfortunate consequences a single word might put time out of jointif you see what i mean i might say something that would reveal too much of the future kit surmised and that could cause irreparable harm the doctor concluded or good i am not prepared to take that risk are you his gaze became intense i suppose not replied kit realising he had been revealing whole reams of knowledge about the future from the moment he showed up getting back to the book of the dead he suggested by way of changing the subject in actual fact its title is the book of coming forth by day as i was about to say we have yet to recover the whole text but we have retrieved many portions and fragments the doctor paused a moment and collected his thoughts then recited a verse from memory i wake in the dark to the stirring of birds a murmur in the trees a flutter of wings it is the morning of my birth the first of many the past lies knotted in its sheets asleep winds blow making flags above the temple ripple out of darkness the earth spins towards light i feel a change coming my thoughts flicker glow a moment and catch fire i come forth by day singing thats very good said kit appreciatively i like that it is not about death you see but about rising to eternal life for the ancients death was simply an emergencea coming forthfrom darkness into the glorious light of a new and better day they were fascinated by immortalityobsessed with it as a civilisation they turned vast resources to furthering their understanding of the afterlife in the hope of eradicating death entirely whole sections of plaster were tumbling to the floor now raising clouds of thick white dust khefri a damp keffiyeh over his nose and mouth was given the task of supervising the demolition work thomas and kit retreated outside to wait until the dustmaking destruction was finished kit tumbled up the steps and into the bright morning light he stood blinking up at the sky clean blue and high above and it did seem as if he had stumbled from darkness into the allpervading radiance of a better world stepping free of the tomb he felt compelled to ask why were the ancients so in love with death who told you they were in love with death wondered dr young pulling a soft cloth from a rear trouser pocket he removed his glasses and began wiping off the dustcovered lenses is that not why they perfected mummificationto preserve the body as long as possible isnt that why they went to such great lengths with all their elaborate tombs and mortuary temples and such on the contrary dear fellow they were in love with life corrected thomas replacing his spectacles and such lifelife in great abundance life in all its glorious splendour death was anathema to them death though natural and common was unacceptable death was seen as nothing short of tragic disasterat the very least an unfortunate accident along the happy road of existence and one which in time they hoped to learn to avoid altogether they were searching for immortality precisely because they wished life to continue forever without end dont we all we do cried the doctor of course we do we were made for it after all i know not what it is like in your timeperhaps your world enjoys a more enlightened viewbut in this current mechanistic age such thoughts are increasingly considered backwards and unscientific he shook his head sadly too many of my brother scientists are succumbing to a view that holds all religion as outdated nonsensenursery tales from mankinds infancy dogmas to be outgrown and swept aside by scientific progress im familiar with the view confirmed kit but see here continued thomas brightening once more contrary to what many may think immortality is not a fairy tale invented to compensate for an unhappy life rather it is the perception shared by nearly all sentient beings that our conscious lives are not bounded by this time and space we are not merely lumps of animate matter we are living spiritswe all feel this innately and in our deepest hearts we know that we can only find ultimate fulfilment in union with the supreme spiritual realitya reality that appears even during this earthly life to take us beyond the narrow limits of time kit pondered this although somewhat alien to his thoughts he heard in the words as from a far country the distant but undeniable ring of truth at last he said do you think we live forever oh i do i most certainly do we are all immortal as i said thats right you did kit savoured the idea for a moment thinking of cosimo sir henry his own parents and all he had known who had gone before its a good thought yet i perceive you remain unconvinced the doctor pursed his lips and regarded kit doubtfully could it be as i fear has the concept fallen out of favour in the age to come before kit could reply he rushed on i challenge you to clear thinking mr livingstone consider consciousness is who we arewe interact with the material world as conscious beings and in no other way is that not so that is so consciousness then is the most evident brand of existence there is you might call it selfevident and it is not necessarily bound to matter at all that much is easily demonstrated can you not bring images to mind of faroff places friends and relations fondly remembered or of things that made you happy in the past can you not imagine acts of kindness or cruelty do you not recognise the truth of something when you hear it or know beauty when you see it he glanced at kit for confirmation then pressed towards his conclusion all these and more are expressions of consciousness and they are not bound by matter or space or time in the least since this is the case it will be most natural for our more limited human consciousnesses to recognise and yearn for an affinity with the one great consciousness that made usthe spiritual consciousness of the creator sharing in this divine awareness is the most natural form of existence he leaned forward and planted a finger on kits chest see here if we can establish an affinity with the eternal everliving creator then is it not likely that this affinity this relationship if you like will endure beyond the death of the material body the doctor did not wait for an answer i tell you it is he declared triumphantly and it is because we can establish an affinity with the eternal creator that immortality becomes more than a fairy tale at the very least you must allow it becomes a most reasonable hope just then they heard raised voices echoing up from the open stairwell behind them and khalids head and shoulders appeared in the excavation hole come quick sirs he called waving them towards him the doorway is revealed once inside thomas inspected the work and approved it well done khalid have this rubble cleared away and then we shall dismantle the sealing blocks the egyptian overseer bowed his head to show he understood and then turned to command his crew yboud he ordered and the workers began scooping rubble into baskets of woven hemp it is of utmost importance not to rush at this stage the doctor explained when they returned to the wadi everyone is always curious to see what lies beyond the door what treasures may appear in haste irreparable harm often resultsinjury to artefacts and grave furnishings that can easily be avoided allowed sufficient patience and care that sounds like the voice of experience kit observed oh aye agreed thomas ruefully it has been my misfortune to have arrived on the scene of several digs too late to prevent the stampede and i have witnessed what can happen when excavators contract gold fever in the race to get their hands on the treasure they will trample valuables still more precious to the scholar and scientist some of these items are in an utterly fragile and delicate condition thomas turned to gaze at the dark rectangular hole as the first workman appeared bearing a heaping basket on his shoulder we will be having none of that on my digs glad to hear it remarked kit i expect the map is especially fragile its just an old piece of skin after all and if you are right mr livingstone added thomas that old piece of skin is one of the most uniquely valuable artefacts the world has ever seen once the room had been cleared and swept clean more oil lamps were lit and placed all around the area to be excavated and under dr youngs eagle eye the sealed doorway was opened block by carefully chiselled block as the hole grew bigger kits pulse quickened when the hole was big enough to reach through thomas took up a lamp and standing on some of the blocks passed the lamp through the breach see anything asked kit edging forward objects replied thomas stepping down once more the room is filled with grave goods he nodded to khalid take it down the bricks came thick and fast now and soon the last of the sealing blocks was removed thomas ordered more lamps to be lit he passed one to kit and one each to khefri and khalid after you dr young said kit indicating the darkened doorway with his lamp the archaeologist hesitated seeing as youre the leader of this excavation and its benefactor i insist the doctor gave a nod and stepped to the threshold and holding his lamp high peered into the darkened room he stood motionlessas if frozen in an attitude of searching expectation doctor said kit what do you see he glanced at khefri who held his hands clasped beneath his chin his dark eyes aglint in the flickering lamplight indescribable breathed the doctor edging farther into the doorway turning slowly he beckoned kit and khefri to join him you had better come and see for yourselves the two stepped through the darkened doorway in the faint illumination of the single lamp he saw a confused and jumbled wall of objects and furniture crammed floor to ceiling and jammed into every available space boxes large and small chests of cedar lime wood and acacia latticework room screens collapsed bed frames stools and footrests and headrests chairs both simple and ornately carved bronzerimmed chariot wheels and disassembled harness trees innumerable jars of all shapes and sizes weaponsspears swords daggers throwing sticksboth functional and ceremonial a collection of painted rods and flails of office and a host of small clay models of everything from cows and hippos to women making beer and men planting barley baldheaded scribes halfnaked slaves kohleyed goddesses in formfitting gowns and enough servants to populate a village and more it was as if the entire contents of an antique dealers showroom had been stuffed higgledypiggledy into a receptacle no larger than the living room in kits old flat and then locked away for several hundred eons moreover everything was shrouded with a heavy layer of powdery ochre dust he did not know what he expected but the sight left him speechless all the same somewhere in the midst of a small museums worth of antiquities awaiting discovery lay the skin mapperhaps in one piece it was all he could do to keep from tearing into the heap sensing something of the frustrated expectation thomas offered we will find your treasure my friend never fear if it is in there we will soon have it in hand over the next two days the contents of the main chamber were cleared piece by piece and each item was numbered by thomas and recorded in a book along with a brief description of the item and its condition in order to speed the process along kit set up a relay system and convinced the fastidious doctor to go along with it he had a canopy erected in front of the elaborately carved doorway across the wadi from the tomb there in the great empty chamber kit called the temple he established dr young at a table beneath the canopy then with kit directing the excavation work inside the tomb each object was carefully pulled from the tomb and either carried or relayed hand to hand by workmen to the table where thomas first inscribed a small number on it in sepia ink then recorded the find in his ledger the artefacts were then conveyed to the empty chamber where khefri supervised their storage there they would remain under guard until thomas could arrange for their transportation to london and ultimately the british museum each box chest and jar was personally examined by kit as it came from the burial chamber hands clothes hair and every inch of exposed flesh became pale with dust he looked like a powdered ghost with a damp handkerchief tied around the lower half of his face he doggedly kept at his work always expecting that the next ancient container he put his hand to must contain the map in this he trusted to thomas simple dictum that by process of elimination they must sooner or later find his treasure while all this cataloguing and recording might have been a logical and reasonable and properly scientific way to proceed it did nothing to assuage kits continual urge to just rush in and start prying open the various containers until he found it and although there was no end of interesting objects issuing from the tomb they found neither goldin the form of rings bracelets belts or other items of jewellerynor the prized roll of human parchment they sought this exacting activity continued each of the four days it took to unpack the burial chamber on the morning of the fifth day the workmen finally removed the folding room screens of carved acacia wood that had stood along the back wall of the tombthe wall of painted panels depicting various events in high priest anens life all impressively rendered vivid and lifelike more lamps called kit and sent khalid to invite thomas and khefri to come and see the masterpieces these are the paintings i was telling you about said kit the three stood together holding their lamps high to admire the exquisite rendering i must bring an artist as soon as it can possibly be arranged thomas said though i doubt any mere copy could do justice to the original his expression alive with pleasure in the glow of the lamp was that of a boy at christmas they are wonderful that one looks like my father observed khefri quietly he pointed to one of anens priestly attendants and therethat is the very image of my cousin hosni over here gentlemen said kit directing their attention to the panel where a shavenheaded priest stood next to a caucasian man in a colourful striped robe open at the chest to reveal a cluster of tiny blue symbols on his skin i give you the man himself upon my word gasped thomas here he is he searched among the hieroglyphs beneath the painting found the one he was looking for and traced it lightly with a fingertip the man who is map arthur flinderspetrie said kit he was here said khefri high priest anen knew him yes he did kit stepped to the last panel and now he said with a gallery owners flair the piece de resistance he directed their attention to the figure of the shavenheaded priest a little older and heavier standing with what looked like a scrap of leather in his hand that declared kit is the skin map as it once existed and see anen is pointing with his other hand to that big star behind him what is that hmmm thomas held his lamp closer it appears to be the constellation canus major i take it to be siriusa star especially revered by the ancients no doubt due to its prominence and seasonal qualities that is more or less what cosimo and sir henry thought confirmed kit and the object anen is holding he continued that is the flinderspetrie mapyou can tell from all the little blue symbols on it and based on cosimos assessment it appears to be all in one piece extraordinary breathed thomas it is very much as you described he turned a grinning face to kit as it has not been discovered in any of the boxes or chests yet examined it must be in one of the few left kit cast a glance around the room at the several dozen or so remaining containers we live in hope the work resumed kit returned to removing and with thomas opening the last boxes and chests his hopes soaring and crashing with each one until khalid appeared at the table beneath the canopy to say this is the last he placed a small black lacquered box on the table inlaid with ivory and lapis in a geometric design it did seem the kind of box to hold a treasure open it instructed thomas with a trembling hand kit lifted the lid upon an elaborate beaded necklace of lapis carnelian and amber a priceless object in anyones estimation there were also a matching ring and brooch but no map well thats it muttered kit all this for nothing not for nothing tutted thomas we have excavated a very important tomb and have made considerable archaeological finds the hieroglyphics alone will prove invaluable to our understanding this is a major discovery it will advance the science of archaeology by leaps and bounds you should be proud sure allowed kit but you know what i mean we came here to find the map he gestured forlornly in the direction of the storage chamber cut in the sandstone of the wadi wall behind them weve got a whole truckload of treasureseverything except the one we came to get and yet suggested thomas his steelrimmed glasses glinting in the sun there is one container we have not searched i looked in every blessed box and jar myself blurted kit disappointment making him raw it wasnt there oh ye of little wit admonished the doctor use that brain of yours sir think i am thinking kit muttered i am thinking weve been on a wild goose chase my impetuous friend chided thomas shaking his head we have not looked in the sarcophagus the sarcophagus hope instantly renewed flared in kits despairing soul he started back to the tomb on the run all hands on deck were going to need all the help we can get khalid bring the heavylifting equipment called the doctor he paused and shouted towards the temple khefri fetch the cook and bring a team of muleswe may need them carved from a single block of red granite the hulking mass of stone sat in the centre of the chamber as yet untouched kit swept away the dust with a handful of rags to expose the smooth stylised visage of a man features impassive staring with blank eyes into the darkness of eternity below the face the rest of the stone lid was engraved with row upon row of hieroglyphs this wont be easy observed kit the thing must weigh twenty tons how are we going to lift it give me a lever and a place to stand and i shall move the earth thomas told him archimedes he squatted down beside the massive granite case and ran his fingers along the seam joining the lid to the bottom we will also use wedges and ropes setting the lamps in a perimeter around the great stone case the labourers set to with levers and wooden wedges working in tandemtwo levers a few inches apartthey eased up an edge of the lid and held it while another workman hammered in a wedge the process was repeated time and again all along the righthand side of the huge stone top when they finished they started over again raising the lid a little more and driving in the wedges that much farther after the third round of prying and hammering they had succeeded in raising the weighty red granite a few inches ropes were passed around the centre of the lid and these sent up to be secured to the mule team the levers were applied nudging the carved top a little higherenough to drive even larger wedges into the gap and tilt the lid to one side little by little the top rose and tilted until with a low grinding sound like the rumble of distant thunder it began to slide off the ropes grew taut as the mules took the strain khalid dashed to the chamber doorway and called instructions for khefri to relay to the mule drivers slowly slowly with a creaking complaint of ropes and wood the massive stone lid tilted and slid all at once one of the ropes gave way the stone slewed to one side teetered then crashed to the floor with a thud that shook the ground beneath their feet the dust was still rising in the air as kit thomas khalid and the nearest labourers rushed forward to catch the first glimpse of the interior of the sarcophagus any hope for jewelled treasure or golden ornaments was swiftly dashed for inside was a second sarcophagus of limestone richly painted to resemble the deceased high priest in his ceremonial robes the lid of this second sarcophagus was lighter and was raised with little difficulty by the workmen to uncover a third coffin of wood also painted the third lid was prised off in a moment to reveal the mummified body of anen tightly bound in linen bands to withstand the ravages of time over the chest had been placednot jewelled ornaments or ceremonial trinkets as in the case of others of highborn castebut only a simple olive wood ankh the ubiquitous cross with a loop symbol for life nothing more kit leaning over the mummy scanned the interior of the coffin but saw no boxes chests or bundles of any kind he felt the heat of discovery begin to fade into the gloom of disappointment once more well what do you think should we unwrap him he asked doubtfully we do not have the proper equipment said thomas but i doubt we would find anything i am sorry i fear we have been grossly misinformed i guess kit miserable with frustration moved to the painting of the priest holding the map and pointing to the star what was the old boy trying to tell them kit livingstone said khefri suddenly look here the headrest the doctor returned to the sarcophagus what sharp eyes you have my boy breathed thomas i do believe youre right kit turned to see the doctor and khefri leaning over the mummy once more crossing the distance in three bounds he watched as thomas reached down beside the linenwrapped corpse here give me a hand lift the mummygently carefully there got it he straightened and in his hand was a square of something wrapped in linen it looked like a mummified sofa cushion our friend anen was using it as a pillow herelets get it out into the light where we can see it better suggested kit already heading for the door out in the daylight the carefully wrapped packet was examined for any external markings there were none the linen bindings were the same as those used to swathe the mummy i will enter this find in the ledger said thomas moving towards his station beneath the canopy then we shall open it if kit had had his way he would have torn off the bandages then and there but he agreed and followed the doctor to the table and watched with mounting impatience as thomas made his entry then handing kit a thinbladed knife he passed the parcel to kit along with the admonition to be very careful and take his time so as not to damage the delicate artefact within with trembling fingers kit slit open the top layer of bands and began unwinding the long narrow strips one after another the layers were removedseven in alland as each fell away excitement grew until kit was almost hopping from foot to foot the last layer of binding strips was unwound and there on the table before them lay a pair of wooden plaques tied with a cord of braided hemp that had been died red the plaques were olive wood raw and unvarnished but covered with columns of black writingnot hieroglyphics nor any language kit had ever seen before he licked his lips do you recognise the script the doctor raised his glasses and bent down to scrutinise the writing so close his nose almost touched the ancient wood i cannot say that i have ever encountered it he clucked his tongue alas i dont know what it might be the cord was tied with a simple knot and the doctor reached for it then hesitated i think he said pushing the bound wooden plaques towards kit once more that you should have this honour kit his mouth dry tugged at the woven cord which parted as the ancient fibres shredded beneath his fingers he brushed aside the disintegrating fragments and holding his breath lifted the top wooden plate there covered with a thin square of gossamerfine linen pressed like a rare leaf between the preserving sheets of a scrapbook lay an irregular scrap of parchment almost translucent with age the finegrained leather thin as gossamer and brittle as a scarab shell was covered with a wild scattering of the most superbly etched symbols in dark blue like a shadow shrivelled by the noonday sun doubt vanished at the sight and kit knew that he had found the skin map part four the language of angels chapter in which the scholarly inquiry bears strange fruit d ouglas flinderspetrie stood beneath the dripping eaves marvelling at the pageant there were maids with pails of milk on yokes across their shoulders ferrying their wares to the college inns ironmongers selling skewers and sconces bakers with trays of fresh bread on their heads hurrying across the square vendors in ramshackle booths selling candles ribbon cloth cheese and spices a butcher working from the back of an open wagon carving up the carcass as required by his customers a pie seller with a handcart shouting for business a farmer with braces of trussed and squawking chickens strolling through the milling throng and on and on like a live action study for a brueghel painting how any of the students could concentrate on their professor who was holding forth a few dozen paces away douglas could not fathom but the lecturer tall and gaunt upon his wooden crate lifted his voice above the general din and declaimed in precise latin on the subject of the day while the students dressed in scholars robes of green and blue faces earnest beneath the level brims of their square hats sat or lounged on bales of straw that had been dragged together to form a loose semicircle around him not a few of the townsfolk stood listening as well sometimes calling out facetious answers to the rhetorical questions posed by the renowned teacher it was the professor douglas had come to see the sole reason he had so painstakingly polished his latin and assembled the wardrobe studied the history manners and customs in order to make this trip to the mids therefore douglas studied him intently a trim solemnfaced fellow of middle years with a strong nose and highdomed head roger bacondoctor professor scientist and theologianhad established himself as a prime moving force in the fields of academia that were his domain anatomy medicine science alchemy philosophy and theology he wore his dark hair short and tonsured like any other priest of his stripe and his simple brown franciscan robe though threadbare and frayed at hem and sleeve was clean his belt of braided cord neatly tied at one point in the lecture some local youths muscled their way to the fore and began talking loudly and making rude imitations of the professor standing on his wooden box from this douglas grasped another fact of his research the petty jealousy of some of the townsfolk of what was increasingly considered the educational elite in their midst some like the crude yokels douglas observed felt themselves hard done by a system that seemed to favour those they considered transient interlopers and effete snobs indeed owing to his propensity for unorthodox notions and the inexplicable behaviour that often accompanied his various experiments the esteemed man of science was steadily establishing himself as a leading eccentric if not a capandbell fool in the court of public opinion the troublemakers pursued a rather halfhearted attempt to interrupt the proceedings until two bulky bailiffs with long pikes appeared and moved them along order restored the openair symposium continued douglas turned his attention to the lecture and tried to follow it as best he could the latin was accomplishedfluent and fluid eloquent and elegant in expressionand so highly polished by years of scholastic application that even when douglas knew the words being spoken it was difficult to ascertain what sense was being conveyed the students and a smattering of townspeople seemed to grasp the meaning of what douglas eventually concluded was a discourse on the nature of the universe and the place of reason in framing the human conception of reality it might well have been riveting stuff but it took all of douglas newly acquired expertise in the ancient language just to identify the subject actually following the subtle nuances of the argument were well beyond his nascent abilities still he had a basic general idea of the flow if not the particulars and anyway he had not come to sit at the feet of the learned professor he was on a far more important mission snipe douglas hissed under his breath do not throw that he had seen his pugnacious assistant fingering a rotten pear he had picked up from the gutter on their way to the lecture drop it now the youth turned a baleful gaze upon his master but still clutched the overripe fruit juice oozing from his fingers drop it said douglas obey with a sneer of defiance the pale youth released the fruit the pear hit the ground with a dull splat snipe stomped it with his foot and ground the soft fruit into the dirt he then stood rigid with rage and glowered at the rabble around them good boy douglas commended him and offered him a sop we will find a cat for you later the lecture eventually came to an end and the students began drifting off in twos and threes melting into the general bustle of the busy town square a few lingered to ask questions and douglas waited for these to finish when all had gone away he approached pax vobiscum magister bacon he said removing his round monks cap and making a nicely practised bow of deference deus vobis quis est said the professor as he turned taking in douglas robes he said god with you brother douglas introduced himself as a visiting priest who had come seeking enlightenment on a scholarly matter i wonder if i may call on you in your lodgings to discuss it it would be a sublime pleasure for a certainty replied master bacon alas my duties are many and i have not found a way to expand time to accommodate them all therefore i must sadly decline your offer to attend meattractive as it may be to be sure replied douglas who had anticipated a similar response and was ready with a reply i would not presume to add to your burdens in any way god knows yet it may interest you to know that i come from the abbey at tyndyrn where an exceedingly peculiar manuscript has come into our hands we know not how he saw the glint of curiosity spark in the professors dark eyes some of my brothers believe you may be the only person alive who can read it this manuscript of which you speak said roger bacon rubbing the back of his hand what can you tell me about it very little sir you see it is written in no language ever seen before at least not one that our best scholars can identify congratulations my friend declared the august professor with a bow of his tonsured head you have succeeded in intriguing mean eventuality that grows more difficult with each year that christ tarries will you come to me tonight at the bear we will have supper together he indicated the inn behind them i take my meals within and my table is always ready i shall keep a place for you his eyes shifted to douglas companion and your acolyte of course gods greeting my son upon regarding the youth more closely his smile wilted he is mute and does not speak douglas informed the master with a pat of snipes overlarge head my thanks master bacon until this evening then god with you friend replied the professor stepping away douglas waited a moment then crossed the square and proceeded to the star inn where he had taken rooms he spoke to the matron and requested food and drink to be brought to him he and snipe returned to their upstairs lodgings douglas to study some more latin in preparation for the evenings conversationan activity he expected to tax his linguistic powers to their utmostand snipe to sleep in preparation for tonights vigil then just after sunset the two ley travellers donned their outer robes once more and went out to meet master bacon at the bear they crossed an allbutdeserted squarenow occupied only by a few old women gleaning morsels from the detritus and garbage heaped at the street corners and some mongrel dogs snuffling through the refuse in the gutters ignoring their beggarly imprecations douglas hurried to the inn paused beneath the torch above the door and with a last warning to snipe to be on his best behaviour lowered the hood of his cowl and went inside the interior was a fog of smoke and steam and the scent of the beeswax candles that lit the room casting everything in a warm amber glow he stepped to the serving hatch and procured a pie then turned to get the measure of the place there were tables of assorted sizes scattered about the large central dining area served by a wide deep and glowing hearth where spitted meat roasted cauldrons gurgled and bread baked three smaller rooms opened off the main room each containing a single long table and benches in one of these snugs they found roger bacon surrounded by a bevy of studentssallowfaced striplings with straggly beards and long tousled hair some wearing their scholars robes others dressed more informally in dark satin jerkins and tunics all clutched jars of ale and they rose as one to greet the newcomers pray you do not stand on our account douglas told them please sit and take your ease posting snipe at the door with the pie he took the seat offered him at the end of the table our friend is visiting from tyndyrn abbey the professor informed his audience he poured another jar and pushed it along the table to douglas he comes seeking enlightenment is this not so verily that is the purpose of my visit replied douglas he noticed the twitch of the students eyes as they darted glances to one another when he spoke he guessed the cause and swiftly moved to disarm any mistrust adding before we converse further i will apologise for my lack of learning and the crudeness of my speech i was not brought up to the latin of my betters i was born and raised on the isle of man whatever learning i possess i acquired late in life and through the instruction of those but little better informed than myself he gazed steadily around the table and concluded i am sorry if my speech offends you brothers i humbly beg your indulgence nonsense cried roger bacon all scholars are pilgrims on the same journey some may have set foot to the path the sooner and so have advanced a little further he too passed his gaze around the gathering as a pilgrim people we do not presume to hold judgement over one another but accept all likeminded travellers in our company as friends for the journey the students subtly chastised ratified this sentiment with hearty cheers and thirsty quaffs of beer hailing the newcomer in their midst my thanks said douglas wiping his mouth on his sleeve in imitation of his companions i am your servant since our company is complete said the master let us break bread together and commend our converse to the almighty may our erudition bring him glory amen cried the students to supper three of the more junior members were dispatched to the kitchen to collect the food and bring it to the table they trooped off noisily returning shortly with a collection of crockery filled with roast meats small loaves of bread and a variety of vegetable porridges wooden spoons were passed around and they all fell to with a will douglas was glad he had remembered to bring along a knife of his own since in an age where everyone was expected to furnish his own cutlery the hospitality of the inn did not extend past the communal wooden spoons the meal soon settled into a convivial hum presided over by master bacon and douglas observed the manners and culture of his fellow diners the camaraderie was genuine and seemed deep as was the esteem in which they held their renowned professor when friar bacon spoke all eyes turned to him as all thoughts yielded to his guidance his was the last word in all discussions as might have been expected of academics the talk around the table was a heady stew chemistry mechanics mathematics astronomy all mixed together with heavy dollops of philosophy and theologymuch of it beyond douglas ability to digest however rich the master was always able to elucidate any matter further or expound in greater or finer degree douglas sensed that the scope and sophistication of the mans thoughts were staggering and though he could not follow the intricacies of expression he could marvel at the suppleness of mind that produced it when long after the dishes had been cleared and the ale jars filled once and again and again the students were dismissed to their evening prayers and the master at last turned to his newest guest now my friend we have some time to ourselves will you accompany me to my laboratory where we can speak more privately of course i would be honoured leaving the inn they went out into the night passing through the city only intermittently illumined by torches and braziers set up at the street corners and tended by the towns bailiffsthe local militia who acted as peacekeepers and enforcers of the kings law tonight the old town was quiet and the two menaccompanied by a truculent shadow in the form of snipewalked easily and unmolested down the wide street leading to the bridge and its imposing tower upon reaching the base of the tower master bacon produced a large iron key and proceeded to unlock his laboratory which occupied the ground floor while the professor worked his key in the lock douglas turned to snipe stay here and guard this door he told him bending near i do not wish to be disturbed understand by means douglas did not perceive the professor lit candles with a mere snap of his fingers as soon as it was light enough to see the interior douglas observed that it was a single large square room its stone walls unadorned its floors bare two long board tables set up on trestles side by side ran the length of the room their surfaces covered with books and parchments at one end and bottles vials jars and mixing bowls on the other in a nearby corner stood a brick oven something like a small blacksmith forge smouldering coals sent a thin tendril of smoke rising towards a hole in the ceiling surrounded by arcane tools and vessels of copper iron tin and bronze it gave that corner of the room the appearance of a combination foundry and chemists laboratory near to the oven was a large wooden chair piled high with fleeces and coverings a large iron candle tree stood to one side of the chair and a contraption resembling a cantilevered drafting table stood on the other from this douglas surmised that it was the place where the eminent professor did his reading and thinking and writing welcome my friend said master bacon waving out the reed he used to light the candles every creature has its true home this is mine here i have everything i need for the sustenance of the inner life a most commodious dwelling agreed douglas indicating the collection of bottles and jars on the table he said am i right in thinking that you are engaged in alchemical investigations you are perceptive replied the master for some years i have been pursuing the promise of alchemy alas it is proving a very elusive prize it is with no small regret that i confess i seem no closer to achieving the goal i have set for myselfalthough i have made many discoveries and enjoyed some small success along the way nothing is wasted said douglas verily roger bacon smiled indulgently for the scholar no effort is ever wasted he moved to the end of the table covered by his manuscripts i believe he said rolling up one of the parchments to clear a space you have brought something for me to examine let us be about our business i am your servant said douglas reaching into the inner pocket of his robe he brought out the small linenwrapped parcel he removed the cloth and placed the book on the board i would be most grateful sir to receive your erudite opinion for i confess its contents are wholly mysterious to me not sir corrected bacon but brother only we are fellow priests are we not douglas merely smiled and pushed the book nearer roger bacons gaze fell onto the volume his dark eyes suddenly agleam with the excitement of the chase let us see what we have taking up the book he carefully opened the leather cover and stared for a long moment at the first page then turned it glanced at another and then three more in quick succession how did this come into your possession he asked his voice trembling his gaze turned fierce he stabbed a finger at the text this this bookhow was it obtained is there some difficulty replied douglas slowly unable to read the meaning behind bacons words he stalled for time to think do not be offended i pray thee bacon said but i must know it is of utmost importance to me it belonged to the previous abbot i believe as i have it the book was found among his things when he died last spring douglas lied he had practised the story so often he almost believed it himself how it came into the dear mans possession i cannot say the present abbot could no doubt tell you more but as he is too old and infirm to make the journey here i was deputed to the task douglas offered a smile of wan sincerity beyond that i can offer nothing i am sorry a very pity the eminent scholar shook his head gently it may be that certain questions must remain unanswered until another day in the meantime we shall proceed with the task before us roger bacon opened the book again and douglas breathed an inward sigh of relief as he watched the scholar brushing his fingers lightly over the closewritten lines of abstruse symbols his lips moving all the while can you read it douglas asked trying to affect a scholarly disinterest for a truth i can confirmed the master you see my friend i am the one who devised it devised wondered douglas uncertain he had heard correctly do you mean that you wrote this oh no bacon replied with a quick shake of his head i did not compose this book but i transcribed the script in which it is written pray what language is represented here i confess neither i nor anyone else i know has ever seen the like here the master scholar allowed himself a bemused smile that does not surprise me in the least he said gently few mortals will have ever seen it he lowered his gaze to the text once more brushing a line of the flowing script with his long fingers it is the language of the angels chapter in which blood tells pay strict attention now archibald instructed lord gower use that clever brain of yours think he turned to the table behind him which was covered by a sheet we will try this test again are you ready archie dark brow furrowed with concentration nodded ready my lord the earl whipped away the cloth now tell mewhich among these items are the genuine articles and which are the imitations he indicated a spread of small objects arranged on a rectangle of blue velvet take your time he urged and concentrate remember all ive told you hands folded beneath his chin the young man stepped forward and gazed at the array of objects on display a brooch with a cameo surrounded by a ring of tiny sapphires a cat carved of ebony a silver owl with jet eyes a golden ring in the shape of a scarab with a shell inset with lapis and carnelian an alabaster statue of a crocodile fighting a hippopotamus and a pair of pendant earrings of blue green red and yellow glass beads these objects had been pulled from the earl of sutherlands extensive collection of antiquities and all were fine specimens of their kind you may look but do not touch cautioned the earl an expert must be able to tell from the very first glance concentrate which are the fakes and which the authentic creations archie burley reached a tentative finger towards the cat figurine then pulled back his hand he went on to the ring and then after havering between the owl and the crocodile statuette chose the gold ring and earrings instead the scarab and the pendant earrings he announced these are genuine lord gower raised his eyebrows questioningly the little scarab and the earrings are you absolutely certain archie gave a curt nod not the owl not the brooch his lordship tapped the cameo making the sapphires sparkle this is a valuable piece he indicated the alabaster statuette why not the crocodile it is very beautiful the question was not which is the most beautiful or costly declared archie you asked which were the genuine artefacts and which the fakes i choose the scarab and the earrings well done archibald the earl began clapping his hands very slowly you are correct those are genuine egyptian antiques you have the talent lad you will get on thank you sir but tell me continued lord gower picking up the brooch why did you not choose this pretty bauble or the hippo and crocodile the brooch is too archie hesitated then offered a shrug too shiny real gemstones are more subtle i think the setting is real but the stones must be imitation and the hippo is wrong what do you mean wrong explain the hippo is too small and it looks like a pig i suspect the object was made by someone who had never seen the real animal or perhaps the craftsman simply copied this piece from another figurine he waved a hand at the cat and owl the cat is of good design and workmanship but the material is not authentic an egyptian artist would have used stone likewise the owl what is wrong with the owl the figure is cast in silveragain not a material an egyptian artist of the classical period would have used he glanced at his instructor for approval am i right you are entirely correct gower beamed at his pupil my boy you have learned your lessons well i think you are ready to accompany me to the sales room i am honoured sir archie felt a quiver of excitement at the thought although inwardly spinning cartwheels of joy he maintained a calm and disinterested mannerthe way his lordship had taught him a shrewd trader never revealed his true emotions an unguarded gush of enthusiasm could easily drive up the price of a bargain or worse ruin an acquisition altogether i will do my best not to betray the trust you have placed in me i am certain you will acquit yourself in a right worthy manner the earl began picking up the valuables to return them to their respective cases in the hall tomorrow he said fingering the brooch we will begin your education on the floor of sothebys auction house the next day they rode by carriage along the strand disembarking at the end of wellington street and proceeding on foot the last few hundred yards so that the earl might view some of his london properties his holdings in the city were by some measures modest but provided a steady income that to archie seemed positively astronomical not that the young man was in any position to complain lord gower provided him with a weekly allowance as well as a yearly stipend a fair portion of which he passed along to his mother during his time in lord gowers employ archie had risen from the humblest of beginnings as menial dogsbody ascending rung by rung in the earls estimation as greater trust and responsibility were conferred upon him from odd job and errand boy archie had become in turn scullion help groom assistant footman footman second underbutler assistant valet and so on to arrive at what amounted to the role of personal private secretary when the earl went upcountry archie went with him when the earl travelled on the continent archie was there to help with all and sundry arrangements when the earl and his entourage decamped for the earls northern estate archie was sent on ahead to make ready the house and grounds for his lordships arrival and nowadays whenever the earl was summoned to windsor or attended the house of lords archie went too all the while the young man was learning the manners and customs of the elite biding his time until he could strike out on his own to make his fortune a man must have an occupation the earl had advised him years ago what will be yours i wonder can i not remain in your service sir he had asked archie was twelve years old at the time and could conceive of nothing better than being a member of the earls household staff as long as you like answered lord gower but my dear boy i shall not live forever much as i might regret it when i go my lands and titles will pass to a cousin whom i have not seen in twenty years that is a fact of law in any case i do not wish to leave you without a way to make a living in the world you cannot be a servant forever you are made of finer stuff i do not care to leave you sir nor i you but blood tells archibald the earl smiled and put a fatherly hand on the young boys shoulder there is aristocratic blood in you and that cannot be denied the earl had long since discovered the circumstances of archies birth and ancestry moreover through his various connections he had succeeded in orchestrating a reconciliation of sorts between lord ashmole and gemma burley extracting a tidy settlement for archies mother yet with a steady eye on the future lord gower was determined to provide archie with an occupation he could take up in years to come to this end he had decided to teach his fosterling the ins and outs of the burgeoning trade in antiques and ancient artefacts that had taken the british aristocracy by storm and in which vast sums of money were to be made by one who knew the business well gower knew his business for a man in the earls position his interest in antiquities was merely a glorified hobby he did not need the swathes of cash that came his way in the trade nevertheless he saw a substantial livelihood in it for a young man especially one as promising as his protege by the time his tutelage was finished his lordship was in no doubt that archie burley would make his way in the world quite well now as they approached the auction house lord gower rehearsed his pupil on what to expect insidehow the auctions were conducted and the bidding progressed he concluded saying we will observe todayalthough if something of interest comes up i may enter the fray in any case i want you to pay attention to those who place bids one can tell a great deal of their interest or means from the way they hold themselves as the bidding reaches the upper limits it can be most instructive archie nodded in days to come we will select an object to acquire and i will have you place the bid i want you to become accustomed to the feelings associated with the game as i see it and learn to control them in this as in everything your best advantage is a cool head and an unclouded mind i will do my best sir i know you will archibald they came to a halt before the large regency building that was home to sothebys auctioners ah here we are shall we go in the earl led the way through the brassencrusted doors into the redcarpeted lobby where he was met by liveried staff who greeted him and conducted him straightaway to the manager who with much bowing and scraping made his lordship welcome your lordship we are honoured please make yourself comfortable while i arrange chairs to be placed for you on the floor good day to you mumphrey replied the earl there is no need to trouble yourself we only just called out of idleness and curiosity would you care for a soothing libation my lord i have some excellent sherry wine just in from portugal i would value your opinion sir the partners are thinking of taking a consignment to let out at auction certainly mumphrey it would be my pleasure replied the earl while the manager scuttled away to fetch the sherry lord gower allowed his attention to roam the room there is no one here at present he declared although the grand entrance was in fact quite full and more people were entering let us see what we have on offer today they joined the mingling crowd gathered around the presentation tables lining the lobby there were also easels set up with broadsheet announcements and descriptions of the various items that would be offered during the days session as i expected observed the earl after a brief perusal there is nothing here of interest to us still that is not our chief concern we are not here to acquire we are here to learn it will be instructive and instructive it certainly was though not perhaps in the way his lordship intended much less approved for in this first visit as well as those that were to follow over the next months what archie learned first and foremost was the enormous leverage of an aristocratic title allied to this keen student that he was archie also gained an appreciation of the immense usefulness of an auction house as a disinterested purveyor of goods as he observed the ebb and flow of the auctions ritual dance the young man quickly formed the opinion that while it was all well and good to acquire pieces from places like sothebys to sell at a profit to rich clients it was a slow and inefficient way to amass a fortune it seemed to archie that the best position was that of the originator of the sale the greater profits were realised by the seller not the middleman buyer rather than being a broker for othersfor that in essence was the role lord gower playeda man with taste good judgement and a sense of the market and who also possessed the means and inclination to travel could easily acquire the same objects in their native countries so to speak and sell them directly to private clients or simply put them onto the market through the auction houses furthermore if that man also possessed an aristocratic title then his future was assured archie had seen how doors opened to the earl that were barred to lesser mortals how men deferred to him how women fawned over himand all due to his title which preceded him wherever he went smoothing his way through the world if archie were to own a title others both clients and vendors would trust him for that reason alone little by little as his understanding of the antique trade increased his resolve hardened a vision of his future began to crystallise in his mind in the meantime he was content to add to his store of knowledge a greedy sponge he would soak up all lord gower had to offer when the day came for him to part company with the earl archie knew what he would do and how he would go about doing it chapter in which patience and practice pay off are you certain you wont come with us asked kit they were standing once again at the end of the sphinx avenue in the earlymorning light both thomas and khefri gazed apprehensively down the long row of statuary towards the temple set in the face of the sheer rock cliff i have made my decision replied the doctor somewhat wistfully someone must remain behind to take care of all the treasures we have liberated from anens tomb he put a hand on the young egyptians shoulder my young friend and i have several years worth of work to do thanks to you this experience has been most enlightening i am in your debt not a bit of it kit countered if anything it is the other way round you will come back asked kherfri when you have found what you are looking foryou will return to egypt i will promised kit if at all possible ill be back before you know it wilhelmina fished the brass ley lamp from the pocket of her jumpsuit a tiny glint of blue winked in the earlymorning light we should be going she said replacing the odd instrument moving to dr young she extended her hand when he took it she pulled him into a hug thank you for everything thomas i knew i could trust you and kits rightwe will return as soon as possible rest assured that in your absence i will endeavour to further inquiries into the philosophical implications of ley travel said thomas gently extricating himself from her embrace he patted the copy of the skin map he had carefully sketched and now wore beneath his shirt next to his own skin god willing i may even be able to translate the cypher then well leave you to it said kit on your return i will happily accompany you wherever your further journeys take you added the doctor on that you have my word until then said kit clasping his hand mina touched kits arm its time wilhelmina and giles had shown up the previous evening in the midst of the excavators celebration at having found the skin map kit in an expansive mood took them down into the tomb and showed them the wall paintings see here he said indicating the third panel we didnt have time before but here is the man himselfarthur flinderspetrie dressed in a striped robe open at the chest to reveal the tattoos extraordinary agreed wilhelmina probably the firstif not the onlyportrait of the man and his map giles who had last seen the room as a prisoner locked up with the corpse of his master and condemned to die of thirst turned his gaze slowly towards the sarcophagus where he and kit had put the bodies of sir henry and cosimo kit saw the glance and involuntary grimace that followed and recognised the reaction i know giles he said it takes a little effort to put it behind you but it might help to remember that this is not the same tomb where sir henry and cosimo died that tombthe one we were inis in another place and time in another world giles nodded but said nothing now said kit moving on to the fourth panel of the giant wall painting take a look at this last one there is high priest anen holding the mapthe whole thingas he points to the star but ours is only a piece commented wilhelmina isnt that what you said possibly a fourth or fifth of the wholejust as cosimo believed and which more or less corresponds to the portion i saw in the christ church crypt but you said that was a fake mina pointed out it was confirmed kit although someone had gone to the trouble of making it roughly the same size and shape as the original he had stolen what will you do with the map wondered thomas now that you have found it what will you do first kit considered we must learn to read it and then well use it to carry on cosimo and sir henrys quest to find flinderspetries treasure wilhelmina put her face close to the painting she held her lamp nearer and studied the map in the high priests hand are these in any way accurate do you think i wish they were said kit theyre just the artists representations i dont think the people who drew those symbols had any interest in rendering them in exact detail my guess is they probably never saw the real map at all he shrugged who knows let me see it said wilhelmina kit turned to thomas who produced a bundle wrapped in fresh linen the doctor untied the cord and unrolled the nearly translucent patch of human parchment in the gentle lambent glow of the lamps the indigo symbols etched on the skin seemed to pulsate with strange power may i said wilhelmina thomas passed the map to her and she held it up to the painting though the symbols in the painting were crude squiggles next to the real thing the basic shapes seemed more or less correct the piece mina was holding did match up with the upper right quadrant of the map in high priest anens hand whoever cut up the map was very careful she observed look at the ruffled edges she pointed out the lower portion and left side of the map see how irregular the line is whoever did it was at pains not to cut into other symbols replied kit so they cut around them producing this deckled edge the adjoining pieces will match precisely offered thomas by that you will know they are genuine wilhelmina carefully rerolled the human parchment and passed it to thomas who returned it to its cover the four had then returned to the wadi camp where khefri had organised a special dinner of roast goat to celebrate the successful completion of the dig they had eaten and talked late into the night and now as the sun was rising in the east it was time to depart wilhelmina started down the avenue towards the spot where giles was waiting kit lifted a hand and called farewell go with god my friends shouted thomas waving them away grace and peace attend you but his words were lost in the shriek of the wind that suddenly gusted along the ancient pavement the world grew hazy in a mixture of dust and grit and the next thing kit knew a fierce rain was beating on his face his clothing whipped about his limbs in a galeforce wind that unlike his other experiences did not summarily die away upon their arrival i think weve landed in the middle of a hurricane he shouted trying to be heard above the crash and roar what came wilhelminas voice from a distance that sounded like miles but must have been only a few feet away this storm he cried were in the thick of it its always storming here she shouted emerging out of the lashing wind it never stops never not ever she pressed her wet face closer not that i know youve been here before lots of times he felt her hand grip his arm this way stay with me she turned her head and shouted over her shoulder giles are you with us here my lady came the reply from somewhere close behind take hold of my hand im going to count to three and we run straight ahead ready here we go one two three go kit did as instructed sprinting blindly into the teeth of the storm for an instant it felt as if his flesh would be ripped from his bones and then darkness and silence he was tumbling through an emptiness through an airless void so absolute he thought he was suffocating he gagged but could not draw oxygen into his lungs he felt a sharp sting on his cheek breathe kit he opened his eyes to see wilhelmina standing before him with her hand poised to strike again hah he gasped staggering backwards stop that im okay mina turned to giles who was kneeling on a broad leafstrewn path a few paces away you okay upon receiving his grunted reply she said sorry guys that one was the worstbut it saved us four more jumps and maybe two days of overland travel anything for the cause said kit woozily shaking water from his clothes im soaked to the skin youll dry wilhelmina started away have you still got the map kit patted his stomach where the bundle resided under his shirt he nodded good she started away youll feel better once were moving again its best to walk it off come on where are we kit glanced around they seemed to be standing in a lightly wooded countryside the air was cool and redolent of fallen leaves he could hear insects buzzing in the branches of the nearby trees were about three miles north of prague she said stepping off the path theres a road a little farther along it runs beside the river itll take us into the city if were lucky we might be able to hitchhike the rest of the way when are we kit asked well were somewhere in the autumn of during the reign of emperor rudolf if we hit it right were in early september she started towards a bayberry bush growing beside the path or possibly august and weve come here why wondered kit i live here she said we need a good safe place to lay up for a few days to study the map and figure out what to do next wait here she said stepping behind the bush i have to change you stashed a change of clothes said kit nice i dare not be seen dressed like this in the city too many people know me kit looked down at himself what about giles and me giles is fine the way he is came the reply from behind the bush as for you take off that dumb turban and wrap it around your waist tie it like a sash it will help disguise your flouncy shirt flouncy shirt muttered kit its a jalabiya ill have you know im sure it is with a sash people will just think its a labourers smock they wear those around here kit obeyed as instructed much to the amusement of the watching giles where did you go you and giles when we left the wadi the first time while i was helping thomas dig up the tomb where were you in edinburgh came the reply from the bushes dr young was there i went to convince him to help you excavate the tomb but thatshow can that be he was in egypt with me wasnt he not yet said wilhelmina i should have thought that would be obvious not to me explain it simple time as we know operates independently in different frames of reference as we know kit agreed so i simply had to reach him before he left for egypt on his expedition but that would mean i was already with him digging up the treasure before you even asked him kit pointed out right said wilhelmina neat eh she stepped out from behind the bush wholly transformed gone was the girl in the camouflage jumpsuit and skyblue scarf and desert boots in her place stood a winsome lass in a long skirt white blouse with puffy sleeves and multicoloured shawl she carried a cloth bag which she handed to kit this way chaps she said and soon they were moving through the long grass and down a gently sloping hillside kit could see the gleam of a river at the bottom of the incline and sure enough a road if we dont dillydally we can have dinner tonight at one of the best restaurants in the city kit stopped walking and stared at her as if seeing her for the first time gosh mina you are amazing how do you know so much about all this practice she said lots and lots of practice and mistakes chapter in which a destiny is determined the end when it came was swift and unexpected lord gower had complained in the evening of feeling unwell he had taken tea and a bit of dry toast and retired to his rooms by morning he was no better so a doctor was summoned to attend him that same afternoon in a feverish sweat and complaining of headache he had lapsed into a fitful sleep from which he was not to be roused archie was with him when he died two days later standing by the earls bed he marked the toll of the nine oclock bell from the tower of st marys argent square as his benefactors spirit fled its mortal confines archie bent his head and shed a private tear for the man who had been his teacher friend and so far as archie was concerned the only father he had ever known the next day was spent in the offices of beachcroft and lechward lord gowers solicitors who arranged for the funeral and burial according to the earls will and special instructions the funeral was held seven days later at st marys with nearly two hundred in attendance the mourners were provided tea and cakes at lord gowers london residence after the graveside service and archie received the condolences of his guests with a dignified decorum the earl would have approved and commended the next two weeks were spent in an inventory of the property in preparation for what archie considered the inevitable invasion to come the calendar turned over another leaf and one morning george gower the estranged cousin of the earl came knocking on the door in the company of his wife branca a peckham bailiff and a solicitor in a top hat and black frock coat archie received them in the earls sitting room the handover of property will not be delayed intoned the lawyer imperiously we will be taking immediate possession it would be most helpful if you were to collect your personal possessions and vacate the premises at your earliest convenience archie who had braced himself for this moment was nevertheless stunned by the abruptness of the eviction and the coldness of the greed on display when he found his voice he said i have had an inventory prepared if you would care to we will make our own inventory thank you the lawyer sniffed in any case you will vacate the premises by three oclock this afternoon the bailiff here will be pleased to help you gather your things he will accompany you now to ensure that you do not inadvertently remove any articles not belonging to you and to which you are not entitled your foresight is admirable archie offered a grim smile to the new tenants how you must have longed for this day and prayed for its coming silencie a sua lingua snarled the woman her potent portuguese temper quick and hot you are not family you have nothing to say indeed archie agreed i assure you that i have no wish to remain in your odious presence a moment longer than necessary now see here you sputtered george gower you bounder but archie was already moving towards the door and departed without another word summon beachcroft he told the earls valet then pack your things and if i were you i might spare a thought to the days aheadif you know what i mean the valet nodded it is in hand sir you may instruct the rest of the staff to do the same very good sir while the new owners began totting up the silver archie went to his rooms and began to pack his things he was joined a few minutes later by the bailiffa suspicious oaf who insisted on examining everything archie put into his cases until archie suggested perhaps it would be best if you packed for me then you could give your keepers a precise inventory of what i have taken never you mind my job muttered the man get on with you beachcroft the earls solicitor arrived with a copy of lord gowers will just as archie was placing his cases in the foyer in the presence of the inheritors and their lawyer he read out the relevant portion of the earls last will and testament which explicitly stated that archibald burley was given leave to choose any five objects from the earls extensive collection of exotic artefacts any five objects he so desires stressed walter beachcroft without let or hindrance when archie took his leave a short while later it was much to the relief of the new owners with five small dusty antiques of negligible interest had george and branca known the true value of the items archie selected fits of apoplexy would have ensued all around as it was their ignorance allowed them some measure of insulation from the stinging reality taken together the objects archie chose amounted to a very tidy sum that would allow him to set up in the antiquities trade nor was that all in truth the far greater portion of archies nowconsiderable fortune was already safely stashed in six large tea chests that had been safely deposited in the vaults of lloyds bank and another delivered with his cases to kings cross station a week earlier after his summary eviction from lord gowers london residence archie paid his mother a visit and bade her farewell leaving her with a lloyds bank book for an account containing five hundred pounds in her name then he kissed her goodbye and caught the evening boattrain to the continent visits to paris cologne vienna and rome were followed by more lengthy sojourns in prague constantinople jerusalem and cairo at each stop along the way he acquired objets dart and exotica that would form the basis of a collection of almost legendary proportions to tantalise the jaded palates of londons elite collectors archies only contact with england during his sojourn abroad was in the form of a letter from beachcroft the solicitor informing him that the earls estate had been sold to a sugar magnate george and branca gower had taken their fortune and returned to lisbon where presumably they would live out their days in comfort and ease at the expense of their late relation on the second anniversary of the earl of sutherlands death an extremely dashing tycoon answering to the name archelaeus burleigh earl of sutherland arrived in london the dark distinguished young lord took an apartment in an expansive kensington garden mansion in the weeks and months to follow the wealthier citizens of the metropolis would be buzzing about the rare and exquisite antiques this knowledgeable and wellspoken gentleman could produce from his seemingly inexhaustible store tales circulated about the earls extensive connections with the aristocracy of old europe and the royal palaces of the middle east which were the principal sources for the wondrous items he traded these objects did not come cheaply certainly the fine rings bracelets and necklaces jewelled pendants statuettes daggers and diadems carved reliefs from attic friezes and pediments intricately decorated redandblack amphorae bowls lamps beakers and urns and all the rest carried breathtaking price tags but then where else could one obtain such superb specimens beauty is all too often fleeting in this world lord burleigh was wont to remark i live only for one thingand that is the pursuit of beauty that outlasts the ages this sentiment and much else about the young aristocrat mightily impressed his clientele which now included a growing number of marriageable young women as word of the eligible bachelor of sutherland spread his wealth grewand grew in the tellinguntil he could not attend an evening performance at covent garden or the proms without attracting a bevy of beautifully groomed and gowned young things the situation did not go unnoticed as one mildly envious onlooker was heard to opine i say the earl of sutherland must love his gardening how so mortimer why to be surrounded by such a profusion of ravishing flowers he must work those beds like a very slave quite the young earl himself appeared to enjoy the feminine attention yet remained slightly aloof from it maintaining an air of mild amusement at his own apparent availability and while he displayed no favouritism in his choice of companions being seen in public with a different beauty every night there was one who began to emerge from the pack a willowy blonde lovely named phillipa harveyjones daughter and sole surviving heir of prominent industrialist reginald harveyjones a man in the chase for a knighthood if ever there was one reggie as he was known to friends and admirers enjoyed the reputation as a bruisingly tough businessman whose only pleasure in life was doting on his daughter naturally when her name began to be linked with the dashing burleighs it roused reggies considerable interest within minutes of their first meeting he cut right to the point your money sir where did you get it beg your pardon archelaeus raised his eyebrows we are men of the world reg told him lets not be coyespecially where money is concerned we both know it is nothing to do with character at best it is only an arbitrary indicator of a mans place in the world he fixed the young lord with a narrow uncompromising gaze so how much have you got anyway difficult to say replied burleigh easily sliding into a tone of confidentiality what with the northern properties the southern holdings and the london house most of that belongs to the family of course archie had long ago learned to play on londoners innate ignorance of scotland generally and its gentry in particular just your private assets thenyour own private accountshow much do you command personally oh i should say around ten thousand not bad annually burleigh added almost apologetically i am impressed harveyjones gave him a look of renewed respect that is twice as much as my income and i work hard for what i get i am certain that you do agreed the young lord mildly my own work is more in the way of a leisure pursuit a hobby sir something of the sort the young gentleman allowed himself a sigh still one must fill the empty hours as best one can if you were married suggested the industrialist you would find other ways to fill those hours i daresay what is more you would soon have fewer of them to fill daddy chirped a warm feminine voice you are completely monopolising our host with your chatter she affected a frown of disapproval you arent talking about money again are you tell me youre not furthest thing from my mind pippa dear reggie gave his goldenhaired daughter a peck on the cheek we were just now speaking of hobbies and avocations the earl here complains of too much time on his hands i told him he wants a wife daddy phillipa gasped horrified embarrassed and excited all at once she glanced at burleigh to gauge his reaction to this bold affront to his dignity oh do please forgive my father he can be such a rascal sometimes yes forgive me echoed reggie i did not enjoy the benefit of the good upbringing my daughter had but there it is a man needs a wife well sir what do you say i say answered burleigh slowly holding phillipa in his gaze as he spoke that happiness like wealth means nothing unless there is someone to share it spoken like a true romantic hooted reggie oh daddy do behave laying a hand on the impeccable black sleeve of burleighs dinner jacket phillipa said i assure you my lord it is a sentiment i share then perhaps you will do me the honour of sitting beside me at dinner tonight so we can discuss it at the greater length it deserves burleigh took her hand from his sleeve raised it to his lips and kissed it that is he said with a glance to reggie if your father can be persuaded to let you out of his sight for the space of an hour a calamity sir but i shall bear up somehow he waved them away run along you young folk go and enjoy yourselves shall we burleigh offered his arm which the lady graciously accepted and the two strolled off across the marble vestibule towards the great hall later they would be seen again and again in one anothers companyso much so that people began to expect it they became an item of interest in the elevated reaches of high society and were treated as a courting couplewhich certainly appeared to be the casethough whenever anyone ventured to ask the question was lightly brushed aside with a laugh and an assurance of mutual friendship if that response was intended to stop the tongues from wagging it effected the opposite result the gossipmongers of the aristocracy spoke with ever more certainty of an imminent announcement of betrothal alas those expecting an early invitation to a gala wedding were disappointed summer came and went gave way to autumn and though the courtship continued no matrimonial announcement was made those close to the earl intimated that the young gentlemans travelling schedule made such arrangements difficult at present his various business pursuits dictated a return to the middle east and quite possibly the orient be that as it may speculation remained high for a wedding the following spring as soon as the earl arrived back in the city from his travels but the young gentleman did not returnnot the following spring or the next then when the diligent flow of his letters to his darling phillipa abruptly stopped the fire of speculation flamed in new and unexpected directions as time went on opinion began to harden that some dire fate had befallen him though the manner of his demise remained unconfirmed imagination supplied no end of likely disasters burleighs ship had sunk on its return voyage he had fallen among thieves the earl had been abducted and was being held for ransom he had been caught in the crossfire of some local strife and been rendered a casualty of war he had gone native in arabia the young man languished in a foreign prison on false charges or any other explanation that occurred to the toilers at the rumour mill in fact it would be three years entire before archelaeus burleigh returned to england the reason for his absence and what had happened to him during his travels were never disclosed no word of explanation for his delay was ever breathed aloud but the man who returned to london was not the same man who left the city almost four years before in the belly of the young lord was a new and insatiable hunger knowledge the more arcane the better was now his consuming passion he was not to be seen without a book in his hand and when he wasnt reading he was making notes in one of a growing succession of journals which he kept under lock and key in his desk the ballroom of his spacious mansion was gutted by an army of carpenters they lined the walls with a double tier of shelves which soon began filling with obscure and archaic tomes that architectural transformation served to underscore the simple fact that the wealthy young man had become an indefatigable scholar and though he still maintained a nominal presence in the antiquities trade the earl of sutherland was more likely now to be seen at a lecture of the royal society than on the auction floors of sothebys or christies when at last phillipa realised that anything she said or did could have no effect on her paramours new obsession the young womanwho was not accustomed to suffer any rival to her affectionslowly withdrew and archelaeus burleigh was consigned to his solitude and bachelorhood chapter in which the past catches up putting their feet to the road the three travellers began walking alongside the river lazily winding its way towards the city the sun was warm on their backs and their wet clothes soon dried as they walked kit who had grown used to the sweltering heat of egypt in high summer luxuriated in the balmy breezes wafting off the water really he said after a while how did you learn so much about ley travel the last time i saw you he paused i mean the time before the last timewhen i lost you in the alley in london remember of course i remember she told him the best thing that ever happened to mehow could i forget explain just wait she gave him a bright smile youll see okay agreed kit then tell me how you knew where to find the leys weve been using i discovered this line with my ley lamp that little gismo you have hidden in your pocket thats what i call it she dug it out and handed it to him it seems to be able to locate ley lines and indicate when they are most strongly active he stared at the brass oval filling the palm of her hand may i be my guest she passed it to him it was heavier than he expected and warm to the touch the small holes formerly filled with blue light were dark now ever seen anything like that before he asked passing the mechanism to giles for his perusal only in miss wilhelminas possession he handed it back where did it come from asked kit long story mina replied but im hoping to get an upgrade on this one giles sang out just then wagon coming they turned to see a farm vehicle pulled by two large horses trundling towards them were in luck observed wilhelmina we can hitch a ride with them she glanced at kit hows your german mein deutsch ist nicht so gut he said and yours better than that she laughed just smile and be agreeable ill do all the talking the wagon drew nearer and wilhelmina hastened to meet it guten tag she called amazing breathed kit watching her converse with the farmer i cant believe shes the same person ive always known people can change giles observed too right the ride into prague was a slowmotion delight as the wagon jostled along the dirt road in the easy warmth of a lazy autumn afternoon and then as they came around a sweeping bend of the river there it was the old city with its grand iron gates and stout walls proud flags fluttered on crenellated battlements and the tops of steeples and towers could be glimpsed above the walls the old cobbled streets leading into the warren of timber houses with red tile roofs and windows of tiny diamondshaped glass panes at once cosy and ordered it was a sharp contrast to the arid wilderness of the egyptian desert as the wagon was waved through the wideopen city gate by the guardsmen dozing in the shadow of the archway kit glanced at giles whose expression remained fixed and inscrutable what do you make of this then he asked giles looked around thoughtfully it all seems as it should was his only reply once in the city square they disembarked wilhelmina paid the farmer a few small coins and thanked him then gathering her charges she said this is known as the old square it is the main market square of the city and in my opinion the best place in the city to live you live here wondered kit there was no market in progress but the wide paved expanse was full of people plying their trades from small carts and otherwise going about their business i do she said leading them across the square in fact i have a partner and a shop she pointed to the bank of handsome buildings lining the northern side of the square thereshe indicated one of themthe green one with the sign in gold lettering that one is mine grand imperial kaffeehaus said kit reading the sign mina are you telling me you have a coffeehouse coffeehouse and bakery she replied the best in the citythe best in bohemia actually were unique crikey murmured kit shaking his head in disbelief so this is how you have survived all this timeas a baker in a coffee shop kit i own the shop you said you had a partner a business partner yes she added by way of clarification she pushed open the door and beckoned them in come on ill introduce you to him they stepped over the threshold and into a convivial room filled with clothcovered tables where customers were being served by whiteaproned waitresses in green dresses and little green bonnets the travellers passed among the tables and some of the shops patrons recognised their hostess and greeted her politely a counter separated the dining area from the kitchen from which emanated the mouthwatering smell of freshroasted coffee and warm pastry this way she led them around the counter and back into the inner kitchen where the ovens were located etzel ich bin zurluck she called and a large soft bear of a man wearing a flourdusted apron and floppy green hat turned redfaced from bending over the oven oh mein schatz he said holding out thick arms for a hug he all but buried wilhelmina in his embrace i thought you would be gone all day no i guess the journey did not take as long as i expected she said come ive brought some friends i want you to meet them he glanced up and saw the visitors for the first time das wurde mich freuen he gasped and swept off his hat he ran a chubby hand through his pale blond hair in an effort to make himself presentablea gesture of such affable humility that kit liked him instantly kit giles this is my friend and partner engelbert stiffelbeam she said repeating it in german for the baker then adding for his benefit the best man i know oh you flatterer said etzel blushing at the compliment he patted her with obvious affection and she bussed his doughy cheek then turning back the baker held out his hand to his guests who shook it in turn welcome my friends he said offering a little bow i am honoured glad to meet you said kit and mina echoed es freut mich sie kennenzulernen jawohl replied etzel i hope you have had a good journey mina translated but before either of them could reply he said what am i thinking you must be starving sit down sit down you must have some of my fresh apple strudel it will revive you while etzel busied himself with the strudel mina donned a crisp clean apron and began preparing coffee kit watched the efficient operation with interest verging on admiration he could not get over the transformation he saw in wilhelmina as she directed her staff and took charge of the kitchen displaying an easy authority he had never before seen in her nor was that all her hair was longer more luxuriant somehow her long lithe form had filled out a little giving her a trim figure the dark circles a perennial part of her appearance were gone she radiated a vitality and energy kit had never witnessed she was he decided a woman who had come into her own and he liked what he saw shortly etzel called for one of his helpers to bring plates and directed his guests to sit down setzen sie sich bitte just find a table mina told them and i will bring the coffee kit and giles returned to the dining room evening was drawing in but there were still a few people in the house they chose a table in a far corner so they could talk without disturbing the others in a moment etzel appeared humming to himself as he placed thick slices of warm strudel on plates before them and daintily laying a small spoon beside each plate satisfied that all was in order the big baker urged them on saying mahlzeit guten appetit kit and giles took up their spoons and simultaneously took an exploratory bite sehr gut kit said making a pantomime expression of pleasure very good said giles descending to his plate he began spooning up strudel like the hungry man he was kits polite restraint lasted another two bites and then he too began scooping for all he was worth and murmuring heartfelt appreciation between mouthfuls etzel beamed at them and chuckled his hands folded across his stomach wilhelmina returned with a tray full of small pots of coffee and cups well thats going down a treat she observed to etzel she said your strudel will be world famous it is that spice you have brought us he replied knowingly the cinnamon she said pleased that he was using this unfamiliar spice do you think so ja that makes the difference seeing that the men had all but finished their portions he said i will bring some more i didnt know i was so hungry kit remarked giles nodded in fullmouthed agreement well have a nice dinner after weve closed the shopif you two can hold out that long wilhelmina set down the tray and took up a pot she was pouring the first cups when she glanced towards the shops front door at some customers just entering it looks like closing time will have to wait a little while ill seat these last customers and put up the shutters dont mind us said kit taking up his coffee were happy as clams in clover he said expansively sipping the rich dark bitter liquid well giles old buddy it looks like we landed on our feet this time whod have thought it eh as the newcomers passed behind kit he saw giles eyes flick their way the young mans features froze in an odd expressionsomething halfway between disbelief and horror what asked kit what is she doing here hissed giles she wondered kit swivelling in his chair dont turn around he sensed a presence behind him and then the last voice he expected to hear spoke his name kit giles upon my soulit is you and then she was at their table standing over them kit looked up into the face he thought never to see againas lovely as ever but now contorted in anguish and fear hello haven said kit voice husky his skin tingling with instant revulsion fancy meeting you here you must leave at once she urged eyes wide she stole a swift glance towards the shop entrance where another party of customers was just entering quick her manner became frantic she clutched at kits arm as if to pull him bodily from his chair flee you must not let him see you he thinks you dead who across the table giles watching the entrance let out a low growl of contempt as he spat out the name burleigh chapter in which the question of what to do is asked and answeredtwice is there a problem here asked wilhelmina she put down the plates she was holding and turned to confront the russethaired beauty standing over kit mina said kit meet haven fayth no time to explain burleighs here bloody great muttered wilhelmina glancing at the party just entering the shop is anyone with him help them i pray you said lady fayth appealing to mina they are in danger you must help them flee this place at once right wilhelmina fixed a smile on her face as she observed the newcomers just then trooping into the coffeehouse i see bazalgette and now yes rosenkruez is here too who are they do you know them alchemists at the emperors court explained wilhelmina i know them all haste i urge you said haven is there another way out of this building asked kit through the kitchen my apartment is upstairs go up there and wait for me replied wilhelmina already moving to greet the newcomers you come with me she added to lady fayth wait kit said leaping up he snatched haven by the arm the green book he stretched out his hand sir henrys book i want it lady fayth hesitated burleigh is here you must flee at once not without the book insisted kit hand it over oh very well relented haven take it from a fold in her dress she brought out a small clothwrapped square and pressed it into kits hand get you hence wilhelmina returned and drew the young woman away throwing a command over her shoulder as she went you two get upstairs and keep quiet now hurry giles and kit slipped into the kitchen they heard the other party clumping into the room behind them the flow of german fast and thick etzel was bending over the stove banking the oven for the night he smiled when he saw them kit nodded and mimed laying his head on a pillow and then pointed towards the ceiling as he headed for the staircase leading to the upper rooms jahwol said etzel schlaft gut they found wilhelminas room across from the landing went in and closed the door the room was spartan spare a high bed a chair a small round table a large and ornately carved chest with a domed top and in a corner a tall standing wardrobe the bed or the chair said kit which would you prefer before giles could reply a knock came on the door they turned as a young woman in green livery entered with a shallow pan of coals ich habe die glut she said offering the pan vielen dank replied kit indicating the hearth the maid busied herself at the grated fireplace and soon had a cosy fire going she rose and with a pretty curtsey left closing the door behind her kit lit a candle on the mantel from the fire and set it on the table then settled on the bed to wait giles took the chair some deal eh mused kit the one guy we hope to avoid shows up here first thing what are the odds giles regarded him with a puzzled expression sir burleigh shows up here just as were getting settled in said kit some coincidence sir henry always said there was no such thing as coincidence so i hear said kit sinking back onto the bed im beginning to believe it they talked quietly for a while lamenting the cruel demise of cosimo and sir henry at burleighs hands and allowing themselves the luxury of imagining what they might do to settle the score did you ever see sir henrys book asked kit no sir i was not privy to his lordships papers replied giles kit pulled the book from where he had stashed it in his belt and began unwrapping it well he made a careful study of all this ley business and wrote it down in this little book he passed the greenbound volume to giles who regarded it with interest cracked open the cover and thumbed a few pages what do you make of it he closed the cover and returned the book to kit very interesting sir but i cannot read sir oh there was a rustle at the door and wilhelmina swept in theyre gone she said i told them we were just closing burleigh and the others have gone back to the palace come on weve got to get you out of hereout of prague we just got here complained kit cant we stay no it isnt safe she spun on her heel and darted back through the doorway its a big city well lie low look burleigh doesnt know that i know you anyway he thinks youre dead lets keep it that way now come on my lady is right said giles it is best to avoid trouble whenever possible kit tucked the green book back into his sash and climbed reluctantly off the bed and back downstairs they passed through the kitchen now dark save for a faint glow from the ovens etzel was gone and the dining room was empty there was a bit of strudel on a plate on the counter and kit helped himself where are we going im taking you to a place i knownot far from here you can hide out there until burleigh leaves he never stays long the three padded through the darkened coffeehouse threading among the tables to the front door wilhelmina opened it glanced out and then beckoned them to follow she started off across the neardeserted square kit and giles had to scurry to catch up they crossed the square and headed down a narrow street towards the city gate this place youre taking us kit said where is it its near the river outside the city mina said how far kit wanted to know as wilhelmina turned to answer him she nearly collided with three men approaching from the opposite direction entschuldigung she said the three stepped aside and she sailed on kit and giles in her wake they had gone but a few yards however when one of the men called out oi you there kit glanced back over his shoulder to see three burley men standing in the street frozen in momentary indecision run shouted kit dex con get after them cried the one called tav ill fetch the boss go go but kit and giles were already streaking away wilhelmina had disappeared kit and giles pounded down the cobbled street as they passed the corner of a house a hand snaked out and caught kit by the sleeve mina pulled him into an alcove its the burley men kit told her you two go on she said ill keep them busy kit hesitated are you sure positive here take this she fished the ley lamp from a pocket of her apron and shoved it at him kit looked at the smoothly rounded gismo i dont know how to use it its simple it picks up ley activityanything in the vicinity and the blue lights shine the brighter they glow the closer you are to a line of force she dropped the object into his hand head for the river and follow the road east out of the city a mile or so outside the walls theres a little lane running perpendicular to the road that is a ley line ive used it before the lamp will light up when youre there whatever happens stick together what about you dont worry about me just make the jump and stay put ill come find you kit nodded drew breath and prepared to make a run for it ready giles one more thing said mina quickly youd better give me the map itll be safer with me kit hesitated but only for a moment then yanked the slender package from under his shirt and passed it to her be careful always she squeezed his hand and pushed him out into the street giles gave her a nod and then darted after kit good luck you two mina whispered stepping from the alcove to watch them go kit streaked off running down a street sinking into evening shadows the next thing he heard was someone shouting in german halt diebe halten sie die diebe auf it was wilhelmina calling on passersby to stop the thieves escaping kit saw her snag one of the burley men and with much waving and gesturing begin organising the pursuit in german kit ran for all he was worth his shoes slapping hard on the cobblestones giles keeping pace right behind down the narrow street they flew running for the city gate naked fear making them flee a few dozen yards or so farther on they came in sight of the gate its still open shouted kit we can make it bleiben sie stehen bleiben sie stehen came the shout behind them kit glanced back to see that a few idle townsfolk had joined the chase wilhelmina was nowhere to be seen the shouting reached the gate ahead of them the bewildered gatekeeper pike in hand stepped into their path just as the two fugitives came pounding up aus dem weg aus dem weg shouted kit motioning wildly for the guard to get out of the way schnell the guard remained planted in the road throwing his pike sideways to bar their exit kit breaking to the right hit the shaft of the weapon tilting it down and leaping over the pole in one smooth motion even as giles ducked under the rising end the flummoxed gatekeeper gave out a startled cry but they were already past three running steps carried them under the arch three more and they were through the gate and out of the city the gate man was shouting at them to halt adding his voice to the shouts of the pursuers who had now reached the gatehouse twilight was settling quickly on the land but the sky was still light kit caught a glimmer of water the river is this way shouted kit well try to lose them as we go even before the words were out of his mouth he heard another sound the rhythmic clatter of steel horseshoes on stone paving he looked back to see a dark figure in the saddle of a pale grey horse one glimpse of the rider and he knew that burleigh was in the chase hurtling down through the streets scattering the crowd that was now pouring through the gate the road before them was a broad curve around a long bend in the river city walls on one side and riverbank on the other there was no one on the road and no place they might hide from the pursuit gathering pace behind them according to mina the ley was a mile distant hes got a horse called kit well never make it keep running shouted giles if we can reach the bend we might elude them yet gritting his teeth kit raced on the bend was farther than they estimated and though they succeeded in gaining some distance on the mob by the time they rounded the curve burleigh was closer still and coming fast kit pulled up lungs heaving heart pounding its no good he gasped between breaths well have to try to take him giles looked back gauging the distance between themselves and the oncoming rider we must remove him from that horse right agreed kit how do we do that i know horses the sound of the hooves pounding towards them grew louder there are ways to throw a rider the shouts of the chase echoed over the water coursing along the riverbanks kit suddenly understood what it was like to be the fox desperate to avoid the jaws of the baying hounds what about the mob once we have taken the horse we can use it to escape sounds like a plan decided kit what do we do there giles pointed to a clump of elder bushes hide yourself there but make yourself ready to jump out as soon as i have the rider on the ground you sure you can handle it alone giles nodded with a last backwards glance kit darted into the brush as giles snatched off a long leafy branch from the elder bush and took up a stance at the side of the road holding the branch down and slightly behind him he stood easily waiting as the horse thundered nearer burleigh saw him and shouted something kit watching from his hiding place imagined he could feel the earth tremble as the pounding hooves swiftly narrowed the distance giles steady as a stone remained firmly planted heavy hooves churning the horse thundered closer and closer still kits breath caught in his throat as burleigh swerved to ride down the unresisting giles but just as the hurtling beast closed on him giles stepped lightly sideways swinging up the branch and throwing the leafy end into the animals face its vision obscured by a tree that seemed to appear from nowhere the horse shied and tossed its head high to avoid the obstruction giles drove forward keeping the branch in the frightened animals eyes the horse reared and reared again burleigh unprepared for the attack was thrown over the rear of his mount he landed hard on his back in the middle of the road giles was on him in an instant kit leapt from his hiding place and ran to help giles subdue the struggling burleigh he saw giles fist rise and fallonce twice and the writhing man lay still get the horse shouted giles kit hurried after the riderless animal that was now cantering away it took a moment but he finally managed to snag the dangling reins and pull the horses head around gotcha holding tight to the reins he turned to see giles running to join him then even as he watched giles seemed to levitate in the air his feet lifting off the ground in the same instant the report of a distant explosion reached kit like a slap in the face giles was carried headlong and thrown to the dirt by the force of the blow the horse reared at the sound jerking the reins free from his grasp kit saw a flash behind the struggling giles as the slap of another report reached him the glint of steel in burleighs hand warned kit that another blast was coming stay down he cried hes got a gun a third shot ripped the dirt at his feet and kit skidded to a halt run cried giles waving kit away burleigh was on his feet now and moving forward arm raised hand extended kit caught between helping giles and fleeing hesitated mina will see to me shouted giles go a fourth shot decided the issue as the bullet whizzed past kits head and the report split the air kit spun and ducked instinctively heading back into the brush at the side of the road he ran blindly his only thought to lose himself in the lightly wooded roadside margin behind him he heard burleigh calling but ran on heedless of all but the need to escape when the first fury of desperation had passed he paused to catch his breath and collect his wits the river was to his back before him lay a field of grain he considered diving into it but the prospect of escaping on hands and knees through the barley held little appeal he held his breath to listen above the sound of his own rapid heartbeat he could hear voices on the road and assumed that the townsfolk had met up with burleigh and the pursuit would now resume a hasty estimate determined that he was still a little less than halfway to the lane that marked the ley line described by wilhelmina which he reckoned was now his best chance of escape keeping the road and river to his right he proceeded through the wood in the direction of the lane behind him he could hear voices and sounds of men thrashing through the undergrowth searching for his trail others remained on the road he could hear them too soon overtaking him and moving on ahead kit grim and determined as death worked steadily along dodging the boles and branches of trees and shrubs trying to remain silent and invisible in the dying light all at once a clear loud voice sang outurgent confident assuredit rang loud in the silence and was quickly joined by others kit knew his trail had been found fighting down the urge to bolt blindly into the darkening wood he doubled his pace but despite his best efforts the voices behind him grew louder by degrees when next he paused to catch his breath he glanced back to see pale globes of glimmering light wavering through the trees someone had brought torches realising he only had scant minutes before he was seen and captured he snaked a hand into his pocket and brought out the brass homing device that wilhelmina had given him the little curved row of holes on the top were dark still running towards the line he held the thing before him urging it mentally work you blasted thing work to his amazement the small oval object began to glowa faint fitful flicker through the tiny holes but as he waved the curious instrument before him the gently wavering lights strengthened and took hold with an increasingly bright blue glow clutching the ley lamp kit drove on flying through the brush dodging branches as he went the chase was getting closer his movement through the brush alerted the pursuit and soon the surrounding wood was echoing with cries of the townsfolk amongst the shouts and sounds of crashing feet he thought he heard burleighs voice raised above the tumult urging his search party to greater speed every now and then kit glanced down at the homing device and saw the little row of lights still lit and shining ever more brightly its got to be here somewhere kit told himself its close there came a loud crash behind him and he looked back to see burleigh back in the saddle burst through an opening in the trees a hundred paces or so away the earl saw him in the same instant and with a swift assured motion drew the pistol from his belt holding the reins in one hand he extended his arm to fire kit did not wait for him to pull the trigger but ducked low and dived into the brake a second later a shot shivered the branches and ripped through the leaves above kits head he scrambled fast on hands and knees wilhelminas ley lamp grew warm in his palmenough to let him know that he was not imagining it he looked around and saw that he had plunged into a narrow game trail a single rutted line that stretched away on either hand straight as an arrows flight another small explosion sent a bullet tearing through the screening brush shattering a nearby branch and kit clutching the device started running down the track as a third gunshot sliced the air a mere step ahead of him he stopped turned and started back the opposite way but the surrounding wood had already faded into the shadowy deeps of an allpervading darkness kit managed another step and yet one more before he tumbled headlong out of one world and into another chapter in which a little light is shed the language of the angels allows no earthly utterance friar bacon explained therefore it cannot be spoken by mortal tongues he emphasised this point with a solemn shake of his tonsured head that is not to say that it cannot be understood with the proper application of intelligence and logic the meaning can be deduced it can be made to speak to us what does the book tell you asked douglas after waiting almost three days while roger examined it his endurance was at an end patience my friend all in gods good time the renowned scholar returned to his perusal of the parchments on his worktable first we must prepare the soil so that our understanding can be correctly seeded of course muttered douglas forgive me brother if i seem overanxious the priest brushed away the apology with a sweep of his hand as i believe i have indicated on a previous occasion he continued the script in question is derived from an alphabet of symbolsas are all languages to be sure for what is a written text but a collection of symbols that substitute for the elementary sounds of human speech however unlike the symbols strung together to form the sounds used in speech the symbols in this book are abstracted and thus removed from the realm of vocal representation roger bacon glanced at his pupil and seemed to require some sign that he had been understood intriguing commented douglas pray continue see here bacon said picking up one of the scraps he had prepared for douglass edification notice how the symbols curvethis one to the right this one to the left some up some downeach particular curve contains meaning as do the small lines which branch away from the main as well as those that cross the main where the lines branch and cross aids in determining meaning he tapped the parchment with a fingertip it is a most cunning and ingenious cypher indeed replied douglas feeling slightly overwhelmed by the prospect of decoding what amounted to another whole language in order to decipher the book he had stolen from the british library how many symbols are there in total hundreds replied roger bacon simply as there must be to be sure douglas agreed philosophically thinking the greater part of his work lay before him then he remembered something the scholar had told him when i first gave you the book you said you were the one who devised the script by that do you mean you invented the symbols in which it is written only in part bacon conceded for my purposes i chose a script based on a symbolism that is far far older than any other i adapted it for my use but did not create it douglas puzzled over the precisely parsed meaning of the priests words am i to take it that you wrote this book you flatter me undeservedly brother he laid a reverent hand on the small volume douglas had brought him again forgive my ignorance but your name is most prominently displayed in the text a mere formality of acknowledgement replied the learned priest with a curious half smile brother luciferus whatever his true identity is merely declaring his debt to the originator of the script in which his book finds its voice nothing more how fortunate for me observed douglas to have found the one man in england who can read it yes and in order that we might gain the benefit of it i have applied myself to the task of rendering a transliteration of the text for future reference he nodded with satisfaction i am happy to say that work is now complete three days mused douglas my abbot will certainly wish to reward your service you must allow us to show our appreciation learning is its own reward replied friar bacon but you made a copy of the more interesting portions yes the rest is fragmentary perhaps when time allows i shall finish may i see it i would be delighted to show you replied bacon thoughtfully however i must first receive certain assurances before douglas could ask what these might be the scholar rose and went to a large ironclad box in the corner of the room naturally it would not do to allow what i am about to show you to be heralded through the streets of the city in these difficult times men of learning must resort to a stringent secrecy while we await a more enlightened age to dawn he cast an expectant glance behind him suddenly the scholars meaning became clear i am happy to provide you with whatever assurances you deem appropriatematerial or otherwise offered douglas i know how easily particular aspects of our work can be misconstrued by an uneducated and unappreciative public alas mused roger bacon it is not only the public which so often fails to appreciate the nature of our more delicate investigationsmany of our leading churchmen are particularly lacking in the finer faculties of discernment led by the twin banes of intolerance and ignorance they too often condemn where they rightly should revere they traduce what should be championed they denounce what should be praised douglas knew that the eminent scholar was speaking from painful personal experience having endured ecclesiastical persecution for some of his more daring ideas pray receive my most solemn and sacred vow that the secrets shared in this room will remain secret hereafter the scientist smiled i knew you to be a fellow pilgrim he bent his angular form to the iron box and withdrawing a key from a fold in his robe unlocked the hinge raised the lid and withdrew a sheaf of cut parchment tied with a red band come let us sit by the fire where the light is better we will read it out together he led his guest to the wide hearth where a coal fire glowed the most valuable piece of scientific equipment yet invented declared bacon indicating his chair beside the fire there were two of them one on either side of the brightburning hearth they are of my own design please he said directing douglas to sit you will find it supremely conducive to mental activity of every kind douglas settled himself into what amounted to a low straightbacked throne with wide armrests and deep cushions covered with sheep skin the chair was tilted at a slight angle and was he was pleased to find eminently comfortablea definite necessity as it turned out for they would spend the better part of the next three hours steeped in erudite discursion of the contents of what roger bacon called the book of forbidden secrets the identity of the author is hidden beneath a veil of wilful obscurityi think we can agree that the name brother luciferus or light bearer is an alltooobvious pseudonym nevertheless the brilliance of the mans intellect shines out with unmistakeable clarity the vision which produced this singular document is as unique as it is revolutionary and therefore readily mistaken and censured by those of shall we say more prejudicial opinion commented douglas bacon offered a sage nod hence the coarse appellation the forbidden secrets which i suspect is a flirting reference to another highly influential work the secret of secrets at all events the author wished his work to remain uncensored and chose the script devised by myself to preserve his work he laid a longfingered hand on the bundled parchments moving on the breadth of topics addressed in this tome is somewhat narrow in consideration of a yet greater work of which this is seen as a mere distillationhence the title opus minus alchemaie the title put douglas in mind of one of bacons own works the opus majus was brother luciferus really bacon himself hiding behind an alias in the main the subject matter concerns the authors explorations in the science of alchemy continued the professor but he indulges in brief excursions into topics of more esoteric interest such as wondered douglas immortality replied bacon spirit travel the uses of earth energy the power of human willqueries and speculations of this nature digressions as i say and yet not without interest to a mind hungry for knowledge of every variety the scholar offered an indulgent smile i myself feel drawn to the very things you describe this spirit travel of which you speakis there anything of use for practical application contained in the book oh indeed brother luciferus was keenly interested in this mode of conveyance and its implications for discerning what he callsthe philosopher paused to consult the pages in his hand scanning them for the place he had markedyes here it is a most salubrious mechanism which reveals the impossible breadth of creation and the deeper expression of the mind of god in this he is not wrongas i myself can attest indeed douglas affected surprise he knew from his researches the legend that roger bacon had been credited with the ability to appear and disappear at will and even to be in two places at onceboth of which would be easily accomplished through ley travel oh yes i have indulged in experiments which have proved beyond all doubt that it is a repeatable phenomenon which however poor our understanding of it nevertheless affords ready application of its properties to those who know how to manipulate the more subtle energies the book tells how to do it bacon nodded and more brother luciferus expounds practical principles as well as concomitant philosophical considerationssuch as deriving the dynamism by which spirit travel operates the mechanism if you will and its salutary effects on the physical body how very interesting douglas eye fell upon the sheaf of parchment scraps and you have translated this for purposes of further experimentation i have bacon paused then added i hope your abbot will not mind of course the translation is mine and must never leave my possession they talked on through the evening hours and far into the night pausing only to take a little bread and wine so that they might continue their discussion when at last the renowned scholar confessed to growing weary and needing a little rest douglas rose and with a low bow of deference thanked his host for his unstinting diligence and service i shall speak to my abbot and no doubt he will wish to reward you for your intellectual generosity and service to scholarship you have been more than helpful i hope you will give your abbot my best regards bacon took the red ribbon and carefully retied the bundle in his lap then returned to the strongbox and locked away the deciphered script will you come to me again brother he asked dropping the key back into place inside his robe we have much to discuss alas my time in oxford has come to an end replied douglas my duties at the abbey he smiled apologetically i understand but god willing i may be asked to return for further instruction if so i will welcome the opportunity indeed i he paused as if embarrassed what is it i pray you asked the professor was there something else i have already taxed you enough said douglas but there is one final matter which may interest you as much as it has excited the curiosity of many of our brothers at the abbeya matter i have been pursuing in my own researches he reached into his robe and brought out the copy of the skin map he had obtained from sir henrys strongbox in the christ church crypt may i by all means granted bacon he pressed the back of his hand to his mouth to stifle a yawn i am led to believe that this is a map i mention it now because of its uncanny similarity to the symbol language you have translated from the book of forbidden secrets friar bacon held out his hand for the parchment if you would allow me he unrolled it and held it to the light yes i see what you mean can you make any sense of it a map you say so i believe yesss the scholar said slowly fascinating douglas bit his lip yes i do see what you mean confirmed bacon but it is not a map douglas felt his strength leaking away through his legs into the floor he swayed on his feet as if the floor were tilting beneath the knowledge that his efforts had been for nothing he fought down his disappointment not a map in the common sense of the word bacon continued though i understand why some may think it so he held the parchment to his face to study it more closely yes these are numerical coordinates he tapped a finger on one of the meticulously copied symbols given a key i believe i could decipher them for you a key wondered douglas a key to unlock the mystery of the numbers said the professor for unless we know to what the coordinates correspond the information provided by the numerals will remain meaningless he passed the scrap back to douglas do you possess such a key i confess that i do not but might a sample be provided which i can take away with me for further study at the abbey i know my brothers would be grateful for even that much for a certainty replied master bacon he crossed to his worktable took up a quill dipped it into his inkhorn and began scribbling quickly on the parchment when he finished he handed the stillwet copy to douglas there were now rows of numbers beside a dozen or so of the small glyphsnumbers that douglas recognised as longitude and latitude coordinates i am in awe of your erudition said douglas with a bow he thanked him and took his leave my greetings to your abbot called roger bacon from the door of his tower we will speak again when next you return to the city once outside douglas paused to rouse the sleeping snipe who was curled in his cloak at the foot of the stairs wake up he whispered i have work for you the boy awoke instantly alert there is an iron box in the corner of the room he described the strongbox and where the key was kept inside the box is a document tied with a red band snipe gave a shrewd and silent nod steal it part five a house made all of bone chapter in which feeling good and strong is not enough k it landed with a jolt that rattled his bones from ankle to skull then crashed headlong onto a path soft with alder leaves and pine needles heart racing blood pounding in his temples his breath coming in gulps and gasps he braced himself for the wave of nausea that when it came was a mere ripple that passed through his gut and disappeared not so bad he thought maybe im getting used to this he lay for a moment listening bubbling up from somewhere below he could hear running watera stream peacefully slipping and sliding over smooth stonesa calm agreeable sound mixed with intermittent birdcalls from the trees round about it immediately put kit at ease there was neither sign nor sound of pursuit he had succeeded in eluding burleigh and his mob when his vision cleared kit lifted his head and looked around a woodland path lay arrow straight before him slanting down at a fairly steep angle rising in the distance directly opposite was a curtain of greywhite rock mottled green with moss shrubs and small treesthe sheer wall of an enormous limestone gorge a few hundred yards away it was he decided with considerable relief the very place wilhelmina had told him about the air was crisp and cool the sun directly overhead but pale in a sky of silver haze it felt like autumn to himsomething about the scent of dry leaves and the tang in the breeze put him in mind of october a month he had always ranked high among his favourites he climbed to his feet thinking now to find a comfortable spot to wait for mina to show up the way the girl played fast and loose with time he reckoned he would not have to wait long glancing around he made a quick survey of the immediate vicinity and spotted a rock ledge jutting out from the sloping wall beside the trail dry and flat it seemed as good a place as any he walked over brushed off the fallen leaves and sat down the ley lamp still warm in his hand was dark now and the animating warmth fading fast an intriguing device made of burnished brass with a row of little lights along one gently curved side it was about the size and shape of the average potato and it looked more than a little like an ocarinaone of those funny little musical instruments introduced in middle school music class the smooth metal surface was incised with ornate swirly lines radiating out from a buttonsized knob below a slightly larger circular hole covered by a crystal lens resisting the urge to twist the knob to see what would happen he instead stuffed the device back into his pocket and settled himself on the stone bench where his thoughts soon turned back to the harrowing chase he had just endured burleigh on his horse the horse rearing the gunshots giles suddenly on the ground urging him away the mad dash through the dark wood along the river stumbling onto the ley it had all happened so fast he had reacted on instinct now that he had time to think what he thought was that he was probably extremely lucky to be alive and he hoped giles had survived too and that the wound was not too bad he wondered how wilhelmina would deal with this kink in the plan no doubt she had a remedy ready at hand and was already employing it the day was warm and after cooling his heels for a while listening to the drone of bees working the poppies and dog roses growing along the slope kit grew drowsy and decided to walk to the top of the path have a little look around keep himself awake and see if he could tell where in the world he might be not that it mattered very much he did not plan on remaining here long it was more just something to do while he waited the path up to the top was steep and he was sweating by the time he reached the trails beginning where a broad plain of low gentle hills rising and falling in heavily wooded waves greeted him there were no roads no towns no fields not a hint of human habitation anywhereonly the fading green and gold of an autumn woodland in every direction as far as the eye could see a track through long grass joined the trail leading down into what kit now realised was a very substantial canyon he followed the grass path a few dozen yards to a place where it divided into several more trailsone to the left one to the right one leading into the wood directly ahead he took this one and was soon strolling through a very pleasant grove of ash larch birch and alder with a few beech and walnut scattered throughout the air was heavy with the scent of leaves and moist soil and a pungent animal smell but if there were any creatures about they kept themselves hidden when the path divided again he took the righthand way and continued through an unvarying landscape of trees interspersed now and again with small clearings or meadows although he kept his eyes peeled for the merest hint of human activity he did not spot anything more substantial than a trail made by animal feet much less a road realising he might trek for hours this way he abandoned his excursion and turned around retracing his steps to the track leading down into the gorge kit descended at a steady pace and upon passing the place where he had landed pulled out minas ley lamp the little lights remained dark the instrument cold in his hand he shoved the gismo back into his pocket with the thought that some leys being more time sensitive than others the ley was obviously dormant for the moment he would check it again later his walk had made him sweaty and thirsty so he resumed his excursion and followed the old straight track down to the river at the bottom of the gorge a few dozen yards from the ley the trail widened losing the arrowstraight line as it followed the natural undulating curves of the cliffs down and down into the valley the walls were marked with striated bands of greyandwhite stonelimestone and shale laid down in ribbons and layers over countless millennia as the surrounding rock walls rose ever higher around him kit had a sensation of riding an escalator down through successive ages of time each layer another eon or so eventually the path ended in a bowl formed by a wide lazy bend in the small river that picked its way among boulders the size of cars and garden sheds littering the centre floor of the valley on either side of the river lay a wide grassy verge along the low banks were reed beds and scrub oak and small bushes and trees here on the valley floor the air was warmer and more humid hopping from one large stone to the next he worked his way along the rivers edge until he found a small pool clear as glass kneeling he scooped up cupped handfuls and drank his fill of sweet fresh water he sat down and let the pale sunlight drench him in a little while he was dozing kit came awake with the sharp realisation that he had fallen asleep in a place where wilhelmina would not know to look for him he rose quickly and made a hasty return to the place he had landed earlier driven by a sense of exasperated urgency jogging along worried about missing wilhelmina he at first failed to notice that the smell he had encountered up in the wooded hills had appeared again the moment the scent registered he stopped and looked around sniffing the air stronger now it was unmistakeable a rich earthy pong redolent of fur and sweat blood and muskthe scent of the bier and kennel the sty and stable den and warren despite these associations the odour was not entirely disagreeable in fact there was a wildness about it that stirred him strangely had he been a hound he imagined his nose would be quivering and his hackles would be raised out of the blue the thought occurred to him that perhaps whatever he was smelling might be smelling him kit moved on more quickly this time casting frequent glances behind him although he saw nothing he grew increasingly certain that there was something behind him calm down youre letting your imagination run wild he forced himself to pause and take a deep breath there thats better the thought was still winging through his mind when he heard the crackle of dry leaves he shot a swift glance behind and glimpsed a grey shape fading into the deepshadowed greenery along the curtain wall of the gorgea mere flicker of movement and then it was gone so silent so quick in a moment he was not even sure he had seen it again he tried to shrug it off he moved on forcing himself to proceed more quietly even so he could not easily shake the feeling that he was being followed every few steps at random intervals he cast a backwards glance to see if he could catch sight of the shadow again he saw nothing but the silence of the gorge had begun to exert an uncanny pressure of its ownas if the entire valley were holding its breath in expectation of something dire okay thats just silly theres nothing there and then just as he resumed his progress he heard the unmistakable snap of a dry branch beneath a heavy foot whirling towards the sound he thought that once again he saw a shudder of movementa shadow fading into shadow swift and silent but massive and this time he was certain he had seen it certainty sent a sick dread snaking through his gut he was being stalked into his mind burst an image of himself running exhausted chased by a pack of howling wolves until he fell and was ripped to bloody ribbons before his fevered imagination could throw up another gruesome image kit lit out skittering over the stone field along the river although it was rougher going he decided to remain out in the open where he could see around him rather than take to the treelined marge where the thing stalking him had the camouflage advantage of shadows and timber this decision sat well with him until he glimpsed on the other side of the river sloping through the trees another shadowy shape keeping pace with him kit was running flat out now little caring that he was easily visible to the creatures stalking him his feet flew over the uneven bed of watersmoothed stones of all sizes clumsy in his haste heedless of all but the driving need to distance himself from the pursuit in his flight he blew past the turning that led up to the ley line trail but he gradually became aware that he was no longer in territory he had seen before the valley was the sameonly different now glancing around desperately he saw that the curtain walls of the gorge had opened out the river was wider here and more shallow dancing across the rocky bed in ripples a few inches deep wheres the bloody trail he muttered unwilling to backtrack to find it he felt impelled to move on he began looking for a place to hide and was heartened to see that the trees were larger here the surrounding wood thicker when the river kinked around another sharp bend kit decided to abandon the waterway and take to the trees almost at once he struck a wide path of bare earth it snaked through the wood passing around the boles of the larger oaks and larches it was easier to run here and he determined to put some distance between himself and his pursuers he leaned into his stride and flew like a mad thing for freedom his feet pounded a mantra with every step i feel good i feel strong i feel good i feel strong indeed he was feeling good and strong right up until the split second he tumbled into the trap in the space between one step and the next the ground gave way beneath him and he plunged through empty air time seemed to expand and everything became almost unbearably clear the golden motes adrift in shafts of sunlight the cleanetched tendrils of a fern a yellow butterfly hovering above a white flower with slow beats of its delicate wings a blackbird taking flight from a branch overhead all the world seemed to pause on a long intake of breath his first fleeting thought was that he had somehow made a ley leap and then the walls of the pit closed around him and he landed in a heap in the half light of a deep square hole with a mass of broken twigs and leaves showering over him the force of his rude landing drove the wind out of him he lay gagging trying to draw breath but unable to make his lungs work properly his vision grew dim and hazy then when it seemed he would implode for lack of oxygen his breath returned with a whoosh and he lay spent and wheezing like a broken bellows on his back looking up at a perfectly square patch of blue sky framed by the dirt walls of the hole in which he lay kit took a quick mental inventory of himself aside from the mighty thump of the deadfall jolt that had knocked the breath out of him there was no pain a good sign he thought he patted himself down he still had minas ley lamp and sir henrys green book safely tucked away and so far as he could tell all his faculties he raised one hand then the other and waved them both around he shook out his legs all seemed in working order no broken bones then the light in the pit dimmed as he was taking stock and he looked skyward to see that a face had appeared in the square opening above him at the first glimpse of that face he frozenot in fear but stark astonishment for it was a face at once familiar yet utterly foreign kit recognised it instantly but knew he had never seen it in the flesh before the face peering down at him was attached to a swarthy rugged square head covered with a heavy pelt of hair so thick and matted it looked like yak fur and the features were those of a clumsily executed caricature in fact if those same features had been carved out of timber with an ax the result would have been nearly identicalexcept for the eyes and it was the eyes in that face that astonished him and held him fast big dark eyes so quick and intelligent and expressive they could only belong to a creature of at least modest selfawareness the fact that the creature seemed to be as surprised to see kit as kit was to see it completed the circle of amazement he lay gazing up at that roughhewn face and with a childlike fascination the sense of wonder was so overpowering it drove out all fear kit simply forgot to be afraid chapter in which a most peculiar predicament arises time slowed to a trickle lying on the floor of the pit kit fought his way back to a more reasoned frame of mind he was in big trouble he was in a killing pit for heavens sake he was for the chop and there was nothing he could do about it still he did not feel at all distraught every instinct jangled noisily insisting that he should be rigid with terror instead more than anythingaside from the initial astonishmenthe felt only relief there was a movement above him and the face disappeared replaced by a sturdy length of wood smoothed and rounded polished with use the shaft of a spear the implement hovered over him when he made no move to touch it the creature on the other end prodded him first in the shoulder then in the stomach kit brushed the thing away but the blunt wooden pole continued to poke him ever more insistently until kit realised that the creature on the other end of the stick wanted him to take hold of it tentatively grasping the smooth rounded haft of the branch he was pulled upright in a single effortless jerk and quickly scrambled to his feet the top of the hole was still two feet or so above his head so the pole was offered again and grasping it tightly with both hands kit was hauled bodily up out of the pit to stand before creatures whose existence was the stuff of myth and dusty museum dioramas there were two of them large shaggy and extremely inquisitive creatures they regarded him intently bright curiosity burning in their dark eyes one was larger than the other older but both were dressed in skins held together with strings and bands of woven rope and dried gut their flesh was a healthy nutbrown from the sun and weather their hair long and dark but sunbleached at the tips the older one was aggressively bearded and the younger lacked any facial hair both were barefoot with broad splayed toes and thick calloused soles both held identical stoutshafted spears with stubby blades made of chipped flint although no taller than kit himself they gave every impression of being giantsperhaps owing to their perfectly solid presence and heavy muscular build they were magnificent specimens broad of shoulder and deep of chest with large square heads on short corded necks and huge muscled forearms legs and thighs shortwaisted and thick about the middle they appeared almost as broad as they were tall yet there was not an ounce of fat on them just pure lean hard muscle and lots of it they gaped at kit then at one another then at kit againtheir wide expressive faces registering unalloyed wonder at the sight of so strange a being hauled from their trap then after a moments consideration the younger one reached out with a thick grubby forefinger and poked kit in the chest as if to test his corporeality it was the most natural gesture in the world yet it made kits knees buckle he swayed and stepped back whereupon the older one reached out and taking his entire shoulder in one massive hand steadied him with a grip so gentle and reassuring that kit almost swooned at the touch his heart skipped a beat or two and his breath caught in his throat as the utter impossibility of this most peculiar predicament broke over him he had been captured by cavemen kits heart thumped in his chest and he felt faint and dizzy with the surge of adrenaline and highoctane emotion crashing through him his thoughts skittered off in every direction leaving him with an utterly useless question what now what under holy heaven now without a sound or sign the older of the two creatures turned abruptly and started walking away after a few steps the big hunter paused and with a curved hand gesturethe kind a child might make to a playmateindicated that kit was to follow kit afraid to do otherwise obeyed the little hunter fell into step behind him and the three moved off in single file together for beings so stocky they moved with the agile grace of wild things silent as shadows the only sounds kit heard were those of his own makingswishing through grass breaking the odd twig beneath his shoes the rustle of dry leaves every now and then big hunter would pause and sniff the air in an odd doglike fashion his wide flat nostrils flaring he seemed to taste the air as much as smell it and after each reassurance moved on again with a little backwards glance at kit as if to say all is well we go on they walked a long time and the day began to fade they were deeper into the wood now the trees larger the shadows thicker and darker branches closed overhead to form a green canopy and the river narrowed to a slowrunning stream moss and lichen grew on the trees and rocks all around and a scent like that of mushrooms filled the air they stopped to drink from the stream first little hunter then big huntereach keeping guard over the otherwhile kit lapped water from his cupped hands they resumed their trek moving ever deeper into the wooded valley pausing every now and then to sniff the air kit used these little rest stops to surreptitiously check the ley lamp on the off chance that he might find another ley but there was never any sign of activity after the third or fourth pause big hunter gave out a gruff snort and picked up his speed moving through the forest with long groundeating strides little hunter gave kit a shove from behind that nearly knocked him off his feet and kit stepped up to double time that was not fast enough however and soon he was having to trot just to keep pace this went on for a considerable time when at last they slowed again kit was sweating and gasping and all but falling over by his hazy estimate they were several miles from the ley line that had brought him to this world if wilhelmina were looking for him she would not find him there at first opportunity he told himself he would escape and make his way back to the ley and wait there as instructed kit keenly regretted having wandered off but who could have foreseen being kidnapped by cavemen by now kit was getting thirsty again and footsore during the next pause to sniff the air kit ignored his captors and knelt to drink little hunter grew agitated and jabbed kit with the butt of his spear a few times until the older one grunted a command that made his companion desist kit drank his fill and when he was done rose big hunter stooped down and drank toojust a few mouthfuls slurped out of the palm of his wide hand as if to be polite they moved on again keeping the river on the left as they threaded through the undulating valley and then just as the light began to fail kit caught a whiff of a pungent stink a rich musky ripe scent like he imagined a den of wolves might smell after a long hard winter the three passed under a lowhanging bough and through a screening wall of bushes and suddenly kit was standing in a clearing amidst a collection of crude rounded domes made from branches pulled fullleafed from the surrounding trees and shrubs they were home four primitives rose to greet the returning hunters kit saw their eyes flick to him and all at once there arose a tremendous yowling of excitement five more creatures all female materialised some emerging from the rudimentary shelters others from the nearby wood and all jabbering at once in what sounded to kit like an excited guttural yap one or two of the boldest primitives thrust forward and began touching him with little pats and prods they touched his skin and hair and clothes meanwhile the females formed a muttering murmuring circle around him the poking and prodding continued for a time the chatter coming in waves until one of the younger primitives baring his teeth in a ghastly smile picked up a stick and in imitation of his elders jabbed kit in the leg ow kit announced not so much from pain as from the unexpected attack that response encouraged the youngster so he stabbed kit again harder with a sound that kit could only interpret as laughter this time kit kept his mouth closed which provoked a third attack and a rapid fourth a slightly older creature joined in giving kit a firm punch in the ribs and then crying loudly for everyone to see what he had doneat which point big hunter who seemed to be the leader of the group loosed a low rumbling growl that even kit recognised as a command instantly all poking and prodding and chattering ceased silence claimed the clearing as the woodland swallowed the sound big hunter pushed through the mob taking charge of kit with a proprietary gesture of control and possession cupping a heavy hand to kits head then thumping himself on the chest with a closed fist the others appeared to understand this and the nature of the interaction changed the whole proceeding became immediately quieter and more respectful in this simple act ground rules were established that even kit could not fail to understand one moment he was a strange new animal that had been hauled in for observation and comment and the next moment kit was a guest a new status had been claimed for him and boundaries established he was not to be poked and jabbed with sticks he was not to be yapped at or buffeted about for their amusement still the others stared and murmured ignoring the behaviour of his fellow beings big hunter touched him on the arm and beckoned kit to follow him kit was led across the clearing to the biggest bower in the camp a log lay lengthwise across the entrance and before the log a ring of large river stones encircled a heap of glowing charcoal embers the setup was exactly the sort of bivouac boy scouts would have fashioned for a forest jamboreea generous hearth with benches it was almost dark in the glade though patches of sky glimpsed through holes in the leaf canopy still held a bit of pale pink kit was made to sit on the log while dry branches were broken up and tossed onto the smouldering embers of the previous fire in no time the glade was lit with a flame that continued to grow as more and more wood was thrown onto the pile the older primitives busied themselves with some activity or otherhuddled together as they were kit could not see what they were doingbut while their elders worked the younger ones gathered around to watch kit watch the fire presently a long green reed was produced on which was threaded strings of meat kit did not see what kind of animal produced these gobbets but it was red and fresh more of these makeshift spits appeared and were put into the fire and soon the entire group was sitting around the ring toasting meat on thin skewers the scent of sizzling fat and meat juice brought the water to kits mouth and though he was seated in what was surely a place of honour everyone ignored him apparently where important matters of life were concernedsuch as cooking and eatingceremony could wait when the first skewer was done big hunter took it and bit off a healthy chunk the others watched him as he chewed he gave a lift of his chin and everyone else proceeded to pull their spits from the fire and commenced to eat rising from his place at the fire the chief came to kit and held the reed out to him kit nodding and smiling reached to take it he pulled a morsel of roasted meat from the charred reed and popped it into his mouth much to the delight of the others big hunter made a rumbling noise and took up two more uncooked skewers one he gave to kit keeping the other for himself he sat down on the log beside his guest and then with gestures and grunts instructed kit in the art of cooking meat on a reed kit proved himself to be a ready and able studentas if he required any schoolingand his evident ability to feed himself so expertly seemed to meet with the approval of the gathering the others murmured among themselves and with much nudging and many a sly glance let kit know they were discussing him as grateful as he was for the food and the chance to sit and rest a little kit could not help feeling that his next act must be to escape there was little hope for that he decided while they were all still watching him he would have to wait until the camp was asleep to make his move kit planned to return to the ley line and find a place to wait for wilhelmina to show upif she was not there already if he had done that in the first place he would not be in this improbable situation now just thinking about how mina was no doubt searching high and low for him muttering dark oaths against his namedeservedly so he had to admitmade him that much more eager to be on his way then another and altogether worse thought occurred to him maybe he had already missed her what if she had arrived as planned seen that he was not there and promptly left again to search somewhere else what then it did not bear thinking aboutso he tried not to but the glum thought cast him into an apprehensive and fretful mood the meal went on for a considerable time and at a pace that could only be described as leisurely kit grew increasingly anxious to be on his way when at last the younger primitives began to drowse and fall asleep some of the older ones picked them up and carried them into the nearby bowers finally as the food disappeared the others drifted offmost to bed down in the shelter of their leafy hovels but a few of the young males simply curled up in the root hollows of the larger trees or on the ground near the fire ring big hunter crawled into his shelter behind the log and gestured for kit to join him with reluctance bordering on dread kit acquiesced thinking that any refusal on his part would only delay the inevitable or worse rouse the suspicions of his host who might then take steps to forestall any escape so kit crawled into the bower to wait the problem was that the interior of the rude branchconstructed hut was much more comfortable than he imagined possible the floor was carpeted with alternating layers of moss and leaves covered by dry grass there were even pillowsanimal pelts rolled into bags and stuffed with grass and of all things fragrant lavender the excitement of the daywhich had begun a long time ago and far far awaycombined with a good stint of healthy exercise served to smother kits resolve he drifted off to sleep on clouds of lavender and was soon dreaming of lambs frolicking in sundappled meadows he woke again with the sound of a whippoorwill singing in a nearby tree otherwise the camp was peaceful and quiet and dawn he guessed still some way off big hunter was sound asleep his breathing deep and regular so kit gathered himself and creeping as quietly as he could backed from the hovel and rather than cross the camp slipped around the side and directly into the forest behind once away from the camp he paused the moon was low but there was still enough light to navigate his way without stumbling around he listened for the river then followed the sound until he reached the stony bank the rounded stones appeared like humps of overgrown mushrooms grey and white in the soft moonlight the water gleaming all slithery and silver it was kit decided merely a matter of retracing the route back through the valley until he reached the place where he had entered the gorge he had a fair distance to travel but time enough if he did not dally along the way he started out with a determined step and hope in his heart his pace quick but measured fed and rested his spirits high he covered ground at a respectable rate pausing now and again to listen for any sound of pursuit each time he continued with greater assurance that he had made good his escape and would reach the meeting place in reasonable time counting on the fact that it would be morning by the time he approached the vicinity and he would recognise the turning when he saw it again in the daylight assuming that is he lived long enough to see the light of another day chapter in which kit embraces the stone age ignorance may be bliss but it is still ignorance and kit hoofing through the nightdark valley had not the slightest twinge or premonition of the danger into which he had blithely wandered to give him a little credit kit saw the three black humps beside the river but took them for stonesone large two slightly smaller boulders in a field of boulders strewn along the river path it was not until an unseen fourth stone off to his right reared up on its hind legs that he realised his mistake by then he had already passed the point of no return it was a bear black as an ink stain beady little eyes glinting in the wan light of a fading moon as it swung its head left and right to pick up the human scent that had aroused it from a midnight snack of crayfish and clams there were as kit now understood four of thema mother and three halfgrown cubs and without knowing it he had made the most elementary errorthe one transgression every schoolkid on a field trip is warned against committing in the wild never get between a mother and her young scenting him the bear gave out a halfstrangled cry of alarm as it stood motionless a scant fewdozen paces across the field of stones the mother bears massive head came up sharply in response to her bawling infant the great dark muzzle swung first one way and then the other as the creature homed in on him nostrils twitching then rising on its hind legs it spread its massive arms opened its toothy maw and loosed with a roar to shake the stars from the heavens the raw feral snarl of an enraged meateater loosened kits bowels instantly giving the animal a new and more pungent scent to follow the great beast shuffled forward on its hind legsa move kit missed because he was by then frantically searching for a tree to climb unfortunately the only trees near enough to offer sufficient shelter were behind the bear that was even now gathering itself to charge when the animal roared again kit was already backpedaling making for what he imagined was the safety of the wood behind him too far behind him there was no better option he turned around and within three steps was in full armflapping retreat kit ran with the abandon of the truly desperate scrambling over rocks large and small stumbling splashing banging his knees and shins picking himself up and floundering on over the lumpy treacherous ground the bear had no such difficulty it surged ahead with the fluid momentum of a runaway freight train gathering pace with every step the smaller bears joined in the chase a stand of slender white birches stood shimmering in the moonlight a few hundred paces away if he could make it to the grove kit imagined it just might slow the animals down long enough for him to find a tree big enough to climb gulping air he drove himself to greater speed willing strength to his legs and fleet to his feet and for a moment it seemed as if he actually gained some ground on the pursuing beasts alas whatever imagined advantage kit might have enjoyed was instantly lost when skittering over the uneven surface his foot slipped on a mossslick stone and he fell hard whacking his chin on the river rocks mother bear was on him before he could get his feet under him again squirming onto his back he faced the beast kicking and screaming as if that might drive the enraged animal away the bear seeing its quarry helpless on the ground reared for the final assault jaws wide claws extended it made a mighty sweep with one great deathdealing paw kit anticipated the blow and rolled to one side narrowly avoiding having his entire stomach ripped open he shouted and kicked out blindly the toe of his shoe struck a leg solid as a tree trunk astonishingly that kick appeared to confuse the bear it paused midlunge and shook its shaggy head emboldened by this unwarranted success kit kicked again the blow was accompanied by a loud meaty chunk the bear reared back before kit could launch another kick there was another thunk and another the bear swiped at the empty air and fistsized stones began to rain all around thick and fast they came striking glancing bouncing as they smacked mercilessly into the animals bulky frame the bear staggered back in confusion and kit heard a sudden loud cry erupt behind him he twisted his head around to see three primitives break from the birch grove all with fistsized river rocks in their hands and all shouting and heaving stones as they ran throwing with unerring accuracy every missile struck home with a satisfying thump the great ferocious beast cowered under the attack after being struck a few times on the head and chest it turned lowered itself to all fours and beat a hasty retreat crying for its cubs to follow the young bears did not wait for the stones to begin falling on them they hightailed it after their mother mewling all the way then hands were thrust beneath kits shoulders and he was hauled to his feet by his armpits while two other primitives continued to hurl stones at the fleeing bears big hunter patted kit around the body as if feeling for wounds im okay kit told him knowing full well he would not be understood im only a little skinned up its okay he gripped the heavy hand im all right this brought a response from big hunter who ceased pawing at him gangor he said plain as day his voice coming from somewhere deep inside him it was the first word if word it was that kit understood he said it again and pointed to the bears gangor kit said trying to repeat the sound of the word as near as he was able big hunters eyes went wide with amazed delight he called to the other primitives and when they had returned and gathered around he said the word again looking at kit with an expression of anticipation gangor said kit eager to oblige the effect was electric all three primitives began jabbering at once and patting himstroking him like a dog that has just learned a new trick kit endured this enthusiastic buffeting no really it was nothing he told them turning to big hunter he pressed the primitives hand thank you he gazed into the bearded faces around him and with all the sincerity he could muster said thank you all for saving me the celebration finished and the primitives started back to the settlement through gestures and proddings they gave kit to know that they expected him to accompany them but kit had a better idea no wait he insisted planting his feet stepping quickly behind the nearest bush he removed his soiled underwear and with some regret left them he washed as best he could in the shallow stream then emerged from the bush to rejoin the party pointing up the valley he indicated one of the tiered ledges of the gorge and said i need to check on something he knew full well that there was not the shred of a chance that any of them would understand him but it was a relief to talk and he harboured the small hope that he might make them understandin the manner of british tourists abroad who not knowing the local patois just speak englishbut loudly up there i have to go there wont take a minute kit spread his arms and then drew a circle that included them all you can come with me in fact i hope you will he turned and made a show of starting off come on he made a sweep of his arm as if calling the start to a marathon lets go chaps he stepped off a halfdozen paces and glanced back to see them still standing there watching him on a sudden inspiration kit made the gesture big hunter had made with him earlierthe curved hand come along motion then with a single grunt of command big hunter started after him and the rest fell into step as they walked the sky began to lighten and kit was glad to see that he remembered this region of the gorge he walked with purpose urging on his new friends at each turn the sun was rising by the time they reached the cutting kit recognised as the ley trail leading down into the valley here it is he cried pointing like a wild man at the long sloping incline this is the place he made such a show of his excitement that the primitives stood bewildered by his odd behaviour murmuring among themselves wait here he told them holding up his hands just wait right here with that he turned and started up the trail his entourage followed so kit had to repeat the stay put gestureas one would with a dog determined to follow its master to schooluntil they at last got the message as soon as he turned away he took the ley lamp from his pocket and made a quick survey of the site the device was dead no warmth no little lights nothing at all to suggest the ley might be active thinking that perhaps the instrument had been knocked around so much it had stopped working he shoved it back in his pocket and instead took a few running steps down the centre of the ley when he failed to raise so much as a tingle on his skin he stopped drew a deep breath cleared his mind and then with deliberate steps began walking swiftly up the inclined ley fully confident that this time he would be transported again his expectation was confounded kit closed his eyes and tried again but upon opening his eyes he found he was still in the same place same world same time as before if he had travelled at all it was only the few paces between the place he started and the place he stopped growing frustrated and a little desperate now he tried three more times in quick succession before finally admitting defeat the ley was not open and not active he gave up and walked back down to the valley to join the waiting primitives who were watching him with undeniable expressions of concern on their broad hairy faces sorry to keep you all waiting he said ill try again later in fact over the next days he did try againfour times twice more in the morning and twice in the eveningeach time making the arduous trek from the place he called river city camp to the ley four timeswith no better result than before though he resisted the idea that he was now trapped here he had to admit that something had gone very wrong to keep despair at bay he immersed himself in observing his little community of primitives all the while trying to remember what he knew about the stone age like most people what he had gained had come from jokes and bmovies were these the cavemen of cartoon fame were they heavyhanded dullards who hunted such things as mastodons and dire wolves and giant sloths were they subhuman ogres that eked out a nasty and brutish existence in a world of dinosaurs and spewing volcanoes were they hairy monosyllabic troglodytes that lived in holes in the ground were they any of these things the first discovery to surprise kit was that he could no longer think of them as primitives much less call them creatures since the night they had risked themselves to save him from the bear they were peoplealbeit of an alien race and species kit spent a considerable amount of time trying to determine the blood relationships and hierarchy among the members of the river city clan big hunter seemed to be the chief though he was not the eldest there were two females that kit pegged as the oldest members of the group of sixteen individuals who ranged in age from three or four years to well whatever age the oldest ones weresixty seventy that is how old they appeared though the privations of a hardgraft huntergatherer life being what they were kit doubted the aged ones were anywhere near that old the clan consisted of seven males and nine females in appearance aside from the primary sexual characteristics such as beards and breasts and such the two sexes differed little both were of stocky muscular build thickframed and sturdy both more or less the same height with the males only a couple inches taller on average and females slightly less bulky both dressed in the same skins and furssome of the women chose to cover their upper chests but others did not both possessed the same long dark coarse wiry hair that they either plaited into thick ropelike braids or bound in leather bands into which they stuck interesting leaves feathers or other found objects as the days gave way to weeks kit gained a more rounded appreciation of their habits and means of survival the world was their larder and they ate whatever came to hand bolting down many things kit would not allow past his lipsinsects worms and larvae included for the most part they ate with their fingers but used sticks to sear raw meat in the fire but the thing they seemed to relish most of all was marrow from the bigger bones of the larger animals they hunted one day the hunting party returned carrying an antelope or sheepkit could not tell because they had already gutted and skinned it leaving the entrails far from camp so the scent would not draw predators the carcass was roughly quartered with flint hand axes and then cut up in smaller chunks which were put onto the reed skewers later when the meat was cooking a special cracking stone was fetched and the larger bones expertly broken open to allow access to the dark jellylike sweetmeat kit watched as the treat was doled outbig hunter first and then the others in turn though one or two got bigger pieces than the others no one appeared to complain kit too was offered a piece he lifted the broken shard of bone to his lips and sucked imitating the clansmen the congealed substance tasted of blood and meat and though not altogether distasteful and undoubtedly healthy in any number of ways he could not work up the enthusiasm for it that the clansmen seemed to share he ate some out of a sense of politeness but did not ask for more the clans mostly carnivorous diet was supplemented by roots berries and various greens most of which he enjoyed though he began to miss simple seasonings especially salt he made a mental note to remedy this situation at the first opportunity but all in all they ate well enoughsome days better than others as determined by the huntand kit reckoned that if he did not grow fat on the primitive regimen neither would he starve one of the more arresting features of their society was how very quiet they could be and most often were they could speak but usually became talkative only when excited kit marked an entire day when no one spoke from the moment he opened his eyes in the morning until he crawled into bed that night not a single vocal utterance had been made he wondered about this for a long time until it occurred to him that perhaps it was a basic survival tactic an inbred desire to keep from drawing unwanted attention to themselves by passing predators despite this innate reticence they were extremely communicative in other ways employing a full repertoire of facial expressions that would have done a professional mime proud added to that was a range of gestures that bordered on sign language in combination the gestures and expressions were often all that was necessary to get surprisingly complex messages across but that was not all in the first few days kit observed that the entire clan appeared to possess an uncanny instinct for empathy within the groupa sixth sense that told them what the others were thinking at first he imagined that perhaps it was due to the fact that they lived so closely and in such harmony with one another that they had simply developed a fundamental understanding that did not need words but as time went on he saw that it was something far more subtle and specific than that it was a sort of telepathy as kit got to know them better he came to believe that the clan did not talk much because each just instinctively knew what everyone else was thinking the most potent demonstration of this came late one afternoon a few days after he had come to river city an early dusk was settling on the camp and some of the females were chopping a haunch of wild pig in preparation for cooking a few of the males were chipping flint to make scrapers or ax blades everyone was busy working away quietly when all of a sudden one of the males dropped his flint stone and stood up instantly he was joined by the three females not a word was spokennot even a gruntbut all four disappeared into the wood those who remained behind also stopped working and began preparing a bed of fresh reeds and rushes by the fire ring intrigued kit watched as they heaped the reeds high and covered them with skins they then built up the fireclearly in anticipation of something that was about to take place and only a few minutes later the group that had gone into the wood returned carrying one of the younger malesscratched and bleeding and obviously injured they laid him on the reed bed and nursed him through the night all this took place without so much as a single syllable breathed aloud the more he thought about it the more convinced kit became that at the moment of the young ones injury they all knew that he was in trouble and had gone to rescue him they just knew yet as extraordinary as that was the thing that impressed kit most was how very gentle they were with each other in those first days with them he did not witness any angry or aggressive behaviour indeed they seemed to tolerate one another very well if not to enjoy being together the older ones definitely doted on the youngerat least in camp for the smallest of the clan were not allowed to wander very far into the surrounding woods unless an adult was in tow there was still much to learn about them of course but kit was content to allow that learning to take place naturally in the meantime he tried to be a good guest and not bother his hosts or make a nuisance of his presence nevertheless the clan appeared as fascinated by him as he was by them for their part they missed nothing he did following his every movefrom the way he washed his hands and face to brushing his teeth with chewed hazel twigs and taking off his shoes to sleepwhich drew great excitement the first time he performed any of these activities the younger members of the clan tried to imitate him the older ones merely watched from a polite distance the thing that produced the greatest amusement for the clan was kits attempt to wash his clothes one morning awakening to the fact that his shirt and trousers were filthy and that he had not had a proper wash for more days than he cared to think about kit decided that the time had come to take the plungeliterally he took himself to the river and found what he imagined to be a secluded spot where the stream ran deep and slow and then waded out he dove in swam around a bit bobbing up and down to thoroughly soak his garments and then waded back to the bank and disrobed all this splashing about drew a crowd of course and he was soon the object of intense observation for although they understood that his clothing while different from their own served the same function the younger ones reacted with the same mixture of fascination and disgust he might have felt upon seeing a businessman shedding his skin like a snake they jabbered excitedly at the first glimpse of the extreme white hairlessness of his skinat least that was what kit assumed they were remarking on and not on his inconsequential and wholly unimpressive physique despite his initial qualms he found he did not mind being naked in front of the clanany more than a farmer might baulk at being caught naked in front of barnyard cattle not that he thought of them as cattle but the sense of species separation was so great that once he had wriggled out of his sopping shirt and trousers and was slapping them against the smooth flat river stones he simply did not care anymore in any event the exercise proved mildly successful after drying on a sunfacing bush his garments did seem fresher if not cleaner but lying in the sun on the riverbank he felt the chill that was never far from the air even on the warmest days and knew that he was enjoying the last gasp of a splendid autumn the days were already drawing in the nights growing steadily cooler often now the morning air held a frosty note and days were overcast he wondered what the river city clan did for the winterwhere did they go he did not think they would stay camped by the river and he was right chapter in which a sensible course of action is proposed why oh why cant everyone just once do what theyre told for heavens sake wilhelmina tapped her foot and gazed darkly down the empty trackway no kit he should be here her instructions were simple specific and clear stay put do not wander off wait for rescue was that too much to ask okay giles getting himself wounded had thrown a kink into the plan that had taken a deal of sorting out admittedlynot to mention putting her carefully maintained cover at riskand had delayed things considerably but that was no excuse for kit to go wandering off when she had told him not to move a muscle but could kit manage even that much could he heck she decided to give it another fifteen minutes and if kit didnt show up she would have to abandon her present time location and try another this particular ley leading into the valley was completely reliable in all her experiments learning the ropes of ley travel practicing her technique mapping the destination and basically just trying to get her head around the incredible facility to simply pop out of one world into another in all those early training trials she had come to believe that the one she called the big valley ley was fairly uncomplicated its time window seemed to be limited and there were not a lot of branches or forks or whatever they were leading off to other places in other universesjust a simple straightforward thoroughfare in motorway terms she thought of it as the m so if kit had made it to the ley ahead of the chase why the devil was he not here waiting for her the only explanation was that kit had left the trail and gone off somewhere into the valley searching for him there would be a chore and one she was not prepared at the moment to undertake she glanced down at the smoothtooled object filling her palmthe new ley lamp rosenkreuz had made for her although roughly the same size and shape as before it boasted a few improvements most of which she looked forward to trying the chief difference in the new model was a second row of little lights which she was told glowed from yellow to red in the presence of the searchedfor traveller the young alchemist had offered to explain the mechanics of its operation but with everything going on there had been neither time nor inclination in any event she had been able to get giles bandaged medicated and tucked away without burleigh tumbling to the fact that she was in cahoots with the two fugitives lady fayth a willing accomplice had helpedunwittingly true but necessarily if haven had known the full extent of wilhelminas involvement she might not have been such a keen collaborator if things had fallen out differently mina would have been forced to join kit and giles on the run but the young lady had kept her head and when it mattered backed wilhelminas risky play to the hilt now mina cast yet another longing look down the trail and with an exasperated sigh and a roll of her big brown eyes trudged down the trail and into the valley when she reached the bottom she paused and then shouted for kit she listened then repeated the call satisfied that if he had been within the sound of her voice he would have answered she moved oneventually coming to the little halfabandoned village the settlement was one of several that seemed to have been settled and constructed by country folk in the region the few who lived there maintained fields on the riverbanks and on the highlands above the river provided water for a mill duck ponds and a little fishery she had met some of the inhabitants and they in turn were used to seeing her now and then they were simple peaceable folk who kept to themselves and avoided conflict and confrontationwhich is why mina had felt good about sending kit and giles here they were unlikely to get into difficulties with the locals she walked along the valley floor following the river and calling for kit there was never any reply after walking a mile or more in one direction she turned and repeated the procedure in the opposite direction at the end of the exercise with darkness falling she returned to the ley and made a last call for kit to hurry or miss his rescue she waited as before there was no answer turning on her heel she took up the ley lamp and in four quick strides departed the valley for home by the time she returned to prague the sun had risen on another day at the city gates she joined the trickle of farmers fresh from the fields trundling produce to market in barrows and donkey carts she walked through the old town as the days traders were setting up their stalls in the square she greeted those she knew and promised to return later to buy etzel was just opening the grand imperial kaffeehaus removing the shutters and pulling down the green awning she had designed and herr arnostovi had commissioned to be built and installed good morning mein schatz she chirped and gave him a quick peck on the cheek ach wilhelmina you are here relief pinwheeled over his round face i did not see you return last nightall the kerfufflei was worried something might have happened to you she smiled and patted his arm reassuringly nothing is going to happen to me remember what i told you if i should turn around and find you gone he said repeating her words by rote i am not to worry you will always come back i will always come back she echoed then on impulse she gave him another kiss he stared at her blinking in the earlymorning light that is a sacred promise etzel i will always come back ja i believe you he said dropping his head shyly but sometimes i think it might be better if i helped you with this he searched for a word this work that you do i know liebling she said resting her hand on his arm and feeling the warmth there maybe someday you will but for now there is too much i do not understand too much i must learn i could help you learn these things i think she smiled you are helping me you help me more than you can possibly know just by being here when i come back but maybe it is true etzel i need you to be here to be my rock and my anchor one day i will tell you all about my other work but for now it must be this way she held his eyes with her own willing him to understand all right of course meine liebste he gave her a small contrite smile if that is what you want you know i cannot refuse you anything she gave him a pat on the arm and i will try never to ask you for anything you would not willingly give mina moved to the door of the shop i am famished i could eat a horsenose to tail there is fresh bread and good sausage engelbert told her resuming his work of pulling down and spreading the heavy cloth awning i will join you when i have finished here mina paused in the kitchen on her way through the coffeehouse she greeted the staff and commended them to their labours then went upstairs to change her clothes and to check on her injured guest thanks to her cunning intervention and lady fayths help giles was not only alive he was safe in wilhelminas care left to burleigh she had no doubt giles would be pushing up daisies do you really want the city militia nosing around in your business she had asked what is that to you burleigh had asked bristling with belligerence knowing she skated on very thin ice she had shrugged nothing i dont know the man but i know the city bureaucracy hes been seen and questions will be asked if you wanted him dead you should have killed him when you had the chance its too late now she is right lady fayth chimed in turning to wilhelmina he had asked could you take care of him me she feigned surprise i have a peaceful life here i dont want any part of this burleigh stared at her so hard she thought he had worked out the ruse but then he pulled her aside and said i want him gone see to it why should i this is nothing to do with me you have friends in high places i wonder what these friends of yours would say if they knew the truth about you he gave her a sly knowing look what would happen to your peaceful life then you wouldnt oh i could think of all manner of things to tell them his eyes narrowed dangerously do you know what they do to witches here wilhelmina bit her lip lady fayth who had been watching this exchange said giles was just my uncles coachman he knows nothing please archelaeus let him go very well the black earl relented to wilhelmina he said i dont care how you do it but i want him gone disappeared i got it wilhelmina replied petulantly i dont like it but ill do it the two had left then consigning the wounded man to minas care the barely conscious giles had been carried to an upstairs bedroom and wilhelmina joined him there to assess the damage he had been shot through the upper shoulder the pistol ball passing through the muscle back to front nicking his collarbone and making a mess of his pectoral muscle but high enough to miss his lung and any major arteries the ball had exited the wound so she did not think he would suffer lead poisoning he might well die of septic infection however if she could not keep the wound clean to aid in this she fetched a generous portion of engelberts excellent schnapps in which she soaked giles bandages she also gave him a sip of laudanum to lull the pain and then as the wounded man drifted off to sleep she had gone out to bring kit home wilhelmina moved to stand beside the invalids bed she put a hand to his forehead and with some relief determined that there was as yet no fever the patient stirred at her touch and surfaced from his groggy sleep momentarily confused he started up pain instantly grabbed him his face contorted and he fell back once more with a groan easy there wilhelmina told him youre safe now take a deep breath she waited while he pulled himself together youve had a pretty narrow escape i gave you some laudanum and youve been asleep do you remember what happened he nodded on the pillow mr livingstone did he escape kit got away some of the townsfolk think they saw him jump into the river burleigh thinks kit might have swum to the other side theyve been looking for him there giles licked dry lips you will be thirsty ill get you some water is there much pain no my lady he gave his head a feeble shake liar ill get you some more laudanum it makes you groggy but it will numb the pain she put her palm to his forehead again dont worry youre going to get through this he bent his head to try to see his wound when that did not work he touched it gingerly with his fingertips the touch made him wince im no doctor mina said but i dont think there was very much internal damage youve got a broken collarbonethat seems to be the worst of it one of the better physicians in the city comes to the coffeehouse every day and ill have him look in on you when he arrives is burleigh still here dont you worry about him hes out chasing kit and wont be coming back here any time soon and mr livingstone will he come here soon she told him no i went to fetch him but he was not where i told him to be i dont know what happened probably he just wandered off ill go back and try again as soon as i can she turned to go but now ill bring you the laudanum and some water you should rest he nodded then as she left the room he said thank you miss wilhelmina youre not out of the woods so dont thank me yet you wont be completely safe until youre far away from here we have to get you well enough to travel where am i going home chapter in which confidences are frankly shared i never meant to betray them insisted lady haven fayth believe me i pray you wilhelmina regarded her doubtfully there was much about the young woman to admireher startling beauty her quick and ready mind her formidable strength of willbut there was also much about the russethaired lady that invited distrust when mina did not respond to this confidence lady fayth continued our circumstances were desperate and worse poor cosimo and my dear uncle henry were already deadthere was nothing whatever to be done for themand we were slowly dying of thirst when the black earl condescended to see us he arrived bearing an offer of survival gramercy i seized the opportunity forthwith lest it prove a chimera she pressed wilhelminas hand earnestly willing her to accept the truth of what she was saying there was no time to explain i was compelled to act at once she frowned remembering that awful day kit and giles were no useall full of affronted bravado and doomed honourthey were no use at all that much i do believe allowed wilhelmina but why did burleigh choose you why you and not kit we had a glancing acquaintance replied haven and then went on to explain how she had met the earl previously when he had come looking for sir henry at clarivaux it fell out that my father invited him to supper and i dined with them she paused her expression pleading in clearest hindsight i see that he was seeking to draw my uncle into his nefarious schemes but there was no hint of it then quite the contrary indeed so burleigh shows up in egypt and makes you an offer you cannot refuse is that it but you do see do you not replied lady fayth as if obstinacy alone could persuade there was simply no point in all of us dying in that tomb by remaining alive i perceived that i might return to rescue the others that i most heartily assure you was my sole hope and most fervent intent you meant to come back and free them said wilhelmina dubiously they were sitting in the grand imperial at a table in the rear of the house it was the middle of the afternoon the slow time of day the serving staff were waiting on the few patrons and etzel was napping upstairs it was my plan to return to the tomb as soon as i could slip away from the black earls knavish clutches then why didnt you why did you wait so long burleighs men answered haven readily the day after we left the tomb his lordships hired ruffians arrived in karnak with the report that the two young gentlemen had died the disease of the desert tomb had taken its dreadful toll they said i was devastated inconsolable of course of course to be sure i knew nothing else until i saw kit sitting in this very coffeehouse not two evenings ago she gazed across the table at wilhelmina suitably contrite and forthright what is more i can vouchsafe that lord burleigh was ignorant of any other outcome until he was apprised of their presence by his hirelings wilhelmina considered this it was all plausible and it fit with most of what she already knew she was inclined to accept that however selfserving lady fayth was telling the truthat least insofar as kit and giles were concerned about her involvement with burleigh mina still had doubts about the young womans sincerity the black earl was not best pleased with his minions haven continued they have been consigned to outer darkness with much weeping and gnashing of teethuntil such time as they can redeem themselves in his lordships sight then i suppose we all owe you a debt of gratitude my lady ventured wilhelmina pray not so she objected kit lost and poor giles woundedthat is hardly a result worthy of commendation or merit it could have been much much worse wilhelmina conceded thanks to your timely warning they were able to get away as to that she continued what was that package you gave kit just before he fled the coffeehouse package that little parcel mina described a small square with her fingers what was that it was a book a book thats all oh not just any book mind you haven said then lowered her voice it was the green book that is to say uncle henrys private journal of his investigations into ley leaping by ley leaping you mean haven nodded i believe you know well enough what i mean do i do you not i do i knew it lady fayth took a sip of coffee and resumed her confession the black earl knows about the green book he has read it in fact she allowed herself a sly smile that is to say he has read the portions i permitted him to read certain pages of sir henrys book i thought best to keep to myself she finished her coffee and pushed her cup aside do you have any idea where kit has gone across the river mina hedged thats what theyre saying no doubt hell turn up again once burleigh has gone yes well we must hope and pray he remains out of sight i do not expect the black earl will allow him to escape a third time it must have been a sight what will burleigh do now resume his search for the map replied haven what else can he do it is clear that neither cosimo nor uncle henry possessed the map it was not passed on to kit so cosimos portion remains to be found the young woman stood and brushed her hands down the front of her dress i must go his lordship will be wondering what has become of me she smiled nicely thank you for the coffee and for your confidence the knowledge that i have a secret ally in this fightand mark you it is a most desperate fightrenews my faith and courage she took wilhelminas hand may i call you my friend wilhelmina was taken aback by the question of course good i like that i have no other friend in which to confide she said then still gripping wilhelminas hand added the burden of the quest is ours now it falls to us to see it throughfor better or worse lady fayth took her leave and wilhelmina saw her to the coffeehouse door for better or worse echoed wilhelmina watching as her new ally sailed into the great market square were in it up to our eyeballs girlfriend be true to me and i will love you like a sister she said under her breath betray me and you will wish youd never been born chapter in which formal introductions are made t he trees all along the river turned spectacular shades of red orange and yellow and one morning kit arose to the sight of the leaves falling at once in a silent golden storm the next day rain came to the valley a chill north wind stripped the remaining leaves from the trees the clan gathered all the weapons and toolsthe stout spears and axes the scrapers and pounders the short stonebladed knivesand bundled up their skins and sleeping mats and coils of woven fibre rope and moved out this happened as so much else without any discussion that kit could detect they simply understood that today was moving day and everyone began packing kit pitched in by rolling the skins he used for sleeping and shouldering the spears he had learned that whatever he did by way of helping with the chores was always remarked on by the clan who more and more seemed to regard him as an exotic and unexpectedly useful pet when everything had been gathered big hunter led them back through the valley they followed the river downstream and owing to the mostly bare trees and shrubs kit could get a better sense of the size and shape of the great limestone gorge that was their home in places the grey curtains of stone rose to tower hundreds of feet above themnow so close the sheer walls cast the narrow gap in perpetual shadow now so far apart they were but a hazy backdrop rising above the forest at the narrow parts the river ran fast over a lumpy bed of welltumbled stones when the walls receded the water widened and deepened to a dark slowmoving river but whether quick and shallow or deep and slow the river wound and wiggled its way through mostly deciduous woodland they walked all morning and stopped to rest around midday in a grove on the edge of a spacious meadow of long grass now dry they picked and ate some late blackberries and lazed in the sun which shed a thin warmth from a dead white sky kit found a flat rock stretched himself out on it and napped until it was time to move on again they did not stop until the sun had dropped below the cliff tops and then they found a hollow near the river where they made a simple camp no fire was lit that night and kit discovered just how inadequate his clothing had become he wrapped himself in his sleeping skins but nevertheless spent most of the long dark hours shivering and wakeful he had known the day was coming when he would have to augment his wardrobe with furs such as the river city clan wore but he thought he would have a little more time to get himself properly outfitted they decamped early the next morning and trekked along the everdeepening river as they passed the trail that marked the ley kit tested the ley lamp yet again but received no response he had not expected any but nevertheless resumed the journey with a slightly heavier footstep than before pausing only to rest and drink the clan reached their destination as the sun sank below the canyon rim their new home was a massive limestone ledge carved out of the great curtain wall of the gorge perhaps fifty or sixty feet above the valley floor and overlooking a wide expanse of river kit could see why they had chosen it as a wintering place the ledge was south facing to catch the sun and owing to the generous overhang away from the wind and very dry farther back the ledge gave way to two chambers the smaller of which was a natural basin filled with water that seeped down through the stone from somewhere above aside from having to gather firewood and haul it up from the woods below it was perfect in all kit estimated they had travelled at least twenty miles from the first camp which meant they were fifteen or so miles from the ley that had brought him to the valleytoo far to just nip round and check it from time to time a fact he noted with some regret but soon he was too busy to worry about it for with their move to winter quarters the clan also set about stockpiling food and supplies for the winter the huntersboth males and females for kit had long since noted that hunting was not strictly a guysonly pursuithad gone out only every third or fourth day when they were back at river city now they went out every day leaving before sunrise and coming home around midday the hunt had taken on a sense of seriousness and purpose previously lacking the older nonhunting females likewise busied themselves with gathering roots and berries preparing furs and skins weaving rope and storing nuts and other odds and ends they would need for the long cold season ahead gradually they transformed the bare rock ledge into something resembling a utopia as envisaged by a band of survivalist gypsies at first kit stayed in camp and watched the little ones so their elders could hunt and gather kit had yet to figure out the parentage of the young ones since none of the elders seemed to take any proprietary interest in any particular individual all treated each and every one with alike deference and regard by way of helping out kit was content to play babysitter inasmuch as it allowed him to spend some time getting to grips with sir henrys bookas he had been in his idle moments ever since joining the clan while he read the youngsters played around his feet the littlest of the lot accepted him as a natural part of their world and responded to him as they would to any other elder the slightly older children seemed more aware of his otherness and were shy around him but that changed the day kit began to learn their language the adults had trooped off leaving him in charge as had become the custom this time kit noticed that some of the older tykes had begun vocalising to the younger ones repeating the same sounds over and over again which the infants imitated so kit joined in the game and was soon enrolled in this rudimentary language class the clan thought this a smashing good game and vied with each other to teach him sounds when he had mastered the basics one of the older children brought him a stone and put it in his hand kit held it up what he said to his amazement the child paused and very clearly replied tok tok said kit he put down the stone and picked up another pebble and held it in the palm of his hand tok the young one tapped the pebble repeating the word just to see if he understood correctly kit tossed the pebble away and then patted the smooth stone surface of the limestone ledge on which they sat what again the same word was repeated tok and kit had effectively doubled his stone age vocabulary he now knew the word for stone to add to his mental dictionary beside the word for bear next they tried water which turned out to be simply nah nah asked kit raising his eyebrows in imitation of their own inquisitive expressions he poured water from the gourd back into the catchment pool then put in his hand nah he shook off the water from his fingers nah said his small teacher pointing at the pool then dipping his own hand and shaking it then cupping his hand he slurped up some water ena the lesson continued until the elders began to return by which time kit had a dozen fresh words he was polishing his new acquisition so that he could show it off to the elders when they gathered that evening but he was not given the chance as soon as the first adults appeared his small teacher in full view of everyone picked up a stone and presented it to kit with an expression of such keen anticipation kit could not help laughing tok he declared the effect was stunningas if he had set off a roman candle or pulled a rabbit out of the hat everyone gathered around and before he knew it they were all offering him rocks and pebbles just to hear him say the word he moved on to demonstrate his mastery of the word for water and for drinking and wood and fire hand leg arm and the rest of the few he had learned then as he had their rapt attention he placed the flat of his hand on his chest and said kit his gesture was met with baffled silence he repeated the gesture and said his name once more the clansmen regarded him with quizzical expressions their heavy brows furrowed their broad faces pinched kit began thumping his chest and saying his name slowly clearly willing them to understand his repeated attempts failed to gain any result until big hunter stepped forward and in a fair imitation of kit put his own hand on his chest and in a voice that seemed to come from somewhere deep underground said dardok kit repeated the word to himself then pointed to big hunter and said dardok then with the same gesture he indicated himself and said his own name once more big hunter drew himself up and with evident pride said kit the fact that it came out more like ghidt was easily overlooked in the moment as dardoks success brought coos of amazed delight all around the rest of the clan began chanting his name kit revelled in the fact that he had successfully crossed a communication divide he could teach them as well as learn to be sure they were only getting started a forthright young female shoved in made the chestpointing gesture and repeated kits name then placing a hand to herself uttered with remarkable enunciation neek kit swiftly mastered this name and was instantly inundated by the entire clan who pressed forward all together each one speaking a name and demanding kits repeated reply in the days that followed alongside his study of the green book some portion of each day was devoted to learning new words and when kit was not adding to his word store he was practising the ones he had already learned in this way he gradually built up a working vocabulary and with it a sense of how the river city clan saw the world among themselves they still did not speak all that much but around him they became regular chatterboxes the difference was stark and kit wondered about ituntil the obvious explanation occurred to him they needed very little speech because they had this strange telepathy or whatever it was that allowed them to know what others were thinking among clan members they communicated just fine without any speech at all it was only kit who was forced to vocalise to make himself understood confirmation of this fact was conclusively demonstrated by the arrival of visitors a few days later the weather had been growing steadily colder and wetter the days shorter more often than not they awoke in the morning to frost on the ground nestled in their rockledge fortress however they remained dry and reasonably warm kit was sewing a handsome new suit of furdeer and rabbit mostlywhich with patience and dogged perseverance he was patching together using the flint knife bone needle and hemp thread they had given him he was putting the finishing touches on a feature of which he was inordinately proud a roomy inner pocket designed to hold minas ley lamp and sir henrys book and keep them safe the clan was lolling around the fire at the rim of the ledge when suddenly dardok stood up and gazed off into the foggy treetops along the river instantly four others joined his survey of the valley below the rest of the clansmen dropped what they were doing and fell absolutely silent an atmosphere of intense anxiety descended over the camp again not a word or sign passed among them but all were wary the tension swirling around them like the sinewy coils of a serpent kit stood too and quietly crept to the rim of the ledge to see if he could discover what had alerted the others a minute or two eked by and then he heard a sound he had heard every day since coming to the winter quarters heavy feet on the rocky trail leading to the ledge someone was coming kit waited every sense prickling bracing himself for a fight who was it were they under attack he cast a hasty glance around for the nearest weapon then as one the clan relaxed although dardok still stood watching the path below the palpable sense of imminent danger simply melted away something had changed but what before kit could determine what had happened to alter the mood he saw movement on the path leading up to the ledge and a moment later their visitors arrived a group of fifteenseven females five males and the rest young ones of various ages and sizes from the enthusiastic welcome that commenced kit reckoned the group was well known to the river city folk in fact seeing how naturally the newcomers were accepted and how easily they insinuated themselves into the life of the group kit began to think that perhaps they were not merely visitors but part of the same extended valley clan then the newcomers saw kit and he was subjected to the inevitable examination with much murmuring touching and rubbing of his skin and scruffy beard they appeared fascinated by the colour and texture of his pale skin and fine curly hair and were amused by his thin frame short arms narrow shoulders and curious upright posture the round of buffeting had no sooner concluded than a second group of visitors arrivedfour sturdy males bearing a fifth on a litter made of birch poles and skins this fifth male was the oldest kit had seen so far with wispy grey hair and a long white beard and a face so ancient and wrinkled that wrapped chin to ankles in hides and furs he looked positively mummified the bearers carefully lowered the bier to the ground and several of the nearer clan members helped him to his feet as soon as he was upright he waved off his aides and shuffled forward with unsteady steps to meet kit at his approach kit became aware of a tingling sensation at the base of his skull time seemed to slowthe ordinary flow dwindled down to a mere trickle and pooled around them moreover kit was aware of a very strange and powerful emotionone he had only ever felt once before in his life as a youngster kit had been introduced to what was reputed to be the oldest tree in englanda massive gnarled tanglerooted thing called the marton oak which had survived almost years of earthly life kit remembered standing there beneath the twilight canopy of its enormous spreading boughs among roots that were as big as he was and feeling an almost supernatural force that gave him to know that he was in the presence of a living entity of such peace and gentleness and strength of spirit that it inhabited a whole other plane of existence and beside which he was as small and notional as a clod of dirt in the presence of the old one kit felt that way again dwarfed by a spirit not only far older and wiser but also far larger and more powerful than any he had ever encountered and like that ancient oak the old man was unutterably regal a king of his kind once more kit was that young boy standing in the shadow of a vastly superior entity and knowing to his very pith and core how very insignificant he was yet he felt no fear a boundless and placid acceptance seemed to emanate from the aged being before him and kit understood that despite the yawning abyss between them he had nothing to fear the ancient one examined kit slowly head to toe and kit saw that while one of the old ones eyes was bright and piercing keen the other was clouded and almost opaque upon concluding his examination the aged chieftain raised his head and fixed kit with an ardent determined look and kit was aware that this was an attempt at communication he could feel it as a physical force of considerable intensity kit beguiled by the power and directness of the approach simply opened himself to it the result was staggering what kind of creature are you the question struck him like a closed fist and kit instinctively took a quick backwards step to recover his equilibrium it took a second before kit realised that the question had not been spoken aloud moreover it had not in fact used words at all i am a man kit blurted even though he knew this would not be understood but he was wrong in this assumption maan echoed the disembodied voice in his head clear as a bell and distinct from his own thought with its own timbre and texture and cadence the unspoken voice of the ancient one took shape and the unprecedented interview commenced maan kits word for himself was then combined with the idea of being or existing is then kit got a sense of growing things action breathing change living life inextricably entwined with something tangible yet amorphous an animating fire present yet hidden within living soul the question as it entered kits mind was are you man a living soul oh yes yes indeed i ami have a soul kit assured him speaking aloud he suspected it was probably unnecessary but it was just easier to vocalise his thoughts goodness the feeling of fullness and rightness satisfaction flowed from the ancient one along with an awareness of a souls unique value and place in the world kits instant interpretation of these interconnected conceptual traces came out as that is good creatures with souls are rare rare yes the chief gave a grunt of satisfaction the next thought that formed in kits consciousness was the recognition of a long and varied experience allied with surprise at a sudden and startling uniqueness the sense kit made of it was we have seen many things but never one like you i have not seen any like you kit replied next kit received what he interpreted as a sort of formal introduction into his mind poured a complicated and much mingled concept an association of metaphors pure animal strength and courage allied with majestic dominancea lion perhapsand this was combined with a sense of longevitylike a yew tree or a mountainand lastly the concept of serenity as applied to a calm deep freshwater lake of immense size and limitless depths all this then was somehow combined and united in an affirmation of individual personhoodthe being standing right in front of him in fact the ancient one then with a delicacy of gesture that kit found endearing the old chieftain placed a thick hand over his heart and said aloud enul there was no question but that this was the ancient ones name and kit repeated it at once saying i am pleased to meet you enul he lowered his head in a little bowan automatic response but one kit felt appropriate to the situationand received a grunt of satisfaction in reply the next question flowed into kits mind already formed where is your home my home is far from here was how kit chose to answer to say more would have been unnecessary and probably impossible anyway the next two questions followed so quickly in succession they formed a single inquiry why are you alone are you cast out from your clan no noi am not an outcast kit hastened to assure him i am alone because i am lost i was travelling and became lost he did not know if the concept of travelling would translate my clanmy people do not know i am here a feeling of sympathetic sorrow flowed in inundating waves to kitempathetic commiseration mingled with a sense of the wrongness of such a state as kit described that is bad you possessive fellow beings your people kit decided strong imperative must outpouring of grief and anxiety mourn an empty place absence your people must mourn your absence some of them do i suppose admitted kit lamely the ancient one gave another grunt of satisfaction and then peering deep into kits eyes expressed a largess of generosity and inclusive fellowship kit could only describe as a feeling of welcome to a long lost and much loved son it felt as if he was being adopted into the clan it felt as if he was coming home the intensity of the emotion so directly conveyed took his breath away kit could not speak for the sudden stirring of his own longsuppressed feelings tears welled in his eyes and he began to weep they were tears of grief for his own inadequacy his frailty his shrunken and limited intelligence his woeful dependency he wept hot miserable tears and with the weeping came a kind of solace a comfort like that of a friendly hand reached out to steady a tottering child as if in response to his misery he sensed an empathy and understanding there was nothing superior in it or condemning into his soul flowed simply acceptance when kit found his voice again all he could say was thank you chapter in which the future is a dream r iver city clan remained encamped on the stone ledge as winter deepened across the valley a few days after the arrival of the new clan members kit noticed that at daybreak each morning all the younger males left the warmth and shelter of the rock ledge and disappeared into the wood they returned an hour or so before sunset but try as he might he received no answer to his admittedly clumsy attempts to find out what they were doing very obviously they were not huntingdardok and two of the women continued their hunting and scavenging forays on suitable days as they had since coming to the winter shelter whatever they were up to it was not about providing food for the tribe finally when kit had become absolutely eaten up with curiosity he went to enul who since his arrival had hived himself up in robes and furs at the far side of the ledge where he spent his days overlooking the fogbound river far below i am sorry to bother you enul kit said announcing his presence with a polite cough he was learning when speaking to clansmen to try to make simple declarations while holding the images or concepts at issue forcefully in his mind the old one stirred and turned a bright eye on kit be welcome here ghidt came into kits consciousness the response surprised kit not because it was unusual in itself but because he had not given his name to the clan elder or heard anyone else speak it aloud in his presence he must have picked it up from one of the others by way of the mental radio they all shared i have come with a question kit said settling in beside the old chieftain the young men he continued picturing the ones he meant as they had appeared that morning when he saw them leave the camp where do they go what do they do all day kit received back an image of the young males along with a sense of doing of work of dedicated labour they make with purpose was how he interpreted the concept along with this came the notion of bestowal of presentation of offering allied to the personal designation en ul linking all this together kit tried out this interpretation they are making a gift for you this received the standard grunt kit associated with satisfactiona yes the old one held kits gaze in his own and with a slow deliberate action placed the flat of his palm on kits forehead the touch was rough and heavy but warm instantly into kits mind came the image of a sort of house or shelter of extraordinary designthe most unusual dwelling kit had ever seen a house made all of bone they are making a house of bones kit said half in surprise half in question for you again the grunt of satisfaction as enul removed his hand they sat for a moment in silence then kit received the sensation he had come to associate with the interrogativea questionand with it the concept of sight or seeing do i want to see it he said aloud yes he said quickly i would see it e li the old one said his voice low as a rumble of thunder and into kits mind came the image of sunlight flooding the horizon allied with the concept of something unseen yet present along with expectation bordering on certainty the future this kept him occupied for some little while tomorrow kit guessed holding in his mind the image of a rising sunthe new day that would be unh grunted enul the day that is soon becoming i will go with the young ones tomorrow he confirmed picturing himself leaving with the group as they went out the next morning unh grumbled the old chief again the next morning when the young males rose and made ready to departarraying themselves with skins worn like capes and wrapping their feet against the snow and coldkit did likewise joining them in their preparations there were four of them this morning and they acknowledged his presence with sniffs and nods and the leadera large male kit had begun calling thag for no particular reason other than he bore an uncanny resemblance to a cartoon character kit knewpatted him about the head and shoulders in a gesture kit had come to understand as a sign of friendly greeting adults often used the same behaviour with the children as soon as kit was ready they picked up their stout stonebladed spears and set off the track they followed down into the valley was well trod now the shindeep snow crushed down by the passing of many feet over the last few days and it squeaked as they walked once again kit marvelled at the easy grace of the big creatures as they strode along the trail led down to a bluff only a few dozen yards above the river the ice at the edges caught the light of the rising sun and gleamed a few more days of such cold and kit would not be surprised to see it frozen over entirely they paused to rest a few moments and to listen and scent the air at first kit wondered about this but it came to him that this behaviour was a simple defensive action they were making certain they were not being stalked by one of the large predators that roamed the valleya lion say or wolves but this day they were not to be challenged so they moved on in a little while the narrow track began to rise and soon they were walking next to the sheer limestone curtain kit enjoyed the exertion it felt good to stir the blood feel the cold air in his lungs and move around after lolling around camp silent as shadows save for the squeak of their feet on the crisp snow they moved up and up following the contours of the undulating wall the trail grew narrow and steep and soon they had climbed out of the valley altogether and onto the thickwooded plain above thag paused at the rim of the gorge to scent the cold air and listen the forest stretched before them draped in heavy blankets of snow softening all sound to a muted hush from somewhere in the dark woods depths kit heard the keening cry of a hunting hawk and the soft plipplop of snow dropping from branches assured that there was no danger the group continued following the deeply entrenched trail into the wood here and there kit spied animal tracks crossing the trail the small traces of mice and rabbits and the larger tracks of ferret marmot and some of the smaller antelopelike animals once he saw what must have been the tracks of one of the larger predators they were trying to avoideither lion or wolf he could not tell but his companions would know and they did not seem to pay them any mind if not for the ribbon of beatendown snow kit would have quickly lost his way the wood was dark and wreathed in hoarfrost and frozen mist abruptly they arrived at a crease in the landa little canyon formed by a tributary that carried spring melt and summer rain into the larger valley here the canyon formed a cliff with a sheer drop of fifty or sixty feet the group did not linger at the edge but continued along the rim for a way until they came to a defile leading down to the bottom of the dry streambed they followed the defile as it curved around and back to the cliff and there directly below the sheer drop lay a fantastic heap of bones devoid of flesh and partially covered with snow they made a stark whiteonwhite mound at the bottom of the streambed all at once kit understood what he was looking at a crude but brutally efficient method of hunting that consisted of driving the fleeing prey over a cliff where they would either be killed by the fall or injured and finished off by the hunters judging by the massive tangle of carcasses the river city clan had been using this kill zone for some considerable time there were bones of all kinds some big as dinosaur bonesthough kit was fairly certain there were none of those around mammoths then or mastodons maybe were those the sameall jumbled together with those of elk deer and antelope and some that looked like they might have come from giant oxen or buffalodefinitely bovine in natureand even some from horses without any discussionthere never was any in factthe clansmen began dragging the larger bones from the heap disentangling them and reforming them into a smaller more ordered heap why some bones were chosen and others discarded kit could not readily tell but he joined in all the same the work party soon sorted out a number of sizeable piles then using the ropes made of braided hemp they had brought with them they bound the bones into bundles these unwieldy collections were then heaved onto their shoulders and muscled up out of the defile when all the bones had been trundled up out of the graveyard each clansman hefted a bundle or two onto his back and trudged off into the wood once more kit could only manage to lift the smaller bundle he himself had made but picked that up and followed his companions walking single file into the dark snowclotted forest and to a clearing that was suspiciously circular in naturean almost perfect circle which kit concluded had been made somehow by the clan he could not determine how they could have achieved this lacking anything but simple stone axes yet here it was an almost perfect circle sixty feet or so in diameter surrounded by tall pines and larches but offering a clear and unobstructed view of the sky overhead and in the precise centre of the clearing the bone house kit recognised it at once as the dwelling made of bone that enul had pictured for hima simple moundshaped hut formed of the interlocked skeletons of all manner of animals there were no windows as such and but a single low tunnel for a door over which hung the entire skull of a giant elk with splayed antlers big as palm branches the lintels of this door were solid ivory in the form of two enormous curving mammoth tusks more elephant tusks lined the foundation of the house whose framework was made up of the most fantastical conglomeration of skeletal fragments pelvises spines leg bones vertebrae and rib bones by the score there were skulls from more than a dozen different creaturesdeer of several kinds as well as bison aurochs and horses sheep and antelope what looked like dog or wolf and even that of a horned rhinoceros these were the ones kit thought he recognised but there were as many more that he could not readily identify taken as a whole the bizarre structure possessed a distinctly eerie alien air the work party began untying their bundles and fitting the bones they had brought into chinks and gaps in the structure and kit imitated their example finding places to work in what he had brought they laboured with purpose and in silence when one or the other got thirsty he would go outside the clearing to eat handfuls of snow then return to continue working when the last bone from the bundles had been placed it was back to the kill zone for another load three more trips to the bone heap for materials brought them to the end of their labours the short winter day was hastening on and the workers were growing hungryat least kit was starving and he imagined the clansmen who appeared to require more than twice as much to keep them going must have been ready to eat the trees thag stood back coiling his hemp rope and regarding the bone house his big shaggy head held to one side in the precise manner of a carpenter inspecting his handiwork it was such a classic pose kit smiled to see it thag gave a grunt that signified satisfaction and turned away now that the official verdict had been received the others grunted too and the group departed making their long way back through the forest the returning labourers ate a hearty meal and exhausted with the good fatigue of useful work went to sleep kit drifted off too but if he imagined a restful day to follow he was mistaken for just before sunrise he was awakened by a touch on his shoulder he opened his eyes to see enul crouching beside him into his mind came a possessive urging he understood as attend me the old chief turned away and kit followed moving silently through the sleeping camp the nights fire had burned to embers and the sky still held a sprinkling of stars sharp as ice crystals in the cold cold heavens they picked their way carefully down from the ledge and found the wellmarked trail leading up out of the valley within a few minutes of leaving the settlement kit realised their destination was the bone house and for one who had been carried into the camp the aged enul surprised kit with his stamina they paused only twice to rest and catch their breathonce halfway up the trail and once at the top of the gorgeand arrived in the forest clearing as the sun rose above the trees in the thin winter light the strange edifice glowed with a pale and alien pallora white mound set in a snowwhite fieldtaking on a ghostly almost ethereal aspect as if constructed not of bones but of the mammalian spirits of the creatures themselves a profound apprehension crept like the stealthy cold into kits soul this curious shelter had been erected for a purpose and it was for that purpose they had come enul turned to him and gazing into kits eyes willed him to understand kit received an impression of immense importance of an unfathomable weight of consequence a significance of unimaginable magnitudeas if whole worlds of significance converged in this place there was no single word for it but the force of the concept struck him with an urgency that was as powerful as hunger and thirst kit trying hard to understand was overwhelmed by the thought that had been conveyed why have we come here he asked aloud the old one tilted back his head and looked at the pale white sky for a moment then returning his gaze to kit breathed into kits mind the image of living things of many kindsthe creatures of the forest the entire forest itself whole stone age tribescombined with a feeling of swimming against the strong flow of the river or struggling against a powerful grinding uncompromising force bent on mindless destruction survival their presence at the bone house had something to do with the survival of themselves and their world was how kit explained it to himself and although he could not see how this was so he did not doubt enuls sincerity as soon as this thought had passed through kits mind the ancient chieftain turned and walked to the entrance of the bone house he paused at the low doorway and stood for a moment then raised his hand and placed the palm on the forehead of the skull of the giant elk and bowed his own head in a gesture kit had never seen one of them make before then bending low he entered the bone hut beckoning kit to follow inside the bones formed a domeshaped room of weird undulating design lit only by the watery winter daylight that found its way through the chinks and crevices of the interlocking bones the floor was packed snow over which pine branches had been spread and these piled with skins and furs kit saw that a small cache of fooddried meat and berriesand little heaps of snow for water had been set aside enul crawled in and sat himself crosslegged in the centre of the room he looked around and gave a grunt of satisfaction as if approving of the finished product then when kit had sat down across from him he addressed himself to conveying what was about to happen in imitation of the old one kit crossed his legs and pulled furs around him as into his mind came the image of himself asleepas seen by one of the clan perhapsand then immediately a sort of curious sensation of flying of actually having wings and soaring high on the wind dreaming this thought met with a satisfied grunt and instantly kit felt once again the immense bottomless ocean of consequenceonly this time it was an ocean a vast tidal stream in endless flux time dreaming time kit said aloud although strictly speaking this did not make any sense to him at all the mental contact faded evaporating into the ether and enul closed his eyes his breathing altered his body relaxed and soon kit realised that the old one was asleep he waited when nothing more happened kit crept from the bone house and went out to the perimeter of the circle to relieve himself the day was growing blustery a sharp wind rising out of the north was soughing through the tall pines all around the pale sky was darker now with heavy snowladen clouds there was a storm on the way he could smell the metallic tang on the air they would have to go back to the shelter of the rock ledge soon but he was reluctant to disturb the ancient ones sleep kit did not know what to do but one thing was certainhe did not care to be out in the forest alone it was not safe kit returned to the bone house enul was if possible even more deeply asleep than before kit settled down to wait but after what seemed like an age of doing nothing more than listening to the old chieftains deep and regular breathing he grew too anxious to put off leaving any longer he took the furs he had been using and wrapped those around enuls body wishing his sleeping companion well he departed running jogging floundering through the snow kit scrambled back to the safety of the valley encampment arriving as the last light faded into twilight mist the river city clan greeted his return with grunts of recognition and seemed to accept his absence as a matter of little interest kit sought out dardok thinking to gain an explanation of what had taken place that day holding an image of the bone house firmly in mind he said enul sleeps there this appeared to be understoodas least so far as kit could discernfor it met with a snort of gruff acknowledgement he says he is dreaming time kit continued pushing his luck is that so dardoks expression grew opaque and he grumbled low in his throata sign of dissatisfaction and that was that the discussion went no further it confirmed what kit already knew whatever faculty enul possessed that allowed him to communicate with kit the others did not have it or at least not to the same degree later kit ate and unaccountably tired from his exertions crawled off to sleep in his customary place but sleep eluded him for a long time he lay pondering the possible meaning of the concept dreaming time what could it mean wrapped in fur against the cold kit stared past the glowing red embers of the dying fire into the fathomless sea of darkness beyond as into a daunting future his mind filled with the strangeness and wonder of the bone house conjured a vision he saw a full moon rising over a high windswept plain its silvery light illuminating a curving slice of river cradled in a shallow bowl of a valley the great round moon poured down its light as it passed overhead and the stars wheeled slowly in the sky until it sank again below the western horizon all was dark then but only for a moment before kit could blink the moon rose again faster this time passing over the bend in the river once more the moon soared and sank only to repeat the process again and yet again with every repetition the moon flew faster its rising and setting merging into a single fluid tracery of light a shining arc across the limitless star field this bright arc widened expanding into a luminous band encircling the wandering earth out on the plain he saw a mountain rising in the distance white and ghostly in the silver moonlight the mountain rose higher and kit saw that it was moving slowly inexorably following the course of the river which now ran with chunks of ice with the mountain came snow kit could see the drifts deepening over the landscape spreading merging covering the land covering the rocks and trees filling the valley covering everything and still the snow fellas if the inexhaustible vaults of winter had opened and poured out their unending store upon the world below and all the while the mountain lurched nearer a glacier on the move growing even as it came driving all before it trees rocks boulders entire hills on and on it came tearing grinding with the low rumble of constant thunder annihilating everything that fell beneath the massive wall of its leading edge gouging the land carving deep into the soft soil of the river valley its stupendous weight forming new hills on either side shaping landscapes as it passed and still the ice mountain grew spreading as it came it stretched now from horizon to horizon gathering cold draining the rivers lowering the seas leaching moisture from all it touched from the very atmosphere until the air became dry and brittle and still it grew shimmering with a terrible majesty beneath the brilliant band of light that was the everracing moon a continent of ice on the move pushing up mountains slicing out canyons tilting the earth with its passing more images wheeled before kits unblinking eyes an endless line of enormous woolly mammoths staggering across a plain drifted high with windwhipped snow fire falling from the sky in burning chunks the size of boulders setting the hills ablaze an ocean locked tight its waves thrashed into hard motionless peaks bony carcasses of starved creatures piled in a frozen bog a bear on its hind legs gnawing at the bark of a tree a man woman and two infant children dressed in wolf skin and forever huddled in a frozen embrace a high mountain pass leading down to lands yet green lands that had not felt the bitter sting of killing cold and more faster and faster until one image could not be distinguished from another reeling from what he had seen kit closed his eyes but the images persisted flickering through his consciousness in a mist of motion and light fusing swirling all detail muted and lost merging into a dense luminous fog that resolved into the milky way the measureless star path of the galaxy the shining mist slowly dissipated until at last it was swallowed in the end by the eternal darkness of empty space chapter in which a remedy is pursued d azed and drained kit waited for the dawn to lighten the sky to return to the bone house if the remedy for his bewildered state could be found he imagined it might be there when the first faint traces of daylight gave texture to the winter landscape below the rock shelter kit rose stepped carefully over the sleeping bodies around him and stole down the narrow trail leading into the valley and ultimately up to the high woodland above fresh snow had fallen in the night and he ploughed through the drifts moving with an urgency born of a dreamtroubled night he reached the woodland on the plateau above the valley and alert to lurking predators hurried through the frigid winterbound forest to the clearing it was farther than he remembered impatience drove him to greater haste until he burst into the circle of standing trees to see the tangled mound of chalky snowcovered bones standing in the centre of the clearing pale and spectral in the dead winter light the renewed sight of that singular structure woven of ivory horn and bone brought kit up short he halted then approached more slowly circling the bone house to reach the low entrance now almost hidden by snow kit dropped to his knees and crawled inside enul was there and in much the same position as kit had left him the previous day so still and silent he might have been dead kit held his breath until he heard the long low sigh of the sleeper then relaxed and settled into his place in the thin light filtering through the latticework of interwoven bones he saw that some of the food had been eaten and two of the little piles of snow were gone enul had taken nourishment at least once then kit took comfort from that whatever the old chieftain was doing it did not involve starving to death thinking of this he wished he had brought along something for himself to eat he considered helping himself to some of the sleepers cache but immediately decided against it restrained by the potent feeling that doing so would violate some taboo he pulled some of the furs around him and made himself comfortable now that he was here he wondered why he had rushed so it had seemed important but now he could not think why he settled back to wait some while laterit might have been a few hours it might have been only a momenthe could no longer be certain how to measure times elapse in the presence of enul and his dreaming time took on an elastic quality and seemed not to behave properly then again since coming to the valley kits internal clock had ceased to function in the usual way however it was kit had the sensation of having sat in the bone house for hours if not days and was beginning to feel lightheaded from hunger he reached out for a handful of snow and filled his mouth letting the frosty crystals melt and run down his throat it felt good and it was as he stretched for another handful that he felt a warmth begin to pulse near his heart placing a hand to his chest he traced the smooth bulk of the ley lamp then dug into the inner pocket of his roughmade robe and brought out the brass device immediately dropping it in the snow where it shone a bright incandescent blue scooping it up he brushed off the snow and gazed at the glowing instrument the little row of lights on its face filled the dim interior of the bone house with a brilliant indigo radiance brighter than ever before and which pulsed slowly rhythmically steadilylike a long slow heartbeat his skin tingled with the telltale sign of a nearby ley the small hairs on the back of his neck stood up the air inside the house of bone crackled with pent energy as if building to a lightning strike holding the ley lamp before him kit rose he made to step over elul in his dreaming trance but as his raised foot touched down he plunged through the floor of the bone house the snowpacked floor simply gave way and kit was suddenly tumbling through space down and down and down he plunged instinctively he curled himself into a ball and leaned sideways to take the force of the fall on his hip but the expected impact did not come and he continued to fall the shadowy light of the bone house swiftly faded to a pale point far above and darkness closed over and around him the light of the ley lamp was all that he could see and then that too slowly faded leaving him in a darkness that was so close and pervasive it was more like a cloak or second skin than the emptiness of the void the air condensed becoming so thick and close it could be taken only in gulps oddly kit was not afraid or if he had been the fear shrivelled away so swiftly it left no impression he did not seem to be falling anymore but flying without any orienting markers kit could not tell where he was going nor how fast yet the sensation of moving at extreme speed over inexhaustible distances persisted again time shrank away to insignificance kit imagined he could actually feel it peeling away from him layer by layer how long this lasted he could not say a moment the length of time it took for the thought to enter his consciousness and leave again an entire lifetime more an age an eon an eternity nothing seemed adequate to explain his current state past and future melted together mingled mixed became one until there was only the unchanging present moment so far as he could tell he might exist like this forever living in a timeless voida neverending now kit perceived that though this void might be empty of time it was nevertheless full of possibility anything could happen might happen might have already happenedanything he could think might suddenly take form might gain existence from his thought alone this insight if that is what it was brought a sobering realisation that the merest whim might bring a whole world into existence a world replete with living creatures whose lives were suddenly called into being by a single careless thought kit shrank from the horrific responsibility and instead turned his attention to his journey the sensation of travelling remained strong kit knew he was covering heroic distances and while it seemed likely this could go on without end he did have the feeling that a destination awaited again the thought had no sooner formed than kit sensed he was arriving between one heartbeat and the next the allpervading darkness began to thin becoming ever more transparent spots appeared before his eyes tiny pinpricks of light suddenly they were everywhereshimmering glittering winking in and out of existence like sparks from exploding fireworks they rippled through the void in waves all around him some passing through him faster and faster they came kit became aware of a soundthe rush and wash of the ocean surf crashing onto the shore suddenly he was there his arrival happened so fast he had no time to brace himself one moment he was sailing through space and the next he was scrambling on hands and knees over an expanse of sand there was water behind him and a bank of green rising before him in fact he comprehended now that his clothes were wethad he emerged from the sea if so he could not remember the sensation of swift downward movement was still so strong it drove out all else he closed his eyes and drew deep calming breaths into his lungs until the unsettling sense of falling ceased he raised his head to look around a vista of fine white sand stretched away on either side as far as he could see a perfect beach washed by the cool waters of a turquoise ocean the sun was warm on his back and the air balmy a gentle seaward breeze wafted over him before him lay a land of shining green and goldthe deep vivid emerald greens of the tropics and the bright yellows of exotic flowers in reckless profusion giant ferns and date palms poked above the verdure spreading into a sky so blue it sent an ache through kit to see it this is heaven he thought or at least someones idea of paradise gathering his feet under him kit stood and without any particular aim began to walk up the sloping strand towards the forest as he stepped from the sandy verge onto soft grass he saw that his feet were on a welltrod path it felt good to move under his own power again so kit followed the trail as it wound its way into the jungle the farther he went the more luxurious the foliage becameextravagant in the variety of colours and shapes all different all delightful to the eye trees with leaves shaped like pale limecoloured stars like rusty fans like golden feathers fronds like sawtooth blades like delicate lace flowers like drifts of jewels like multicoloured clouds like frieze works splashed with an exuberant painters brush and more many of the trees shrubs and plants bore fruitin globes in clusters in clutches and bunches and bundlesall in riotous abundance everything he saw was so intensely real so manifestly present it seemed to vibrate to palpitate with the animating force of life a force so strong it leaked shimmering into the very air he breathed the entire forest resonated to a sound kit could not hear a sound just beyond the threshold of hearing like the final triumphant chord of a symphonyonly he had entered the concert hall too late to hear the music still the majestic waves of what must have been a glorious sound lingered trembling in the air the farther he walked the higher grew the trees he passed through sundappled shade and cool shadow content to follow the path wherever it led until the trees thinned abruptly and he found himself standing in a wide clearing before a lake of what looked like glass crystal no not glassbut not water either intrigued kit stepped closer and knelt down to examine it more closely translucent glimmering fluid yet giving off a faint milky glow a pool of liquid light as impossible as that might have been anywhere else here in this place it felt natural and right kit reached out a hand to touch the gently gleaming substance and just as his fingers were about to dip beneath the surface he heard a rustling in the nearby leaves and branches pulling back his hand he shrank away from the edge of the pool to watch the foliage on the bank of the pond shuddered and thrashed a moment later the fronds of the tree ferns parted and out stepped a man of middle height and compact frame dark hair and eyes the shadow of a beard on his jaw he was dressed in a loose white shirt and dark trousers boots and belt all this kit noticed as a sort of afterthought because his attention was wholly absorbed in the burden the man carried the limp and lifeless body of a young woman with long black hair and an oval face and almond eyes kits first thought was that the woman was asleep she was dressed in a long gown of thin white stuff crushed and rumpled and stained at the neck and under the arms as if sweat had dried there over time then kit observed the ghastly tinge of the womans flesh ashen and waxy the sick pallor of the grave no living human had flesh like that at a glance kit knew that she was dead the man his face set in a grimace of determination tightened his grip on the body in his armsas if gathering his strength for a superhuman effortthen steadying himself the man took a purposeful stride towards the pool of liquid light his first step took him to the brink his next step carried him into the pond and up to his shins another stride and he was in to his knees the opalescent liquid swirled around him thick and glutinous as honey radiance scattering in waves across the surface disturbed by the mans measured plunge into the pool the darkhaired fellow waded farther sinking deeper into the strange liquid now lapping around his shoulders swallowing the corpse he clutched so tightly in his arms another step and the man and dead woman sank beneath the surface without a sound kit watched the place where they had disappeared it was marked by rings of shimmering light these rings spread in waves across the pool and were soon lapping at kits feet but something else was happening the place where the couple had sunk from view was now glowing with a rosy golden hue this luminescence grew and spread until the entire pond was the colour of heated bronze glowing fresh from the crucible kit watched fascinated as a dome of light appeared a great bubble rising from the liquid light in the centre of this dome emerged the head and shoulders of the man rising once more he still clutched the body of the woman close to his chest but where before she had been a limp dead weight in his arms now she clung to him her arms clasped around his neck her face was buried in the hollow of his throat as he carried her alive from the pool her skin gleaming with the sheen of living light no longer bore the taint of the grave kit would have stayed to see the couple reunited but the tenderness with which the man knelt to lay his lady down and cupped a hand to her face gave kit to know that this moment was for the two of them alone he backed away from the edge of the pool and as he turned to leave cast a last backwards glance across the pond to see that the man standing once more had removed his shirt to make a pillow for the young womans head the mans torso was tattooed with a spray of tiny blue symbolsdozens of themsymbols he had seen before the man who is map breathed kit at the well of souls epilogue he waited until after dark and then to be certain that he had not been followed charles flinderspetrie approached the sacred way by a torturously circuitous wandering route doubling back time and again until he could put his mind at rest the last passage had been fraught and he feared he had alerted his enemies but it seemed that he had given them the slip if only for a little while that was all he would need a few more crossings and it would be finished the map would disappear forever then let them do their worst nothing would make him talk he would die first the thought of taking his secrets to the grave made him smile now to the business at handthe reason he had come to etruria although he had never met the king of velathri he had heard the name turms since boyhood and had longed to meet the royal sage and seer it would not happen now but charles was glad to be here just the same the funeral of the king lasted most of the day and he had arrived in time to witness the procession standing reverently among the grieving subjects as a representative of his family it was right to acknowledge the passing of a longtime friend of his father and grandfather charles congratulated himself on correctly navigating the ley and calibrating the time of his arrival true it would have been better if he had managed to reach his destination while turms was still alive but as things stood he considered it a singular victory the tomb was unsealed and would remain so for another seven days in order to allow mourners to place their gifts and remembrances in the chamber having dressed in the style of a rural labourer of the day charles did not expect to be challenged by the soldiers guarding the tomb as far as anyone was concerned he was merely one more rural peasant come to pay his humble respects his modest stature and unremarkable features together with his wholly unassuming demeanour often made it possible for him to move unseen through the various worlds he visited also he had found that few in authority paid much attention to those they considered beneath them so to accentuate his lowly state he had cut his hair short and allowed his beard to go unshaved a few days giving himself a more grizzled rustic guise if fortune favoured him tonight he would pass unnoticed once more charles hoped he would not have to speak to the guards or worse bribe them to let him into the tomb bearing a cluster of grapes in one hand and pressing the bundle containing his grave gift to his chest charles descended the long staircase leading to the sunken road cut deep into tufa stone beneath the surface of the surrounding landscape he walked along his way lit intermittently by torches advancing from one pool of light to the next until he arrived at the place where an iron brazier had been set up outside an elaborately carved doorway the tomb had been whitewashed and painted red green and gold designating a royal burial the doorway was festooned with white flowers and little red pennons had been strung from the top of the high banks of tufa at the top of the sacred way two guards stood either side of the dooryawning and leaning on their long lancesand three more sat on campstools across the narrow roadway a table had been erected and the remains of the funeral meal as well as gifts of food and wine were piled high in baskets along the walls and steps leading to the tomb the guards gripped cups and had obviously been helping themselves to the wine bread and sweetmeats why not there was no danger of thieves or grave robbers turms the immortal was a just and revered king well loved by the people exceedingly longlived he had survived plague and drought and warthe banes of rulers in every age and in every age the same he had lived long enough to enjoy that rarest of elixirs the loving acclaim of devoted subjects even among his enemies the bellicose latins turms the immortal was renowned as a sage and seer of extraordinary powers any thief foolish enough to risk stealing from this tomb would be torn apart by the mob so high was the esteem in which the late king was held the presence of guards was a mere formality rounding his shoulders and lowering his head charles affected a stoop and for good measure a slight limp smiling obsequiously as he approached the guards at the door gave him a cursory glance as he hobbled into view nodding and smiling he bowed once twice three timesas one would to his bettersand stepped to the tomb entrance as he mounted the steps he heard one of the guards behind him speak outa single word of command he did not know what was said but he halted nonetheless the soldier rose from his stool and moved unsteadily towards him charles turned as the guardsman confronted him he raised a hand to his ear and touched it lightly with his finger as a deaf man might the soldier spoke again and charles still smiling shook his head one of the standing guards spoke a word to his comrade and gestured with his lance for the visitor to enter charles stepped to the threshold but the other soldier put a hand on his shoulder turned him back around and then as if to assert his authority took the bunch of grapes from his hand then with a lift of his chin he directed the old man to do what he had come to do charles paused just inside the chamber as his eyes adjusted to the darkness the little light that entered the tomb came from the torches outside and that was not much although every instinct screamed at him to hurry he forced himself to wait until he could make out the mound of gifts and tributes heaped on and around the stone sarcophagus of king turms the marble casing itself was fairly plain a large box with a slightly domed lid the sides decorated with the name and title of the resident within and an oval lozenge containing a relief depicting a figure on a throne attended by winged figures in flowing robes that was all garlands of flowers had been draped over the sarcophagus creating the fragrant atmosphere of a garden grave goods filled the corners and were heaped round about plates and bowls and chalices in decorated ceramic and hammered silver sealed amphorae filled with wine and beer elaborately fashioned loaves of bread baskets of grain an olive tree in a pot cured meat figs in sweet liquor spiced honey in jars and other delicacies a hungry soul might fancy charles stepped to the great white stone coffin removing the short iron bar from the bundle he carried with an efficiency born of practice he jammed the tapered end of the tool into the crack where the lid joined base he paused listening to the halfdrunk guards talking outside when he was certain their attention was elsewhere he leaned all his weight on the iron bar and succeeded in raising the heavy lid sufficiently to slip a second tool into the crack working quickly he levered up the coffin top the stone was heavy and it took all his strength but he managed to force a tiny gapjust enough to slide in the last item from his bundle a thin scrap of parchment sealed between two flat pieces of olive wood he would have preferred better tools and more time to hide the item properly but neither luxury was possible in the circumstance he felt the placket drop into the coffin and with a sigh of relief gently lowered the lid back down and removed the tools which he swiftly hidone beneath a sack of barley and the other in a basket of persimmons then with a bow of respect to the dead occupant the visitor exited the tomb as he emerged one of the soldiers at the door insisted on giving him a perfunctory patdown although anyone could see well enough that he was not hiding anything stolen from the tomb in his thin tunic the guard sent him on his way with a nod he bowed again and hurried away threading back along the sunken road three down charles said to himself as he flitted like a shadow along the sacred way two more to go just two more he prayed for timea little more time to complete his mission then let his enemies plot and rage come what may charles could face the future unafraid
