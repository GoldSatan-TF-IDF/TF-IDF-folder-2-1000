come on pet ill take you back to bed he tucked her in started to read her a story daddy she said what if i fall asleep and dont wake up like snow white or sleeping beauty nobody sleeps forever sammy all it takes to wake them up is a kiss theres nothing the witches and evil queens can do about that he kissed her forehead dead people dont wake up she said hugging pa broon not even when you kiss them john rebus kissed his daughter sure you dont want a lift samantha shook her head i need to walk off that pizza rebus put his hands in his pockets felt folded banknotes beneath his handkerchief he thought of offering her some money wasnt that what fathers did but shed only laugh she was twentyfour and independent didnt need the gesture and certainly wouldnt take the money shed even tried to pay for the pizza arguing that shed eaten half while hed chewed on a single slice the remains were in a box under her arm bye dad she pecked him on the cheek next week ill phone you maybe the three of us by which she meant ned farlowe her boyfriend she was walking backwards as she spoke one final wave and she turned away from him head moving as she checked the evening traffic crossing the road without looking back but on the opposite pavement she halfturned saw him watching her waved her hand in acknowledgment a young man almost collided with her he was staring at the pavement the thin black cord from a pair of earphones dribbling down his neck turn round and look at her rebus commanded isnt she incredible but the youth kept shuffling along the pavement oblivious to her world and then shed turned a corner and was gone rebus could only imagine her now making sure the pizza box was secure beneath her left arm walking with eyes fixed firmly ahead of her rubbing a thumb behind her right ear which shed recently had pierced for the third time he knew that her nose would twitch when she thought of something funny he knew that if she wanted to concentrate she might tuck the corner of one jacketlapel into her mouth he knew that she wore a bracelet of braided leather three silver rings a cheap watch with black plastic strap and indigo face he knew that the brown of her hair was its natural colour he knew she was headed for a guy fawkes party but didnt intend staying long he didnt know nearly enough about her which was why hed wanted them to meet for dinner it had been a tortuous process dates rejigged lastminute cancellations sometimes it was her fault more often his even tonight he should have been elsewhere he ran his hands down the front of his jacket feeling the bulge in his inside breast pocket his own little timebomb checking his watch he saw it was nearly nine oclock he could drive or he could walk he wasnt going far he decided to drive edinburgh on firework night leaves blown into thick lines down the pavement one morning soon he would find himself scraping frost from his car windscreen feeling the cold like jabs to his kidneys the south side of the city seemed to get the first frost earlier than the north rebus of course lived and worked on the south side after a stint in craigmillar he was back at st leonard s he could make for there now he was still on shift after all but he had other plans he passed three pubs on his way to his car chat at the bar cigarettes and laughter a fug of heat and alcohol he knew these things better than he knew his own daughter two out of the three bars boasted doormen they didnt seem to be called bouncers these days they were doormen or frontofhouse managers big guys with short hair and shorter fuses one of them wore a kilt his face was all scar tissue and scowl the scalp shaved to abrasion rebus thought his name was wattie or wallie he belonged to telford maybe they all did graffiti on the wall further along wont anyone help three words spreading across the city rebus parked around the corner from flint street and started walking the street was in darkness at ground level except for a cafe and amusement arcade there was one lamppost its bulb dead the council had been asked by police not to replace it in a hurry the surveillance needed all the help it could get a few lights were shining in the tenement flats there were three cars parked kerbside but only one of them with people in it rebus opened the back door and got in a man sat in the drivers seat a woman next to him they looked cold and bored the woman was detective constable siobhan clarke who had worked with rebus at st leonard s until a recent posting to the scottish crime squad the man a detective sergeant called claverhouse was a crime squad regular they were part of a team keeping twentyfour hour tabs on tommy telford and all his deeds their slumped shoulders and pale faces bespoke not only tedium but the sure knowledge that surveillance was futile it was futile because telford owned the street nobody parked here without him knowing who and why the other two cars parked just now were range rovers belonging to telford s gang anything but a range rover stuck out the crime squad had a specially adapted van which they usually used for surveillance but that wouldnt work in flint street any van parked here for longer than five minutes received close and personal attention from a couple of telford s men they were trained to be courteous and menacing at the same time undercover bloody surveillance claverhouse growled only were not undercover and theres nothing to survey he tore at a snickers wrapper with his teeth and offered the first bite to siobhan clarke who shook her head shame about those flats she said peering up through the windscreen theyd be perfect except telford owns them all claverhouse said through a mouthful of chocolate are they all occupied rebus asked hed been in the car a minute and already his toes were cold some of them are empty clarke said telford uses them for storage but every bugger in and out of the main door gets spotted claverhouse added weve had meter readers and plumbers try to wangle their way in who was acting the plumber rebus asked ormiston why rebus shrugged just need someone to fix a tap in my bathroom claverhouse smiled he was tall and skinny with huge dark bags under his eyes and thinning fair hair slowmoving and slow talking people often underestimated him those who did sometimes discovered that his nickname of bloody claverhouse was merited clarke checked her watch ninety minutes till the changeover you could do with the heating on rebus offered claverhouse turned in his seat thats what i keep telling her but she wont have it why not he caught clarkes eyes in the rearview she was smiling because claverhouse said it means running the engine and running the engine when were not going anywhere is wasteful global warming or something its true clarke said rebus winked at her reflection it looked like shed been accepted by claverhouse which meant acceptance by the whole team at fettes rebus the perennial outsider envied her the ability to conform bloody useless anyway claverhouse continued the bugger knows were here the van was blown after twenty minutes the plumber routine didnt even get ormiston over the threshhold and now here we are the only sods on the whole street we couldnt blend in less if we were doing panto visible presence as a deterrent rebus said aye right a few more nights of this and im sure tommyll be back on the straight and narrow claverhouse shifted in his seat trying to get comfortable any word of candice sammy had asked her father the same thing rebus shook his head you still think taravicz snatched her no chance she did a runner rebus snorted just because you want it to be them doesnt mean it was my advice leave it to us forget about her youve got that adolf thing to keep you busy dont remind me did you ever track down colquhoun sudden holiday his office got a doctors line i think we did for him rebus realised one of his hands was caressing his breast pocket so is telford in the cafe or what went in about an hour ago clarke said theres a room at the back he uses that he seems to like the arcade too those games where you sit on a motorbike and do the circuit we need someone on the inside claverhouse said either that or wire the place we couldnt even get a plumber in there rebus said you think someone with a fistful of radio mikes is going to fare any better couldnt do any worse claverhouse switched on the radio seeking music please clarke pleaded no country and western rebus stared out at the cafe it was welllit with a net curtain covering the bottom half of its window on the top half was written big bites for small change there was a menu taped to the window and a sandwich board on the pavement outside which gave the cafes hours as am pm the place should have been closed for an hour how are his licences he has lawyers clarke said first thing we tried claverhouse added hes applied for a latenight extension i cant see the neighbours complaining well rebus said much as id love to sit around here chatting end of liaison clarke asked she was keeping her humour but rebus could see she was tired disrupted sleep pattern body chill plus the boredom of a surveillance you know is going nowhere it was never easy partnering claverhouse no great fund of stories just constant reminding that they had to do everything the right way meaning by the book do us a favour claverhouse said what theres a chippy across from the odeon what do you want just a poke of chips siobhan irnbru oh and john claverhouse added as rebus stepped out of the car ask them for a hotwater bottle while youre at it a car turned into the street speeding up then screeching to a halt outside the cafe the back door nearest the kerb opened but nobody got out the car accelerated away door still hanging open but there was something on the pavement now something crawling trying to push itself upright get after them rebus shouted claverhouse had already turned the ignition slammed the gearshift into first clarke was on the radio as the car pulled away as rebus crossed the street theman got to his feet he stood with one hand against the cafe window the other held to his head as rebus approached the man seemed to sense his presence staggered away from the cafe into the road christ he yelled help me he fell to his knees again both hands scrabbling at his scalp his face was a mask of blood rebus crouched in front of him well get you an ambulance he said a crowd had gathered at the window of the cafe the door had been pulled open and two young men were watching like they were onlookers at a piece of street theatre rebus recognised them kenny houston and prettyboy dont just stand there he yelled houston looked to prettyboy but prettyboy wasnt moving rebus took out his mobile called in the emergency his eyes fixing on prettyboy black wavy hair eyeliner black leather jacket black poloneck black jeans stones paint it black but the face chalkwhite like it had been powdered rebus walked up to the door behind him the man was beginning to wail a roar of pain echoing into the night sky we dont know him prettyboy said i didnt ask if you knew him i asked for help prettyboy didnt blink the magic word rebus got right up into his face prettyboy smiled and nodded towards houston who went to fetch towels most of the customers had returned to their tables one was studying the bloody palmprint on the window rebus saw another group of people watching from the doorway of a room to the back of the cafe at their centre stood tommy telford tall shoulders straight legs apart he looked almost soldierly i thought you took care of your lads tommy rebus called to him telford looked straight through him then turned back into the room the door closed more screams from outside rebus grabbed the dishtowels from houston and ran the bleeder was on his feet again weaving like a boxer in defeat take your hands down for a sec the man lifted both hands from his matted hair and rebus saw a section of scalp rise with them like it was attached to the skull by a hinge a thin jet of blood hit rebus in the face he turned away and felt it against his ear his neck blindly he stuck the towel on to the mans head hold this rebus grabbing the hands forcing them on to the towel headlights the unmarked police car claverhouse had his window down lost them in causewayside stolen car ill bet theyll be hoofing it we need to get this one to emergency rebus pulled open the back door clarke had found a box of paper hankies and was pulling out a wad i think hes beyond kleenex rebus said as she handed them over theyre for you she said it was a threeminute drive to the royal infirmary accident amp emergency was gearing up for firework casualties rebus went to the toilets stripped and rinsed himself off as best he could his shirt was damp and cold to the touch a line of blood had dried down the front of his chest he turned to look in the mirror saw more blood on his back he had wet a clump of blue paper towels there was a change of clothes in his car but his car was back near flint street the door of the toilets opened and claverhouse came in best i could do he said holding out a black tshirt there was a garish print on the front a zombie with demons eyes wielding a scythe belongs to one of the junior doctors made me promise to get it back to him rebus dried himself off with another wad of towels he asked claverhouse how he looked theres still some on your brow claverhouse wiped the bits rebus had missed how is he rebus asked they reckon hell be okay if he doesnt get an infection on the brain what do you think message to tommy from big ger is he one of tommys men hes not saying so whats his story fell down a flight of steps cracked his head at the bottom and the dropoff says he cant remember claverhouse paused eh john what one of the nurses wanted me to ask you something his tone told rebus all he needed to know aids test they just wondered rebus thought about it blood in his eyes his ears running down his neck he looked himself over no scratches or cuts lets wait and see he said maybe we should pull the surveillance claverhouse said leave them to get on with it and have a fleet of ambulances standing by to pick up the bodies claverhouse snorted is this sort of thing big gers style very much so rebus said reaching for his jacket but not that nightclub stabbing no claverhouse started laughing but there was no humour to the sound he rubbed his eyes never got those chips did we christ i could use a drink rebus reached into his jacket for the quarterbottle of bell s claverhouse didnt seem surprised as he broke the seal he took a gulp chased it down with another and handed the bottle back just what the doctor ordered rebus started screwing the top back on not having one im on the wagon rebus rubbed a thumb over the label since when the summer so why carry a bottle around rebus looked at it because thats not what it is claverhouse looked puzzled then what is it a bomb rebus tucked the bottle back into his pocket a little suicide bomb they walked back to a ampe siobhan clarke was waiting for them outside a closed door theyve had to sedate him she said he was up on his feet again reeling all over the place she pointed to marks on the floor airbrushed blood smudged by footprints do we have a name hes not offered one nothing in his pockets to identify him over two hundred in cash so we can rule out a mugging what do you reckon for a weapon hammer rebus shrugged a hammer would dent the skull that flap looked too neat i think they went for him with a cleaver or a machete claverhouse added something like that clarke stared at him i smell whisky claverhouse put a finger to his lips anything else rebus asked it was clarkes turn to shrug just one observation whats that i like the tshirt claverhouse put money in the machine got out three coffees hed called his office told them the surveillance was suspended orders now were to stay at the hospital see if the victim would say anything the very least they wanted was an id claverhouse handed a coffee to rebus white no sugar rebus took the coffee with one hand in the other he held a polythene laundrybag inside which was his shirt hed have a go at cleaning it it was a good shirt you know john claverhouse said theres no point you hanging around rebus knew his flat was a short walk away across the meadows his large empty flat there were students through the wall they played music a lot stuff he didnt recognise you know telford s gang rebus said didnt you recognise the face claverhouse shrugged i thought he looked a bit like danny simpson but youre not sure if its danny a names about all we can hope to get out of him telford picks his boys with care clarke came towards them along the corridor she took the coffee from claverhouse its danny simpson she confirmed i just got another look now the bloods been cleaned off she took a swallow of coffee frowned wheres the sugar youre sweet enough already claverhouse told her why did they pick on simpson rebus asked wrong place wrong time claverhouse suggested plus hes pretty low down the pecking order clarke added making it a gentle hint rebus looked at her short dark hair shrewd face with a gleam to the eyes he knew she worked well with suspects kept them calm listened carefully good on the street too fast on her feet as well as in her head like i say john claverhouse said finishing his coffee any time you want to head off rebus looked up and down the empty corridor am i in the way or something its not that but your jobs liaison period i know the way you work you get attached to cases maybe even overattached look at candice im just saying youre saying dont butt in colour rose to rebuss cheeks look at candice im saying its our case not yours thats all rebuss eyes narrowed i dont get it clarke stepped in john i think all he means is whoah its okay siobhan let the man speak for himself claverhouse sighed screwed up his empty cup and looked around for a bin john investigating telford means keeping half an eye on big ger cafferty and his crew and claverhouse stared at him okay you want it spelling out you went to barlinnie yesterday news travels in our business you met cafferty the two of you had a chinwag he asked me to go rebus lied claverhouse held up his hands fact is as youve just said he asked you and you went claverhouse shrugged are you saying im in his pocket rebuss voice had risen boys boys clarke said the doors at the end of the corridor had swung open a young man in dark business suit briefcase swinging was coming towards the drinks machine he was humming some tune he stopped humming as he reached them put down his case and searched his pockets for change he smiled when he looked at them good evening earlythirties black hair slicked back from his forehead one kisscurl looped down between his eyebrows anyone got change of a pound they looked in their pockets couldnt find enough coins never mind though the machine was flashing exact money only he stuck in the pound coin and selected tea black no sugar he stooped down to retrieve the cup but didnt seem in a hurry to leave youre police officers he said his voice was a drawl slightly nasal scottish upperclass he smiled i dont think i know any of you professionally but one can always tell and youre a lawyer rebus guessed the man bowed his head in acknowledgement here to represent the interests of a certain mr thomas telford im daniel simpsons legal advisor which adds up to the same thing i believe daniels just been admitted the man blew on his tea sipped it who told you he was here again i dont believe thats any of your business detective di rebus the man transferred his cup to his left hand so he could hold out his right charles groal he glanced at rebuss tshirt is that what you call plain clothes inspector claverhouse and clarke introduced themselves in turn groal made great show of handing out business cards i take it he said youre loitering here in the hope of interviewing my client thats right claverhouse said might i ask why d s claverhouse or should i address that question to your superior hes not my claverhouse caught rebuss look groal raised an eyebrow not your superior and yet he manifestly is being an inspector to your sergeant he looked towards the ceiling tapped a finger against his cup youre not strictly colleagues he said at last bringing his gaze back down to focus on claverhouse ds claverhouse and myself are attached to the scottish crime squad clarke said and inspector rebus isnt groal observed fascinating im at st leonard s then this is quite rightly part of your division but as for the crime squad we just want to know what happened rebus went on a fall of some kind wasnt it how is he by the way nice of you to show concern claverhouse muttered hes unconscious clarke said and likely to be in an operating theatre fairly soon or will they want to xray him first im not very up on the procedures you could always ask a nurse claverhouse said ds claverhouse i detect a certain hostility just his normal tone rebus said look youre here to make sure danny simpson keeps his trap shut were here to listen to whatever bunch of shite the two of you eventually concoct for our delectation i think thats a pretty fair summary dont you groal cocked his head slightly to one side ive heard about you inspector occasionally stories can become exaggerated but not im pleased to say in your case hes a living legend clarke offered rebus snorted and headed back into a ampe there was a woollysuit in there seated on a chair his cap on his lap and a paperback book resting on the cap rebus had seen him half an hour before the constable was sitting outside a room with its door closed tight quiet voices came from the other side the woollysuit was called redpath and he worked out of st leonard s hed been in the force a bit under a year graduate recruit they called him the professor he was tall and spotty and had a shy look about him he closed the book as rebus approached but kept a finger in his page science fiction he explained always thought id grow out of it there are a lot of things we dont grow out of son whats it about the usual threats to the stability of the time continuum parallel universes redpath looked up what do you think of parallel universes sir rebus nodded towards the door whos in there hit and run bad the professor shrugged where did it happen top of minto street did you get the car redpath shook his head waiting to see if she can tell us anything what about you sir similar story son parallel universe you could call it siobhan clarke appeared nursing a fresh cup of coffee she nodded a greeting towards redpath who stood up a courtesy which gained him a sly smile telford doesnt want danny talking she said to rebus obviously and meantime hell want to even the score definitely she caught rebuss eyes i thought he was a bit out of order back there meaning claverhouse but not wanting to name names in front of a uniform rebus nodded thanks meaning you did right not to say as much at the time claverhouse and clarke were partners now it wouldnt do for her to upset him a door slid open and a doctor appeared she was young and looked exhausted behind her in the room rebus could see a bed a figure on the bed staff milling around the various machines then the door slid closed were going to do a brain scan the doctor was telling redpath have you contacted her family i dont have a name her effects are inside the doctor slid open the door again and walked in there was clothing folded on a chair a bag beneath it as the doctor pulled out the bag rebus saw something a flat white cardboard box a white cardboard pizza box clothes black denims black bra red satin shirt a black duffelcoat john and black shoes with twoinch heels squaretoed newlooking except for the scuff marks like theyd been dragged along the road he was in the room now they had a mask over her face feeding her oxygen her forehead was cut and bruised the hair pushed away from it her fingers were blistered the palms scraped raw the bed she lay on wasnt really a bed but a wide steel trolley excuse me sir you shouldnt be in here whats wrong its this gentleman john john what is it her earrings had been removed three tiny pinpricks one of them redder than its neighbours the face above the sheet puffy blackened eyes a broken nose abrasions on both cheeks split lip a graze on the chin eyelids which didnt even flutter he saw a hit and run victim and beneath it all he saw his daughter and he screamed clarke and redpath had to drag him out helped by claverhouse whod heard the noise leave the door open ill kill you if you close that door they tried to sit him down redpath rescued his book from the chair rebus tore it from him and threw it down the hall how could you read a fucking book he spat thats sammy in there and youre out here reading a book clarkes cup of coffee had been kicked over the floor slippy redpath going down as rebus pushed at him can you jam that door open claverhouse was asking the doctor and what about a sedative rebus was clawing his hands through his hair bawling dryeyed his voice hoarse and uncomprehending staring down at himself he saw the ludicrous tshirt and knew thats what hed take away from this night the image of an iron maiden tshirt and its grinning brighteyed demon he hauled off his jacket and started tearing at the shirt she was behind that door he thought and i was out here chatting as casual as you like shed been in there all the time hed been here two things clicked a hit and run the car speeding away from flint street he grabbed at redpath top of minto street youre sure what sammy top of minto street redpath nodded clarke knew straight away what rebus was thinking i dont think so john they were headed the opposite way could have doubled back claverhouse had caught some of the exchange i just got off the phone the guys who did danny simpson we picked up the car white escort abandoned in argyle place rebus looked at redpath white escort redpath was shaking his head witnesses say darkcoloured rebus turned to the wall stood there with his palms pressed to it staring at the paintwork it was like he could see inside the paint claverhouse put a hand on his shoulder john im sure shes going to be fine the doctors gone to fetch you a couple of tablets but meantime what about one of these claverhouse with rebuss jacket folded in the crook of his arm the quarterbottle in his hand the little suicide bomb he took the bottle from claverhouse unscrewed its top his eyes on the open doorway lifted the bottle to his lips drank book two in the hanging gardenno one sleeps a seaside holiday caravan park long walks and sandcastles he sat in a deckchair trying to read cold mind blowing despite the sun rhona rubbed suntan lotion on sammy said you couldnt be too careful told him to keep an eye open she was going back to the caravan for her book sammy was burying her fathers feet in the sand he was trying to read but thinking about work every day of the holiday he sneaked off to a phonebox and called the station they kept telling him to go and enjoy himself forget about everything he was halfway through a spy thriller the plot had already lost him rhona was doing her best shed wanted somewhere foreign a bit of glamour and heat to go with the sunshine finances however mere on his side so here they mere on the fife coast where hed first met her was he hoping for something some memory rekindled hed come here with his own parents played with mickey met other kids then lost them again at the end of the fortnight he tried the spy novel again but casework got in the may and then a shadow fell over him where is she what he looked down his feet mere buried in sand but sammy wasnt there how long had she been gone he stood up scanned the seashore a few tentative bathers going in no further than their knees christ john where is she he turned round looked at the sand dunes in the distance the dunes they warned her there mere hollows in the dunes where the sand was eroding small dens had been created a magnet for kids only they were prone to collapse earlier in the season a tenyearold boy had been dug out by frantic parents he hadnt quite choked on the sand they were running now the dunes the grass no sign of her sammy maybe she went into the water you mere supposed to be keeping an eye on her im sorry i sammy a small shape in one of the dens hopping on its hands and knees rhona reached in pulled her out hugged her sweetie we told you not to i was a rabbit rebus looked at the fragile roof sand meshed with the roots of plants and grasses punched it with a fist the roof collapsed rhona was looking at him end of holiday john rebus kissed his daughter see you later he said watching her as she left the coffee shop espresso and a slice of caramel shortbread thats all shed had time for but theyd fixed another date for dinner nothing fancy just a pizza it was october th by midnovember if nature were feeling bloody it would be winter rebus had been taught at school that there were four distinct seasons had painted pictures of them in bright and sombre colours but his native country seemed not to know this winters were long outstaying their welcome the warm weather came suddenly people stripping to tshirts as the first buds appeared so that spring and summer seemed entwined into a single season and no sooner had the leaves started turning brown than the first frost came again sammy waved at him through the cafe window then was gone she seemed to have grown up all right hed always been on the lookout for evidence of instability hints of childhood traumas or a genetic predisposition towards self destruction maybe he should phone rhona some day and thank her thank her for bringing samantha up on her own it couldnt have been easy that was what people always said he knew it would be nice if he could feel some responsibility for the success but he wasnt that hypocritical the truth was while shed been growing up hed been elsewhere it was the same with his marriage even when in the same room as his wife even out at the pictures or around the table at a dinner party the best part of him had been elsewhere fixed on some case or other some question that needed answering before he could rest rebus lifted his coat from the back of his chair nothing left for it but to go back to the office sammy was headed back to her own office she worked with exconvicts she had refused his offer of a lift now that it was out in the open shed wanted to talk about her man ned farlowe rebus had tried to look interested but found that his mind was half on joseph lintz in other words same problem as always when hed been given the lintz case hed been told he was wellsuited to it his army background for one thing and his seeming affinity for historical cases by which farmer watson rebuss chief superintendent had meant bible john for another with respect sir rebus had said that sounds like a load of balls two reasons for me getting lumbered with this one no other bugger will touch it with a bargepole two itll keep me out of the way for a while your remit the farmer had said unwilling to let rebus rile him is to sift through what there is see if any of it amounts to evidence you can interview mr lintz if itll help do whatever you think necessary and if you find enough to warrant a charge i wont you know i wont rebus sighed sir weve been through this before its the whole reason the war crimes section was shut down that case a few years back lot of hoohas about bugger all he was shaking his head who wants it all dragged up apart from the papers im taking you off the mr taystee case let bill pryde handle that so it was settled lintz belonged to rebus it had started with a news story with documents handed over to a sunday broadsheet the documents had come from the holocaust investigation bureau based in tel aviv they had passed on to the newspaper the name of joseph lintz who had they said been living quietly in scotland under an alias since the end of the war and who was in fact josef linzstek a native of alsace in june lieutenant linzstek had led the rd company of an ss regiment part of the nd panzer division into the town of villefranche dalbarede in the correze region of france rd company had rounded up everyone in the town men women children the sick were carried from their beds the elderly pulled from their armchairs babies hoisted from their cots a teenage girl an evacuee from lorraine had seen what the germans were capable of she climbed into the attic of her house and hid there watching from a small window in the rooftiles everyone was marched into the village square the teenager saw her school friends find their families she hadnt been in school that day a throat infection she wondered if anyone would tell the germans there was a commotion as the mayor and other dignitaries remonstrated with the officer in charge while machine guns were aimed at the crowd these men among them the priest lawyer and doctor were set upon with rifle butts then ropes were produced and strung over half a dozen of the trees which lined the square the men were hauled to their feet their heads pushed through the nooses an order was given a hand raised then dropped and soldiers pulled on each rope until six men were hanging from the trees bodies writhing legs kicking uselessly the movements slowing by degrees as the teenager remembered it it took an age for them to die stunned silence in the square as if the whole village knew now knew that this was no mere check of identity papers more orders were barked the men separated from the women and children were marched off to prudhommes barn everyone else shepherded into the church the square grew empty except for a dozen or so soldiers rifles slung over their shoulders they chatted kicked up dust and stones shared jokes and cigarettes one of them went into the bar and switched the radio on jazz music filled the air competing with the rustle of leaves as a breeze twisted the corpses in the trees it was strange the girl later said i stopped seeing them as dead bodies it was as if theyd become something else parts of the trees themselves then the explosion smoke and dust billowing from the church a moments silence as though a vacuum had been created in the world then screams followed immediately by machinegun fire and when it finally stopped she could still hear it because it wasnt just inside the church it was in the distance too prudhommes barn when she was finally found by people from surrounding villages she was naked except for a shawl she had found in a trunk the shawl had belonged to her grandmother dead the previous year but she was not alone in escaping the massacre when the soldiers had opened fire in prudhommes barn theyd aimed low the first row of men to fall had been wounded in the lower body and the bodies which fell on them shielded them from further fire when straw was strewn over the mound and set alight theyd waited as long as they could before starting to claw their way out from beneath expecting at any moment to be shot four of them made it two with their hair and clothes on fire one dying later from his wounds three men one teenage girl the only survivors the death toll was never finalised no one knew how many visitors had been in villefranche that day how many refugees could be added to the count a list was compiled of over seven hundred names people who had most likely been killed rebus sat at his desk and rubbed his eyes with his knuckles the teenage girl was still alive a pensioner now the male survivors were all dead but theyd been alive for the bordeaux trial in he had summaries of their evidence the summaries were in french a lot of the material sitting on his desk was french and rebus didnt speak french that was why hed gone to the modern languages department at the university and found someone who could her name was kirstin mede and she lectured in french but also had a working knowledge of german which was handy the documents which werent in french were in german he had a onepage english summary of the trial proceedings passed on from the nazi hunters the trial had opened in february and lasted just under a month of seventy five men identified as having been part of the german force at villefranche only fifteen were present six germans and nine french alsatians not one of them was an officer one german received the death sentence the others jail terms of between four and twelve years but they were all released as soon as the trial finished alsace hadnt been enjoying the trial and in a bid to unite the nation the government had passed an amnesty the germans meantime were said to have already served their sentences the survivors of villefranche had been horrified even more extraordinary to rebuss mind the british had apprehended a couple of german officers involved in the massacre but had refused to hand them over to the french authorities returning them to germany instead where they lived long and prosperous lives if linzstek had been captured then there would have been none of the present commotion politics it was all down to politics rebus looked up and kirstin mede was standing there she was tall deftly constructed and immaculately dressed she wore makeup the way women usually did only in fashion adverts today she was wearing a check twopiece the skirt just touching her knees and long goldcoloured earrings she had already opened her briefcase and was pulling out a sheaf of papers latest translations she said thanks rebus looked down at a note hed made to himself correze trip necessary well the farmer had said he could have whatever he wanted he looked up at kirstin mede and wondered if the budget would stretch to a tour guide she was sitting opposite him putting on halfmoon reading glasses can i get you a coffee he asked im a bit pushed today i just wanted you to see these she laid two sheets of paper on his desk so that they faced him one sheet was the photocopy of a typed report in german the second sheet was her translation rebus looked at the german der beginn der vergeltungsmassnahmen hat ein merkbares aufatmen hervorgerufen and die stimmung sehr gunstig beeinflusst the beginning of reprisals he read has brought about a marked improvement in morale with the men now noticeably more relaxed its supposed to be from linzstek to his commander she explained but no signature just the typed name underlined so it doesnt help us identify linzstek no but remember what we were talking about it gives a reason for the assault a touch of r ampr for the lads her look froze him sorry he said raising his hands far too glib and youre right its almost like the lieutenant is trying to justify the whole thing in print for posterity maybe after all theyd just started being the losing side he looked at the other papers anything else some further reports nothing too exciting and some of the eyewitness testimony she looked at him with pale grey eyes it gets to you after a while doesnt it rebus looked at her and nodded the female survivor of the massacre lived in juillac and had been questioned recently by local police about the man in charge of the german troops her story hadnt changed from the one shed told at the trial shed seen his face only for a few seconds and looking down from the attic of a three storey house shed been shown a recent photo of joseph lintz and had shrugged maybe shed said yes maybe which would rebus knew be turfed out by the procurator fiscal who knew damned well what any defence lawyer with half a brain would do with it hows the case coming kirstin mede asked maybe shed seen some look cross his face slowly the problem is all this stuff he waved towards the strewn desk on the one hand ive got all this and on the other ive got a wee old man from the new town the two dont seem to go together have you met him once or twice whats he like what was joseph lintz like he was cultured a linguist hed even been a professor at the university back in the early s only for a year or two his own explanation i was filling a vacuum until they could find someone of greater standing hed been professor of german hed lived in scotland since or he was vague about exact dates blaming his memory his early life was vague too he said papers had been destroyed the allies had had to create a duplicate set for him there was only lintzs word that these new papers were anything but an official record of lies hed told and which had been believed lintzs story birth in alsace parents and relatives all dead forced enlistment in the ss rebus liked the touch about joining the ss it was the sort of admission that would make officials decide hes been honest about his involvement with that so hes probably being honest about the other details there was no actual record of a joseph lintz serving with any ss regiment but then the ss had destroyed a lot of their own records once theyd seen the way the war was headed lintzs war record was vague too he mentioned shellshock to explain the gaps in his memory but he was vehement that he had never been called linzstek and had never served in the correze region of france i was in the east he would say thats where the allies found me in the east the problem was that there was no convincing explanation as to how lintz had found himself in the united kingdom he said hed asked if he could go there and start a new life he didnt want to return to alsace wanted to be as far away from the germans as possible he wanted water between him and them again there was no documentation to back this up and meantime the holocaust investigators had come up with their own evidence which pointed to lintzs involvement in the rat line have you ever heard of something called the rat line rebus had asked at their first meeting of course joseph lintz had said but i never had anything to do with it lintz in the drawingroom of his heriot row home an elegant fourstorey georgian edifice a huge house for a man whod never married rebus had said as much lintz had merely shrugged as was his privilege where had the money come from ive worked hard inspector maybe so but lintz had purchased the house in the lates on a lecturers salary a colleague from the time had told rebus everyone in the department suspected lintz of having a private income lintz denied this houses were cheaper back then inspector the fashion was for country properties and bungalows joseph lintz barely five foot tall bespectacled parchment hands with liver spots one wrist sported a prewar ingersoll watch glass fronted bookcases lining his drawingroom charcoalcoloured suits an elegant way about him almost feminine the way he lifted a cup to his lips the way he flicked specks from his trousers i dont blame the jews hed said theyd implicate everyone if they could they want the whole world feeling guilty maybe theyre right in what way sir dont we all have little secrets things were ashamed of lintz had smiled youre playing their game and you dont even know it rebus had pressed on the two names are very similar arent they lintz linzstek naturally or theyd have absolutely no grounds for their accusations think inspector wouldnt i have changed my name more radically do you credit me with a modicum of intelligence more than a modicum framed diplomas on the walls honorary degrees photos taken with university chancellors politicians when the farmer had learned a little more about joseph lintz hed cautioned rebus to ca canny lintz was a patron of the arts opera museums galleries and a great giver to charities he was a man with friends but also a solitary man someone who was happiest when tending graves in warriston cemetery dark bags under his eyes pushing down upon the angular cheeks did he sleep well like a lamb inspector another smile of the sacrificial kind you know i dont blame you youre only doing your job you seem to have no end of forgiveness mr lintz a careful shrug do you know blakes words inspector and through all eternity i forgive you you forgive me im not so sure i can forgive the media this last word voiced with a distaste which manifested itself as a twist of facial muscles is that why youve set your lawyer on them set makes me sound like a hunter inspector this is a newspaper with a team of expensive lawyers at its beck and call can an individual hope to win against such odds then why bother trying lintz thumped both arms of his chair with clenched fists for the principle man such outbursts were rare and shortlived but rebus had experienced enough of them to know that lintz had a temper hello kirstin mede said angling her head to catch his gaze what she smiled you were miles away just across town he replied she pointed to the papers ill leave these here okay if youve any questions great thanks rebus got to his feet its okay i know my way out but rebus was insistent sorry im a bit he waved his hands around his head as i said it gets to you after a while as they walked back through the cid office rebus could feel eyes following them bill pryde came up preening wanting to be introduced he had curly fair hair and thick blond eyelashes his nose large and freckled mouth small and topped with a ginger moustache a fashion accessory he could well afford to lose a pleasure he said taking kirstin medes hand then to rebus makes me wish wed swopped pryde was working on the mr taystee case an icecream man found dead in his van engine left running in a lockup looking initially like suicide rebus steered kirstin mede past pryde kept them moving he wanted to ask her out he knew she wasnt married but thought there might be a boyfriend in the frame rebus was thinking what would she like to eat french or italian she spoke both those languages maybe stick to something neutral indian or chinese maybe she was vegetarian maybe she didnt like restaurants a drink then but rebus didnt drink these days so what do you think rebus started kirstin mede had asked him something sorry she laughed realising he hadnt been listening he began to apologise but she shook it off i know she said youre a bit and she waved her hands around her head he smiled theyd stopped walking they were facing one another her briefcase was tucked under one arm it was the moment to ask her for a date any kind of date let her choose whats that she said suddenly it was a shriek rebus had heard it too it had come from behind the door nearest them the door to the womens toilets they heard it again this time it was followed by some words they understood help me somebody rebus pushed open the door and ran in a wpc was pushing at a cubicle door trying to force it with her shoulder from behind the door rebus could hear choking noises what is it he said picked her up twenty minutes ago she said she needed the loo the policewomans cheeks wore a flush of anger and embarrassment rebus grabbed the top of the door and hauled himself up peering over and down on to a figure seated on the pan the woman there was young heavily madeup she sat with her back against the cistern so that she was staring up at him but glassily and her hands were busy they were busy pulling a streamer of toiletpaper from the roll stuffing it into her mouth shes gagging rebus said sliding back down stand back he shouldered the door tried again stood back and hit the lock with the heel of his shoe the door flew open catching the seated woman on the knees he pushed his way in her face was turning purple grab her hands he told the wpc then he started pulling the stream of white paper from her mouth feeling like nothing so much as a cheap stageshow magician there seemed to be half a roll in there and as rebus caught the wpcs eye both of them let out a nearinvoluntary laugh the woman had stopped struggling her hair was mousy brown lank and greasy she wore a black skiing jacket and a tight black skirt her bare legs were mottled pink bruising at one knee where the door had connected her bright red lipstick was coming off on rebuss fingers she had been crying was crying still rebus feeling guilty about the sudden laughter crouched down so that he could look into her makeupstreaked eyes she blinked then held his gaze coughing as the last of the paper was extracted shes foreign the policewoman was explaining doesnt seem to speak english so how come she told you she needed the toilet there are ways arent there where did you find her down the pleasance brazen as you like thats a new patch on me me too nobody with her not that i saw rebus took the womans hands he was still crouching in front of her aware of her knees brushing his chest are you all right she just blinked he made his face show polite concern okay now she nodded slightly okay she said her voice husky rebus felt her fingers they were cold he was thinking junkie a lot of the working girls were but hed never come across one who couldnt speak english then he turned her hands saw her wrists recent zigzag scar tissue she didnt resist as he pushed up one sleeve of her jacket the arm was a mass of similar inflictions shes a cutter the woman was talking now babbling incoherently kirstin mede who had been standing back from proceedings stepped forward rebus looked to her its not anything i understand not quite eastern european try her with something so mede asked a question in french repeating it in three or four other languages the woman seemed to understand what they were trying to do theres probably someone at the uni who could help mede said rebus started to stand up the woman grabbed him by the knees pulled him to her so that he nearly lost his balance her grip was tight her face resting against his legs she was still crying and babbling i think she likes you sir the policewoman said they wrested her hands free and rebus stepped back but she was after him at once throwing herself forwards like she was begging her voice rising there was an audience now half a dozen officers in the doorway every time rebus moved she came after him on all fours rebus looked to where his exit was blocked by bodies the cheap magician had become straight man in a comedy routine the wpc grabbed her pulled her back on to her feet one arm twisted behind her back come on she said through gritted teeth back to the cell shows over folks there was scattered applause as the prisoner was marched away she looked back once seeking rebus her eyes pleading for what he did not know he turned towards kirstin mede instead fancy a curry some time she looked at him like he was mad two things one shes a bosnian muslim two she wants to see you again rebus stared at the man from the slavic studies department whod come here at kirstin medes request they were talking in the corridor at st leonard s bosnian dr colquhoun nodded he was short and almost spherical with long black hair which was swept back either side of a bald dome his puffy face was pockmarked his brown suit worn and stained he wore suede hush puppies same colour as the suit this rebus couldnt help feeling was how dons were supposed to look colquhoun was a mass of nervous twitches and had yet to make eye contact with rebus im not an expert on bosnia he went on but she says shes from sarajevo does she say how she ended up in edinburgh i didnt ask would you mind asking her now rebus gestured back along the corridor the two men walked together colquhouns eyes on the floor sarajevo was hit hard in the war he said shes twentytwo by the way she told me that shed looked older maybe she was maybe she was lying but as the door to the interview room opened and rebus saw her again he was struck by how unformed her face was and he revised her age downwards she stood up abruptly as he came in looked like she might rush forward to him but he held up a hand in warning and pointed to the chair she sat down again hands cradling the mug of sweetened black tea she never took her eyes off him shes a big fan the wpc said the policewoman same one as the toilet incident was called ellen sharpe she was sitting on the rooms other chair there wasnt much space in the interview room a table and two chairs just about filled it on the table were twin video recorders and a twin cassettemachine the video camera pointed down from one wall rebus gestured for sharpe to give her seat to colquhoun did she give you a name he asked the academic she told me candice colquhoun said you dont believe her its not exactly ethnic inspector candice said something shes calling you her protector and what am i protecting her from the dialogue between colquhoun and candice was gruff guttural she says firstly you protected her from herself and now she says you have to continue continue protecting her she says you own her now rebus looked at the academic whose eyes were on candices arms she had removed her skiing jacket underneath she wore a ribbed shortsleeved shirt through which her small breasts were visible she had folded her bare arms but the scratches and slashes were all too apparent ask her if those are selfinflicted colquhoun struggled with the translation im more used to literature and film than um what does she say she says she did them herself rebus looked at her for confirmation and she nodded slowly looking slightly ashamed who put her on the street you mean whos running her whos her manager another short dialogue she says she doesnt understand does she deny working as a prostitute she says she doesnt understand rebus turned to wpc sharpe well a couple of cars stopped she leaned in the window to talk with the drivers they drove off again didnt like the look of the goods i suppose if she cant speak english how did she manage to talk to the drivers there are ways rebus looked at candice he began to speak to her very softly straight fuck fifteen twenty for a blow job unprotected is an extra fiver he paused how much is anal candice colour flooded her cheeks rebus smiled maybe not university tuition dr colquhoun but someones taught her a few words of english just enough to get her working ask her again how she got here colquhoun mopped his face first candice spoke with her head lowered she says she left sarajevo as a refugee went to amsterdam then came to britain the first thing she remembers is a place with lots of bridges bridges she stayed there for some time colquhoun seemed shaken by the story he handed her a handkerchief so she could wipe her eyes she rewarded him with a smile then she looked at rebus burger chips yes are you hungry rebus rubbed his stomach she nodded and smiled he turned to sharpe see what the canteen can come up with will you the wpc gave him a hard stare not wanting to leave would you like anything dr colquhoun he shook his head rebus asked for another coffee as sharpe left rebus crouched down by the table and looked at candice ask her how she got to edinburgh colquhoun asked then listened to what sounded like a long tale he scratched some notes on a folded sheet of paper the city with the bridges she says she didnt see much of it she was kept inside sometimes she was driven to some rendezvous youll have to forgive me inspector i may be a linguist but im no expert on colloquialisms youre doing fine sir well she was used as a prostitute that much i can infer and one day they put her in the back of a car and she thought she was going to another hotel or office office from her descriptions id say some of her work was done in offices also private apartments and houses but mostly hotel rooms where was she kept in a house she had a bedroom they kept it locked colquhoun pinched the bridge of his nose they put her in the car one day and next thing she knew she was in edinburgh how long was the trip shes not sure she slept part of the way tell her everythings going to be all right rebus paused and ask her who she works for now the fear returned to candices face she stammered shaking her head her voice sounded more guttural than ever colquhoun looked like he was having trouble with the translation she cant tell you he said tell her shes safe colquhoun did so tell her again rebus said he made sure she was looking at him while colquhoun spoke his face was set a face she could trust she reached a hand out to him he took it squeezed ask her again who she works for she cant tell you inspector theyd kill her shes heard stories rebus decided to try the name hed been thinking of the man who ran half the citys working girls cafferty he said watching for a reaction there was none big ger big ger cafferty her face remained blank rebus squeezed her hand again there was another name one hed been hearing recently telford he said tommy telford candice pulled her hand away and broke into hysterics just as wpc sharpe pushed open the door rebus walked dr colquhoun out of the station recalling that just such a walk had got him into this in the first place thanks again sir if i need you i hope you wont mind if i call if you must you must colquhoun said grudgingly not too many slavic specialists around rebus said he had colquhouns business card in his hand a home phone number written on its back well rebus put out his free hand thanks again as they shook rebus thought of something were you at the university when joseph lintz was professor of german the question surprised colquhoun yes he said at last did you know him our departments werent that close i met him at a few social functions the occasional lecture what did you think of him colquhoun blinked he still wasnt looking at rebus theyre saying he was a nazi yes but back then as i say we werent close are you investigating him just curious sir thanks for your time back in the station rebus found ellen sharpe outside the interview room door so what do we do with her she asked keep her here you mean charge her rebus shook his head lets call it protective custody does she know that whos she going to complain to theres only one bugger in the whole city can make out what shes saying and ive just packed him off home what if her man comes to get her think he will she thought about it probably not no because as far as hes concerned all he has to do is wait and well release her eventually meantime she doesnt speak english so what can she give us and shes here illegally no doubt so if she talks all wed probably do is kick her out of the country telford s clever i hadnt realised it but he is using illegal aliens as prossies its sweet how long do we keep her rebus shrugged and what do i tell my boss direct all enquiries to di rebus he said going to open the door i thought it was exemplary sir he stopped what your knowledge of the chargescale for prostitutes just doing my job he said smiling one last question sir yes sharpe why whats the big deal rebus considered this twitched his nose good question he said finally opening the door and going in and he knew he knew straight away she looked like sammy wipe away the makeup and the tears get some sensible clothes on her and she was the spitting image and she was scared and maybe he could help her what can i call you candice whats your real name she took hold of his hand put her face to it he pointed to himself john he said don john shaun john he was smiling so was she john john he nodded thats it and you he pointed at her now who are you she paused candice she said as a little light died behind her eyes rebus didnt know tommy telford by sight but he knew where to find him flint street was a passageway between clerk street and buccleuch street near the university the shops had mostly closed down but the games arcade always did good business and from flint street telford leased gaming machines to pubs and clubs across the city flint street was the centre of his eastern empire the franchise had until recently belonged to a man called davie donaldson but hed suddenly retired on health grounds maybe hed been right at that if tommy telford wanted something from you and you werent forthcoming predictions of your future health could suddenly change donaldson was now in hiding somewhere hiding not from telford but from big ger cafferty for whom he had been holding the franchise in trust while cafferty bided his time in barlinnie jail there were some who said cafferty ran edinburgh as effectively from inside as he ever had done outside but the reality was that gangsters like nature abhorred a vacuum and now tommy telford was in town telford was a product of ferguslie park in paisley at eleven hed joined the local gang at twelve a couple of woolly suits had visited him to ask about a spate of tyre slashings theyd found him surrounded by other gang members nearly all of them older than him but he was at the centre no doubt about it his gang had grown with him taking over a sizeable chunk of paisley selling drugs and running prostitutes doing a bit of extortion these days he had shares in casinos and video shops restaurants and a haulage firm plus a property portfolio which made him landlord to several hundred people hed tried to make his mark in glasgow but had found it sealed down tight so had gone exploring elsewhere there were stories hed become friendly with some big villain in newcastle nobody could remember anything like it since the days when london s krays had rented their muscle from big arthur in glasgow hed arrived in edinburgh a year ago moving softly at first buying a casino and hotel then suddenly he was inescapably there like the shadow from a raincloud with the chasing out of davie donaldson hed given cafferty a calculated punch to the gut cafferty could either fight or give up everyone was waiting for it to get messy the games arcade called itself fascination street the machines were all flashing insistence in stark contrast to the dead facial stares of the players then there were shootemups with huge video screens and digital imprecations think youre tough enough punk one of them challenged as rebus walked past they had names like harbinger and necrocop this latter reminding rebus of how old he felt he looked at the faces around him saw a few he recognised kids whod been pulled into st leonard s theyd be on the fringes of telford s gang awaiting the callup hanging around like foster children hoping the family would take them most of them came from families who werent families latchkey kids grown old before their time one of the staff came in from the cafe who ordered the bacon sarnie rebus smiled as the faces turned to him bacon meant pig meant him a moments examination was all he warranted there were more pressing demands on their attention at the far end of the arcade were the really big machines halfsize motorbikes you sat astride as you negotiated the circuit on the screen in front of you a small appreciative coterie stood around one bike on which sat a young man dressed in a leather jacket not a marketstall jacket something altogether more special quality goods shiny sharptoed boots tight black denims white polo neck surrounded by fawning courtiers steely dan kid charlemagne rebus found amace for himself in the midst of the glaring onlookers no takers for that bacon sarnie he asked who are you the man on the machine demanded di rebus caffertys man said with conviction what i hear you and him go back i put him inside not every cop gets visiting rights though rebus realised that though telford s gaze was fixed on the screen he was watching rebus in its reflection watching him talking to him yet still managing to control the bike through hairpin bends so is there some problem inspector yes theres a problem we picked up one of your girls my what she calls herself candice thats about as much as we know but foreign lassies are a new one on me and youre fairly new around here too im not getting your drift inspector i supply goods and services to the entertainment sector are you accusing me of being a pimp rebus stuck out a foot and pushed the bike sideways on the screen it spun and hit a crash barrier a moment later the screen changed back to the start of the race see inspector telford said still not turning round thats the beauty of games you can always start again after an accident not so easy in real life what if i cut the power game over slowly telford swivelled from the hips now he was looking at rebus close up he looked so young most of the gangsters rebus had known theyd had a worn look undernourished but overfed telford had the look of some new strain of bacteria not yet tested or understood so what is it rebus some message from cafferty candice rebus said quietly the slight tremor in his voice betraying his anger with a couple of drinks in him hed have had telford on the floor by now from tonight shes off the game understood i dont know any candice understood hang on lets see if ive got this you want me to agree with you that a woman ive never met should stop touting her hole smiles from the spectators telford turned back to his game wheres this woman from anyway he asked almost casually were not sure rebus lied he didnt want telford knowing any more than was necessary must have been a great little chat the two of you had shes scared shitless me too rebus im scared youre going to bore me to death this candice did she give you a taste of the goods im betting its not every scrubber would get you this het up laughter rebus its brunt shes off the game telford dont think about touching her not with a bargepole pal myself im a cleanliving sort of individual i say my prayers last thing at night and kiss your cuddly bear telford looked at him again dont believe all the stories inspector here grab a bacon sarnie on your way out i think theres one going spare rebus stood his ground a few moments longer then turned away and tell the mugs out front i said hello rebus walked back through the arcade and out into the night heading for nicolson street he was wondering what he was going to do with candice simple answer let her go and hope she had the sense to keep moving as he made to pass a parked car its window slid down fucking well get in a voice ordered from the passenger seat rebus stopped looked at the man whod spoken recognised the face ormiston he said opening the back door of the orion now i know what he meant who tommy telford im to tell you he said hello the driver stared at ormiston rumbled again he didnt sound surprised rebus recognised the voice hello claverhouse ds claverhouse dc ormiston scottish crime squad fettess finest on surveillance claverhouse as thin as twa ply o reek as rebuss father would have said ormiston frecklefaced and with mick mcmanuss hair slick puddingbowl cut unfeasibly black you were blown before i walked in there if thats any consolation what the fuck were you doing paying my respects what about you wasting our time ormiston muttered the crime squad were out for telford good news for rebus ive got someone he said she works for telford shes frightened you could help her the frightened ones dont talk this one might claverhouse stared at him and all wed have to do is get her out of here set her up somewhere witness relocation if it comes to that what does she know im not sure her english isnt great claverhouse knew when he was being sold something tell us he said rebus told them they tried not to look interested well talk to her claverhouse said rebus nodded so how long has this been going on ever since telford and cafferty squared off and whose side are we on were the un same as always claverhouse said he spoke slowly measuring each word and phrase a careful man d s claverhouse meantime you go charging in like some bloody mercenary ive never been a great one for tactics besides i wanted to see the bastard close up and he looks like a kid and hes as clean as a whistle claverhouse said hes got a dozen lieutenants whod take the fall for him at the word lieutenants rebuss mind flashed to joseph lintz some men gave orders some carried them out which group was the more culpable tell me something he said the teddy bear story is it true claverhouse nodded in the passenger seat of his range rover a fucking huge yellow thing sort they raffle in the pub sunday lunchtime so whats the story ormiston turned in his seat ever hear of teddy willocks glasgow hardman carpentry nails and a clawhammer rebus nodded you welched on someone willocks came to see you with the carpentry bag but then claverhouse took over teddy got on the wrong side of some geordie bastard telford was young making a name for himself and he very badly wanted an in with this geordie so he took care of teddy and thats why he carries a teddy around with him ormiston said a reminder to everyone rebus was thinking geordie meant someone from newcastle newcastle with its bridges over the tyne newcastle he said softly leaning forward in his seat what about it maybe candice was there her city of bridges she might link telford to this geordie gangster ormiston and claverhouse looked at one another shell need a safe place to stay rebus told them money somewhere to go afterwards a firstclass flight home if she helps us nail telford im not sure shell want to go home thats for later claverhouse said first thing is to talk to her youll need a translator claverhouse looked at him and of course you know just the man she was asleep in her cell curled under the blanket only her hair visible the mothers of invention lonely little girl the cell was in the womens block painted pink and blue a slab to sleep on graffiti scratched into the walls candice rebus said quietly squeezing her shoulder she started awake as if hed administered an electric shock its okay its me john she looked round blindly focused on him slowly john she said then she smiled claverhouse was off making phone calls squaring thingsormiston stood in the doorway appraising candice not that ormiston was known to be choosy rebus had tried colquhoun at home but thered been no answer so now rebus was gesturing letting her know they wanted to take her somewhere a hotel he said she didnt like that word she looked from him to ormiston and back again its okay rebus said its just a place for you to sleep thats all somewhere safe no telford nothing like that she seemed to soften came off the bed and stood in front of him her eyes seemed to say ill trust you and if you let me down i wont be surprised claverhouse came back all fixed he said his examination falling on candice she doesnt speak any english not as practised in polite society in that case ormiston said she should be fine with us three men and a young woman in a dark blue ford orion heading south out of the city it was late now past midnight black taxis cruising students were spilling from pubs they get younger every year claverhouse was never short of a cliche and more of them end up joining the force rebus commented claverhouse smiled i meant prossies not students we pulled one in last week said she was fifteen turned out she was twelve on the run all grown up about it rebus tried to remember sammy at twelve he saw her scared in the clutches of a madman with a grievance against rebus shed had lots of nightmares afterwards till her mother had taken her to london rhona had phoned rebus a few years later she just wanted to let him know hed robbed sammy of her childhood i phoned ahead claverhouse said dont worry weve used this place before its perfect shell need some clothes rebus said siobhan can fetch her some in the morning how is siobhan seems fine hasnt half cut into the jokes and the language though ach she can take a joke ormiston said likes a drink too this last was news to rebus he wondered how much siobhan clarke would change in order to blend with her new surroundings its just off the bypass claverhouse said meaning their destination not far now the city ended suddenly green belt plus the pentland hills the bypass was quiet ormiston doing the ton between exits they came off at colinton and signalled into the hotel it was a motorists stop one of a nationwide chain same prices same rooms the cars which crowded the parking area were salesmens specials cigarette packets littering the passenger seats the reps would be sleeping or lying in a daze with the tv remote to hand candice seemed reluctant to get out of the car until she saw that rebus was coming too you light up her life ormiston offered at reception they signed her in as one half of a couple mrs angus campbell the two crime squad cops had the routine off pat rebus watched the hotel clerk but a wink from claverhouse told him the man was okay make it the first floor malcolm ormiston said dont want anyone peeking in the windows room number will someone be with her rebus asked as they climbed the stairs right there in the room claverhouse said the landings too obvious and wed freeze our bums off in the car did you give me colquhouns number ormiston has it ormiston was unlocking the door whos on first watch claverhouse shrugged candice was looking towards rebus seeming to sense what was being discussed she snatched at his arm jabbering in her native tongue looking first to claverhouse and then to ormiston all the time waving rebuss arm its okay candice really theyll take care of you she kept shaking her head holding him with one hand and pointing at him with the other prodding his chest to make her meaning clear what do you say john claverhouse asked a happy witness is a willing witness what times siobhan expected ill hurry her up rebus looked at candice again sighed nodded okay he pointed to himself then to the room just for a little while okay candice seemed satisfied with this and went inside ormiston handed rebus the key i dont want you young things waking the neighbours now rebus closed the door on his face the room was exactly as expected rebus filled the kettle and switched it on dumped a teabag into a cup candice pointed to the bathroom made turning motions with her hands a bath he gestured with his arm go ahead the curtain over the window was closed he parted it and looked out a grassy slope occasional lights from the bypass he made sure the curtains were closed tight then tried adjusting the heating the room was stifling there didnt seem to be a thermostat so he went back to the window and opened it a fraction cold night air and the swish of nearby traffic he opened the pack of custard creams two small biscuits suddenly he felt ravenous hed seen a snack machine in the lobby plenty of change in his pockets he made the tea added milk sat down on the sofa for want of any other distractions he turned the tv on the tea was fine the tea was absolutely fine no complaints there he picked up the phone and called jack morton did i wake you not really hows it going i wanted a drink today so whats new rebus could hear his friend making himself comfortable jack had helped rebus get off the booze jack had said he could phone any time he liked i had to talk to this scumbag tommy telford i know the name rebus lit a cigarette i think a drink would have helped before or after both rebus smiled guess where i am now jack couldnt so rebus told him the story whats your angle jack asked i dont know rebus thought about it she seems to need me its been a long time since anyones felt like that as he said the words he feared they didnt tell the whole story he remembered another argument with rhona her screaming that hed exploited every relationship hed ever had do you still want that drink jack was asking im a long way from one rebus stubbed out his cigarette sweet dreams jack he was on his second cup of tea when she came back in wearing the same clothes her hair wet and hanging in ratstails better he asked making the thumbsup sign she nodded smiling do you want some tea he pointed to the kettle she nodded again so he made her a cup then he suggested a trip to the snack machine their haul included crisps nuts chocolate and a couple of cans of coke another cup of tea finished off the tiny cartons of milk rebus lay along the sofa shoes off watching soundless television candice lay on the bed fullyclothed sliding the occasional crisp from its packet flicking channels she seemed to have forgotten he was there he took this as a compliment he must have fallen asleep the touch of her fingers on his knee brought him awake she was standing in front of him wearing the tshirt and nothing else she stared at him fingers still resting on his knee he smiled shook his head led her back to bed made her lie down she lay on her back arms stretched he shook his head again and pulled the duvet over her thats not you any more he told her goodnight candice rebus retreated to the sofa lay down again and wished she would stop saying his name the doors wishful sinful a tapping at the door brought him awake still dark outside hed forgotten to close the window and the room was cold the tv was still playing but candice was asleep duvet kicked off chocolate wrappers strewn around her bare legs and thighs rebus covered her up then tiptoed to the door peered through the spyhole and opened up for this relief much thanks he whispered to siobhan clarke she was carrying a bulging polythene bag thank god for the twentyfourhour shop they went inside clarke looked at the sleeping woman then went over to the sofa and started unpacking the bag for you she whispered a couple of sandwiches god bless the child for sleeping beauty some of my clothes theyll do till the shops open rebus was already biting into the first sandwich cheese salad on white bread had never tasted finer how am i getting home he asked i called you a cab she checked her watch itll be here in two minutes what would i do without you its a tossup either freeze to death or starve she closed the window now go on get out of here he looked at candice one last time almost wanting to wake her to let her know he wasnt leaving for good but she was sleeping so soundly and siobhan could take care of everything so he tucked the second sandwich into his pocket tossed the roomkey on to the sofa and left fourthirty the taxi was idling outside rebus felt hungover he went through a mental list of all the places he could get a drink at this time of night he didnt know how many days it had been since hed had a drink he wasnt counting he gave his address to the cabbie and settled back thinking again of candice so soundly asleep and protected for now and of sammy too old now to need anything from her father shed be asleep too snuggling into ned farlowe sleep was innocence even the city looked innocent in sleep he looked at the city sometimes and saw a beauty his cynicism couldnt touch someone in a bar recently years back had challenged him to define romance how could he do that hed seen too much of loves obverse people killed for passion and from lack of it so that now when he saw beauty he could do little but respond to it with the realisation that it would fade or be brutalised he saw lovers in princes street gardens and imagined them further down the road at the crossroads where betrayal and conflict met he saw valentines in the shops and imagined puncture wounds real hearts bleeding not that hed voiced any of this to his public bar inquisitor define romance had been the challenge and rebuss response hed picked up a fresh pint of beer and kissed the glass he slept till nine showered and made some coffee then he phoned the hotel and siobhan assured him all was well she was a bit startled when she woke up and saw me instead of you kept saying your name i told her shed see you again so whats the plan shopping one quick swoop on the gyle after that fettes dr colquhouns coming in at noon for an hour well see what we get rebus was at his window looking down on a damp arden street take care of her siobhan no problem rebus knew thered be no problem not with siobhan this was her first real action with the crime squad shed be doing her damnedest to make it a success he was in the kitchen when the phone rang is that inspector rebus whos speaking a voice he didnt recognise inspector my name is david levy weve never met i apologise for calling you at home i was given this number by matthew vanderhyde old man vanderhyde rebus hadnt seen him in a while yes i must say i was astonished when it transpired he knew you the voice was tinged with a dry humour but by now nothing about matthew should surprise me i went to him because he knows edinburgh yes laughter on the line im sorry inspector i cant blame you for being suspicious when ive made such a mess of the introductions i am a historian by profession ive been contacted by solomon mayerlink to see if i might offer assistance mayerlink rebus knew the name placed it mayerlink ran the holocaust investigation bureau and exactly what assistance does mr mayerlink think i need perhaps we could discuss it in person inspector im staying in a hotel on charlotte square the roxburghe could we meet there this morning ideally rebus looked at his watch an hour he suggested perfect goodbye inspector rebus called into the office told them where hed be they sat in the roxburghes lounge levy pouring coffee an elderly couple in the far corner beside the window pored over sections of newspaper david levy was elderly too he wore blackrimmed glasses and had a small silver beard his hair was a silver halo around a scalp the colour of tanned leather his eyes seemed constantly moist as if hed just chewed on an onion he sported a duncoloured safari suit with blue shirt and tie beneath his walkingstick rested against his chair now retired hed worked in oxford new york state tel aviv itself and several other locations around the globe i never came into contact with joseph lintz however no reason why i should our interests being different so why does mr mayerlink think you can help me levy put the coffee pot back on its tray milk sugar rebus shook his head to both then repeated his question well inspector levy said tipping two spoonfuls of sugar into his own cup its more a matter of moral support moral support you see many people before you have been in the same position in which you now find yourself im talking about objective people professionals with no axe to grind and no real stake in the investigation rebus bristled if youre suggesting im not doing my job a pained look crossed levys face please inspector im not making a very good job of this am i what i mean is that there will be times when you will doubt the validity of what you are doing youll doubt its worth his eyes gleamed perhaps youve already had doubts rebus said nothing he had a drawerful of doubts especially now that he had a real living breathing case candice candice who might lead to tommy telford you could say im here as your conscience inspector levy winced again no i didnt put that right either you already have a conscience thats not under debate he sighed the question youve no doubt been pondering is the same one ive asked myself on occasions can time wash away responsibility for me the answer would have to be no the thing is this inspector levy leaned forward you are not investigating the crimes of an old man but those of a young man who now happens to be old focus your mind on that there have been investigations before halfhearted affairs governments wait for these men to die rather than have to try them but each investigation is an act of remembrance and remembrance is never wasted remembrance is the only way we learn like weve learned with bosnia youre right inspector as a race weve always been slow to take in lessons sometimes they have to be hammered home and you think im your carpenter were there jews in villefranche rebus couldnt remember reading of any does it matter im just wondering why the interest to be honest inspector there is a slight ulterior motive levy sipped coffee considering his words the rat line wed like to show that it existed that it operated to save nazis from possible tormentors he paused that it worked with the tacit approval the more than tacit approval of several western governments and even the vatican its a question of general complicity what you want is for everyone to feel guilty we want recognition inspector we want the truth isnt that what you want matthew vanderhyde would have me believe it is your guiding principle he doesnt know me very well i wouldnt be so sure of that meantime there are people out there who want the truth to stay hidden the truth being that known war criminals were brought back to britain and elsewhere and offered new lives new identities in exchange for what the cold war was starting inspector you know the old saying my enemys enemy is my friend these murderers were protected by the secret services military intelligence offered them jobs there are people who would rather this did not become general knowledge so so a trial an open trial would expose them youre warning me about spooks levy put his hands together almost in an attitude of prayer look im not sure this has been a completely satisfactory meeting and for that i apologise ill be staying here for a few days maybe longer if necessary could we try this again i dont know well think about it wont you levy extended his right hand rebus took it ill be right here inspector thank you for seeing me take care mr levy shalom inspector at his desk rebus could still feel levys handshake surrounded by the villefranche files he felt like the curator of some museum visited only by specialists and cranks evil had been done in villefranche but had joseph lintz been responsible and even if he had had he perhaps atoned during the past halfcentury rebus phoned the procuratorfiscals office to let them know how little progress he was making they thanked him for calling then he went to see the farmer come in john what can i do for you sir did you know the crime squad had set up a surveillance on our patch you mean flint street so you know about it they keep me informed whos acting as liaison the farmer frowned as i say john they keep me informed so theres no liaison at street level the farmer stayed silent by rights there should be sir what are you getting at john i want the job the farmer stared at his desk youre busy on villefranche i want the job sir john liaison means diplomacy its never been your strongest suit so rebus explained about candice and how he was already tied into the case and since im already in sir he concluded i might as well act as liaison what about villefranche that remains a priority sir the farmer looked into his eyes rebus didnt blink all right then he said at last youll let fettes know ill let them know thank you sir rebus turned to leave john the farmer was standing behind his desk you know what im going to say youre going to tell me not to tread on too many toes not to go off on my own little crusade to keep in regular contact with you and not betray your trust in me does that just about do it sir the farmer shook his head smiling bugger off he said rebus buggered off when he walked into the room candice rose so quickly from her chair that it fell to the floor she came forward and gave him a hug while rebus looked at the faces around them ormiston claverhouse dr colquhoun and a wpc they were in an interview room at fettes lothian and borders police hq colquhoun was wearing the same suit as the previous day and the same nervous look ormiston was picking up candices chair hed been standing against one wall claverhouse was seated at the table beside colquhoun a pad of paper in front of him pen poised above it she says shes happy to see you colquhoun translated id never have guessed candice was wearing new clothes denims too long for her and turned up four inches at the ankle a black woollen vneck jumper her skiing jacket was hanging over the beck of her chair get her to sit down again will you claverhouse said were pushed for time there was no chair for rebus so he stood next to ormiston and wpc candice went back to the story shed been telling but glanced regularly towards him he noticed that beside claverhouses pad of paper sat a brown folder and an asized envelope on top of the envelope sat a black and white surveillance shot of tommy telford this man claverhouse asked tapping the photo she knows him colquhoun asked then listened to her answer she he cleared his throat she hasnt had any direct dealings with him her twominute commentary reduced to this claverhouse dipped into the envelope spread more photos before her candice tapped one of them prettyboy claverhouse said he picked up the photo of telford again but shes had dealings with this man too shes colquhoun mopped his face shes saying something about japanese people oriental businessmen rebus shared a look with ormiston who shrugged where was this claverhouse asked in a car more than one car you know a sort of convoy she was in one of the cars yes where did they go they headed out of town stopping once or twice juniper green candice said quite clearly juniper green colquhoun repeated they stopped there no they stopped before that to do what colquhoun spoke with candice again she doesnt know she thinks one of the drivers went into a shop for some cigarettes the others all seemed to be looking at a building as if they were interested in it but not saying anything what building she doesnt know claverhouse looked exasperated she wasnt giving him much of anything and rebus knew that if there was nothing she could trade crime squad would dump her straight back on the street colquhoun was all wrong for this job completely out of his depth where did they go after juniper green just drove around the countryside for two or three hours she thinks they would stop sometimes and get out but just to look at the scenery lots of hills and colquhoun checked something hills and flags flags flying from buildings no stuck into the ground claverhouse gave ormiston a look of hopelessness golf courses rebus said try describing a golf course to her dr colquhoun colquhoun did so and she nodded agreement beaming at rebus claverhouse was looking at him too just a guess rebus said with a shrug japanese businessmen its what they like about scotland claverhouse turned back to candice ask her if she accommodated any of these men colquhoun cleared his throat again colour flooding his cheeks as he spoke candice looked down at the table moved her head in the affirmative started to speak she says thats why she was there she was fooled at first she thought maybe they just wanted a pretty woman to look at they had a nice lunch the beautiful drive but then they came back into town dropped the japanese off at a hotel and she was taken up to one of the hotel rooms three of them she as you put it yourself d s claverhouse she accommodated three of them does she remember the name of the hotel she didnt where did they have lunch a restaurant next to flags and colquhoun corrected himself next to a golf course how long ago was this two or three weeks and how many of them were there colquhoun checked the three japanese and maybe four other men ask her how long shes been in edinburgh rebus asked colquhoun did so she thinks maybe a month a month working the street funny we havent picked her up she was put there as a punishment for what claverhouse asked rebus had the answer for making herself ugly he turned to candice ask her why she cuts herself candice looked at him and shrugged whats your point ormiston asked she thinks the scars will deter punters which means she doesnt like the life shes been leading and helping us is her only sure ticket out something like that so colquhoun asked her again then said they dont like that she does it thats why she does it tell her if she helps us she wont ever have to do anything like that again colquhoun translated glancing at his watch does the name newcastle mean anything to her claverhouse asked colquhoun tried the name ive explained to her that its a town in england built on a river dont forget the bridges rebus said colquhoun added a few words but candice only shrugged she looked upset that she was failing them rebus gave her another smile what about the man she worked for claverhouse asked the one before she came to edinburgh she seemed to have plenty to say about this and kept touching her face with her fingers while she talked colquhoun nodded made her stop from time to time so he could translate a big man fat he was the boss something about his skin a birthmark maybe certainly something distinctive and glasses like sunglasses but not quite rebus saw claverhouse and ormiston exchange another look it was all too vague to be much use colquhoun checked his watch again and cars a lot of cars this man crashed them maybe he got a scar on his face ormiston offered glasses and a scar arent going to get us very far claverhouse added gentlemen colquhoun said while candice looked towards rebus im afraid im going to have to leave any chance of coming back in later sir claverhouse asked you mean today i thought maybe this evening look i do have other commitments we appreciate that sir meantime dc ormiston will run you back into town my pleasure ormiston said all charm they needed colquhoun after all they had to keep him sweet one thing colquhoun said theres a refugee family in fife from sarajevo theyd probably take her in i could ask thank you sir claverhouse said maybe later on eh colquhoun seemed disappointed as ormiston led him away rebus walked over to claverhouse who was shuffling his photos together bit of an oddball claverhouse commented not used to the real world not much help either rebus looked towards candice mind if i take her out what just for an hour claverhouse stared at him shes been cooped up here and only her hotel room to look forward to ill drop her back there in an hour hour and a half bring her back in one piece preferably with a smile on her face rebus motioned for candice to join him japanese and golf courses claverhouse mused what do you think telford s a businessman we know that businessmen do deals with other businessmen he runs bouncers and slot machines whats the japanese connection rebus shrugged i leave the hard questions to the likes of you he opened the door and john claverhouse warned nodding towards candice shes crime squad property okay and remember you came to us no bother claverhouse and by the way im your b division liaison since when with immediate effect if you dont believe me ask your boss this might be your case but telford works out of my territory he took candice by the arm and marched her from the room he stopped the car on the corner of flint street its okay candice he said seeing her agitation were staying in the car everythings all right her eyes were darting around looking for faces she didnt want to see rebus started the car again and drove off look he told her were leaving knowing she couldnt understand im guessing this is where you started from that day he looked at her the day you went to juniper green the japanese would be staying in a central hotel somewhere pricey you picked them up then headed east along dalry road maybe he was speaking for his own benefit christ i dont know look candice anything you see anything that looks familiar just let me know okay okay had she understood no she was smiling all shed heard was that final word all she knew was that they were heading away from flint street he took her down on to princes street first was it a hotel here candice the japanese was it here she gazed from the window with a blank look he headed up lothian road usher hall he said sheraton any of it ring a bell nothing did out along the western approach road slateford road and on to lanark road most of the lights were against them giving her plenty of time to study the buildings each newsagents they passed rebus pointed it out just in case the convoy had paused there to buy cigarettes soon they were out of town and entering juniper green juniper green she said pointing at the signpost delighted to have something to show him rebus attempted a smile there were plenty of golf courses around the city he couldnt hope to take her to every one of them not in a week never mind an hour he stopped for a few moments by the side of a field candice got out so he followed lit a cigarette there were two stone gateposts next to the road but no sign of a gate between them or any sort of path behind them once there might have been a track and a house at the end of it atop one of the pillars sat the badly worn representation of a bull candice pointed towards the ground behind the other pillar where another lump of carved stone lay halfcovered by weeds and grass looks like a serpent rebus said maybe a dragon he looked at her itll all mean something to somebody she looked back at him blankly he saw sammys features reminded himself that he wanted to help her he was in danger of letting that slip of focusing on how she might help them get to telford back in the car he branched off towards livingston intending to head for ratho and from there back into town then he noticed that candice had turned to look out of the back window what s it she came out with a stream of words her tone uncertain rebus turned the car anyway and drove slowly back the way theyd just come he stopped at the side of the road opposite a low drystone wall beyond which lay the undulations of a golf course recognise it she mumbled more words rebus pointed here yes she turned to him said something which sounded apologetic its okay he told her lets take a closer look anyway he drove to where a vast iron doublegate stood open a sign to one side read poyntinghame golf and country club beneath it bar lunches and a la carte visitors welcome as rebus drove through the gates candice started nodding again and when an oversized georgian house came into view she almost bounced in her seat slapping her hands against her thighs i think i get the picture rebus said he parked outside the main entrance squeezing between a volvo estate and a lowslung toyota out on the course three men were finishing their round as the final putt went in hands went to wallets and money changed hands two things rebus knew about golf one to some people it was a religion two a lot of players liked a bet theyd bet on final tally each hole even every shot if they could and didnt the japanese have a passion for gambling he took candices arm as he escorted her into the main building piano music from the bar panatella smoke and oakpanelling huge portraits of selfimportant unknowns a few old wooden putters framed behind glass a poster advertised a halloween dinnerdance for that evening rebus walked up to reception explained who he was and what he wanted the receptionist made a phone call then led them to the chief executives office hugh malahide bald and thin midforties already had a slight stammer which intensified when rebus asked his first question by throwing it back at the questioner he seemed to be playing for time have we had any japanese visitors recently well we do get a few golfers these men came to lunch maybe a fortnight three weeks back there were three of them plus three or four scottish men probably driving range rovers the table may have been reserved in the name of telford telford thomas telford ah yes malahide wasnt enjoying this at all you know mr telford in a manner of speaking rebus leaned forward in his chair go on well hes look the reason i seem so reticent is because we dont want this made common knowledge i understand sir mr telford is acting as gobetween gobetween in the negotiations rebus saw what malahide was getting at the japanese want to buy poyntinghame you understand inspector im just the manager here i mean i run the daytoday business but youre the chief executive with no personal share in the club the actual owners were set against selling at first but an offer has been made and i believe its a very good one and the potential buyers well theyre persistent have there been any threats mr malahide he looked horrified what sort of threats forget it the negotiations havent been hostile if thats what you mean so these japanese the ones who had lunch here they were representing the consortium the consortium being i dont know the japanese are always very secretive some big company or corporation id guess any idea why they want poyntinghame ive wondered that myself and everyone knows the japanese love golf it might be a prestige thing or it could be that theyre opening a plant of some kind in livingston and poyntinghame would become the factory social club malahide shivered at the thought rebus got to his feet youve been very helpful sir anything else you can tell me look this has been off the record inspector ive no problem with that i dont suppose youve got any names names of the diners that day malahide shook his head im sorry not even credit card details mr telford paid cash as usual did he leave a big tip inspector smiling some secrets are sacrosanct lets keep this conversation that way too sir all right malahide looked at candice shes a prostitute isnt she i thought as much the day they were here there was revulsion in his voice tarty little thing arent you candice stared at him looked to rebus for help said a few words neither man understood whats she saying malahide asked she says she once had a punter who looked just like you he dressed in plusfours and made her whack him with a mashieniblick malahide showed them out rebus telephoned claverhouse from candices room could be something or nothing claverhouse said but rebus could tell he was interested which was good the longer he stayed interested the longer hed want to hang on to candice ormiston was on his way to the hotel to resume babysitting duties what i want to know is how the hell did telford land something like this good question claverhouse said its way out of his previous sphere isnt it as far as we know a chauffeur service for jap companies maybe hes after the contract to supply their gaming machines rebus shook his head i still dont get it not your problem john remember that i suppose so there was a knock at the door sounds like ormiston i doubt it hes just left rebus stared at the door claverhouse wait on the line he left the receiver on the bedside table the knock was repeated rebus motioned for candice whod been flicking through a magazine on the sofa to move into the bathroom then he crept up to the door and put his eye to the spyhole a woman the dayshift receptionist he unlocked the door yes letter for your wife he stared at the small white envelope which she was trying to hand him letter she repeated there was no name or address on the envelope no stamp rebus took it and held it to the light a single sheet of paper inside and something flat and square like a photograph a man handed it in at reception how long ago two three minutes what did he look like she shrugged tallish short brown hair he was wearing a suit took the letter out of a briefcase how do you know who its for he said it was for the foreign woman he described her to a t rebus was staring at the envelope okay thanks he mumbled he closed the door went back to the telephone what is it claverhouse asked someones just dropped off a letter for candice rebus tore open the envelope holding the receiver between shoulder and chin there was a polaroid photo and a single sheet handwritten in small capitals foreign words what does it say claverhouse asked i dont know rebus tried a couple of words aloud candice had emerged from the bathroom she snatched the paper from him and read it quickly then fled back into the bathroom it means something to candice rebus said theres a photo too he looked at it shes on her knees gamming some fat bloke description the cameras not exactly interested in his face claverhouse weve got to get her away from here hang on till ormiston arrives they might be trying to panic you if they want to snatch her one cop in a car isnt going to cause much of a problem two cops just might how did they know well think about that later rebus was staring at the bathroom door remembering the locked cubicle at st leonard s ive got to go be careful rebus put down the receiver candice he tried the door it was locked candice he stood back and kicked the door wasnt as strong as the one in st leonard s he nearly took it off its hinges she was seated on the toilet a plastic safety razor in her hand slashing it across her arms there was blood on her tshirt blood spraying the white tiled floor she started screaming at him the words collapsing into monosyllables rebus grabbed the razor nicked his thumb in the process he pulled her off the toilet flushed the razor and started wrapping towels around her arms the note was lying in the bath he waved it in her face theyre trying to scare you thats all not even halfbelieving it himself if telford could find her this quickly if he had the means of writing to her in her own language then he was much stronger much cleverer than rebus had suspected its going to be okay he went on i promise its all okay well look after you well get you out of here take you somewhere he cant get to you i promise candice look this is me talking but she was bawling tears dripping from her cheeks head shaking from side to side for a time shed actually believed in knights on white chargers now she was realising how stupid shed been the coast seemed to be clear rebus took her in his car ormiston tucked in behind no other way to play it it was a tradeoff a speedy exit versus hanging around for a cavalry escort and the way candice was bleeding they couldnt afford to wait the drive to the hospital was nervetingling then there was the wait while her wounds were checked and some of them sewn up rebus and ormiston waited in a ampe drinking coffee from beakers asking one another questions they couldnt answer how did he know who did he get to write the note why give us a warning why not just grab her what does the note say it struck rebus that they were near the university he took dr colquhouns card from his pocket and phoned his office colquhoun was in rebus read the message out to him spelling some of the word they sound like addresses colquhoun said untranslatable addresses are any towns named i dont think so sir well be taking her to fettes if shes well enough any chance you could meet us there its important everything with you chaps is important yes sir but this is important candices life may be in danger colquhoun took time answering i suppose in that case ill send a car for you after an hour she was well enough to leave the cuts werent too deep the doctor said not lifethreatening they werent meant to be rebus turned to ormiston she thinks shes going back to telford thats why she did it she knows shes going back to him candice looked as though all the blood had been drained from her her face seemed more skeletal than before and her eyes darker rebus tried to recall what her smile looked like he doubted hed be seeing one for a while she kept her arms folded protectively in front of her and wouldnt meet his eyes rebus had seen suspects act that way in custody people for whom the world had become a trap at fettes claverhouse and colquhoun were already waiting rebus handed over the note and photo as i said inspector colquhoun stated addresses ask her what they mean claverhouse demanded they were in the same room as before candice knew her place and was already seated her arms still folded showing creamcoloured bandages and pink plasters colquhoun asked but it was as though hed ceased to exist candice stared at the wall in front of her unblinking her only motion a slight rocking to and fro ask her again claverhouse said but rebus interrupted before colquhoun could start ask her if people she knows live there people who are important to her as colquhoun formed the question the rocking grew slightly in intensity there were fresh tears in her eyes her mother and father brothers and sisters colquhoun translated candice tried to stop her mouth trembling maybe she left a kid behind as colquhoun asked candice flew from her chair shouting and screaming ormiston tried to grab her but she kicked out at him when shed calmed she subsided in a corner of the room arms over her head shes not going to tell us anything colquhoun translated she was stupid to believe us she just wants to go now theres nothing she can help us with rebus and claverhouse shared a look we cant hold her john not if she wants to leave its been dodgy enough keeping her away from a lawyer once she starts asking to go he shrugged come on man rebus hissed shes shitscared and with good reason and now youve got all youre going to get out of her youre just going to hand her back to telford look its not a question of hell kill her you know he will if he was going to kill her shed be dead claverhouse paused hes cleverer than that he knows damned well all he had to do was give her a fright he knows her it sticks in my craw too but what can we do just keep her a few days see if we cant cant what you want to hand her over to immigration its an idea get her the hell away from here claverhouse pondered this then turned to colquhoun ask her if she wants to go back to sarajevo colquhoun asked she slurred some answer choking back tears she says if she goes back theyll kill everyone silence in the room they were all looking at her four men men with jobs family ties men with lives of their own in the scheme of things they seldom realised how well off they were and now they realised something else how helpless they were tell her claverhouse said quietly shes free to walk out of here at any time if thats what she really wants if she stays well do our damnedest to help her so colquhoun spoke to her and she listened and when hed finished she pushed herself back on to her feet and looked at them then she wiped her nose on her bandages pushed the hair out of her eyes and walked to the door dont go candice rebus said she halfturned towards him okay she said then she opened the door and was gone rebus grabbed claverhouses arm weve got to pull telford in warn him not to touch her you think he needs telling you think hed listen ormiston added i cant believe this he scared her half to death and as a result we let her walk i really cant get my head round this she could always have gone to fife colquhoun said with candice out of the room he seemed to have perked up a bit bit late now ormiston said he beat us this time thats all claverhouse said his eyes on rebus but well take him down dont worry he managed a thin humourless smile dont think were giving up john its not our style early days yet pal early days she was waiting for him out in the car park standing by the passengerdoor of his battered saab okay she said okay he agreed smiling with relief as he unlocked the car he could think of only one place to take her as he drove through the meadows she nodded recognising the treelined playing fields youve been here before she said a few words nodded again as rebus turned into arden street he parked the car and turned to her youve been here she pointed upwards fingers curled into the shape of binoculars with telford telford she said she made a show of writing something down and rebus took out his notebook and pen handed them over she drew a teddy bear you came in telford s car rebus interpreted and he watched one of the flats up there he pointed to his own flat yes yes when was this she didnt understand the question i need a phrasebook he muttered then he opened his door got out and looked around the cars around him were all empty no range rovers he signalled for candice to get out and follow him she seemed to like his livingroom went straight to the record collection but couldnt find anything she recognised rebus went into the kitchen to make coffee and to think he couldnt keep her here not if telford knew about the place telford why had he been watching rebuss flat the answer was obvious he knew the detective was linked to cafferty and therefore a potential threat he thought rebus was in caffertys pocket know your enemy it was another rule telford had learned rebus phoned a contact from the scotland on sunday business section japanese companies rebus said rumours pertaining to can you narrow that down new sites around edinburgh maybe livingston rebus could hear the reporter shuffling papers on his desk theres a whisper going round about a microprocessor plant in livingston thats one possibility anything else nope why the interest cheers tony rebus put down the receiver looked across at candice he couldnt think where else to take her hotels werent safe one place came to mind but it would be risky well not so very risky he made the call sammy he said any chance you could do me a favour sammy lived in a colonies flat in shandon parking was almost impossible on the narrow street outside rebus got as close as he could sammy was waiting for them in the narrow hallway and led them into the cramped livingroom there was a guitar on a wicker chair and candice lifted it setting herself on the chair and strumming a chord sammy rebus said this is candice hello there sammy said happy halloween candice was putting chords together now hey thats oasis candice looked up smiled oasis she echoed ive got the cd somewhere sammy examined a tower of cds next to the hifi here it is shall i put it on yes yes sammy switched the hifi on told candice she was going to make some coffee and beckoned for rebus to follow her into the kitchen so who is she the kitchen was tiny rebus stayed in the doorway shes a prostitute against her will i dont want her pimp getting her wheres she from again sarajevo and she doesnt have much english hows your serbocroat rusty rebus looked around wheres your boyfriend out working on the book rebus didnt like ned farlowe partly it was that name neds were what the sunday post called hooligans they robbed old ladies of their pension books and walkingframes those were the neds of this world and farlowe meant chris farlowe out of time a number one that should have belonged to the stones farlowe was researching a history of organised crime in scotland sods law sammy said he needs money to buy the time

keep it short just say youre doing your dad a favour you think a journalists going to be content with that if he loves you the kettle boiled clicked off sammy poured water into three mugs through in the livingroom candices interest had shifted to a pile of american comic books rebus drank his coffee then left them to their music and their comics instead of going home he made for young street and the ox ordering a mug of instant fifty pee pretty good deal when you thought about it fifty pence for what half a pint a pound a pint cheap at twice the price well onepointseven times the price which would take it to the price of a beer give or take not that rebus was counting the back room was quiet just somebody scribbling away at the table nearest the fire he was a regular a journalist of some kind rebus thought of ned farlowe who would want to know about candice but if anyone could keep him at bay sammy could rebus took out his mobile phoned colquhouns office sorry to bother you again he said what is it now the lecturer sounded thoroughly exasperated those refugees you mentioned any chance you could have a word with them well i colquhoun cleared his throat yes i suppose i could talk to them does that mean candice is safe i dont have their number here colquhoun sounded fuddled again can it wait till i go home phone me when youve talked to them and thanks rebus rang off finished his coffee and called siobhan clarke at home i need a favour he said feeling like a broken record how much trouble will it get me in almost none can i have that in writing think im stupid rebus smiled i want to see the files on telford why not just ask claverhouse id rather ask you its a lot of stuff do you want photocopies whatever ill see what i can do voices were raised in the front bar youre not in the ox are you as it happens yes drinking a mug of coffee she laughed in disbelief and told him to take care rebus ended the call and stared at his mug people like siobhan clarke they could drive a man to drink it was am when the buzzer sounded telling him there was someone at his tenements main door he staggered along was all to the intercom and asked who the bloody hell it was he the croissant man a rough english voice replied the what come on dickbrain wakeywakey memorys not so hot the e days eh a name tilted into rebuss head abernethy now open up its perishing down here rebus pushed the buzzer to let abernethy in then jogged back the bedroom to put on some clothes his mind felt numb abernethy was a di in special branch london the last time he d been in edinburgh had been to chase terrorists rebus wondered what the hell he was doing here now when the doorbell sounded rebus tucked in his shirt and walked back down the hall true to his word abernethy was carrying a bag of croissants he hadnt changed much same faded denims and black leather bomber same cropped brown hair spiked with gel his face was heavy pockmarked and his eyes an unnerving psycho paths blue howve you been mate abernethy slapped rebuss shoulder and marched past him into the kitchen get the kettle on like they did this every day of the week like they didnt live four hundred miles apart abernethy what the hell are you doing here feeding you of course same thing the english have always done for the jocks got any butter try the butterdish plates rebus pointed to a cupboard bet you drink instant am i right abernethy lets get this ready first then talk okay the kettle boils quicker if you switch it on at the plug right and i think theres some jam any honey do i look like a bee abernethy smirked old georgie flight sends his love by the way word is hell be retiring soon george flight another ghost from rebuss past abernethy had unscrewed the top from the coffee jar and was sniffing the granules how fresh is this he wrinkled his nose no class john unlike you you mean when did you get here hit town half an hour ago from london stopped a couple of hours in a layby got my head down that a is murder though north of newcastle its like coming into a thirdworld country did you drive four hundred miles just to insult me they took everything through to the table in the livingroom rebus shoving aside books and notepads stuff about the second world war so he said as they sat down im assuming this isnt a social call actually it is in a way i could have just telephoned but i suddenly thought wonder how the old devils getting on next thing i knew i was in the car and heading for the north circular im touched ive always tried to keep track of what youre up to why because last time we met well youre different arent you am i i mean youre not a team player youre a loner bit like me loners can be useful useful for undercover jobs that are a bit out of the ordinary you think im special branch material ever fancied moving to london its where the action is i get action enough up here abernethy looked out of the window you couldnt wake this place with a fiftymegaton warhead look abernethy not that im not enjoying your company or anything but why are you here abernethy brushed crumbs from his hands so much for the social niceties he took a gulp of coffee squirmed at its awfulness war crimes he said rebus stopped chewing theres a new list of names you know that because youve got one of them living on your doorstep so so im heading up the london hq weve established a temporary war crimes unit my jobs to collate gen on the various investigations create a central register you want to know what i know thats about it and you drove through the night to find out theres got to be more to it abernethy laughed whys that there just has a collators job is for someone good at office work thats not you youre only happy in the field what about you id never have taken you for a historian abernethy tapped one of the books on the table its a penance what makes you think its any different with me so whats the score with herr lintz theres no score so far all the darts have missed the board how many cases are there twentyseven originally but eight of those are deceased any progress abernethy shook his head we got one to court trial collapsed first day cant prosecute if theyre gaga well for your information heres where the lintz case stands i cant prove he was and is josef linzstek i cant disprove his story of his participation in the war or how he came to britain rebus shrugged same tale ive been hearing up and down the country what did you expect rebus was picking at a croissant shame about this coffee abernethy said any decent gaffs in the neighbourhood so they went to a cafe where abernethy ordered a double espresso rebus a decaf there was a story on the front of the record about a fatal stabbing outside a nightclub the man reading the paper folded it up when hed finished his breakfast and took it away with him any chance youll be talking to lintz todayabernethy asked suddenly why thought i might tag along its not often you get to meet someone who might have killed seven hundred frenchies morbid attraction were all a bit that way inclined arent we ive nothing new to ask him rebus said and hes already been muttering to his lawyer about harassment hes wellconnected rebus stared across the table youve done your reading abernethy the conscientious cop well youre right he has friends in high places only a lot of them have been hiding behind the curtains since this all started sounds like you think hes innocent until proven guilty abernethy smiled lifted his cup theres a jewish historian been going around has he contacted you whats his name another smile how many jewish historians have you been in touch with his names david levy you say hes been going around a week here a week there asking how the cases are going hes in edinburgh just now abernethy blew on his coffee so youve spoken with him yes as it happens and and what did he try his rat line story again why the interest hes tried it with everyone else what if he has jesus do you always answer a question with a question look as collator this guy levys name has popped up on my computer screen more than once thats why im interested abernethy the conscientious cop thats right so shall we go see lintz well seeing youve come all this way on the way back to the flat rebus stopped at a newsagents and bought the record the stabbing had taken place outside megans nightclub a new establishment in portobello the fatality had been a doorman william tennant aged the story had made the front page because a premier league footballer had been on the periphery of the incident a friend whod been with him had received minor cuts the attacker had fled on a motorbike the footballer had offered no comment to reporters rebus knew him he lived in linlithgow and a year or so back had been caught speeding in edinburgh with in his own words a wee bitty charlie meaning cocaine on his person anything interesting abernethy asked someone killed a bouncer quiet little backwater eh a story like that in london it wouldnt rate a column inch how long are you staying here ill be off today want to drop in on carlisle theyre supposed to have another old nazi after that its blackpool and wolverhampton before home a sucker for punishment rebus drove them the tourist route down the mound and across princes street he double parked in heriot row but joseph lintz wasnt home never mind he said i know where hell probably be he took them down inverleith row and turned right into warriston gardens stopping at the cemetery gates what is he a gravedigger abernethy got out of the car and zipped his jacket he plants flowers flowers what for im not sure a cemetery should have been about death but warriston didnt feel that way to rebus much of it resembled a rambling park into which some statuary had been dropped the newer section with stone driveway soon gave way to an earthen path between fading inscriptions there were obelisks and celtic crosses lots of trees and birds and the electric movements of squirrels a tunnel beneath a walkway took you to the oldest part of the cemetery but between tunnel and driveway sat the heart of the place with its rollcall of edinburgh s past names like ovenstone cleugh and flockhart and professions such as actuary silk merchant ironmonger there were people whod died in india and some whod died in infancy a sign at the gate informed visitors that the place had been the subject of a compulsory purchase by the city of edinburgh because previous private owners had let it fall into neglect but that same neglect was at least part of its charm people walked their dogs here or came to practise photography or just mused among the tombstones gays came looking for company others for solitude after dark of course the place had another reputation entirely a leith prostitute a woman rebus had known and liked had been found murdered here earlier in the year rebus wondered if joseph lintz knew about that mr lintz he was trimming the grass around a headstone doing so with a halfsized pair of garden shears there was a sheen of sweat on his face as he forced himself upright ah inspector rebus you have brought a colleague this is d i abernethy abernethy was examining the headstone which belonged to a teacher called cosmo merriman they let you do this he asked his eyes finally finding lintzs no one has tried to stop me inspector rebus tells me you plant flowers too people assume i am a relative but youre not are you only in so far as we are the family of man inspector abernethy youre a christian then yes i am born and bred lintz took out a handkerchief and wiped his nose youre wondering if a christian could commit an atrocity like villefranche its perhaps not in my interest to say this but i think it entirely possible ive been explaining this to inspector rebus rebus nodded weve had a couple of talks religious belief is no defence you see look at bosnia plenty of catholics involved in the fighting plenty of good muslims too good in that they are believers and what they believe is that their faith gives them the right to kill bosnia rebus saw a sharp image of candice escaping the terror only to end up more terrified still and more trapped than ever lintz was stuffing the large white handkerchief into the pocket of his baggy brown cord trousers in the outfit green rubber overshoes green woollen jersey tweed jacket he did look like a gardener little wonder he attracted so little attention in the cemetery he blended in rebus wondered how artful it was how deeply hed learned the skill of invisibility you look impatient inspector abernethy youre not a man for theories am i right i wouldnt know about that sir in that case you must not know very much now inspector rebus he listens to what i have to say more than that he looks interested whether he is or not i cant judge but his performance if performance it be is exemplary lintz always spoke like this like hed been rehearsing each line last time he visited my home we discussed human duality would you have any opinion on that inspector abernethy the look on abernethys face was cold no sir lintz shrugged case against the londoner proven atrocities inspector occur by an effort of the collective will spelling it out sounding like the lecturer he had once been because sometimes all it takes to turn us into devils is the fear of being an outsider abernethy sniffed hands in pockets sounds like youre justifying war crimes sir sounds to me like you might even have been there yourself do i need to be a spaceman to imagine mars he turned to rebus gave him the fraction of a smile well maybe im just a bit too simple sir abernethy said im also a bit parky lets walk back to the car and carry on our discussion there all right while lintz packed his few small tools into a canvas bag rebus looked around saw movement in the distance between headstones the crouched figure of a man splitsecond glimpse of a face he recognised what is it abernethy asked rebus shook his head nothing the three men walked in silence back to the saab rebus opened the back door for lintz to his surprise abernethy got into the back too rebus took the drivers seat felt warmth returning slowly to his toes abernethy had his arm along the back of the seat his body twisted towards lintz now herr lintz my role in all this is quite straightforward im collating all the information on this latest outbreak of alleged old nazis you understand that with allegations such as these very serious allegations we have a duty to investigate spurious allegations rather than serious ones in which case youve nothing to worry about except my reputation when youre exonerated well take care of that rebus was listening closely none of this sounded like abernethy the hostile graveside tone had been replaced by something much more ambiguous and meantime lintz seemed to be picking up whatever the londoner was saying between the lines rebus felt deliberately excluded from the conversation which was why abernethy had got into the back seat in the first place hed placed a physical barrier between himself and the officer investigating joseph lintz there was something going on meantime abernethy said cooperate as fully as you can with my colleague the sooner hes able to reach his conclusions the sooner this will all be over the problem with conclusions is that they should be conclusive and i have so little proof this was wartime inspector abernethy a lot of records destroyed without proof either way theres no case to answer lintz was nodding i see he said abernethy hadnt voiced anything rebus himself didnt feel the problem was hed voiced it to the suspect it would help if your memory improved rebus felt obliged to add well mr lintz abernethy was saying thanks for your time his hand was on the elderly mans shoulder protective comforting can we drop you somewhere ill stay here a little longer lintz said opening the door and easing himself out abernethy handed the bag of tools to him take care now he said lintz nodded gave a small bow to rebus and shuffled back towards the gate abernethy climbed into the passenger seat rum little bugger isnt he you as good as told him he was off the hook bollocks abernethy said i told him where he stands let him know the score thats all he saw the look on rebuss face come on do you really want to see him in court an old professor who keeps cemeteries tidy it doesnt make it any easier if you sound like youre on his side even supposing he did order that massacre you think a trial and a couple of years in clink till he snuffs it is the answer better to just give them all a bloody good scare stuff the trial and save the taxpayer millions thats not our job rebus said starting the engine he took abernethy back to arden street they shook hands abernethy trying to sound like he wanted to stay a little longer one of these days he said and then he was gone as his sierra drew away another car pulled into the space hed just vacated siobhan clarke got out bringing with her a supermarket carrier bag for you she said and i think im owed a coffee she wasnt as fussy as abernethy accepted the mug of instant with thanks and ate a spare croissant there was a message on the answering machine dr colquhoun telling him the refugee family could take candice tomorrow rebus jotted down the details then turned his attention to the contents of siobhans carrierbag maybe two hundred sheets of paper photocopies dont get them out of order she warned i didnt have time to staple them fast work i went back into the office last night thought id get it done while no one was about i can summarise if you like just tell me who the main players are she came to the table and pulled a chair over beside him found a sequence of surveillance shots put names to the faces brian summers she said better known as prettyboy he runs most of the working girls pale angular face thick black lashes a pouting mouth candices pimp hes not very pretty clarke found another picture kenny houston from prettyboy to plugugly im sure his mother loves him prominent teeth jaundiced skin what does he do he runs the doormen kenny prettyboy and tommy telford grew up on the same street theyre at the heart of the family she sifted through more photos malky jordan he keeps the drugs flowing sean haddow bit of a brainbox runs the finances ally cornwell hes muscle deek mcgrain theres no religious divide in the family prods and papes working together a model society no women though telford s philosophy relationships get in the way rebus picked up a sheaf of paper so what have we got everything but the evidence and surveillance is supposed to provide that she smiled over the top of her mug you dont agree its not my problem and yet youre interested she paused candice i dont like what happened to her well just remember you didnt get this stuff from me thanks siobhan he paused everything going all right fine i like crime squad bit livelier than st leonard s i miss brian meaning her onetime partner now out of the force you ever see him no do you rebus shook his head got up to show her out he spent about an hour sifting through the paperwork learning more about the family and its convoluted workings nothing about newcastle nothing about japan the core of the family eight or nine of them had been at school together three of them were still based in paisley taking care of the established business the rest were now in edinburgh and busy prying the city away from big ger cafferty he went through lists of nightclubs and bars in which telford had an interest there were incident reports attached arrests in the vicinity drunken brawls swings taken at bouncers cars and property damaged something caught rebuss eye mention of a hotdog van parked outside a couple of the clubs the owner questioned possible witness but hed never seen anything worth the recall name gavin tay mr taystee recent dodgy suicide rebus gave bill pryde a bell asked how that investigation was going dead end street pal pryde said not sounding too concerned pryde too long the same rank and not going anywhere beginning the long descent into retirement did you know he ran a hotdog stall on the side might explain where he got the cash from gavin tay was an excon hed been in the icecream business a little over a year successful too new mere parked outside his house his financial records hadnt hinted at money to spare his widow couldnt account for the mere and now evidence of a job on the side selling food and drink to punters stumbling out of nightclubs tommy telfords nightclubs gavin tay previous convictions for assault and reset a persistent offender whod finally gone straight the room began to feel stuffy rebuss head clotted and aching he decided to get out walked through the meadows and down george iv bridge took the playfair steps down to princes street a group was sitting on the stone steps of the scottish academy unshaven dyed hair torn clothes the citys dispossessed trying their best not to be ignored rebus knew he had things in common with them in the course of his life hed failed to fit several niches husband father lover he hadnt fit in with the armys ideas of what he should be and wasnt exactly one of the lads in the police when one of the group held out a hand rebus offered a fiver before crossing princes street and heading for the oxford bar he settled into a corner with a mug of coffee got out his mobile and called sammys flat she was home all was well with candice rebus told her he had a place for candice she could move out tomorrow thats fine sammy said hold on a second there was a rustling sound as the receiver was passed along hello john how are you rebus smiled hello candice thats very good thank you sammy is uh i am teaching how to she broke into laughter handed the receiver back im teaching her english sammy said i can tell we started with some oasis lyrics just went from there ill try to come round later what did ned say he was so shattered when he came home i think he barely noticed is he there id like to talk to him hes out working what did you say he was doing again i didnt right thanks again sammy see you later he took a swig of coffee washed it around his mouth abernethy he couldnt just let it go he swallowed the coffee and called the roxburghe asked for david levys room levy speaking its john rebus inspector how good to hear from you is there something i can do id like to talk to you are you in your office rebus looked around in a manner of speaking its a twominute walk from your hotel turn right out of the door cross george street and walk down to young street far end the oxford bar im in the back room when levy arrived rebus bought him a half of eightybob levy eased himself into a chair hanging his walkingstick on the back of it so what can i do for you im not the only policeman youve spoken to no youre not someone from special branch in london came to see me today and he told you id been travelling around yes did he warn you against speaking to me not in so many words levy took off his glasses began polishing them i told you there are people whod rather this was all relegated to history this man he came all the way from london just to tell you about me he wanted to see joseph lintz ah levy was thoughtful your interpretation inspector i was hoping for yours my utterly subjective interpretation rebus nodded he wants to be sure of lintz this man works for special branch and as everyone knows special branch is the public arm of the secret services he wanted to be confident i wasnt going to get anything out of lintz levy nodded staring at the smoke from rebuss cigarette this case was like that one minute you could see it the next you couldnt like smoke i have a little book with me levy said reaching into his pocket id like you to read it its in english translated from the hebrew its about the rat line rebus took the book does it prove anything that depends on your terms concrete proof concrete proof exists inspector in this book levy shook his head under lock and key in whitehall kept from scrutiny by the hundred year rule so theres no way to prove anything theres one way what if someone talks if we can get just one of them to talk thats what this is all about wearing down their resistance looking for the weakest link levy smiled again we have learned patience inspector he finished his drink im so grateful you called this has been a much more satisfactory meeting will you send your bosses a progress report levy chose to ignore this well talk again when youve read the book he stood up the special branch officer ive forgotten his name i didnt give it levy waited a moment then said ah that explains it then is he still in edinburgh he watched rebus shake his head then hes probably on his way to carlisle yes rebus sipped coffee offered no comment my thanks again inspector levy said undeterred thanks for dropping by levy took a final look around your office he said shaking his head the rat line was an underground railway delivering nazis sometimes with the help of the vatican from their soviet persecutors the end of the second world war meant the start of the cold war intelligence was necessary as were intelligent ruthless individuals who could provide a certain level of expertise it was said that klaus barbie the butcher of lyons had been offered a job with british intelligence it was rumoured that highprofile nazis had been spirited away to america it wasnt until that the united nations released its full list of fugitive nazi and japanese war criminals forty thousand of them why so late in releasing the list rebus thought he could understand modern politics had decreed that germany and japan were part of the global brotherhood of capitalism in whose interests would it be to reopen old wounds and besides how many atrocities had the allies themselves hidden who fought a war with clean hands rebus whod grown to adulthood in the army could comprehend this hed done things hed served time in northern ireland seen trust disfigured hatred replace fear part of him could well believe in the existence of a rat line the book levy had given him went into the mechanics of how such an operation might have worked rebus wondered was it really possible to disappear completely to change identity and again the recurring question did any of it matter there did exist sources of identification and there had been court cases eichmann barbie demjanjuk with others ongoing he read about war criminals who rather than being tried or extradited were allowed to return home running businesses growing rich dying of old age but he also read of criminals who served their sentences and became good people people who had changed these men said war itself was the real culprit rebus recalled one of his first conversations with joseph lintz in the drawingroom of lintzs home the old mans voice was hoarse a scarf around his throat at my age inspector a simple throat infection can feel like death there didnt seem to be many photographs around lintz had explained that a lot had gone missing during the war along with other mementoes i do have these photos though hed shown rebus half a dozen framed shots dating back to the s as hed explained who the subjects were rebus had suddenly thought what if hes making it up what if these are just a bunch of old photos he picked up somewhere and had framed and the names the identities he now gave to the faces had he invented them hed seen in that instant for the first time how easy it might be to construct another life and then later in their conversation that day lintz sipping honeyed tea had started discussing villefranche ive been thinking a lot about it inspector as you might imagine this lieutenant linzstek he was in charge on the day yes but presumably under orders from above a lieutenant is not so very far up the pecking order perhaps you see if a soldier is under orders then they must carry out those orders no even if the order is insane nevertheless id say the person was at the very least coerced into committing the crime and a crime that very many of us would have carried out under similar circumstances cant you see the hypocrisy of trying someone when youd probably have done the same thing yourself one soldier standing out from the crowd saying no to the massacre would you have made that stand yourself i hope so rebus thinking back to ulster and the mean machine levys book didnt prove anything all rebus knew was that josef linzsteks name was on a list as having used the rat line posing as a pole but where had the list originated in israel again it was highly speculative it wasnt proof and if rebuss instincts told him lintz and linzstek were one and the same they were still failing to tell him whether it mattered he dropped the book back to the roxburghe asked the receptionist to see that mr levy got it i think hes in his room if youd like to rebus shook his head he hadnt left any message with the book knowing levy might interpret this as a message in itself he went home for his car drove down to haymarket and along to shandon as usual parking near sammys flat was a problem everyone was home from work and tucked in front of their televisions he climbed the stone steps wondering how treacherous theyd get when the frosts came and rang the bell sammy herself led him into the living room where candice was watching a game show hello john she said are you my wonderwall im nobodys wonderwall candice he turned to sammy everything all right just fine at that moment ned farlowe walked in from the kitchen he was eating soup from a bowl dunking a folded slice of brown bread into it mind if i have a word rebus said farlowe shook his head then jerked it in the direction of the kitchen can i eat while we talk im starving he sat down at the foldaway table got another slice of bread from the packet and spread margarine on it sammy put her head round the doorway saw the look on her fathers face and made a tactical retreat the kitchen was about seven foot square and too full of pots and appliances swinging a cat you could have done a lot of damage i saw you today rebus said skulking in warriston cemetery coincidence what do you think im asking you rebus leaned his back against the sink unit folded his arms im watching lintz why because im being paid to by a newspaper lintzs lawyer has interim interdicts flying around nobody can afford to be seen near him but they still want him watched if theres a court case coming they want to know as much as possible stands to reason by court case farlowe didnt mean any trial of lintz but rather of the newspapers themselves for libel if he catches you he doesnt know me from adam besides thered always be somebody to take my place now do i get to ask a question let me say something first you know im investigating lintz farlowe nodded that means were too close if you find out anything people might think it came from me i havent told sammy what im doing specifically so theres no conflict of interests im just saying others might not believe it a few more days ill have enough money to fund the book for another month farlowe had finished his soup he carried the empty bowl over to the sink stood next to rebus i dont want this to be a problem but the bottom line is what can you do about it rebus stared at him his instinct was to stuff farlowes head into the sink but how would that look with sammy now farlowe said do i get to ask my question what is it whos candice a friend of mine so whats wrong with your flat rebus realised he was no longer dealing with his daughters boyfriend he was confronted with a journalist someone with a nose for a story tell you what said rebus say i didnt see you in the cemetery say we didnt just have this little chat and i dont ask about candice rebus stayed quiet farlowe considered the deal say i get to ask you a few questions for my book what sort of questions about cafferty rebus shook his head i could talk about tommy telford though when when weve got him behind bars farlowe smiled i could be on the pension by then he waited saw rebus was going to give him nothing shes only here till tomorrow anyway rebus said wheres she off to rebus just winked left the kitchen returned to the livingroom talked to sammy while candices game show reached its climax whenever she heard audience laughter she joined in rebus made arrangements for the following day then left there was no sign of farlowe hed either hidden himself in the bedroom or else gone back out it took rebus a few moments to remember where hed parked his car he drove home carefully stopped for all the lights the parking spaces were all taken in arden street he left the saab on a yellow line as he approached his tenement door he heard a car door open and spun towards the sound it was claverhouse he was on his own mind if i come in rebus thought of a dozen reasons for saying yes but he shrugged and made for the door any news of the stabbing at megans he asked how did you know wed be interested a bouncer gets stabbed the attacker flees on a waiting motorbike it was premeditated and the majority of the bouncers work for tommy telford they were climbing the stairs rebuss flat was on the second floor well youre right claverhouse said billy tennant worked for telford he controlled the traffic in and out of megans traffic as in dope the footballers friend the one who got wounded hes a known dealer works out of paisley therefore connected to telford too were speculating he was the target tennant just got in the way leaving only one question who was behind it come on john it was cafferty obviously not caffertys style rebus said unlocking his door maybe hes learned a thing or two from the young pretender make yourself at home rebus said walking down the hall the breakfast things were still on the dining table siobhans bag of goodies was down the side of a chair a guest claverhouse had noticed the two mugs two plates he looked around shes not here now though she wasnt here for breakfast either because shes at your daughters rebus froze i went to settle up with the hotel they said a police car had come and taken all her things away so then i asked around and the driver gave me samanthas address as the dropoff claverhouse sat down on the sofa crossed one leg over the other so whats the game john and how come youve seen fit to leave me on the bench he sounded calm now but rebus could tell thered been a storm do you want a drink i want an answer when she walked out she waited beside my car i couldnt think where to take her so i brought her here but she recognised the street telford had been watching my flat claverhouse looked interested why maybe because i know cafferty i couldnt let candice stay here so i took her to sammys is she still there rebus nodded so what happens now theres a place she can go the refugee family for how long what do you mean claverhouse sighed john shes the only life shes known here is prostitution rebus went over to the hifi for something to do looked through his tapes he needed to do something whats she going to do for money are you going to provide what does that make you rebus dropped a cd turned on his heels nothing like that he spat claverhouse had his hands up palms showing come on john you know yourself theres i dont know anything john look get out will you it wasnt just that it had been a long day more that it felt like the day would never end he could feel the evening stretch to infinity no rest available to him in his head bodies were swaying gently from trees while smoke engulfed a church telford was on his arcade motorbike cannoning off spectators abernethy was touching an old mans shoulder soldiers were riflebutting civilians and john rebus john rebus was in every frame trying hard to remain an onlooker he put van morrison on the hifi hardnose the highway hed played this music on east neuk beaches and tenement stakeouts it always seemed to heal him or at least patch the wounds when he turned back into the room claverhouse was gone he looked out of his window two kids lived in the secondmoor flat across from his hed watched them often from this window and they never once saw him for the simple reason that they never so much as glanced outside their world was complete and allabsorbing anything outside their window an irrelevance they were in bed now their mother closing the shutters quiet city abernethy was right about that there were large chunks of edinburgh where you could live your whole life and never encounter a spot of bother yet the murder rate in scotland was double that of its southern neighbour and half those murders took place in the two main cities not that the statistics mattered a death was a death something unique had disappeared from the world one murder or several hundred they all meant something to the survivors rebus thought of villefranches sole existing survivor he hadnt met her probably never would another reason it was hard to get passionate about a historical case in a contemporary one you had many of the facts to hand and could talk to witnesses you could gather forensic evidence question peoples stories you could measure guilt and grief you became part of the whole story this was what interested rebus the people interested him their stories fascinated him when part of their lives he could forget his own he noticed the answeringmachine was flashing one message oh hello there im um i dont know how to put this placed the voice kirstin mede she sighed look i cant do this any more so please dont im sorry i just cant there are other people who can help you im sure one of them end of message rebus stared down at the machine he didnt blame her i cant do this any more that makes two of us rebus thought the only thing was he had to keep going he sat down at his table and pulled the villefranche paperwork towards him lists of names and occupations ages and dates of birth picat mesplede rousseau deschamps wine merchant china painter cartwright housemaid what did any of it mean to a middleaged scot he pushed it aside and lifted siobhans paperwork on to the table off with van the man on with side one of wish you were here scratched to hell he remembered it had come in a black polythene wrapper when opened thered been this smell which afterwards hed learned was supposed to be burning flesh i need a drink he said to himself sitting forward in his chair i want a drink a few beers maybe with whiskies attached something to smooth the edges he looked at his watch not even near to closing time not that it mattered much in edinburgh the land that closing time forgot could he make it to the ox before they shut up shop yes too easily it was nicer to have a challenge wait an hour or so and then repeat the debate or call jack morton or go out right now the telephone rang he picked it up hello john making it sound like sean hello candice whats up up is there a problem problem no i just wanting i say to you see you tomorrow he smiled yes see you tomorrow you speak very good english i was chained to a razor blade what line from song oh right but youre not chained to it now she didnt seem to understand im uh its okay candice see you tomorrow yes see you rebus put down the receiver chained to a razor blade suddenly he didnt want a drink any more he picked candice up the next afternoon she had two carrier bags her worldly belongings she gave sammy as much of a hug as her bandaged arms would allow see you again candice sammy said yes see you thanks lost for an ending to the sentence candice opened her arms wide bags swinging they stopped off at mcdonalds her choice for something to eat zappa and the mothers cruising for burgers the day was bright and crisp just right for crossing the forth bridge rebus took it slowly so candice could take in the view he was heading towards fifes east neuk a cluster of fishing villages popular with artists and holidaymakers out of season lower largo seemed practically deserted though rebus had an address he stopped to ask directions finally he parked in front of a small terraced house candice stared at the red door until he gestured for her to follow him he hadnt been able to make her understand what they were doing here hoped mr and mrs petrec would make a better job of it the door was opened by a woman in her earlyforties she had long black hair and peered at him over halfmoon glasses then her attention shifted to candice and she said something in a language both women understood candice replied looking a little shy not sure what was going on come in please mrs petrec said my husband is in the kitchen they sat around the kitchen table mr petrec was heavily built with a thick brown moustache and wavy brown and silver hair a pot of tea was produced and mrs petrec drew her chair beside candices and began talking again shes explaining to the girl mr petrec said rebus nodded sipped the strong tea listened to a conversation he could not understand candice cautious at first grew more animated as she told her story and mrs petrec was a skilled listener sympathising showing shared horror and exasperation she was taken to amsterdam told there would be a job there for her mr petrec explained i know this has happened to other young women i think she left a child behind a son yes shes telling my wife about him what about you rebus asked how did you end up here i was an architect in sarajevo no easy decision leaving your whole life behind he paused we went to belgrade first a refugee bus brought us to scotland he shrugged that was nearly five years ago now i am a house painter a smile distance no object rebus looked at candice who had started crying mrs petrec comforting her we will look after her mrs petrec said staring at her husband later at the door rebus tried to give them some money but they wouldnt take it is it all right if i come and see her sometime but of course he stood in front of candice her real name is dunya mrs petrec said quietly dunya rebus tried out the word she smiled her eyes softer than rebus remembered them as if some transformation were beginning she bent forward kiss the girl she said a peck on both cheeks her eyes filling with tears again rebus nodded to let her know he understood everything at his car he waved once and she blew him another kiss then he drove around the corner and stopped gripping the steeringwheel herd he wondered if shed cope if shed learn to forget he thought again of his exwifes words what would she think of him now had he exploited dunya no but he wondered if that was only because she hadnt been able to give him anything on telford he felt he had somehow failed to do the right thing so far the only choice shed had to make was when shed waited for him by his car rather than going back to telford before then and after all the decisions had been taken for her in a sense she was still as trapped as ever because the locks and chains were in her mind they were what she expected from life it would take time for her to change to begin trusting the world again the petrecs would help her heading south down the coast thinking about families he decided to visit his brother mickey lived on an estate in kirkcaldy his red bmw parked in the driveway he was just home from work and suitably surprised to see rebus chrissie and the kids are at her mums he said i was going to grab a curry for dinner how about a beer maybe just a coffee rebus said he sat in the lounge until mickey returned toting a couple of old shoeboxes look what i dug out of the attic last weekend thought you might like a look milk and sugar a spot of milk while mickey went to the kitchen to fetch the coffee rebus examined the boxes they were filled with packets of photographs the packets had dates on them some with questionmarks rebus opened one at random holiday snaps a fancy dress parade a picnic rebus didnt have any pictures of his parents and the photos startled him his mother had thicker legs than he remembered but a tidy body too his father used the same grin in every shot a grin rebus shared with mickey digging further into the box he found one of himself with rhona and sammy they were on a beach somewhere the wind playing havoc peter gabriel family snapshot rebus couldnt place it at all mickey came back through with a mug of coffee and a bottle of beer there are some he said i dont know who the people are relatives maybe grandma and granddad im not sure id be much help mickey handed over a menu here he said best indian in town pick what you want so rebus chose and mickey phoned the order in twenty minutes till delivery rebus was on to another packet these photos were older still the s his father in uniform the soldiers wore hats like mcdonalds counter staff they also wore long khaki shorts malaya written on the backs of some india on the others remember the old man got himself wounded in malaya mickey said no he didnt he showed us the wound it was in his knee rebus was shaking his head uncle jimmy told me it was a cut dad got playing football he kept picking the scab off ended with a scar he told us it was a war wound he was fibbing mickey had started on the other box here look at these handing over an inchthick collection of postcards and photographs secured with an elastic band rebus pulled the band off turned the cards over saw his own writing the photos were of him too posed snaps badly taken where did you get these you always used to send me a card or a photo dont you remember they were all from rebuss own army days id forgotten he said once a fortnight usually a letter to dad a card for me rebus sat back in his chair and started to go through them judging by the postmarks they were in chronological sequence training then service in germany and ulster more exercises in cyprus malta finland and the desert of saudi arabia the tone of each postcard was breezy so that rebus failed to recognise his own voice the cards from belfast consisted of almost nothing but jokes yet rebus remembered that as one of the most nightmarish periods of his life i used to love getting them mickey said smiling ill tell you you almost had me joining up rebus was still thinking of belfast the closed barracks the whole compound a fortress after a shift out on the streets there was no way to let off steam booze gambling and fights all taking place within the same four walls all culminating in the mean machine and here were these postcards here was the image of rebuss past life that mickey had lived with these past twentyodd years and it was all a lie or was it where did the reality lie other than in rebuss own head the postcards were fake documents but they were also the only ones in existence there was nothing to contradict them nothing except rebuss word it was the same with the rat line the same with joseph lintzs story rebus looked at his brother and knew he could break the spell right now all he had to do was tell him the truth whats the matter mickey asked nothing ready for that beer yet the foodll be here any second rebus stared at the cooling mug of coffee more than ready he said putting the rubber band back around his past but ill stick to this he lifted the mug toasted his brother next morning rebus went to st leonards telephoned the ncis centre at prestwick and asked if they had anything connecting british criminals to european prostitution his reasoning someone had brought candice she was still candice to him from amsterdam to britain and he didnt think it was telford whoever it was rebus would get to them somehow he wanted to show candice her chains could be broken he got ncis to fax him what information they had most of it concerned the tippelzone a licensed car park where drivers went for sex it was worked by foreign prostitutes mainly most of them lacking work permits many smuggled in from eastern europe the main gangs seemed to be from former yugoslavia ncis had no names for any of these kidnapperscumpimps there was nothing about prostitutes making the trip from amsterdam to britain rebus went into the car park to smoke his second cigarette of the day there were a couple of other smokers out there a small brotherhood of social pariahs back in the office the farmer wanted to know if there was any progress on lintz maybe if i brought him in and slapped him around a bit rebus suggested be serious will you the farmer growled stalking back to his office rebus sat down at his desk and pulled forward a file your problem inspector lintz had said to him once is that youre afraid of being taken seriously you want to give people what you think they expect i mention the ishtar gate and you talk of some hollywood movie at first i thought this was meant to rouse me to some indiscretion but now it seems more a game you are playing against yourself rebus seated in his usual chair in lintzs drawingroom the view from the window was of queen street gardens they were kept locked you had to pay for a key do educated people frighten you rebus looked at the old man no are you sure dont you perhaps wish you were more like them lintz grinned showing small discoloured teeth intellectuals like to see themselves as historys victims prejudiced against arrested for their beliefs even tortured and murdered but karadzic thinks himself an intellectual the nazi hierarchy had its thinkers and philosophers and even in babylon lintz got up poured himself more tea rebus declined a refill even in babylon inspector lintz continued getting comfortable again with its opulence and its artistry with its enlightened king do you know what they did nebuchadnezzar held the jews captive for seventy years this splendid aweinspiring civilisation do you begin to see the madness inspector the flaws that run so deep in us maybe i need glasses lintz threw his cup across the room you need to listen and to learn you need to understand the cup and saucer lay on the carpet still intact tea was soaking into the elaborate design where it would become all but invisible he parked on buccleuch place the slavic studies department was housed in one of the tenements he tried the secretarys office first asked if dr colquhoun was around i havent seen him today when rebus explained what he wanted the secretary tried a couple of numbers but didnt find anyone then she suggested he take a look in their library which was one floor up and kept locked she handed him a key the room was about sixteen feet by twelve and smelled stuffy the shutters across the windows were closed giving the place no natural light a no smoking sign sat on one of four desks on another sat an ashtray with three butts in it one entire wall was shelved filled with books pamphlets magazines there were boxes of press cuttings and maps on the walls showing yugoslavia s changing demarcation lines rebus lifted down the most recent box of cuttings like a lot of people he knew rebus didnt know much about the war in exyugoslavia hed seen some of the news reports been shocked by the pictures then had got on with his life but if the cuttings were to be believed the whole region was being run by war criminals the implementation force seemed to have done its damnedest to avoid confrontation there had been a few arrests recently but nothing substantial out of a meagre seventyfour suspects charged only seven had been apprehended he found nothing about slave traders so thanked the secretary and gave her back her key then crawled through the city traffic when the call came on his mobile he nearly went off the road candice had disappeared mrs petrec was distraught theyd had dinner last night breakfast this morning and dunya had seemed fine there was a lot she said she couldnt tell us mr petrec said standing behind his seated wife hands stroking her shoulders she said she wanted to forget and then shed gone out for a walk down to the harbour and hadnt returned lost maybe though the village was small mr petrec had been working his wife had gone out asking people if theyd seen her and mrs muirs son she said he told me shed been taken away in a car where was this rebus asked just a couple of streets away mr petrec said show me outside his home on seaford road eddie muir aged eleven told rebus what hed seen a car stopping beside a woman a bit of chat though he couldnt hear it the door opening the woman getting in which door eddie one of the back ones had to be there were two of them in the car already men eddie nodded and the woman got in by herself i mean they didnt grab her or anything eddie shook his head he was straddling his bike keen to be going one foot kept testing a pedal can you describe the car big a bit flash not from round here and the men didnt really get a good look driver was wearing a pars shirt meaning a football shirt dunfermline athletic which would mean he was from fife rebus frowned a pickup could that be it candice back to her old ways so soon not likely not in a place like this on a street like this it was no chance encounter mrs petrec was right shed been snatched which meant someone had known where to find her had rebus been followed yesterday if he had theyd been invisible some device on his car it seemed unlikely but he checked wheelarches and the underbody nothing mrs petrec had calmed a little her husband having administered medicinal vodka rebus could use a shot himself but turned down the offer did she make any phone calls he asked petrec shook his head what about strangers hanging around the street i would have noticed after sarajevo its hard to feel safe inspector he opened his arms and heres the proof nowheres safe did you tell anyone about dunya who would we tell who knew that was the question rebus did and claverhouse and ormiston knew about the place because colquhoun had mentioned it colquhoun knew the nervy old slavic studies specialist knew on the way back to edinburgh rebus tried phoning him at office and home no reply hed told the petrecs to let him know if candice came back but he didnt think shed be coming back he remembered the look shed given him early on when hed asked her to trust him i wont be surprised if you let me down like shed known back then that hed fail and shed given him a second chance waiting for him beside his car and hed let her down he got back on his mobile and called jack morton jack he said for christs sake talk me out of having a drink he tried colquhouns home address and the slavic studies office both locked up tight then he drove to flint street and looked for tommy telford in the arcade but telford wasnt there he was in the cafes back office surrounded as usual by his men i want to talk to you rebus said so talk without the audience rebus pointed to prettyboy that one can stay telford took his time but finally nodded and the room began to empty prettyboy stood against a wall hands behind his back telford had his feet up on his desk leaning back in his chair they were relaxed confident rebus knew what he looked like a caged bear i want to know where she is who candice telford smiled still on about her inspector how should i know where she is because a couple of your boys grabbed her but as he spoke rebus realised he was making a mistake telfords gang was a family theyd grown up together in paisley not many dunfermline supporters that distant from fife he stared at prettyboy who ran telford s prostitutes candice had arrived in edinburgh from a city of bridges maybe newcastle telford had newcastle connections and the newcastle united strip vertical black and white lines was damned close to dunfermline s probably only a kid in fife could make the mistake a newcastle strip a newcastle car telford was talking but rebus wasnt listening he walked straight out of the office and back to the saab drove to fettes the crime squad offices and started looking he found a contact number for a ds miriam kenworthy tried the number but she wasnt there fuck it he told himself getting back into his car the a was hardly the countrys fastest road abernethy was right about that still without the daytime traffic rebus made decent time on his way south it was late evening when he arrived in newcastle pubs emptying queues forming outside clubs a few united shirts on display looking like prison bars he didnt know the city drove around it in circles passing the same signs and landmarks heading further out just cruising looking for candice or for girls who might know her after a couple of hours he gave up headed back into the centre hed had the idea of sleeping in his car but when he found a hotel with an empty room the thought of ensuite facilities suddenly seemed too good to miss he made sure there was no minibar a long soak with his eyes closed mind and body still racing from the drive he sat in a chair by his window and listened to the night taxis and yells delivery lorries he couldnt sleep he lay on the bed watching soundless tv remembering candice in the hotel room asleep under sweet wrappers deacon blue chocolate girl he woke up to breakfast tv checked out of the hotel and had breakfast in a cafe then called miriam kenworthys office relieved to find she was an early starter come right round she said sounding bemused youre only a couple of minutes away she was younger than her telephone voice face softer than her attitude it was a milkmaids face rounded the cheeks pink and plump she studied him swivelling slightly in her chair as he told her the story tarawicz she said when hed finished jake tarawicz real name joachim probably kenworthy smiled some of us around here call him mr pink eyes hes had dealings meetings anyway with this guy telford she opened the brown folder in front of her mr pink eyes has a lot of european connections you know chechnia in russia its russia s sicily if you know what i mean is that where tarawicz comes from its one theory the other is that hes serbian might explain why he set up the convoy what convoy running aid lorries to former yugoslavia a real humanitarian our mr pink but also a way of smuggling people out kenworthy looked at him youve been doing your homework call it an educated guess well it gets him noticed he got a papal blessing six months ago married to an englishwoman not for love she was one of his girls but it gives him residency here she nodded he hasnt been around that long five or six years like telford rebus thought but hes built himself a rep muscled in where there used to be asians turks story is he started with a nice line in stolen icons a ton of stuff has been lifted out of the soviet bloc and when that operation started drying he moved into prossies cheap girls and he could keep them docile with a bit of crack the crack comes up from london the yardies control that particular scene mr pink spreads their goods around the northeast he also deals heroin for the turks and sells some girls to triad brothels she looked at rebus saw she had his attention no racial barriers when it comes to business so i see probably also sells drugs to your friend telford who distributes them through his nightclubs probably weve no hard proof there was even a story going around that pink wasnt selling to telford he was buying rebus blinked telford s not that big she shrugged where would he get the stuff it was a story thats all but it had rebus thinking because it might help explain the relationship between tarawicz and telford what does tarawicz get out of it he asked making his thoughts flesh you mean apart from money well telford trains a good bouncer jock bouncers get respect down here then of course telford has shares in a couple of casinos a way for tarawicz to launder his cash rebus thought about this is there anything tarawicz doesnt have a finger in plenty he likes businesses which are fluid and hes still a relative newcomer eagles new kid in town we think hes been dealing arms a lot of stuff crossing into western europe the chechens seem to have weaponry to spare she sniffed gathered her thoughts sounds like hes one step ahead of tommy telford which would explain why telford was so keen to do business with him he was on a learning curve learning how to fit into the bigger picture yardies and asians turks and chechens and all the others rebus saw them as spokes on a huge wheel which was trundling mercilessly across the world breaking bones as it went why mr pink eyes he asked shed been awaiting the question slid a colour photo towards him it was the closeup of a face the skin pink and blistered white lesions running through it the face was puffy bloated and in its midst sat eyes hidden by bluetinted glasses there were no eyebrows the hair above the jutting forehead was thin and yellow the man looked like some monstrous shaved pig what happened to him he asked we dont know thats the way he looked when he arrived rebus remembered the description candice had given sunglasses looks like a carcrash victim dead ringer i want to talk to him rebus said but first kenworthy gave him a guided tour they took her car and she showed him where the street girls worked it was midmorning no action to speak of he gave her a description of candice and she promised shed put the word out they spoke with the few women they met they all seemed to know kenworthy werent hostile towards her theyre the same as you or me she told him driving away working to feed their kids or their habit that too of course in amsterdam theyve got a union doesnt help the poor sods whore shipped there kenworthy signalled at a junction youre sure he has her i dont think telford does someone knew addresses back in sarajevo addresses that were important to her someone shipped her out of there sounds like mr pink all right and hes the only one who can send her back she looked at him why would he do a thing like that just as rebus was thinking their surroundings couldnt get any grimmer all industrial decay gutted buildings and potholes kenworthy signalled to turn in at the gates of a scrapyard youre kidding he said three alsatians tethered by thirtyfoot chains barked and bounded towards the car kenworthy ignored them kept driving it was like being in a ravine either side of them stood precarious canyon walls of car wrecks hear that rebus heard it the sound of a collision the car entered a wide clearing and he saw a yellow crane dangling a huge grab from its arm pluck up the car it had dropped and lift it high before dropping it again on to the carcass of another a few men were standing at a safe distance smoking cigarettes and looking bored the grab dropped on to the roof of the top car denting it badly glass shimmered on the oily ground diamonds against black velvet jake tarawicz mr pink eyes was in the crane laughing and roaring as he picked up the car again worrying it the way a cat might play with a mouse without noticing it was dead if hed seen the new additions to his audience it didnt show kenworthy hadnt got out of her car immediately first shed fixed on a face from her repertoire when finally she was ready she nodded to rebus and they opened their doors simultaneously as rebus stood upright he saw that the grab had dropped the car and was swinging towards them kenworthy folded her arms and stood her ground rebus was reminded of those arcade games where you had to pick up a prize he could see tarawicz in the cab manipulating the controls like a kid with a toy he remembered tommy telford on his arcade bike and saw at once something the two men had in common neither had ever really grown up the motorised hum stopped suddenly and tarawicz dropped from the cab he was wearing a cream suit and emerald shirt open at the neck hed borrowed a pair of green wellies from somewhere so as to keep his trousers clean as he walked towards the two detectives his men stepped into line behind him miriam he said always a pleasure he paused or so the rumour goes a couple of his men grinned rebus recognised one face the crab thats what hed been called in central scotland his grip could crush bones rebus hadnt seen him in a long time and had never seen him so smartly groomed and dressed all right crab rebus said this seemed to disconcert tarawicz who halfturned towards his minion the crab stayed quiet but colour had risen to his neck up close it was hard not to stare at mr pink eyess face his eyes demanded that you meet them but you really wanted to study the flesh in which they sat he was looking at rebus now have we met no this is detective inspector rebus kenworthy explained hes come all the way from scotland to see you im flattered tarawiczs grin showed small sharp teeth with gaps between them i think you know why im here rebus said tarawicz made a show of astonishment do i telford needed your help he needed a home address for candice a note to her in serbocroat is this some sort of riddle and now youve taken her back have i rebus took a halfstep forward tarawiczs men fanned out either side of their boss there was a sheen on tarawiczs face which could have been sweat or some medical cream she wanted out rebus told him i promised id help her i never break a promise she wanted out she told you that tarawiczs voice was teasing one of the men behind cleared his throat rebus had been wondering about this man so much smaller and more reticent than the others better dressed and with sad drooping eyes and sallow skin now he knew lawyer and the cough was his way of warning tarawicz that he was saying too much im going to take tommy telford down rebus said quietly thats my promise to you once hes in custody who knows what hell say im sure mr telford can look after himself inspector which is more than can be said for candice the lawyer coughed again i want her kept off the streets rebus said tarawicz stared at him tiny black pupils like spots of absolute darkness can thomas telford go about his daily business unfettered he said at last behind him the lawyer almost choked you know i cant promise that rebus said its not me he has to worry about take a message to your friend tarawicz said and afterwards stop being his friend rebus realised then tarawicz was talking about cafferty telford had told him that rebus was caffertys man i think i can do that rebus said quietly then do it tarawicz turned away and candice ill see what i can do he stopped slid his hands into his jacket pockets hey miriam he said his back still to them i like you better in that red twopiece laughing he walked away get in the car kenworthy said through gritted teeth rebus got into the car she looked nervous dropped her keys bent to retrieve them whats wrong nothings wrong she snapped the red twopiece she glared at him i dont have a red twopiece she did a three pointturn hitting brakes and accelerator with a little more force than necessary i dont get it last week she said i bought some red underwear bra and pants she revved the engine part of his little game so how does he know thats what im wondering she shot past the dogs and out of the gate rebus thought of tommy telford and how hed been watching rebuss flat surveillance isnt always oneway he said knowing now whod taught telford the skill a little later he asked about the scrapyard he owns it hes got a compacter but before the cars get squashed he likes to play with them and if you cross him he welds your seatbelt shut she looked at him you become part of his game never get personally involved it was the golden rule and practically every case he worked rebus broke it he sometimes felt that the reason he became so involved in his cases was that he had no life of his own he could only live through other people why had he become so involved with candice was it down to her physical resemblance to sammy or was it that she had seemed to need him the way shed clung to his leg that first day had he wanted just for a little while to be someones knight in shining armour the real thing not some mockery john rebus complete bloody sham he phoned claverhouse from his car filled him in claverhouse told him not to worry thanks for that rebus said i feel a whole lot better now listen whos telford s supplier for what dope yes thats the real joker in the pack i mean he does business with newcastle but we cant be certain whos dealing and whos buying what if telford s selling then hes got a line from the continent what do drugs squad say they say not if hes landing the stuff from a boat it means transporting it from the coast much more likely hes buying from newcastle tarawicz has the contacts in europe makes you wonder why he needs tommy telford at all john do yourself a favour switch off for five minutes colquhoun seems to be keeping his head down did you hear me ill talk to you soon are you heading back in a manner of speaking rebus cut the call and drove strawman said morris gerald cafferty as he was escorted into the room by two prison guards earlier in the year rebus had promised cafferty he would put a glasgow gangster uncle joe toal behind bars it hadnt worked despite rebuss best efforts toal pleading old age and illness was still a free man like a war criminal excused for senility ever since then cafferty had felt rebus owed him cafferty sat down rolled his neck a few times loosening it so he asked rebus nodded for the guards to leave waited in silence until theyd gone then he slipped a quarterbottle of bell s from his pocket keep it cafferty told him from the look of you id say your need was greater than mine rebus put the bottle back in his pocket ive brought a message from newcastle cafferty folded his arms jake tarawicz rebus nodded he wants you to lay off tommy telford what does he mean come on cafferty that bouncer who got stabbed the dealer wounded theres war breaking out cafferty stared at the detective not my doing rebus snorted but looking into caffertys eyes he found himself almost believing so who was it he asked quietly how do i know nevertheless war is breaking out thats as may be whats in it for tarawicz he does business with tommy and to protect that he needs to have me warned off by a cop cafferty was shaking his head you really buy that i dont know rebus said one way to finish this cafferty paused take telford out of the game he saw the look on rebuss face i dont mean top him i mean put him away that should be your job strawman i only came to deliver a message and whats in it for you something in newcastle maybe are you tarawiczs man now you know me better than that do i cafferty sat back in his chair stretched out his legs i wonder about that sometimes i mean it doesnt keep me awake at night but i wonder all the same rebus leaned on the table you must have a bit salted away why cant you just be content with that cafferty laughed the air felt charged there might have been only the two of them left in the world you want me to retire a good boxer knows when to stop then neither of us would be much cop in the ring would we got any plans to retire strawman despite himself rebus smiled thought not do i have to say something for you to take back to tarawicz rebus shook his head that wasnt the deal well if he does come asking tell him to get some life insurance the kind with death benefits rebus looked at cafferty prison might have softened him but only physically id be a happy man if someone took telford out of the game cafferty went on know what i mean strawman itd be worth a lot to me rebus stood up no deal he said personally id be happy if you wiped one another out id be jumping for joy at ringside know what happens at ringside cafferty rubbed at his temples you tend to get spattered with blood as long as its someone elses the laughter came from deep within caffertys chest youre not a spectator strawman its not in your nature and youre some kind of psychologist maybe not said cafferty but i know what gets people excited book three cover my face as the animals cry running through the hospital stopping nurses to ask directions sweat dripping off him tie hanging loose around his neck taking right turns left turns looking for signs whose fault he kept asking himself that a message which failed to reach him because he was on a surveillance because he wasnt in radio contact because the station didnt know how important the message was nom running a stitch in his side hed run all the may from the car up two flights of stairs down corridors the place was quiet middle of the night maternity he called to a man pushing a trolley the man pointed to a set of doors he pushed through them three nurses in a glass cubicle one of them came out can i help im john rebus my wife she gave him a hard look third bed along pointing third bed along curtains closed around it he pulled the curtains open rhona lay on her side face still flushed hair sticking to her brow and beside her nuzzling into her a tiny perfection with wisps of brown hair and black unfocused eyes he touched the nose ran a finger round the curves of an ear the face twitched he bent past it to kiss his wife rhona im really sorry they didnt get the message to me until ten minutes ago how did it i mean hes beautiful hes a she his wife said turning away from him he didnt want anyone else taking his work it was his he owned it it owned him look john youre going to want some time off right i can handle things sir his gaze met the farmers please across the hall in the cid room he nodded as everyone came up to say how sorry they were one person stayed at their desk bill pryde knew rebus was coming to see him morning bill pryde nodded theyd met in the wee small hours at the infirmary ned farlowe had been napping in a chair so theyd stepped into the corridor to talk pryde looked tireder now he had loosened the top button of his dark green shirt his brown suit looked livedin thanks for sticking with it rebus said drawing over a chair thinking id rather have had someone else someone sharper no problem any news a couple of good eyewitnesses they were waiting to cross at the lights whats their story pryde considered his reply he knew he was dealing with a father as well as a cop she was crossing the road looked like she was heading down minto street maybe making for the bus stop rebus shook his head she was walking bill going to a friends in gilmour road shed said as much over the pizza apologising that she couldnt stay longer just one more coffee at the end of the meal one more coffee and she wouldnt have been there at that moment or if shed accepted his offer of a lift when you thought about life you thought of it as chunks of time but really all it was was a series of connected moments any one of which could change you completely the car was heading south out of town pryde went on looks like he ran a red light motorist sitting behind him seemed to think so reckon he was drunk pryde nodded way he was driving i mean could be he just lost control but in that case why didnt he stop description pryde shook his head weve got a dark car a bit sporty nobody caught the licence plate its a busy enough street mustve been other cars around a couple of people have called in pryde flicked through his notes nothing helpful but im going to interview them see if i can jog a memory or two could the car have been nicked maybe thats why he was in a hurry i can check ill help you pryde considered this you sure try and stop me bill no skid marks pryde said no sign that he tried braking either before or after they were standing at the junction of minto street and newington road the crossstreets were salisbury place and salisbury road cars vans and buses queued at the traffic lights as pedestrians crossed the road it could have been any one of you rebus thought any one of them could have taken sammys place she was about here pryde went on pointing to a spot where just past the lights a bus lane started the carriageway was wide a fourlane road she hadnt crossed at the lights shed been lazy carrying on down minto street a few strides then crossing in a diagonal when shed been a child theyd taught her about crossing the road green cross code all of that drummed it into her rebus looked around at the top of minto street were some private houses and bed amp breakfasts on one corner stood a bank on another a branch of remnant kings with a takeaway next door the takeaway would have been open rebus said pointing on the third corner stood a spar that place too where did you say she was the bus lane shed crossed three lanes been only a yard or two from safety witnesses say she was nearly at the kerb when he hit her i think he was drunk lost it for a second pryde nodded towards the bank there were two phone boxes in front of it witness called from there the wall behind the phone boxes had a poster glued to it grinning maniac behind a steeringwheel and some writing so many pedestrians so little time a computer game it would have been so easy to avoid her rebus said quietly rebus was sitting in his bosss office it was ninefifteen and he had slept for probably fortyfive minutes the previous night thered been the hospital vigil and sammys operation something about a blood clot she was still unconscious still critical hed called rhona in london shed told him shed catch the first train she could hed given her his mobile number so she could let him know when she arrived shed started to ask her voice had cracked shed put down the receiver hed tried to find some feeling for her richard and linda thompson withered and died hed called mickey who said hed drop by the hospital some time today and that was it for the family there were other people he could call people like patience who had been his lover for a time and sammys landlady until far more recently but he didnt he knew in the morning hed call the office where sammy worked he wrote it in his notebook so he wouldnt forget and then hed called sammys flat and given ned farlowe the news farlowe had asked a question nobody else had how about you are you all right rebus had looked around the hospital corridor not exactly ill be right there so theyd spent a couple of hours in one anothers company not really saying very much at first farlowe smoked and rebus helped him empty the pack he couldnt reciprocate with whisky there was nothing in the bottle but hed bought the young man several cups of coffee since farlowe had spent nearly all his money on the taxi from shandon wakeywakey john rebuss boss was shaking him gently rebus blinked straightened in his chair sorry sir chief superintendent watson went around the desk and sat down hellish sorry to hear about sammy i dont really know what to say except that shes in my prayers thank you sir do you want some coffee the farmers coffee had a reputation throughout the station but rebus accepted a mug gladly how is she anyway still unconscious no sign of the car not the last i heard whos handling it bill pryde started the ball rolling last night i dont know whos taken it from him ill find out the farmer made an internal call rebus watching him over the rim of his mug the farmer was a big man imposing behind a desk his cheeks were a mass of tiny red veins and his thin hair lay across the dome of his head like the lines of a wellfurrowed field there were photos on his desk grandchildren the photos had been taken in a garden there was a swing in the background one of the children was holding a teddy bear rebus felt his throat start to ache tried to choke it back the farmer put down the receiver bills still on it he said felt if he worked straight through we might get a quicker result thats good of him look well let you know the minute we get something but meantime youll probably want to go home no sir or to the hospital rebus nodded slowly yes the hospital but not right this minute he had to talk to bill pryde first and meantime ill reassign your cases the farmer started writing theres this war crimes thing and your liaison on telford are you working on anything else sir id prefer it if you i mean i want to keep working the farmer looked at him then leaned back in his chair pen balanced between his fingers why rebus shrugged i want to keep busy yes there was that and sure youre okay theres a cafe up the road im fine bill he looked around took a deep breath looks like offices behind the spar doubtful anyone would have been there but there are flats above remnant kings and the bank want to talk to them and the spar and the kebab shop you take the b ampbs and the houses meet back here in half an hour rebus talked to everyone he could find in the spar there was a new shift on but he got home phone numbers from the manager and called up the workers from the previous night they hadnt seen or heard anything first theyd known had been the flashing lights of the ambulance the kebab shop was closed but when rebus banged on the door a woman came through from the back wiping her hands on a teatowel he pressed his warrant card to the glass door and she let him in the shop had been busy last night she didnt see the accident she called it that the accident and thats what it was the word really hadnt sunk in until she said it elvis costello accidents will happen was the next line really its only hit and run no the woman said the first thing that caught my attention was the crowd i mean only three or four people but i could see they were standing around something and then the ambulance came will she be all right the look in her eyes was one rebus had encountered before it almost wanted the victim dead because then there was a story to be told shes in hospital he said unable to look at the woman any longer yes but the paper said shes in a coma what paper she brought him the first edition of the days evening news there was a paragraph on one of the inside pages hit and run coma victim it wasnt a coma she was unconscious that was all but rebus was thankful for the story maybe someone would read it and come forward maybe guilt would begin to press down on the driver maybe thered been a passenger it was hard to keep secrets usually you told someone he tried remnant kings but of course they had been closed last night so he climbed to the flats above there was no one home at the first flat he wrote a brief message on the back of a business card and pushed it through the letterbox then jotted down the surname on the door if they didnt call him hed call them a young man answered the second door he was just out of his teens and pushed a thick lock of black hair away from his eyes he wore buddy holly glasses and had acne scars around his mouth rebus introduced himself the hand went to the hair again a backward glance into the flat do you live here rebus asked mm yeah like im not the owner we rent it there were no names on the door anyone else in at the moment nope are you all students the young man nodded rebus asked his name rob robert renton whats this about there was an accident last night rob a hit and run so many times hed been in this situation passing on the bland news of another changed life it was a whole hour since hed telephoned the hospital in the end theyd taken his mobile number said it might be easier if they phoned him whenever there was news they meant easier for them not him oh yes renton was saying i saw it rebus blinked you saw it renton was nodding hair bobbing in front of his eyes from the window i was up changing a cd and is it okay if i come in for a minute i want to see what kind of view you had renton puffed out his cheeks exhaled well i suppose and rebus was in the livingroom was fairly tidy renton went ahead of him crossed to where a hifi rack sat between two windows i was putting on a new cd and i looked out of the window you can see the bus stop and i wondered if i might catch jane coming off a bus he paused janes erics girlfriend the words washed over rebus he was looking down on the street where sammy had been walking tell me what you saw this girl was crossing the road she was nicelooking i thought so anyway then this car came through the lights swerved and sent her flying rebus closed his eyes for a second she must have gone ten feet in the air hit that hedge bounced back on to the pavement she didnt move after that rebus opened his eyes he was at the window renton standing just behind his left shoulder down on the street people were crossing the road walking over the spot where sammy had been hit the spot where shed landed flicking ash on to the pavement where shed lain i dont suppose you saw the driver not from this angle any passengers couldnt tell he wears glasses rebus thought how reliable is he when you saw it happen you didnt go down im not a medical student or anything he nodded towards an easel in the corner and rebus noticed a shelf of paints and brushes someone ran to the phone box so i knew help was coming rebus nodded anyone else see it they were in the kitchen renton paused i know what youre thinking rebus doubted it youre thinking i wear specs so maybe i didnt see it right but he definitely swerved you know deliberately i mean like he was aiming for her he nodded to himself aiming for her renton made a movement with his hand imitating a car gliding off one course and on to another he steered straight for her the car didnt lose control that would have been jerkier wouldnt it what colour was the car dark green and the make renton shrugged im hopeless with cars tell you what though what renton took off his glasses started polishing them why dont i try sketching it for you he moved the easel over to the window and got to work rebus went into the hall and called the hospital the person he got through to didnt sound too surprised no change im afraid shes got a couple of visitors with her mickey and rhona rebus terminated the call made another to prydes mobile im in one of the flats over remnant kings ive got an eyewitness yes he saw the whole thing and hes an art student yes come on bill do you want me to draw it for you there was silence for a moment then pryde said ah rebus held the mobile to his ear as he walked through the hospital joe herdmans put together a list bill pryde was saying rover series the newer ford mondeos toyota celica plus a couple of nissans rank outsider is the bmw series it narrows things down a bit i suppose joe says the rover mondeo and celica are favourites hes given me a few more details chrome around the numberplates stuff like that im going to call our artist friend see if anything clicks a nurse was glaring at rebus as he walked towards her let me know what he says talk to you later bill rebus slipped the phone back into his pocket youre not supposed to use those things in here the nurse snapped look im in a bit of a hurry they can interfere with the machines rebus pulled up colour leaving his face i forgot he said he put a shaking hand to his forehead are you all right fine fine look i wont do it again okay he started to move off you can rely on that rebus took a photocopy of renton s drawing from his pocket joe herdman was a desk sergeant who knew everything about cars hed been useful before turning a vague description into something more concrete rebus looked at the drawing as he walked all the details were there buildings in the background the hedge the onlookers and sammy caught at the point of impact shed halfturned was stretching out her hands as if she could push the car to a stop but renton had drawn fine lines issuing from the back of the car representing the air being pushed representing speed where there should have been a face he had left a blank oval the back half of the car was very clearly defined the front a blur of disappearing perspective renton said hed left out anything he couldnt be sure of he promised he hadnt let his imagination fill in the blanks it was the face or the lack of it it disturbed rebus more than anything else in the picture he drew himself into the scene wondered what hed have done would he have concentrated on the car caught its licence plate or would his attention have been focused on sammy which would have prevailed cop instincts or fatherhood someone at the station had said dont worry well get him not dont worry shell be all right which brought it all down to two things him meaning the driver and retribution rather than her the victim and recovery id just have been another witness rebus said quietly then he folded the drawing and put it away sammy had a room to herself all tubes and machinery the way hed seen it in films and on tv only here the room was dingier paint flaking from the walls and around the windowframes the chairs had metal legs and rubber feet and moulded plastic seats a woman rose as he came in they embraced he kissed the side of her forehead aiming for her didnt anyone say that hello rhona hello john she looked tired of course but her hair was stylishly cut and dyed the colour of a dull golden harvest her clothes were smart and she wore jewellery he studied her eyes their colour was wrong coloured contacts not even her eyes were going to betray her past christ rhona im sorry he was whispering not wanting to disturb sammy which was ludicrous because right now all he wanted in the world was for her to wake up how is she he asked much the same mickey stood up there were three chairs arranged in a sort of semicircle mickey and rhona had been sitting with an empty chair between them as rhona broke from rebuss embrace his brother took her place this is so fucking awful mickey said his voice low he looked the same as ever a party animal whod stopped getting the invites niceties dispensed with rebus went to sammys bedside her face was still bruised and now he could place the probable cause of each abrasion hedge wall pavement one leg was broken both arms heavily bandaged a teddy bear missing one ear lay by her head rebus smiled you brought pa broon yes do they know yet if theres any his eyes were on sammy as he spoke what rhona wanted him to spell it out no hiding place brain damage he said nobodys told us anything she said sounding snubbed aiming for her didnt anyone say that no none of the other onlookers had even hinted as much but then they hadnt had renton s grandstand view has nobody been in not since i got here and i was here before rhona mickey added havent seen a soul it was enough rebus strode from the room a doctor and two nurses were standing chatting at the end of the corridor one of the nurses was leaning against a wall whats going on rebus exploded nobodys been near my daughter all morning the doctor was young male blond hair cut short with a parting were doing everything we can what does that mean i can appreciate that youre fuck you pal why hasnt the big man been to look at her whys she just lying there like a rebus choked back the words your daughter was seen by two specialists this morning the doctor said quietly were waiting for some test results to determine whether to operate again theres some brain swelling the tests take a little time to process theres nothing we can do about it rebus felt cheated still angry but nothing to feel angry about not here he nodded turned away back in the room he explained the situation to rhona a suitcase and large holdall were sitting behind one of the machines listen he told her itd make sense if you stayed at the flat its only ten minutes away and i could let you have the car she was shaking her head were booked into the sheraton the flats nearer and i tend not to charge we rebus looked at mickey whose eyes were on the bed then the door opened and a man came in short thickly built breathing hard he was rubbing his hands to let everyone know hed been to the toilet loose folds of flesh furrowed his brow and bulged from his shirt collar his hair was thick and black like an oilslick he stopped when he saw rebus john rhona said this is a friend of mine jackie jackie platt the man said reaching out a plump hand when jackie heard he insisted on driving me up platt shrugged his head almost disappearing into his shoulders couldnt have her training it up on her ownio hell of a drive mickey said his tone hinting at repetition could have done without the roadworks jackie platt agreed rebuss eyes caught rhonas she looked away quickly dodging reproach to rebus this bulk didnt belong it was as if a character had wandered on to the wrong set platt hadnt been in the script she looks so peaceful dont she the londoner was saying making for the bed he touched her arm sammys bandaged arm grazing it with the back of his hand rebuss fingernails dug into his palms then platt yawned you know rhona it might not be good manners but i think im about to crash see you back at the hotel she nodded relieved platt picked up the suitcase as he passed her his hand went into his trouser pocket came out with a fold of banknotes get a cab back all right all right jackie see you later cheers pet and he squeezed her hand take care mickey all the best john a huge facecreasing wink then he was gone they waited in silence for a few seconds rhona held up her free hand the one without the wad of notes not a word okay furthest thing from my mind rebus said sitting down think im about to crash tactful or what come on johnny mickey said johnny only mickey could do that using the name so that the years fell from both of them rebus looked at his brother and smiled mickey was a therapist by profession he knew the things to say why the cases rebus asked rhona what youre going to a hotel why not leave them in his car i thought about staying here they said i could if i wanted to only then i saw her and i changed my mind tears started down her face smudging alreadysmudged mascara mickey had a handkerchief ready john what if she oh jesus christ why did this have to happen she was wailing now rebus went over to her chair crouched in front of it his hands resting on hers shes all weve got john shes all we ever had shes still here rhona shes right here but why her why samantha ill ask him when i find him rhona he kissed her hair his eyes on mickey and believe me im going to find him later when ned farlowe visited rebus took him outside there was drizzle falling but the air felt good one of the eyewitnesses rebus said thinks it was deliberate i dont understand he thinks the driver meant to hit sammy i still dont get it look there are two scenarios one he was intent on hitting a pedestrian and anyone would have done two sammy was his target hed been following her saw his chance when she crossed the road only the lights were against him so he had to jump them then she was so close to the kerb he had to switch lanes but why rebus stared at him this is sammys dad and her lover right for the purposes of what follows i want you to stop being a reporter farlowe stared back nodded slowly ive had a few runins with tommy telford rebus said he was seeing teddy bears pa broon and the one telford kept in his car this might have been a message for me telford or tarawicz flip a coin or for you if youve been asking questions about telford you think my book im keeping an open mind ive been working the lintz case and so have you someone warning us off lintz rebus thought of abernethy shrugged then theres sammys job working with excons maybe one of them had a grudge jesus she hadnt mentioned anyone following her nobody odd in the area same question hed put to the petrecs only different victim farlowe shook his head look he said until five minutes ago i thought this was an accident now youre saying it was attempted murder are you sure im trusting a witness but he knew what bill pryde thought a drunk driver a crazy man and a grandstand spectator who wore glasses and had read it wrong he took out the drawing again whats that rebus handed it over this is what someone saw last night what kind of car is it rover ford mondeo something like that dark green ring any bells ned farlowe shook his head then looked at rebus let me help i can ask around one kid in a comas enough the rest of the office had packed up and gone home now there were only rebus and sammys boss a woman called mae crumley the light from half a dozen desklamps illuminated the haphazard office which was on the top floor of an old fourstorey building off palmerston place rebus knew palmerston place there was a church there where the aa held meetings hed been to a couple he could still taste whisky at the back of his throat not that hed had any so far today not in daylight hours but then he hadnt phoned jack morton either the address might have been posher than rebus was expecting but the accommodation was cramped the office was in the eaves of the building so that you couldnt stand up in half the available space which hadnt stopped desks being sited in the most awkward corners which is hers rebus asked mae crumley pointed to the desk next to her own there was a computer there somewhere but only its screen was showing loose sheets of paper books and pamphlets and reports the whole lot spilled on to the chair and from there down on to the floor she works too hard crumley said we all do rebus sipped the coffee shed made him cafe hag when sammy came here she went on the first thing she said was that her father was cid she never tried to hide it and youd no qualms about taking her on none at all crumley folded her arms they were big arms she was a big woman her hair was a fiery red long and frizzy and tied back with a black ribbon she wore an oatmeal linen shirt with a denim jacket over the top of it her eyebrows had been plucked into thin arches over pale grey eyes her desk was relatively tidy but only as shed explained to rebus because she tended to stay later than anyone else what about her clients rebus asked could any of them have held a grudge against her or against you against me through her crumley considered this to the extent that theyd run her over just to make a point i very much doubt it id be interested to see her client list she shook her head look you shouldnt be doing this its too personal you know that i mean who am i talking to here sammys father or a copper you think ive a score to settle well havent you rebus put down the coffee mug maybe and thats why you shouldnt be doing this she sighed number one on my wish list sammy back on her feet and back here but what about if meantime i do a bit of poking around i stand a better chance of getting them to talk than you do rebus nodded id appreciate that he got to his feet thanks for the coffee outside he checked the list the juice church had given him he kept it in his pocket didnt refer to it often there was a meeting at palmerston place in about an hour and a half no good he knew hed spend the time beforehand in a pub jack morton had introduced him to alanon but rebus hadnt really taken to it though the stories had affected him see one man had told the group i had problems at work problems with my wife my kids i had money problems and health problems and everything else practically the only problem i didnt have was with the drink and thats because i was a drunk rebus lit himself a cigarette and drove home he sat in his chair and thought about rhona theyd shared so much over so many years and then it had all stopped hed chosen his job over his marriage and that could not be forgiven last time hed seen her had been in london wearing her new life like armour nobody had warned him about jackie platt his phone rang and he snatched it from the floor rebus its bill pryde sounded halfway to excited which was as far as he ever ventured what have you got dark green rover i think the owner called it sherwood green stolen yesterday evening about an hour before the collision where from metered parking on george street what do you reckon my advice is keep an open mind having said that at least now weve got a licence plate owner reported it at sixforty last night it hasnt turned up anywhere so ive upped the alert status give me the reg pryde read out the letters and numbers rebus thanked him and put down the phone he was thinking of danny simpson dumped outside fascination street around the time sammy was being hit coincidence or a double message telford and rebus which put big ger cafferty in the frame he called the hospital was told there was no change farlowe was in visiting the nurse said he had his laptop with him rebus recalled sammy growing up a series of isolated images he hadnt been there for her he saw her in a series of fast jerky impressions as if the film had been spliced he tried not to think about the hell she had gone through at the hands of gordon reeve he saw good people doing bad things and bad people doing good and he tried dividing the two into groups he saw candice and tommy telford and mr pink eyes and encompassing it all he saw edinburgh he saw the mass of the people just getting on with their lives and he saluted them they knew things and felt things things hed never feel he used to think he knew things as a kid hed known everything now he knew differently the only thing you could be sure of was the inside of your head and even that could deceive you i dont even know myself he thought so how could he ever hope to know sammy and with each year he understood less he thought of the oxford bar even on the wagon hed stayed a regular drinking cola and mugs of coffee a pub like the ox was about so much more than just the hooch it was therapy and refuge entertainment and art he checked his watch thinking he could head down there now just a couple of whiskies and a beer something to make him feel good about himself until the morning the phone rang again he picked it up evening john rebus smiled leaned back in his chair jack you must be a bloody mind reader midmorning rebus walked through the cemetery hed been to the hospital to check on sammy no change now he felt he had time to kill a bit cooler today inspector joseph lintz rose from his knees and pushed his glasses back up to the bridge of his nose there were damp patches on his trousers from where hed been kneeling he dropped his trowel on to a white polythene bag beside the bag stood pots of small green plants wont the frost get them rebus asked lintz shrugged it gets all of us but were allowed to bloom for a while rebus turned away today he wasnt in the mood for games warriston cemetery was vast in the past it had been a history lesson to rebus headstones telling the story of nineteenthcentury edinburgh but now he found it a jarring reminder of mortality they were the only living souls in the place lintz had pulled out a handkerchief more questions he asked not exactly what then truth is mr lintz ive got other things on my mind the old man looked at him maybe all this archaeology is beginning to bore you inspector i still dont get it planting things before the first frost well i cant plant very much afterwards can i and at my age any day now i could be lying in the ground i like to think there might be a few flowers surviving above me hed lived in scotand the best part of half a century but there was still something lurking beneath the local accent peculiarities of phrasing and tone that would be with joseph lintz until he died reminders of his far less recent history so he said now no questions today rebus shook his head youre right inspector you do seem preoccupied is it something i can help with in what way i dont really know but youve come here questions or no i take it theres a reason a dog was bounding through the long grass crunching on the fallen leaves nose brushing the ground it was a yellow labrador shorthaired and overweight lintz turned towards it and almost growled dogs were the enemy i was just wondering rebus was saying what youre capable of lintz looked puzzled the dog began to paw at the ground lintz reached down picked up a stone and hurled it it didnt reach the dog the labradors owner was rounding the corner he was young crophaired and skinny that thing should be kept on its lead lintz roared jawohl the owner snapped back clicking his heels he was laughing as he passed them i am a famous man now lintz reflected back to his old self after the outburst thanks to the newspapers he looked up at the sky blinked people send me hate by the royal mail a car was parked outside my home the other night they put a brick through the windscreen it wasnt my car but they didnt know that now my neighbours keep clear of that spot just in case he spoke like the old man he was a little tired a little defeated this is the worst year of my life he stared down at the border hed been tending the earth newly turned looked dark and rich like crumbs of chocolate cake a few worms and wood lice had been disturbed and were still looking for their old homes and its going to get worse isnt it rebus shrugged his feet were cold the damp seeping in through his shoes he was standing on the rough roadway lintz six inches above him on the grass and still lintz didnt reach his height a little old man thats what he was and rebus could study him talk with him go to his home and see what few photographs remained according to lintz from the old days what did you mean back there he said what was it you said something about what i was capable of rebus stared at him its okay the dog just showed me showed you what what youre like with the enemy lintz smiled i dont like dogs its true dont read too much into it inspector thats the journalists job your life would be easier without dogs wouldnt it lintz shrugged of course and easier without me too lintz frowned if it werent you it would be someone else a boor like your inspector abernethy what do you think he was telling you lintz blinked im not sure someone else came to see me a man called levy i refused to talk to him one privilege still open to me rebus shuffled his feet trying to get some warmth into them i have a daughter did i ever tell you that lintz looked baffled you might have mentioned it you know i have a daughter yes i mean i think i knew before today well mr lintz the night before last someone tried to kill her or at least do her some serious damage shes in hospital still unconscious and that bothers me im so sorry how did it i mean how do you i think maybe someone was trying to send me a message lintzs eyes widened and you believe me capable of such a thing my god i thought we had come to understand one another at least a little rebus was wondering he was wondering how easy it would be to put on an act when youd spent half a century practising he was wondering how easy it would be to steel yourself to killing an innocent or at least ordering their death all it took was an order a few words to someone else who would carry out your bidding maybe lintz had it in him maybe it wouldnt be any more difficult than it had been for josef linzstek something you should know rebus said threats dont scare me off quite the opposite its good that you are so strong rebus looked for meaning behind the words im on my way home can i offer you some tea rebus drove and then sat in the drawingroom while lintz busied himself in the kitchen started flicking through a pile of books on a desk ancient history inspector lintz said bringing in the tray he always refused offers of help another hobby of mine im fascinated by that intersection at which history and fiction meet the books were all about babylonia babylon is an historical fact you see but what about the tower of babel a song by elton john rebus offered always making jokes lintz looked up what is it youre afraid of rebus took one of the cups ive heard of the gardens of babylon he admitted putting the book down what other hobbies do you have astrology hauntings the unknown have you ever been haunted lintz seemed amused no would you like to be by seven hundred french villagers no inspector i wouldnt like that at all it was astrology that first brought me to the chaldeans they came from babylonia have you ever heard of babylonian numbers lintz had a way of turning conversations in directions he wanted them to take rebus wasnt going to be deflected this time he waited till lintz had the cup to his lips did you try to kill my daughter lintz paused then sipped swallowed no inspector he said quietly which left telford tarawicz and cafferty rebus thought of telford surrounded by his family but wanting to play with the big boys how different was a gang war from any other kind you had soldiers and orders given to them they had to prove themselves or lose face show themselves cowards shoot a civilian run down a pedestrian rebus realised that he didnt want the driver as such he wanted the person whod driven them to do it lintzs defence of linzstek was that the young lieutenant had been under orders that war itself was the real culprit as though humans had no say in the matter inspector the old man was saying do you think im linzstek rebus nodded i know you are a wry smile then arrest me here comes the bluenose father conor leary said out to steal irelands godgiven guinness he paused eyes narrowing or are you still on that abstention kick im trying rebus said well i wont tempt you then leary smiled but you know me john im not one to judge but a wee drop never harmed a soul problem is you put lots of wee drops together and you get a bloody big fall father leary laughed but arent we all the fallen come away in father leary was priest of our lady of perpetual help years back someone had defaced the board outside to turn help into hell the board had been corrected many times but rebus always thought of the place as perpetual hell it was what the followers of knox and calvin would have believed father leary took him through to the kitchen here man sit yourself down i havent seen you in so long i thought youd renounced me he went to the fridge and lifted out a can of guinness are you operating a pharmacy on the side rebus asked father leary looked at him rebus nodded towards the fridge the shelves of medicine father leary rolled his eyes at my age you go to the doctor with angina and they dose you for every conceivable ailment they think it makes old folk feel better he brought a glass to the table placed it next to his can rebus felt a hand fall on his shoulder im hellish sorry about sammy how did you hear her name was in one of the rags this morning father leary sat down hit and run they said hit and run rebus echoed father leary shook his head wearily one hand rubbing slowly over his chest he was probably in his latesixties though hed never said wellbuilt with a thatch of silver hair tufts of grey sprouted from his ears nose and dogcollar his hand seemed to smother the can of guinness but when he poured he poured gently almost with reverence its a terrible thing he said quietly coma is it not until the doctors say so rebus cleared his throat its only been a day and a half you know what we believers say father leary went on when something like this happens its a test for all of us its a way of making us stronger the head on his guinness was perfect he took a swallow licked his lips thoughtfully thats what we say it may not be what we think he looked into his drink it didnt make me strong i went back to the whisky i can understand that until a friend reminded me it was the lazy way out the cowardly way and whos to say hes not right faintheart and the sermon rebus said with a smile whats that a song but maybe its us too get away were just two old boys having a natter so how are you holding up john i dont know he paused i dont think it was an accident and the man i think is behind it sammy isnt the first woman hes tried to destroy rebus looked into the priests eyes i want to kill him but so far you havent i havent even talked to him because youre worried what you might do or not do rebuss mobile sounded he gave a look of apology and switched it on john its bill yes bill green rover yes weve got it the car had been parked illegally on the street outside piershill cemetery there was a parking ticket on its windscreen dated the previous afternoon if anyone had checked theyd have found the driversside door unlocked maybe someone had the car was empty no coins no mapbooks or cassettes the fascia had been removed from the radiocassette there were no keys in the ignition a car transporter had arrived and the rover was being winched aboard i called in a favour at howdenhall bill pryde was saying theyve promised to fingerprint it today rebus was studying the front passenger side no dents nothing to suggest this car had been used as a battering ram against his daughter i think maybe we need your permission john what for someone should go to the infirmary and print sammy rebus stared at the front of the car then got out the drawing yes shed put out a hand her prints might be there invisible to him sure he said no problem you think this is it ill tell you once we print it you steal a car rebus said then you hit someone with it and leave it a couple of miles away he looked around ever been on this street before pryde shook his head me neither someone local im wondering why they stole it in the first place stick false plates on and sell it pryde suggested spot of joyriding maybe joyriders dont leave cars looking like this no but theyd had a fright theyd just knocked someone down and they drove all the way over here before deciding to dump it maybe it was stolen for a job turn over a petrol station then they hit sammy and decide to jump ship maybe the job was this side of town or sammy was the job pryde put a hand on his shoulder lets see what the boffins turn up eh rebus looked at him you dont go for it look its a feeling youve got and thats fair enough but right now all youve got is that students word for it there were other witnesses john and i asked them all again and they told me the same thing it looked like the driver lost control thats all there was an edge of irritation to prydes voice rebus knew why long hours will howdenhall let you know tonight they promised and ill phone you straight away okay on my mobile rebus said im going to be on the move he looked around there was something about piershill cemetery recently wasnt there kids pryde said nodding they pushed over a load of gravestones rebus remembered now just the jewish headstones wasnt it i think so and there sprayed on the wall near the gates the same piece of graffiti wont anyone help it was late evening and rebus was driving not the m into fife tonight he was on the m heading west heading for glasgow hed spent half an hour at the hospital followed by an hour and a half with rhona and jackie platt their guest for dinner at the sheraton hed worn a fresh suit and shirt he hadnt smoked hed drunk a bottle of highland spring they were planning yet more tests on sammy the neurologist had taken them into his office and talked them through the procedures there would probably be another operation at the end of it rebus could barely remember what the man had said rhona had asked for the occasional explanation but these seemed no more lucid than what had gone before dinner had been a subdued affair jackie platt it turned out sold secondhand cars see john where i really score is the obituaries check the local paper hare round there and see if theyve left a car behind quick cash offer sammy doesnt drive sorry rebus had said causing rhona to drop her cutlery on to her plate at the end of the meal shed seen him out to his car gripped one of his arms hard get the bastard john i want to look him in the face just get the bastard who did this to us her eyes were blazing he nodded stones just wanna see his face rebus wanted it too the m which could be a nightmare at rushhour was a quiet drive in the evenings rebus knew he was making good time and that he would soon see the outline of the easterhouse estate against the sky when his phone sounded he didnt hear it at first blame wishbone ash as argus finished he picked up rebus john its bill whatve you got forensics were good as gold there are prints all over the car interior and exterior several sets he paused and rebus thought the connection had gone one good palm and finger set on the front of the bonnet sammys for definite so weve got our car the owners given us a set so we can eliminate him when weve done that were still not home and dry bill the car sat unlocked outside that cemetery we dont know someone didnt clean it out owner says the radiocassette fascia was there when he left it also half a dozen tapes a packet of paracetamol receipts for petrol and a road map so someone cleaned it out whether its the bastard we want or just some scavenger at least we know its the car ill check again with howdenhall tomorrow collect any other prints and start trying to match them plus ill ask around piershill see if anyone saw someone dumping it meantime get some sleep eh try and stop me what about you me two cups of espresso after dinner and with the knowledge of what lay ahead ill get my head down soon enough bill talk to you tomorrow on the outskirts of glasgow headed for barlinnie prison hed phoned ahead made sure they were expecting him it was way outside any visiting hours but rebus had made up a story about a murder inquiry followup questions was what hed said at this time of night lothian and borders police pal motto justice never sleeps morris gerald cafferty probably didnt sleep much either rebus imagined him lying awake at night hands under his head staring into the darkness scheming running things through his mind how to keep his empire from falling how best to combat threats like tommy telford rebus knew that cafferty employed a lawyer a middleaged pinstripe from the new town to carry messages back to his gang in edinburgh he thought of charles groal telfords lawyer groal was young and sharp like his paymaster strawman he was waiting in the interview room arms folded chair set well away from the table and of course his opening gambit was his nickname for rebus a lovely surprise two visits in a week dont tell me youve another message from the pole rebus sat down opposite cafferty tarawicz isnt polish he glanced towards the guard who stood by the door lowered his voice another of telfords boys got a doing how clumsy he was all but scalped are you looking for war cafferty drew his chair in to the table leaned across towards rebus ive never backed down from a fight my daughter got hurt funny that so soon after wed had our little chat hurt how hit and run cafferty was thoughtful i dont pick on civilians yes rebus thought but she wasnt a civilian because he had lured her on to the battlefield convince me rebus said why should i bother the conversation we had what you asked me to do telford a whisper cafferty sat back for a moment to consider when he leaned forward again his eyes bored into rebuss theres something youve forgotten i lost a son remember think i could do that to another father id do a lot of things rebus but not that never that rebus held the stare all right he said you want me to find who did it rebus nodded slowly thats your price rhonas words i want to look him in the face rebus shook his head i want them delivered to me i want you to do that whatever it takes cafferty placed his hands on his knees seemed to take his time positioning them just so you know its probably telford yes if its not you youll be going after him then any way i can cafferty smiled but your ways arent my ways you might get to him first i want him alive and meantime youre my man rebus stared at him im your man he said rebus got a phone call early the next morning from leith cid telling him joseph lintz was dead the bad news was it looked like murder the body found hanging from a tree in warriston cemetery by the time rebus appeared at the scene they were cordoning it off the doctor having concluded that most suicides wouldnt have bothered administering a violent blow to their own head before commencing with operations the corpse of joseph lintz was being zipped into a body bag rebus got a look at the face hed seen elderly corpses before and mostly theyd looked wonderfully at peace their faces shiny and childlike but joseph lintz looked like hed suffered he didnt look to be at rest at all youll have come to thank us no doubt a man said walking towards rebus his shoulders were hunched inside a navy raincoat and he walked with head bowed hands in pockets his hair was thick and silver and wiry his skin an almost jaundiced yellow the remains of an autumn holiday tan hiya bobby rebus said bobby hogan was leith cid to get back to my initial observation john what am i supposed to be thanking you for hogan nodded towards the body bag taking mr lintz off your hands dont tell me you were enjoying digging into all that not exactly any idea who might have wanted him dead rebus puffed out his cheeks where do you want me to start i mean im right to rule out the usual arent i hogan held up three fingers it wasnt suicide muggers arent quite this creative and it surely wasnt an accident someone was making a point no doubt about it but what sort of point scene of crime officers were busying themselves filling the locus with noise and movement rebus gestured for hogan to walk with him they were deep in the cemetery the part lintz had loved so much as they walked the place grew wilder more overgrown i was here with him yesterday morning rebus said i dont know if he had a routine exactly but he came here most days we found a bag of gardening tools he planted flowers so if someone knew hed be coming they could have been waiting rebus nodded an assassination hogan was thoughtful why hang him its what happened at villefranche the town elders were strung up in the square jesus hogan stopped walking i know youve got other stuff on the go but can you help out on this john any way i can a list of possibles would do for a start how about an old woman living in france and a jewish historian who walks with a stick is that all youve got well theres always me yesterday i as good as accused him of trying to kill my daughter hogan stared at him i dont think he did it rebus paused thinking of sammy hed called the hospital first thing she was still unconscious they still werent using the word coma one more thing he said special branch a guy called abernethy he was here talking to lintz whats the connection abernethys coordinating the various war crimes investigations hes streettough not your typical deskjockey a strange choice for the job rebus nodded which hardly makes him a suspect im doing my best bobby we could check lintzs house see if we can turn up any of the hate mail he claimed hed been getting claimed rebus shrugged you were never sure where you were with lintz do you have any idea what happened from what youve told me id guess he came down here as usual to do his gardening stint hes certainly dressed for it someone was waiting they smacked him over the head stuck his neck in a noose and hauled him up into the tree the rope was tied around a headstone did the hanging kill him doctor says yes haemorrhages in the eyes what do you call them tardieu spots thats it the blow to the head was just to knock him out something else bruising and cuts on the face looks like someone kicked him when he was down knock him cold thump him in the face then string him up bigtime grudge rebus looked around someone with a flair for theatre and not afraid to take risks this place might never get exactly crowded but its a public space and that trees in open view anyone could have walked past what time are we talking about eight eightthirty im guessing mr lintz would have wanted to do his digging in daylight could have been earlier rebus suggested a prearranged meeting then why the tools because by the time it got light the meeting would be over hogan looked doubtful and if it was a meeting rebus said there might be some record of it at lintzs home hogan looked at him nodded my car or yours better get his keys first they started back up the slope searching through a dead mans pockets hogan said to himself why is that never mentioned during recruitment i was here yesterday rebus said he invited me back for tea no family none hogan looked around the hallway big place what happens to the money when its sold rebus looked at him we could split it two ways or we could just move ourselves in basement and ground for me you can have first and second hogan smiled tried one of the doors off the hall it opened on to an office this could be my bedroom he said going in when i came here before he always took me upstairs on you go well take a floor each then swop rebus headed up the staircase running his hand over the varnished banister not a speck of dust cleaning ladies could be invaluable informants if you find a chequebook he called down to hogan look for regular payments to a mrs mop four doors led off the firstfloor landing two were bedrooms one a bathroom the last door led into the huge drawingroom where rebus had asked his questions and listened to the stories and philosophy that lintz had used in place of answers do you think guilt has a genetic component inspector hed asked one time or are we taught it does it matter so long as its there rebus had said and lintz had nodded and smiled as if the pupil had given some satisfactory answer the room was big not too much furniture huge sash windows recently cleaned looked down on to the street there were framed prints and paintings on the walls they could have been priceless originals or junkstore stuff rebus was no expert he liked one painting it showed a ragged whitehaired man seated on a rock surrounded by a barren plain he had a book open on his lap but was staring skywards in horror or awe as a shining light appeared there picking him out it had a biblical look but rebus couldnt quite place it he knew the look on the mans face though hed seen it before when some suspects carefully crafted alibi had suddenly come tumbling down over the marble fireplace was a large giltframed mirror rebus studied himself in it behind him he could see the room he knew he didnt fit here one bedroom was for guests the other was lintzs a faint smell of embrocation half a dozen medicine bottles on the bedside table books too a pile of them the bed had been made a dressinggown draped across it lintz was a creature of habit hed been in no special hurry this morning the next floor up rebus found two further bedrooms and a toilet there was a slight smell of damp in one room and the ceiling was discoloured rebus didnt suppose lintz got many visitors no impetus to redecorate out on the landing again he saw that one of the stairrails was missing it had been propped against the wall awaiting repair a house this size things would always be going wrong he went back downstairs hogan was in the basement the kitchen had a door on to a back garden stone patio lawn covered in rotting leaves an ivycovered wall giving privacy look what i found hogan said coming back from the utility room he was holding a length of rope frayed at one end where it had been cut you think itll match with the noose that would mean the killer got it from here meaning lintz knew them anything in the office its going to take a bit of time theres an address book lots of entries but most of them seem to go back a while how can you tell old std codes computer not even a typewriter he used carbons lots of letters to his solicitor trying to shut the media up you get a couple of mentions too anything upstairs go take a look ill check the office rebus climbed upstairs and stood in the office doorway looking around then he sat down at the desk and imagined the room was his what did he do here he conducted his daily business there were two filingcabinets but to get to them hed have to stand up from the desk and he was an old man say the cabinets were for dead correspondence more recent stuff would be closer to hand he tried the drawers found the address book hogan had mentioned a few letters a small snuffbox its contents turned solid lintz hadnt even allowed himself that small vice in a bottom drawer were some files rebus lifted out the one marked general household it comprised bills and guarantees a large brown envelope was marked bt rebus opened it and took out the phone bills they went back to the beginning of the year the most recent bill was at the front rebus was disappointed to find that it wasnt itemised then he noticed that all the other statements were lintz had been meticulous placing names beside calls made doublechecking british telecoms totals at the foot of each page the whole year was like that right up until recently frowning rebus realised that the penultimate statement was missing had lintz mislaid it rebus couldnt see him mislaying anything a missing bill would have hinted at chaos in his ordered world no it had to be somewhere but rebus was damned if he could find it lintzs correspondence was all business either to lawyers or else to do with local charities and committees hed been resigning from his committees rebus wondered if pressure had been applied edinburgh could be cruel and cold that way well hogan said sticking his head round the door im just wondering what whether to add on a conservatory and knock through from the kitchen wed lose some garden space hogan said he came in rested against the desk anything a missing phone bill and a sudden change from being itemised worth a call hogan admitted i found a chequebook in his bedroom stubs show payments of a month to e forgan where in the bedroom marking his place in a book hogan reached into the desks top drawer lifted out the address book rebus got up pretty rich street this wonder how many of them do their own dusting hogan shut the book no listing for an e forgan think the neighbours will know edinburgh neighbours know everything its just that they most often keep it to themselves hogan was nodding and remember to get me copies of your files are you busy otherwise bobby if time was money id be in hock to every lender in town joseph lintzs neighbours an artist and her husband on one side a retired advocate and his wife on the other the artist used a ccleaning lady called ella forgan mrs forgan lived in east claremont street the artist gave them a telephone number conclusions drawn from the two interviews shock and horror that lintz was dead praise for the quiet considerate neighbour a christmas card every year and an invitation to drinks one sunday afternoon each july hard to tell when hed been at home and when hed been out he went off on holiday without telling anyone except mrs forgan visitors to his home had been few or few had been noticed which wasnt quite the same thing men women rebus had asked or a mixture a mixture id say the artist had replied measuring her words really we knew very little about him to say weve been neighbours these past twentyodd years ah and that was edinburgh for you too at least in this price bracket wealth was a very private thing in the city it wasnt brash and colourful it stayed behind its thick stone walls and was at peace rebus and hogan held a doorstep conference ill call the cleaning lady see if i can meet her preferably here hogan looked back at lintzs front door id love to know where he got the money to buy this place rebus said that could take some excavating rebus nodded solicitor would be the place to start what about the address book worth tracking down some of these elusive friends i suppose so hogan looked dispirited at the prospect ill follow up on the phone bills rebus said if thatll help mae crumley reached rebus on his mobile i thought youd forgotten me he told sammys boss just being methodical inspector im sure youd want no less rebus stopped at traffic lights ive been in to see sammy is there any news nothing much so youve talked to her clients yes and they all seemed genuinely upset and surprised sorry to disappoint you what makes you think im disappointed sammy has a good rapport with all her clients none of them would have wanted her hurt what about the ones who didnt want to be her clients crumley hesitated there was one man when he was told sammy had a police inspector for a father hed have nothing to do with her whats his name it couldnt have been him though why not because he killed himself his name was gavin tay he used to drive an icecream van rebus thanked her for her call and put down the phone if someone had tried to kill sammy on purpose the question was why rebus had been investigating lintz ned farlowe had been following him rebus had twice confronted telford ned was writing a book about organised crime then there was candice could she have told sammy something something which might have threatened telford or even mr pink eyes rebus just didnt know he knew the most likely culprit the most vicious was tommy telford he remembered their first meeting and the young gangsters words to him thats the beauty of games you can always start again after an accident not so easy in real life at the time it had sounded like bravado a performance for the troops but now it sounded like a plain threat and now there was mr taystee connecting sammy to telford mr taystee had worked telfords clubs mr taystee had rejected sammy rebus knew hed have to talk to the widow there was just the one problem mr pink eyes had intimated that if telford wasnt left alone candice would suffer he kept seeing images of candice torn from home and homeland used and abused abusing herself in the hope of respite clinging to a strangers legs he recalled levys words can time mash array responsibility justice was a fine and noble thing but revenge revenge was an emotion and so much stronger than an abstract like justice he wondered if sammy would want revenge probably not shed want him to help candice which meant yielding to telford rebus didnt think he could do that and now there was lintzs murder unconnected but resonant ive never felt comfortable with the past inspector lintz had said once funny rebus felt the same way about the present joanne tay lived in colinton a newish threebedroomed semi with the merc still parked in the drive its too big for me she explained to rebus ill have to sell it he wasnt sure if she meant the house or the car having declined her offer of tea he sat in the busy livingroom ornaments on every flat surface joanne tay was still in mourning black skirt and blouse dark grooves beneath her eyes hed interviewed her back at the start of the inquiry i still dont know why he did it she said now reluctant to see her husbands death as anything other than suicide but the pathology and forensic tests had cast this into doubt have you ever heard rebus asked of a man called tommy telford he runs a nightclub doesnt he gavin took me there once so gavin knew him seemed to yes because no way was mr taystee setting up his hotdog pitch outside telfords premises without telfords okay and telfords okay almost certainly meant payment of some kind a percentage maybe or a favour the week before gavin died rebus went on you said hed been busy working all hours days as well as nights she nodded the weather was lousy that week i know i told him youll never get them buying icecream a day like this pelting down outside but still he went out rebus shifted in his chair did he ever mention sweep mrs tay he had some woman would visit him red hair mae crumley she nodded eyes staring at the coaleffect fire she asked him again if he wanted some tea rebus shook his head and made to leave did pretty well knocked over just the two ornaments on his way to the door the hospital was quiet when he pushed open the door to sammys room he saw that another bed had been added a middleaged woman sleeping in it her hands lay on the bedcovers a white identity tag around one wrist she was hooked up to a machine and her head was bandaged two women were sitting by sammys bed rhona and patience aitken rebus hadnt seen patience in a while the women were sitting close together their whispered conversation stopped as he came in he lifted a chair and placed it beside patiences she leaned over and squeezed his hand hello john he smiled at her spoke to rhona how is she the specialist says those last tests were very positive what does that mean it means theres brain activity shes not in deep coma is that his version he thinks shell come out of it john her eyes were bloodshot he noticed a handkerchief gripped in one hand thats good he said which doctor was it dr stafford hes just back from holiday i cant keep track of them all rebus rubbed his forehead look patience said checking her watch i really should be going im sure the two of you stay as long as you like rebus told her im already late for an appointment actually she got to her feet nice to meet you rhona thanks patience the two women shook hands a little awkwardly then rhona got up and they hugged and the awkwardness vanished thanks for coming patience turned to rebus she looked radiant he decided light really seemed to emanate from her skin she was wearing her usual perfume and had had her hair restyled thanks for looking in he said shes going to be fine john she took his hands in hers leaned towards him a peck on the cheek a kiss between friends rebus saw rhona watching them john she said see patience out will you no thats all of course yes rebus said they left the room together walked the first few steps in silence patience spoke first shes great isnt she rhona yes rebus was thoughtful shes terrific have you met her paramour hes gone back to london ive i asked rhona if she wanted to come stay with me hotels can be rebus smiled tiredly good idea then all youd have to do is invite my brother over and youd have the whole set her face cracked into an embarrassed grin i suppose it must look a bit like im collecting you all the perfect hand of unhappy families she turned to him they were at the main doors of the hospital she touched his shoulder john im really sorry about sammy anything i can do youve only got to ask thanks patience but asking for things has never been your strong point has it you just sit in silence and hope they come to you she sighed i cant believe im saying this but i miss you i think thats why i took in sammy if i couldnt be close to you at least i could be close to someone who was does that make any sense is this where you say something about not deserving me youve seen the script he pulled back a little from her just so he could look at her face i miss you too all the nights slumped at the bar or in his chair at home the long midnight drives so he could keep his restlessness alive hed have the tv and the hifi on at the same time and the flat would still feel empty books he tried reading finding he was ten pages in and couldnt remember anything gazing from his window at the darkened flats across the street imagining lives at rest all because he didnt have her they embraced in silence for a while youre going to be late he said god john what are we going to do see one another that sounds like a start tonight marios at eight she nodded and they kissed again he squeezed her hand her head was turned to look at him as she pushed open the doors emerson lake and palmer still you turn me on rebus felt a little giddy as he walked back to sammys room only it wasnt any more wasnt sammys room now there was another patient there theyd said there was always that possibility shortage of space cutbacks the woman was still asleep or unconscious breathing noisily rebus ignored her and sat where patience had been sitting ive got a message for you rhona said from dr morrison whos he when hes at home ive no idea all he said was could he have his tshirt back the ghoul with the scythe rebus picked up pa broon turned the bear in his hands they sat in silence for a while until rhona shifted in her chair patience is really nice did the two of you have a good chat she nodded and you told her what a perfect husband id been you must be crazy walking out on her sanitys never exactly been my strong point but you used to know a good thing when you saw it trouble is thats never what i see when i look in the mirror what do you see he looked at her sometimes i dont see anything at all later they took a coffeebreak went to the machine i lost her you know rhona said what sammy i lost her she came back here she came back to you we hardly see one another rhona but shes here dont you get it its you she wants not me she turned away from him fumbled for her handkerchief he stood close behind her then couldnt think of anything to say he was all out of words every line of sympathy rang hollow to him just another cliche he touched the back of her neck rubbed it she lowered her head a little didnt resist massage thered been a lot of massage early on in their relationship by the end he hadnt even given her time for a handshake i dont know why she came back rhona he said at last but i dont think she was running away and i dont think it had much to do with seeing me a couple of nurses ran past urgency in their movements id better get back rhona said rubbing a hand over her face pulling it into something resembling composure rebus went with her to the room then said he had to be going he bent down to kiss sammy feeling the breath from her nostrils against his cheek wake up sammy he cajoled you cant stay in bed all your life time to get up when there was no movement no response he turned and left the room david levy was no longer in edinburgh at least he wasnt at the roxburghe hotel rebus could think of only one way of contacting him seated at his desk he called the holocaust investigation bureau in tel aviv and asked to speak with solomon mayerlink mayerlink wasnt available but rebus identified himself and said he needed to contact him as a matter of urgency he got a home telephone number is there news on linzstek inspector mayerlinks voice was a harsh rasp of a kind yes hes dead silence on the line then a slow release of breath thats a pity it s people die a little bit of history dies with them we would have preferred to see him in court inspector dead hes worthless mayerlink paused i take it this ends your inquiry it changes the nature of the investigation he was murdered static on the line an eightbeat pause how did it happen he was hung from a tree there was a longer silence on the line i see mayerlink said at last there was a slight echo on his voice you think the allegations led to his murder what would you say im not a detective but rebus knew mayerlink was lying detection was exactly the role hed chosen in life a detective of history i need to talk to david levy rebus said do you have his address and phone number he came to see you you know he did its not that simple with david he doesnt work for the bureau hes selfmotivated i ask him for help occasionally sometimes he helps sometimes he doesnt but you do have some way of contacting him it took mayerlink a full minute to come up with the details an address in sussex plus telephone number is david your number one suspect inspector why do you ask i could tell you youre barking up the wrong tree the same tree joseph lintz swung from can you really see david levy as a murderer inspector safari suit walking stick it takes all sorts rebus said putting down the phone he tried levys number it rang and rang he gave it a couple of minutes drank a coffee tried again still no answer he called british telecom instead explained what he needed was finally put through to the right person my names justine graham inspector how can i help rebus gave her lintzs details he used to get itemised bills then he switched he heard her fingers hammer a keyboard thats right she told him the customer asked for itemised billing to be discontinued did he say why no record of that you dont need to give an excuse you know when was this a couple of months back the customer had requested monthly billing several years previously monthly billing because he was meticulous kept his accounts by the month a couple of months back september the lintz linzstek story had blown up in the media and suddenly he hadnt wanted his phone calls to be a matter of record do you have records of his calls even the unitemised ones yes we should have that information id like to see a list everything from the first unitemised call through to this morning is that when he died this morning yes she was thoughtful well ill need to check please do but remember ms graham this is a murder inquiry yes of course and your information could be absolutely crucial im quite aware of so if i could have that by the end of today she hesitated im not sure i can promise that and one last thing the bill for september is missing id like a copy of it let me give you the fax number here speed things up rebus congratulated himself with another cup of coffee and a cigarette in the car park she might or might not deliver later in the day but he was confident shed be trying her best wasnt that all you could ask of anybody another call special branch in london he asked for abernethy ill just put you through someone picked up a grunt in place of an acknowledgement abernethy rebus asked he heard liquid being swallowed the voice became clearer hes not here can i help i really need to speak to him i could have him paged if its urgent my names di rebus lothian and borders police oh right have you lost him or something rebuss expression turned quizzical his voice carried a false note of humour you know what abernethys like a snort dont i just so any help appreciated yeah right look give me your number ill get him to call you have you lost him or something youve no idea where he is then its your city chum take your best shot hes up here rebus thought hes right here i bet the office is quiet without him laughter on the line then the sounds of a cigarette being lit a long exhalation its like being on holiday keep him as long as you like so how long have you been without him a pause as the silence lengthened rebus could feel the change of atmosphere what did you say your name was di rebus i was only asking when he left london this morning soon as he heard so what have i won the hatchback or the hostess trolley rebuss turn to laugh sorry im just nosy ill be sure to tell him that a single click then the sound of an open line later that afternoon rebus chased up british telecom then tried levys house again this time he got through to a woman hello mrs levy my names john rebus i was wondering if i could have a word with your husband you mean my father im sorry is your father there no hes not any idea when absolutely none she sounded peeved im just his cook and cleaner like i dont have a life of my own she caught herself sorry mr rebus its just that he never says how long hes going to be away hes away just now has been for the best part of a fortnight he rings two or three times a week asks if thereve been any calls or letters if im lucky he might remember to ask how im doing and how are you doing a smile in her voice i know i know i sound like im his mother or something well you know fathers rebus stared into the middle distance if you dont tell them anythings wrong theyre happy to assume the best and hold their peace you speak from experience too much experience she was thoughtful is it something important very well give me your name and number and next time he calls ill have him phone you thanks rebus reeled off two numbers home and mobile got that she said any other message no just have him call me rebus thought for a moment has he had any other calls you mean people trying to reach him why do you ask i just no real reason he didnt want to say he was a policeman didnt want her spooked no reason he repeated as he came off the phone someone handed him another coffee that receiver must be red hot he touched it with the tips of his fingers it was pretty warm then it rang and he picked it up again di rebus he said john its siobhan hiya hows tricks john you remember that guy her tone was warning him of something what guy the humour was gone from his voice danny simpson he of the flappy skull telfords lackey what about him ive just found out hes hiv positive his gp let the hospital know blood in rebuss eyes his ears dribbling down his neck poor guy he said quietly he should have said something at the time when when we got him to the hospital well he had other things on his mind and some of them were in danger of falling off christ john be serious for a minute her voice was loud enough to have people glance up from their desks you need to get a blood test fine no problem how is he by the way back home but poorly and sticking to his story do i detect the influence of telfords lawyer charles groal that ones so slimy hes practically primordial saves you the cost of a valentine look just phone the hospital talk to a dr jones shell fix an appointment they can do a test right away not that itll be the last word theres a threemonth incubation thanks siobhan rebus put down the receiver drummed his fingers against it wouldnt that be a nice irony rebus out to get telford does the good samaritan bit for one of his men gets aids and dies rebus stared at the ceiling nice one big man the phone rang again rebus snatched it up switchboard he said is that you john patience aitken the one and only just wanted to check were still on for tonight to be honest patience im not sure ill be at my most sparkling you want to cancel absolutely not but i have something to take care of at the hospital yes of course no i dont think you understand its not sammy this time its me whats wrong so he told her she went with him same hospital sammy was in different department last thing he wanted was to bump into rhona have to explain everything to her possibly hivinfected chances were shed redcard him from the bedside the waiting room was white clean lots of information on the walls leaflets on every table as if paperwork was the real virus i must say its very pleasant for a leper colony patience didnt say anything they were alone in the room someone on reception had dealt with him first then a nurse had come out and taken some details now another door opened mr rebus a tall thin woman in a white coat standing in the doorway dr jones he presumed patience took his arm as they walked towards her halfway across the floor rebus turned on his heels and bolted patience caught up with him outside asked what was wrong i dont want to know he told her but john come on patience all i got was a bit of blood splashed on me she didnt look convinced you need to take the test he looked back towards the building fine started walking away but some other time eh it was one in the morning when he drove back into arden street no dinner date with patience instead theyd visited the hospital sat with rhona hed made a silent pact with the big man bring her back and ill keep off the booze hed driven patience home her last words to him take that test get it over and done with as he locked his car a figure appeared from nowhere mr rebus long time no see rebus recognised the face pointy chin misshapen teeth the breathing a series of small gasps the weasel one of caffertys men he was dressed like a downandout perfect camouflage for his role in life he was caffertys eyes and ears on the street we need to talk mr rebus his hands were deep in the pockets of a tweed coat meant for someone eight inches taller he glanced towards the tenement door not in my flat rebus stated some things were sacrosanct cold out here rebus just shook his head and the weasel sniffed hard you think it was a hit he said yes rebus answered she was meant to die i dont know a pro wouldnt fuck up then it was a warning we could do with seeing your notes cant do that the weasel shrugged thought you wanted mr caffertys help i cant give you the notes what about if i summarise itd be a start rover stolen from george street that afternoon abandoned on a street by piershill cemetery radio and some tapes lifted not necessarily by the same person scavengers could be the weasel was thoughtful a warning that would mean a professional driver yes rebus said and not one of ours doesnt leave too many candidates rover what colour sherwood green parked on george street rebus nodded thanks for that the weasel made to turn away then paused nice doing business with you again mr rebus rebus was about to say something then remembered he needed the weasel more than the weasel needed him he wondered how much crap hed take from cafferty how long hed have to take it all his life had he made a contract with the devil for sammy hed have done much much worse in his flat he stuck on the cd of rock n roll circus skipping to the actual stones tracks his answering machine was flashing three messages the first hogan hello john just thought id check see if theres been any word from bt not by the time rebus had left the office message two abernethy me again bad penny and all that heard youve been trying to catch me ill call you tomorrow cheers rebus stared at the machine willing abernethy to say more to give some hint of a location but the machine was on to the final message bill pryde john tried you at the office left a message but i thought youd want to know weve had final word on those prints if you want to try me at home im on rebus took down the number two in the morning but bill would understand after a minute or so a woman picked up she sounded groggy sorry rebus said is bill there ill get him he heard background dialogue then the receiver being hoisted so whats this about prints he asked christ john when i said you could call i didnt mean the middle of the night its important yes i know hows she doing anyway still out cold pryde yawned well most of the prints inside the car belong to the owner and his wife but we found one other set problem is looks like they belong to a kid what makes you so sure the size plenty of adults around with small hands i suppose so you sound sceptical more likely to be one of two scenarios one sammy was hit by a joyrider i know what you think but it does happen two the prints belong to whoever rifled the car after it was left at the cemetery the kid who took the cassette player and tapes exactly no other prints not even partials the car was clean john exterior same three sets on the doors plus sammys on the bonnet pryde yawned again so what about your grudge theory still holds a pro would be wearing gloves thats what i was thinking not too many pros out there though no rebus was thinking of the weasel im dealing with slime to catch a slug nothing he hadnt done before only this time there were personal reasons and he didnt think thered be a trial breakfast was on hogan bacon rolls in a brown paper bag they ate them in the cid room at st leonards a murder room had been established in leith and thats where hogan should have been only he wanted rebuss files and he knew better than to trust rebus to deliver them thought id save you the hassle was what he said youre a gentleman rebus answered examining the interior of his roll tell me are pigs an endangered species i lifted half a slice from you hogan pulled a string of fat from his mouth tossed it into a bin thought i was doing you a favour cholesterol and all that rebus put the roll to one side took a swig from the can of irnbru hogans idea of a morning beverage and swallowed what was sugar consumption compared to hiv what did you get from the cleaning lady grief soon as she heard her employer was dead the taps were on hogan brushed flour from his fingers mealtime over she never met any of his friends never had occasion to answer his telephone hadnt noticed any change in him recently and doesnt think he was a mass murderer quote if hed killed that many people id have known what is she psychic or something hogan shrugged about all i got from her was a glowing character reference and the fact that as she was paid in advance she owes his estate a partial refund theres your motive hogan smiled speaking of motives youve got something lintzs lawyer has come up with a letter from the deceaseds bank he handed rebus a photocopy seems our man made a cash withdrawal of five grand ten days ago cash we found ten quid on his person and about another thirty bar in the house no five grand im beginning to think blackmail rebus nodded what about his address book slow work a lot of old numbers people whove moved on or died plus a few charities museums an art gallery or two hogan paused what about you rebus opened his drawer pulled out the fax sheets waiting for me this morning the calls lintz wanted kept secret hogan looked down the list calls plural or one in particular ive just started going through them best guess therell be callers he spoke to regularly those numbers will show up on the other statements were looking for anomalies oneoffs makes sense hogan looked at his watch anything else i should know two things remember i told you about the special branch interest abernethy rebus nodded i tried calling him yesterday and according to his office he was on his way up here hed already heard the news so ive got abernethy sniffing around and you dont trust him terrific whats the other thing david levy i spoke with his daughter she doesnt know where he is he could be anywhere with a grudge against lintz its possible whats his phone number rebus patted the topmost file on his desk ready for you to take away hogan studied the foothigh pile looking glum i whittled it down to whats absolutely necessary rebus told him theres a months reading there rebus shrugged my case is your case bobby with hogan gone rebus went back to the british telecom list it was as detailed as he could have wished for lots of calls to lintzs solicitor a few to one of the citys taxi firms rebus tried a couple of numbers found himself connected to charity offices lintz would have been phoning to tender his resignation there were a few calls that stood out from the crowd the roxburghe hotel duration four minutes edinburgh university twentysix minutes the roxburghe had to mean levy rebus knew levy had talked to lintz lintz himself had admitted it talking to him being confronted by him was one thing calling him at his hotel quite another the number for edinburgh university connected rebus to the main switchboard he asked to be put through to lintzs old department the secretary was very helpful shed been in the job over twenty years was due to retire yes she remembered professor lintz but he hadnt contacted the department recently every call that comes through here i know about it he might have got straight through to a tutor though rebus suggested no ones mentioned speaking to him theres nobody here from the professors day he doesnt keep in touch with the department i havent spoken to him in years inspector too many years for me to remember so who had he been talking to for over twenty minutes rebus thanked the secretary and put down the phone he went through the other numbers a couple of restaurants a wine shop and the local radio station rebus told the receptionist what he was after and she said shed do her best then he went back to the restaurants asked them to check if lintz had been making a reservation within half an hour the calls started coming in first restaurant a booking for dinner just the one cover the radio station theyd asked lintz to appear on a programme hed said hed consider it then had called back to decline second restaurant a lunch reservation two covers two mr lintz and one other any idea who the other might have been another gentleman quite elderly i think im sorry i dont really remember did he walk with a stick i wish i could help but its a madhouse here at lunchtime you remember lintz though mr lintz is a regular was a regular did he usually eat alone or with company mostly alone he didnt seem to mind hed bring a book with him do you happen to recall any of his other guests i remember a young woman his daughter maybe or granddaughter so when you say young younger than him a pause maybe much younger when was this i really dont remember the voice impatient now i appreciate your help sir just one more minute of your time this woman did he bring her more than once im sorry inspector the kitchen needs me well if you think of anything else of course goodbye rebus put the phone down made some notes just one number left he waited for an answer yeah the voice grudging whos this this is malky who the fuck are you a voice in the background tommy says that new machines fucked rebus put the phone down his hand was shaking that new machine tommy telford on his arcade motorbike he remembered the family mugshots malky jordan tiny nose and eyes in a balloon of a face joseph lintz talking to one of telfords men phoning telfords offce rebus found the number of hogans mobile bobby he said if youre driving better slow down right now hogans notion five in cash was just telfords style blackmail but where was the connection something else hogans play hed talk to telford rebuss notion five was a bit steep for a hitman all the same he wondered about lintz paying five thou to telford to set up the accident motive give rebus a fright scare him off it put lintz back in the frame potentially rebus had fixed up another meeting one he didnt want anyone knowing about haymarket station was nice and anonymous the bench on platform one ned farlowe was already waiting he looked tired worry over sammy they talked about her for a couple of minutes then rebus got down to business you know lintz has been murdered i didnt think this was a social call were looking at a blackmail angle farlowe looked interested and he didnt pay up oh he paid up all right rebus thought he paid up and someone still took him out of the game look ned this is all off the record by rights i should take you in for questioning because i followed him for a few days yes and that makes me a suspect it makes you a possible witness farlowe thought about it one evening lintz left his house walked down the road made a call from a phonebox then went straight back home not wanting to use his home phone afraid it was bugged afraid of the number being traced telephone bugging a favourite ploy of special branch and something else farlowe was saying he met this woman on his doorstep like she was waiting for him they had a few words i think she was crying when she left what did she look like tall short dark hair welldressed she had a briefcase with her wearing farlowe shrugged skirt and jacket matching black and white check you know elegant he was describing kirstin mede her phone message to rebus i cant do this any more theres something i want to ask you farlowe was saying that girl candice what about her you asked me if anything unusual had happened just before sammy got hit yes well she happened didnt she farlowes eyes narrowed does she have anything to do with it rebus looked at farlowe who started nodding thanks for the confirmation who was she one of telfords girls farlowe leaped to his feet paced the platform rebus waited for him to sit down again when he did there could be no doubting the fury in his eyes you hid one of telfords girls with your own daughter i didnt have much choice telford knows where i live i you were using us he paused telford did this didnt he i dont know rebus said farlowe leaped to his feet again look ned i dont want you quite frankly inspector i dont think youre in any position to give advice he started walking and though rebus called after him he never once looked back as rebus walked into the crime squad office a paper plane glided past and crashed into the wall ormiston had his feet up on the desk country and western music was playing softly in the background its source a tape player on the window ledge behind claverhouses desk siobhan clarke had pulled a chair over beside him they were poring over some report not exactly the ateam in here is it rebus retrieved the plane straightened its crumpled nose and sent it back to ormiston who asked what he was doing there liaising rebus told him my boss wants a progress report ormiston glanced towards claverhouse who was tipping himself back in his chair hands behind his head want to take a guess at the headway weve made rebus sat down opposite claverhouse nodded a greeting to siobhan hows sammy she asked just the same rebus answered claverhouse looked abashed and rebus suddenly realised that he could use sammy as a lever play on peoples sympathy why not hadnt he used her in the past wasnt ned farlowe on the nail there weve pulled the surveillance claverhouse said why ormiston snorted but it was claverhouse who answered high maintenance low returns orders from above it isnt as if we were close to getting a result so we just let him get on with getting on claverhouse shrugged rebus wondered if news would get back to newcastle jake tarawicz would be happy hed think rebus was fulfilling his part of the bargain candice would be safe maybe any news on that nightclub killing nothing to link it to your chum cafferty hes not my chum whatever you say stick the kettle on ormie ormiston glanced towards clarke then rose grudgingly from his chair rebus had thought the tension in the office was all to do with telford not a bit of it claverhouse and clarke close together involved ormiston off on his own a kid making paper planes seeking attention an old status quo song paper plane but the status quo here had been disturbed clarke had usurped ormiston the office junior was absolved from making the tea rebus could see why ormiston was pissed off i hear herr lintz was a bit of a swinger claverhouse said now theres a joke i havent heard before rebuss pager sounded the display gave him a number to call he used claverhouses phone it sounded like he was connected to a payphone street sounds heavy traffic close by mr rebus placed the voice at once the weasel what is it a couple of questions the tape player from the car any idea of the make sony the front bit detachable thats right so all they got was the front bit yes claverhouse and clarke back at their report pretending they werent listening what about the tapes you said some tapes got stolen opera the marriage of figaro and verdis macbeth rebus squeezed his eyes shut thinking and another tape with film music on it famous themes plus roy orbisons greatest hits this last the wifes rebus knew what the weasel was thinking whoever took the stuff theyd try flogging it round the pubs or at a car boot sale car boot sales were clearing houses for knockoff but getting whoever had lifted the stuff from the unlocked car wasnt going to nail the driver unless the kid the one whod lifted the stuff whose prints were on the car had seen something been hanging around on the street watched the car screeching to a stop a man getting out and hoofing it an eye witness someone who could describe the driver the only prints we got were small maybe a kids thats interesting anything else i can do rebus said just let me know the weasel hung up sonys a good make claverhouse said fishing some stuff lifted from a car rebus told him it might have turned up ormiston had made the tea rebus went to fetch himself a chair saw someone walk past the open doorway he dropped the chair and ran into the corridor grabbed at an arm abernethy spun quickly saw who it was and relaxed nice one son he said you almost had knuckles for teeth he was working on a piece of chewing gum what are you doing here visiting abernethy looked back at the open door walked towards it what about you working abernethy read the sign on the door crime squad he said sounding amused taking in the office and the people in it hands in pockets he sauntered in rebus following abernethy special branch the londoner said by way of introduction that musics a good idea play it at interrogations sap the suspects will to live he was smiling surveying the premises like he was thinking of moving in the mug meant for rebus was on the corner of the desk abernethy picked it up and slurped made a face started chewing again the three crime squad officers were like a frozen tableau suddenly they looked like a unit it had taken abernethy to do that had taken him all of ten seconds what you working on no one answered mustve got the sign on the door wrong abernethy said should be mime squad is there something we can do for you claverhouse asked his voice level hostility in his eyes i dont know it was john pulled me in here and im pulling you out again rebus said taking his arm abernethy shrugged free bunched his fists a word in the corridor please abernethy smiled manners maketh the man john what does that maketh you abernethy turned his head slowly looked at siobhan clarke whod just spoken im just a regular guy with a heart of gold and twelve big inches of ability he grinned at her to go with your twelve big points of iq she said going back to the report ormiston and claverhouse werent trying too hard to conceal their laughter as abernethy stormed out of the room rebus hung back long enough to watch ormiston pat clarke on the back then headed off after the special branch man what a bitch abernethy said he was making for the exit shes a friend of mine and they say you can choose your friends abernethy shook his head what brings you back you have to ask lintz is dead case closed as far as youre concerned they emerged from the building so so rebus persisted why come all the way back here what is there that couldnt be done with a phone or fax abernethy stopped turned to face him loose ends what loose ends there arent any abernethy gave a cheerless smile and took a key from his pocket as they approached his car he used the remote to unlock it and disable the alarm whats going on abernethy nothing to worry your pretty little head about he opened the driversside door are you glad hes dead what lintz how do you feel about him being murdered ive no feelings either way hes dead which means i can cross him off my list that last time you came up here you were warning him not true was his phone bugged abernethy just snorted did you know he might be killed abernethy turned on rebus whats it to you ill tell you nothing leith cid are on the murder and youre out of it end of story is it the rat line too embarrassing if it all came to light christ what is it with you just give it a rest abernethy got into the car closed the door rebus didnt move the engine turned and caught abernethys window slid down rebus was ready they sent you four hundred miles just to check there were no loose ends so so theres rather a large loose end isnt there rebus paused unless you know who lintzs killer was i leave that sort of thing to you guys heading down to leith i have to talk to hogan abernethy stared at rebus youre a hard bastard arent you maybe even a bit selfish hows that if id a daughter in hospital police work would be the last thing on my mind as rebus lunged towards the open window abernethy gunned the car footsteps behind siobhan clarke good riddance she said watching the car speed off a finger appeared from abernethys window she gave a two fingered reply i didnt want to say anything in the office she began i took the test yesterday rebus lied itll be negative are you positive she smiled a little longer than the joke merited ormiston chucked your tea away said he was going to disinfect the mug abernethy has that effect on people he looked at her remember ormiston and claverhouse go back years i know i think claverhouse has a crush on me itll pass but until it does tread carefully they started walking back towards the main entrance and dont let him tempt you into the broom cupboard rebus went back to st leonards saw that the office was coping quite well without him and headed over to the hospital with dr morrisons iron maiden tshirt in a plastic bag a third bed had been moved into sammys room an elderly woman lay in it though awake she stared fixedly at the ceiling rhona was at sammys bedside reading a book rebus stroked his daughters hair how is she no change any more tests planned not that i know of thats it then she just stays like this he lifted a chair over sat down it had turned into a sort of ritual now this bedside vigil it felt almost the word he wanted to use was comfortable he squeezed rhonas hand sat there for twenty minutes saying almost nothing then went to find kirstin mede she was in her office at the french department marking scripts she sat at a big desk in front of the window but moved from this to a coffeetable with half a dozen chairs arranged around it sit down she said rebus sat down i got your message he told her hardly matters now does it the mans dead i know you spoke with him kirstin she glanced towards him im sorry you waited for him outside his house did the two of you have a nice chat colour had risen to her cheeks she crossed her legs tugged the hem of her skirt towards her knee yes she said at last i went to his house why because i wanted to see him close up her eyes were on his now challenging him i thought maybe i could tell from his face the look in his eyes maybe something in his tone of voice and could you she shook her head not a damned thing no window to the soul what did you say to him i told him who i was any reaction yes she folded her arms his words my dear lady will you kindly piss off and did you yes because i knew then not whether he was linzstek or not but something else what that he was at the end of his tether she was nodding absolutely at breaking point she looked at rebus again and capable of anything the problem with the flint street surveillance was that it had been so open a hidden operation deep cover thats what was needed rebus had decided to scout out the territory the tenement flats across the road from telfords cafe and arcade were served by a single main door it was locked so rebus chose a buzzer at random marked hetherington waited pushed again an elderly voice came on the intercom who is it please mrs hetherington detective inspector rebus im your community cid officer can i talk to you about home security thereve been a few breakins around here especially with elderly victims gracious youd better come up which floor the first the door buzzed and rebus pushed it open mrs hetherington was waiting for him in her doorway she was tiny and fraillooking but her eyes were lively and her movements assured the flat was small wellmaintained the sittingroom was heated by a twobar electric fire rebus wandered over to the window found himself looking down on to the arcade perfect location for a surveillance he pretended to check her windows these seem fine he said are they always locked i open them a bit in the summer mrs hetherington said and when they need washing but i always lock them again afterwards one thing i should warn you about and thats bogus officials people coming to your door telling you theyre soandso always ask to see some id and dont open up until youre satisfied how can i see it without opening the door ask them to push it through the letterbox i didnt see your identification did i rebus smiled no you didnt he took it out and showed her sometimes the fake stuff can look pretty convincing if youre unsure keep the door locked and call the police he looked around you have a phone in the bedroom any windows in there yes can i take a look the bedroom window also looked out on to flint street rebus noticed travel brochures on the dressingtable a small suitcase standing near the door off on holiday eh with the flat empty maybe he could move the surveillance in just a long weekend she said somewhere nice holland wrong time of year for the bulbfields but ive always wanted to go its a nuisance flying from inverness but so much cheaper since my husband died well ive done a bit of travelling any chance of taking me with you rebus smiled this windows fine too ill just check your door see if it could do with more locks they went into the narrow hall you know she said weve always been very lucky here no breakins or anything like that hardly surprising with tommy telford as proprietor and with the panic button of course rebus looked at the wall next to the front door a large red button hed assumed it was for the stairhead lights or something anyone who calls anyone at all im supposed to press it rebus opened the door and do you two very large men were standing right outside oh yes mrs hetherington said i always do for thugs they were very polite rebus showed them his warrant card and explained the nature of his visit he asked them who they were and they told him they were representatives of the buildings owner he knew the faces though kenny houston ally cornwell houston the ugly one ran telfords doormen cornwell with his wrestlers bulk was general muscle the little charade was carried out with humour and good nature on both sides they accompanied him downstairs across the street tommy telford was standing in the cafe doorway wagging his finger a pedestrian crossed rebuss line of vision too late rebus saw who it was had his mouth open to shout something then saw telford hang his head hands going to his face screeching rebus ran across the road pulled the pedestrian round ned farlowe a bottle dropped from farlowes hand telfords men were closing in rebus held tight to farlowe im placing this man under arrest he said hes mine understood a dozen faces glaring at him and tommy telford down on his knees get your boss to the hospital rebus said im taking this one to st leonards ned farlowe sat on the ledge in one of the cells the walls were blue smeared brown near the toiletpan farlowe was looking pleased with himself acid rebus said pacing the cell acid all this research must have gone to your head its what he deserved rebus glared at him you dont know what youve done i know exactly what ive done hell kill you farlowe shrugged am i under arrest youd better believe it son i want you kept out of harms way if i hadnt been there but he didnt want to think about that he looked at farlowe looked at sammys lover whod just staged a fullfrontal assault on telford the kind of assault rebus knew wouldnt work now rebus would have to redouble his efforts because otherwise ned farlowe was a dead man and when sammy came round he didnt want news like that to be waiting for her he drove back towards flint street parked at a distance from it and headed there on foot telford had the place sewn up no doubt about it letting his flats to old folk might have been a charitable act but hed made damned sure it served its purpose rebus wondered if given the same circumstances cafferty would have been clever enough to think of panicbuttons he suspected not cafferty wasnt thick but most of what he did he did by instinct rebus wondered if tommy telford had ever made a rash move in his life he was staking out flint street because he needed an in needed to find the weak link in the chain around telford after ten minutes of wind chill he thought of a better idea on his mobile he called one of the citys taxi firms identified himself and asked if henry wilson was on shift he was rebus told the switchboard to put a call out to henry it was as simple as that ten minutes later wilson turned up he drank in the ox occasionally which was his problem really drunk in charge of a taxicab luckily rebus had been around to smooth things over as a result of which wilson owed him a lifetime of favours he was tall heavily built with short black hair and a long black beard ruddy faced and he always wore check shirts rebus thought of him as the lumberjack need a lift wilson said as rebus got into the front passenger seat first thing i need is a blast of the heater wilson obliged second thing i need is to use your taxi as cover you mean sit here thats what i mean with the meter running youve got an engine problem henry your cabs out of the game for the rest of the afternoon im saving up for christmas wilson complained rebus stared him out the big man sighed and lifted a newspaper from the side of his seat help me pick a few winners then he said turning to the racing pages they sat for over an hour at the end of flint street and rebus stayed in the front of the cab his reasoning a cab parked with a passenger in the back looked suspicious a cab parked with two guys in the front and youd just think they were on their break or at shifts end two cabbies sharing stories and a flask of tea rebus took one sip from the plastic cup and winced half a bag of sugar in the flask ive always had a sweet tooth wilson explained he had a packet of crisps open on his lap pickled onion flavour finally rebus saw two range rovers being driven into flint street sean haddow telfords money man was driving the lead car he got out and went into the arcade on the passenger seat rebus could see a huge yellow teddy bear haddow was coming out again bringing telford with him telford back from the hospital already hands bandaged gauze patches on his face like hed had a particularly ropey shave but not about to let a little thing like an acid attack get in the way of business haddow held the back door open and telford got in this is us henry rebus said youre going to be following those two range rovers stay back as far as you like those things are so high off the ground well be able to see them over anything smaller than a doubledecker both range rovers headed out of flint street the second car carried three of telfords soldiers rebus recognised prettyboy the other two were younger recruits welldressed with groomed hair one hundred percent business the convoy headed for the city centre stopped outside a hotel telford had a word with his men but entered the building alone the cars stayed where they were are you going in wilson asked i think id be noticed rebus said the drivers of both range rovers had got out and were enjoying a smoke but keeping a keen eye on people entering and leaving the hotel a couple of prospects looked into the cab but wilson shook his head i could be making a mint here he muttered rebus offered him a polo wilson accepted with a snort brilliant rebus said wilson looked back towards the hotel a parking warden was talking to haddow and pretty boy she had her notebook out they were tapping their watches attempting charm double yellow lines kerbside no parking any time haddow and prettyboy held up their hands in surrender had a quick confab then it was back into the range rovers prettyboy made circling motions with one hand letting his passengers know they were going to circle the block the warden stood her ground till theyd moved off haddow was on his mobile doubtless letting his boss know the score interesting they hadnt tried to strongarm the warden or bribe her nothing like that lawabiding citizens telfords rules no doubt again rebus couldnt see any of caffertys men giving in so quickly you going in then wilson asked not much point henry telford will already be in a bedroom or somebodys suite if hes doing business itll be behind closed doors so that was tommy telford youve heard of him im a taxi driver we hear things hes after big gers cab business wilson paused not that big ger has a cab business you understand any idea how telford plans to wrest it away from cafferty scare off the drivers or get them to switch sides what about your company henry honest legal and decent mr rebus no approach by telford not yet here they come again they watched as the two range rovers turned back into the street there was no sign of the warden a couple of minutes later telford emerged from the hotel bringing with him a japanese man with spiky hair and a shiny aquamarine suit he carried a briefcase but didnt look like a businessman maybe it was the sunglasses worn in lateafternoon twilight maybe it was the cigarette slouching from the corner of the downturned mouth both men got into the back of the lead car the japanese leaned forward and ruffled the teddy bears ears making some joke telford didnt look amused do we follow them wilson asked he saw the look on rebuss face turned the key in the ignition they were heading west out of town rebus already had an inkling of their ultimate destination but he wanted to know what route theyd take turned out it was much the same route hed taken with candice she hadnt recognised anything until juniper green but it wasnt as if there were many landmarks on slateford road the back car signalled that it was pulling over what do i do wilson asked keep going make the first left you can and turn the cab round well wait for them to go past us haddow had gone into a newspaper shop same story as with candice strange during what was a business trip that telford would allow a stop and what about the building which according to candice hed seemed so interested in there it was an anonymous brick edifice a warehouse maybe rebus could think of reasons why a warehouse might be of interest to tommy telford haddow stayed in the shop three minutes rebus timed him no one else came out so it wasnt as if hed had to queue back into the car and the little convoy set off again they were heading for juniper green and after that poyntinghame country club little point in tagging along the further they got out of town the more conspicuous the cab would be rebus told henry to turn around he got the cabbie to drop him off at the oxford bar wilson slid down his window as he was about to move off are we square now he called till next time henry rebus pushed open the door and walked into the pub perched on a stool daytime tv and margaret the barmaid for company rebus ordered a mug of coffee and a corned beef and beetroot roll for his main course margaret suggested a bridie excellent choice rebus agreed he was thinking about the japanese businessman who hadnt really looked like a businessman at all hed been all sharp edges chiselled face fortified rebus walked from the ox back to the hotel and kept watch on it from an overpriced bar across the street he passed the time making calls on his mobile by the time the battery died hed spoken with hogan bill pryde siobhan clarke rhona and patience and had been about to call torphichen copshop see if anyone there could identify the building on slateford road two hours crawled by he broke his personal best for slow drinking two cokes the bar wasnt exactly crowded no one seemed to mind the music was on a tapeloop psycho killer was coming round for the third time when the range rovers stopped outside the hotel telford and the jap shook hands made slight bows telford and his men drove off rebus left the bar crossed the road and entered the hotel the lift doors were closing on mr aquamarine rebus walked up to reception showed his id the guest who just came in i need his name the receptionist had to check mr matsumoto first name takeshi when did he arrive she checked the register again yesterday how longs he staying three more days look i should call my supervisor rebus shook his head thats all i needed to know thanks mind if i sit in the lounge for a while she shook her head so rebus wandered into the residents lounge he settled on a sofa perfect view of the reception area through the glass doubledoors and picked up a newspaper matsumoto was in town on poyntinghame business but rebus had a whiff of something altogether less savoury hugh malahides story had been that a corporation wanted to buy the club but matsumoto didnt look like he worked in any aboveboard business when he finally emerged into reception hed changed into a white suit black opennecked shirt and burberry trenchcoat topped off with a woollen tartan scarf he had a cigarette in his mouth but didnt light it until he was outside the hotel with the collar of his coat turned up he started walking rebus followed him for the best part of a mile and kept checking that no one was following him it was possible after all that telford would want to keep tabs on matsumoto but if there was surveillance it was exceptional matsumoto wasnt playing the tourist wasnt dawdling he kept his head down protecting his face from the wind and seemed to have some destination in mind when he disappeared into a building rebus paused studying the glass door behind which stood a flight of red carpeted stairs he knew where he was didnt need the sign above the door to tell him he was outside the morvena casino the place used to be owned by a local villain called topper hamilton and managed by a man called mandelson but hamilton was in retirement and mandelson had scarpered the new owner was still an unknown quantity or had been till now rebus guessed he wouldnt be far wrong if he placed tommy telford and his japanese friends in the frame he looked around checking the parked cars no range rovers what the hell he said to himself pushing open the door and starting to climb the stairs in the upstairs foyer he was eyeballed by security two of them looking uncomfortable in their black suits and bowties white shirts one skinny hed be all about speed and manoeuvres one a real heavyweight slow muscle to back up the fast moves rebus seemed to pass whatever test theyd just given him he bought a twentys worth of chips and walked into the gaming room at one time it would have been the drawingroom of a georgian house there were two huge bay windows and ornate cornicing connected the twentyfoothigh cream walls to the pastelpink ceiling now it was home to gaming tables blackjack dice roulette hostesses moved between the tables taking orders for drinks there was very little noise the gamblers took their work seriously rebus wouldnt have called the place busy but what clientele there was comprised a veritable united nations matsumotos coat had disappeared into the cloakroom and he was seated at the roulette table rebus sat down beside two men at the blackjack table nodded a greeting the dealer young but obviously sure of himself smiled rebus won with his first hand lost with his second and third won again with his fourth there was a voice just behind his right ear something to drink sir the hostess had bent forward to speak to him showing plenty of cleavage coke he told her ice and lemon he pretended to watch her move away really he was scoping the room hed sat in on the game quickly walking around the room would have attracted everyones interest and he couldnt be sure if thered be anyone here whod know him he neednt have worried the only person he recognised was matsumoto rubbing his hands as the croupier pushed chips towards him rebus stuck on eighteen the dealer got twenty rebus had never been a great gambler hed tried the football pools sometimes the horses and now occasionally the lottery but fruit machines didnt interest him the poker sessions organised in the office didnt interest him he had other ways of losing money matsumoto lost and gave what sounded like a curse a little bit louder than the room liked the skinny security ape put his head around the door but matsumoto ignored him and when mr skinny saw who was making the noise he retreated fast matsumoto laughed he might not have much english but he knew he had power in this place he told everyone something in a stream of japanese nodding trying for eye contact then a hostess brought him a big tumbler of whisky and ice he handed her a couple of chips as a tip the croupier was telling everyone to place their bets matsumoto quietened down and went back to work rebuss drink was a while coming coke the unlikely beverage of the high roller hed won a couple of hands felt a bit better stood up to accept the drink the table knew to leave him out of the next deal where are you from he asked the hostess i cant place your accent i am from ukraine you speak good english thank you she turned away conversation was not house policy it kept the punters away from their games ukraine rebus wondered if she was another of tarawiczs imports like candice a few things seemed clear to him matsumoto was comfortable here therefore known and the staff were wary of him therefore he had clout had telford behind him telford wanted him kept sweet it wasnt much return for all rebuss work but it was something then someone walked in someone rebus knew dr colquhoun he saw rebus immediately and fear jumped into his face colquhoun with his sick line to the university his enforced holiday no forwarding address colquhoun whod known rebus wastaking candice to the petrecs rebus watched him back towards the doors watched him turn and run options go after him or stay with matsumoto which was the more important to him now candice or telford rebus stayed but now colquhoun was back in town hed track him down for definite after an hour and a quarters play he was considering cashing a cheque for more chips twenty quid down in a little over an hour and candice fighting for some space in his crowded head he took a break moved to a row of fruit machines but the lights and buttons defeated him he wasted three nudges and ran out of time on some accumulator another two quid gone this time in a couple of minutes little wonder clubs and pubs wanted slot machines tommy telford was in the right business his hostess came to see him again asked if he wanted another drink im fine he said not much action tonight its early she told him wait till after midnight no way was he sticking around that long but matsumoto surprised him threw up his hands and came out with another rush of japanese nodding and grinning gathering up his chips he cashed them and left the casino rebus waited all of thirty seconds then followed he said a breezy goodnight to the security men felt their eyes on him all the way back down the stairs matsumoto was buttoning his coat wrapping the scarf tight around his neck he was headed back in the direction of the hotel rebus suddenly bonetired stopped in his tracks he was thinking of sammy and lintz and the weasel thinking of all the time he seemed to be wasting fuck this for a game of soldiers turned on his heels and went to collect his car ten years after goin home it was a twentyminute walk to flint street a lot of it uphill and with the wind doing nobody any favours the city was quiet people huddled at bus stops students munching on baked potatoes chips with curry sauce a few souls marching home with the concentrated tread of the sozzled rebus stopped frowned looked around this was where hed left the saab he was positive no not positive the word had taken on malign overtones he was sure yes sure hed left the saab right here where now a black ford sierra was parked and behind that a mini but no sign of rebuss car aw christ he exploded there were no signs of glass by the roadside which meant they hadnt taken a brick to one of his windows oh thered be jokes in the office about this though whether he got the car back or not a taxi came along and he flagged it down then remembered hed no cash so waved it off again his flat in arden street wasnt that far off but had he been a camel hed have been keeping well clear of any straw he was asleep in his chair by the livingroom window duvet pulled up to his neck when the buzzer sounded he couldnt remember setting the alarm consciousness brought the dawning realisation that it was his door he staggered to his feet found his trousers and put them on all right all right he called heading for the hall keep your hair on he opened the door and saw bill pryde jesus bill is this some sort of twisted revenge rebus looked at his watch twofifteen afraid not john pryde said his face and voice told rebus something bad had happened something very bad indeed ive been off the booze for weeks sure about that definite rebuss eyes burned into those of do gill templer they were in her office at st leonards pryde was there too his jacket was off and his sleeves rolled up gill templer looked bleary from interrupted sleep rebus was pacing what floor there was unable to stay seated ive had nothing to drink all day but coffee and coke really rebus ran his hands through his hair he felt groggy and his head was throbbing but he couldnt ask for paracetamol and water theyd assume hangover come on gill he said im being shafted here who authorised your surveillance nobody i did it in my own time how do you work that out the chief super said i could take a bit of time off he meant so you could visit your daughter she paused is that what this was all about maybe this mr she checked her notes matsumoto he was connected to thomas telford and your theory is that telford was behind the attack on your daughter rebus thumped the wall with his fists its a setup oldest trick in the book ive yet to see one perfected theres got to be something at the scene something out of kilter he turned to his colleagues youve got to let me go there take a look around templer looked to bill pryde pryde folded his arms shrugged assent but it was templers play she was the senior officer here she tapped her pen against her teeth then dropped it on to the desk will you submit to a blood test rebus swallowed why not he said at last come on then she said getting to her feet the story was matsumoto had been on his way back to his hotel crossing the road hed been hit by a car travelling at speed the driver hadnt stopped not right away but the car had travelled only another couple of hundred yards before mounting the pavement with its front wheels it had been abandoned there drivers door open a saab its identity known to half the lothian and borders force the interior reeked of whisky the screwtop from a bottle lying on the passenger seat no sign of the bottle no sign of the driver just the car and two hundred yards further back the body of the japanese businessman growing cold by the roadside nobody had seen anything nobody had heard anything rebus could believe it never one of the city centres busier routes at this hour the place was dead when i followed him from his hotel he didnt come this way rebus told templer she stood with shoulders hunched hands deep in her coat pockets keeping out the cold so she asked long way round for a shortcut maybe he wanted to see the sights pryde suggested what times this supposed to have happened rebus asked templer hesitated theres a margin of error look gill i know this is awkward you shouldnt have brought me here you shouldnt answer my questions im the number one suspect after all rebus knew how much she had to lose over two hundred male chief inspectors in scotland only five women bad odds and a lot of people waiting for her to fail he held up his hands look if i was blind drunk and i hit somebody think id leave the car at the scene you might not know youd hit anyone you hear a thunk lose control and mount the kerb and some survival instinct tells you its time to get out and walk only i hadnt been drinking i left the car near flint street and thats where they took it from any signs it was broken into she didnt say anything ill guess not rebus went on because professionals dont leave marks but to get it started they must have wired it or got into the steering column thats what you should be looking for the car had been towed first thing in the morning forensics would be all over it rebus laughed shaking his head its nice though isnt it first they make sammy look like a hit and run and now they try to pin me for the same thing whos they telford and his men i thought you said they were doing business with matsumoto theyre all gangsters gill gangsters fall out what about cafferty rebus frowned what about him hes got an old grudge against you this way he stitches you up and annoys telford so you do think im being stitched up im giving you the benefit of the doubt she paused not everyone will what was matsumotos business with telford something to do with a country club on the surface at least some japanese were buying it and telford was clearing the way he shivered should have worn a coat over his jacket he rubbed his arm where the blood sample had been taken to test his alcohol level of course a check of the deceaseds hotel room might throw up something weve already been there pryde said nothing out of the ordinary which deadbeat did you send i went myself gill templer said voice as icy as the wind rebus bowed his head in apology she had a point though matsumoto and telford had been doing business there had been nothing about their farewell to one another to suggest a breakup and matsumoto had seemed happy and confident at the casino what had telford to gain by bumping him off apart from maybe getting rebus off his back templer had mentioned cafferty was big ger capable of such a move what did he stand to gain apart from settling a longheld grudge against rebus giving telford a headache and maybe gaining poyntinghame and the japanese deal for himself balance the two telford against cafferty caffertys side tipped went clunk as it hit the ground lets get back to the station templer said im reaching the early stages of frostbite can i go home then were not done with you yet john she said getting into the car not by a long chalk but eventually they had to let him go he wasnt being charged not yet there was work still to be done he knew they could make a case against him if they wanted to knew it only too well hed followed matsumoto out of the club he was the one with the grudge against telford he was the one whod see poetic justice in sending telford a message by driving over one of his associates he john rebus was firmly in the frame it was tightly constructed and quite elegant in its way the scales suddenly tipped back towards telford again so much subtler than cafferty telford rebus visited farlowe in his cell the reporter wasnt asleep how long do i have to stay here he asked as long as possible hows telford minor burns dont expect him to press charges hell want you on the outside then youll have to let me go dont bet on it ned we can press charges we dont need telford farlowe looked at him youre going to prosecute me i saw the whole thing unwarranted attack on an innocent man farlowe snorted then smiled ironic isnt it charging me for my own good he paused i wont be able to see sammy will i rebus shook his head i didnt think of that fact is i didnt think he looked up from his ledge i just did and right up until the moment i did it it felt brilliant and afterwards farlowe shrugged what does afterwards matter its only the rest of my life rebus didnt go home knew he wouldnt sleep and hed no car so he couldnt go driving instead he visited the hospital sat down by sammys bedside he took her hand rested it against his face when a nurse came in and asked if he wanted anything he asked if shed any paracetamol in a hospital she said smiling ill see what i can do rebus was due for further questioning at st leonards at ten oclock so when his pager sounded at eightfifteen he assummed it was a reminder but the phone number it wanted him to call was the mortuary down in the cowgate he called from the hospital payphone and was put through to dr curt looks like ive drawn the short straw curt told him youre about to start work on matsumoto for my sins look ive heard the stories dont suppose theres any truth in them i didnt kill him glad to hear it john curt seemed to be struggling to say something there are questions of ethics of course so i cant suggest that you come down here theres something you think i should see that i cant say curt cleared his throat but if you happened to be here and the place is always very quiet this time of the morning im on my way the infirmary to the mortuary a tenminute walk curt himself was waiting to lead rebus to the body the room was all white tile bright light and stainless steel two of the dissectingtables lay empty matsumotos naked body lay on the third rebus walked around it stunned by what he saw tattoos and not just the kilted piper on a sailors arm these were works of art and they were massive a scaly green dragon breathing pink and red fire covered one shoulder and crept down the arm towards the wrist its back legs reached around the bodys neck while its front ones rested on the chest there were other smaller dragons and a landscape mount fuji reflected in water there were japanese symbols and the visored face of a kendo champion curt put on rubber gloves and had rebus do the same then the two men rolled the body over displaying a further gallery across matsumotos back a masked actor something out of a noh play and a warrior in full armour some delicate flowers the effect was mesmerising stunning arent they curt said phenomenal ive visited japan a few times given papers at conferences so you recognise some of these a few of the references yes thing is tattoos especially on this scale usually mean youre a gang member like the triads the japanese are called yakuza look here curt held up the left hand the pinkie had been severed at the first joint the skin healed in a rough crust thats what happens when they screw up isnt it rebus said the word yakuza bouncing around in his head someone cuts off a finger every time i think so yes curt said just thought you might like to know rebus nodded eyes glued to the corpse anything else well i havent started on him yet really all looks fairly standard evidence of impact with a moving vehicle crushed ribcage fractures to the arms and legs rebus noticed that a bone was protruding from one calf obscenely white against the skin therell be a lot of internal damage shock probably killed him curt was thoughtful i must let professor gates know doubt hell have seen anything like it can i use your phone rebus asked he knew one person who might know about the yakuza shed seemed knowledgeable about every other countrys criminal gangs so he spoke to miriam kenworthy in newcastle tattoos and missing fingers she said bingo thats yakuza actually its only the top bit missing from one little finger thats done to them when they step out of line isnt it not quite they do it to themselves as a way of saying theyre sorry im not sure i know much more than that there was the sound of papers being shifted im just looking for my notes what notes when i was connecting all these gangs different cultures i did some research might be something on the yakuza look can i call you back how long five minutes rebus gave her curts number then sat and waited curts room wasnt so much an office as a walkin cupboard files were stacked high on his desk and a dictaphone lay on top of them along with a fresh pack of tapes the room reeked of cigarettes and bad ventilation on the walls schedules of meetings postcards a couple of framed prints the place was a bolthole a necessity curt spent most of his time elsewhere rebus took out colquhouns business card tried home and office as far as his secretary was concerned dr colquhoun was still off sick maybe but he was well enough to visit a casino one of telfords casinos no coincidence surely kenworthy was good as gold yakuza she said sounding like she was lifting from her script ninety thousand members split into something like two and a half thousand groupings utterly ruthless but also highly intelligent and sophisticated very hierarchical structure almost impenetrable to outsiders like a secret society they even have a sort of middle management level called the sokaiya rebus was writing it all down how do you spell that she told him back in japan they run pachinko parlours thats a sort of gaming thing and have fingers in most other illegal pies unless theyve lopped them off what about outside japan only thing ive got down here is that they ship expensive designer stuff back home to sell on the black market also stolen art ship it back to wealthy buyers wait a minute you told me jake tarawicz started out smuggling icons out of russia youre saying pink eyes might connect to the yakuza tommy telfords been chauffeuring them around theres a warehouse everyone seems interested in plus a country club whats in the warehouse i dont know yet maybe you should find out its on my list something else these pachinko parlours would those be like amusement arcades pretty much another connection with telford he puts gaming machines into half the pubs and clubs on the east coast you think the yakuza saw someone they could do a deal with i dont know he tried stifling a yawn too early in the morning for big questions he smiled something like that thanks for your help miriam no problem keep me posted sure anything new on tarawicz nothing ive heard no sign of candice either sorry thanks again bye curt was standing in the doorway hed stripped off gown and gloves and his hands smelled of soap not much i can do till my assistants get in he looked at his watch fancy a spot of breakfast you have to appreciate how this looks john the media could be all over us i can think of a few journalists whod give their drinking arm to nail you chief superintendent watson was in his element seated behind his desk hands folded he had the serenity of a large stone buddha the occasional crises with which john rebus presented him had hardened the farmer to lifes lesser knocks and taught him calm acceptance youre going to suspend me rebus stated with conviction hed been here before he finished the coffee his boss had given him but kept his hands locked around the mug then youre going to open an investigation not straight away watson surprised him by saying what i want first of all is your statement and i mean a full and frank explanation of your recent movements your interest in mr matsumoto and thomas telford bring in anything you want about your daughters accident any suspicions youve had and above all the validity of those suspicions telford already has a lawyer asking awkward questions about our japanese friends untimely end the lawyer watson looked to gill templer seated by the door mouth a thin unimpressed line charles groal she said flatly groal yes hes been asking at the casino he got a description of a man who came in just after matsumoto and left immediately after him he seems to think its you are you telling him otherwise rebus asked were telling him nothing not until our own inquiries have established et cetera but i cant hold him off forever john have you asked anyone what matsumoto was doing here he works for a firm of management consultants he was here at a clients behest finalising the takeover of a country club with tommy telford in tow john lets not lose sight of matsumoto was a member of the yakuza sir the closest ive come to one of those before has been on a tv screen now suddenly theyre in edinburgh rebus paused dont you find that just a wee bit curious i mean doesnt it worry you at all i dont know maybe im getting my priorities all wring but it seems to me were splashing about in puddles while a tidal waves coming in the pressure of his hands around the mug had been increasing by degrees now the thing broke a piece falling to the floor as rebus winced he picked one ceramic shard out of his palm drops of blood hit the carpet gill templer had come forward was reaching for his hand here let me he spun away from her no way too loud fumbling in his pocket for a handkerchief ive got some paper ones in my bag its all right blood dripping on to his shoes watson was saying something about the mug having a crack templer was staring at him he wrapped white cotton around the wound ill go wash it he said with your permission sir on you go john sure youre all right ill be fine it wasnt a bad cut cold water helped he dried off with paper towels which he flushed down the toilet waiting to see theyd gone a first aid box next half a dozen plasters cover the nick good and proper he bunched his fist saw no sign of leakage had to be content with that back at his desk he started on his memoirs as ordered by watson gill templer came past decided he needed a few soft words none of us thinks you did it john but something like this questions being asked by the japanese consul it has to be done by the book it all comes down to politics in the end eh he was thinking of joseph lintz at lunchtime he dropped in on ned farlowe asked him if he needed anything farlowe wanted sandwiches books newspapers company he looked drawn weary of imprisonment maybe soon hed think to ask for a lawyer a lawyer any lawyer would get him out rebus handed his report to watsons secretary and headed out of the station hed gone fifty yards when a car pulled up alongside range rover prettyboy telling him to get in rebus looked into the back of the car telford ointment on his blistered face looking like a scaleddown jake tarawicz rebus hesitated the cop shop was a short sprint away get in prettyboy repeated sucker for a free offer rebus got in prettyboy turned the car the giant yellow teddy had been strapped into the passenger seat i dont suppose rebus said its worth my while asking you to leave ned farlowe be telfords mind was on other things he wants war hes going to get war who your boss i dont work for cafferty dont give me that im the one who put him inside and youve been snuggling up ever since i didnt kill matsumoto telford looked at him for the first time and rebus could see he was itching for violence you know i didnt rebus went on what do you mean because you did it and you want me to telfords hands were around rebuss neck rebus shrugged them off tried pinning telford down impossible with the car in motion cramped in the back seat prettyboy stopped the car and got out opened rebuss door and dragged him on to the pavement telford followed face beetrootred eyes bulging youre not going to pin this on me he roared drivers slowed to watch pedestrians crossed the road to safety who else rebuss voice was shaky cafferty telford screeched its you and cafferty trying to shut me down im telling you i didnt do it boss prettyboy was saying lets screw the head eh he was looking around nervous of the attention they were attracting telford saw his point let his shoulders relax a little get in the car he said to rebus rebus just stared at him its okay just get in i want to show you a couple of things rebus worlds craziest cop got back in there was silence for a couple of minutes telford rearranging the dressings on his fingers which had come loose during the fight i dont think cafferty wants war rebus said what makes you so sure because ive done a deal with him its me whos going to shut you damn they were heading west rebus tried not to think about possible destinations you were in the army werent you telford asked rebus nodded paratroops then the s a s i didnt get past training rebus thinking hes wellinformed so you decided to become a cop instead telford was completely calm again hed brushed down his suit and checked the knot in his tie thing is working for structures like those army cops you need to obey orders i hear youre not very good at it you wouldnt last long with me he looked out of the window whats cafferty planning no idea why were you watching matsumoto because he tied into you crime squad pulled their surveillance rebus said nothing but you kept yours going telford turned towards him why because you tried to kill my daughter telford stared at him unblinking is that what this is about its why ned farlowe tried to blind you hes her boyfriend telford choked out a disbelieving laugh started to shake his head id nothing to do with your daughter wheres the reason to get at me because she helped me with candice telford was thoughtful okay he said nodding i can see your thinking and i dont suppose my words going to count for much but for what its worth i know absolutely nothing about your daughter he paused rebus could hear sirens nearby is that what took you to cafferty rebus said nothing which seemed to telfords mind to confirm his suspicions he smiled again pull over telford said prettyboy stopped the car the road ahead was blocked anyway police diverting traffic down sidestreets rebus realised hed been smelling smoke for some time the tenements had hidden it from view but now he could see the fire it was in the lot where cafferty kept his taxis the shed used as an office had been reduced to ash the garage behind where the cabs were worked on and cleaned up was about to lose its corrugated roof a row of vehicles was burning nicely we could have sold tickets prettyboy said telford turned from the spectacle to rebus fire brigades going to be stretched two of caffertys offices are spontaneously combusting he checked his watch right about now as is that beautiful house of his dont worry we waited till his wife was out shopping final ultimatums have been delivered to his men they can shuffle out of town or off this mortal coil he shrugged makes no odds to me go tell cafferty hes finished in edinburgh rebus licked his lips youve just said im wrong about you that you had nothing to do with my daughter what if youre wrong about cafferty wake up will you the stabbing at megans then danny simpson caffertys not exactly subtle did danny say it was caffertys men he knows same as i do telford tapped prettyboys shoulder back to base to rebus another little message for you to take to barlinnie heres what i told caffertys men any of them left in this city after midnight are fair game and i dont take prisoners he sniffed seemed pleased with himself settled back in the seat you wont mind if i drop you at flint street only ive a business meeting in fifteen minutes with matsumotos bosses if they want poyntinghame theyll keep dealing with me he looked at rebus you should deal with me too think about this whod want you pissed off with me it comes back to cafferty hitting your daughter setting up matsumoto it all comes back to cafferty think it over then maybe we should talk again after a couple of minutes rebus broke the silence you know a man called joseph lintz bobby hogan mentioned him he phoned your office in flint street telford shrugged ill tell you what i told hogan maybe it was a wrong number whatever it was i didnt speak to any old nazi youre not the only one uses that office though rebus saw prettyboy watching him in the rearview mirror what about you never heard of the cat a car was parked in flint street a huge white limousine with blackened windows there was a tv aerial on the boot and the hubcaps were painted pink christ telford said in amusement look at his latest toy he seemed to have forgotten all about rebus he was out of the car and loping towards the man who was emerging from the back of the limo white suit panama hat big cigar and a bright red paisley shirt none of which stopped you staring at the scarred face and bluetinted glasses telford was commenting on the attire the car the audacity and mr pink eyes was loving it he put a hand around telfords shoulder steering him towards the amusement arcade but then he stopped clicked his fingers turned back to the limo and reached out a hand and now a woman was emerging short black dress and black tights fur jacket keeping out the chills tarawicz rubbed a hand over her backside telford kissed her on the neck she smiled eyes slightly glazed then tarawicz and telford turned towards the range rover they were both staring at rebus trips over inspector prettyboy said telling rebus it was time to get out he did so his eyes on candice but she wasnt looking at him she was snuggling into mr pink eyes head on his chest he was still rubbing her backside the dress rising and falling he was watching rebus eyes alight face pulled into a latex grin rebus walked over to them and now candice saw him and looked frightened inspector tarawicz said good to see you again come to whisk the damsel away to safety rebus ignored him come on candice his hand not quite steady held out towards her she looked at him and shook her head why would i want that she said and was rewarded with another kiss from tarawicz you were abducted you can press charges tarawicz was laughing leading her into the cafe candice rebus reached for her arm but she pulled away and followed her master inside two of telfords men were blocking the door prettyboy was behind rebus no cheap heroics he asked making to pass the policeman back at st leonards rebus took farlowe his food and newspapers then hitched a lift in a patrol car to torphichen the man he wanted was di shug davidson and davidson was in the cid office looking frazzled somebody torched a taxi rank he told rebus any idea who davidsons eyes narrowed the rank was owned by jock scallow is there something youre trying to tell me who really owned the outfit shug you know damned well and whos muscling in on caffertys patch ive heard rumours rebus rested against davidsons desk tommy telfords going into combat unless we can stop him we i want you to take me somewhere rebus said shug davidson was happily married to an understanding wife and had kids who didnt see as much of him as they deserved a year back hed won forty grand on the lottery everyone in his station got a drink the rest of the money had been salted away rebus had worked with him before he wasnt a bad cop maybe lacking a little in imagination they had to work their way around the scene of the fire a further mile and a half on rebus told him to stop what is it davidson asked thats what i want you to tell me rebus was looking towards the brick building the same one which so interested tommy telford its macleans davidson said and whats macleans when its at home davidson smiled you really dont know he opened his car door come on ill show you they had to have their identities checked at the main entrance rebus noticed a lot of security albeit subtle cameras trained down from the corners of the building catching every angle of approach a phone call was made and a man in a white coat came down to sign them in they pinned visitors badges to their jackets and the tour began ive been here before davidson confided if you ask me its the best kept secret in the city they climbed steps walked down passageways everywhere there was security guards checked their badges doors had to be unlocked cameras charted their progress which puzzled rebus for it was such an unassuming building really and nothing spectacular was happening what is it fort knox he asked but then their guide handed them white coats to put on before pushing open the door to a laboratory and rebus started to understand people were working with chemicals examining testtubes writing notes there were all sorts of weird and wonderful machines but in essence it was a school chemistrylab on a slightly grander scale welcome davidson said to the worlds biggest drugs factory which wasnt quite correct for macleans was only the worlds largest legal producer of heroin and cocaine something the guide explained were licensed by the government back in there was an international agreement every country in the world was allowed just one producer and were it for britain so what do you make rebus was staring at the rows of locked fridges all sorts of things methadone for heroin addicts pethedine for women in labour diamorphine to ease terminal illnesses and cocaine for use in medical procedures the company started out supplying laudanum to the victorians and these days we produce about seventy tonnes of opiates a year the guide said and around two million pounds worth of pure cocaine rebus rubbed his forehead i begin to see the need for security the guide smiled the mod has asked us for advice thats how good our security is no breakins a couple of attempts nothing we couldnt deal with no rebus thought but then youve never had to deal with tommy telford and the yakuza not yet rebus walked around the lab smiled and nodded at a woman who just seemed to be standing there not doing anything whos she he asked the guide our nurse shes on standby what for the guide nodded towards where a man was operating one of the machines etorphine he said forty thousand pounds a kilo and extremely potent the nurse has the antidote just in case so whats it used for this etorphine knocking out rhinos the guide said like the answer should have been obvious the cocaine was produced from coca leaves flown in from peru the opium came from plantations in tasmania and australia the pure heroin and cocaine were kept in a strongroom each lab had its share of locked safes the storage warehouse boasted infrared detectors and movement sensors five minutes in the place told rebus exactly why tommy telford was interested in macleans and hed brought the yakuza in on the plan either because he needed their help which was unlikely or to brag about the exploit back at the car davidson asked the obvious question whats this all about john rebus pinched the bridge of his nose i think telfords planning to hit this place davidson snorted hed never get in like you said yourself its fort bloody knox its a prestige thing shug if he can empty the place itll make his name hell have beaten cafferty hands down it was the same with the firebombings they werent just a message to cafferty but a sort of red carpet for mr pink eyes welcome to edinburgh and look what i can do im telling you davidson said theres no way in christ thats cheap davidsons attention had been diverted by signs on the window of the corner shop rebus looked too cutprice cigarettes cheap sandwiches and hot rolls plus five pence off any morning paper competition around here must be crippling davidson said fancy a roll rebus was watching workers leaving the gates of macleans afternoon break maybe saw them cross the road dodging traffic counting small change from their pockets as they pushed open the door to the shop yes rebus said quietly why not the small shop was packed out davidson got in the queue while rebus looked at the rack of papers and magazines the workers were sharing jokes and gossip two staff worked behind the counter young males mixing banter with lessthanefficient service what do you fancy john bacon fine rebus said remembered he hadnt had lunch make it two two bacon rolls came in at one pound exactly they sat in the car to eat you know shug the usual ploy with a shop like that is to take a beating on one or two necessities to get the punters in davidson nodded attacked his roll but that place looked like bargain city rebus had stopped eating do us both a favour find out the shops history who owns it who those two are behind the counter davidsons chewing slowed you think just check it out all right back at st leonards his telephone was ringing he sat down and prised the lid from a beaker of coffee on the drive back hed been thinking about candice two swigs of coffee and he lifted the receiver di rebus he said what the fuck is that little shite up to the voice of big ger cafferty where are you where do you think i am sounds like a mobile amazing the things that find their way into barlinnie now tell me what is happening over there youve heard then he torched my house my house am i supposed to let him get away with that look i think i may have found a way to get to him cafferty calmed a little tell me not yet i want to and all my taxis cafferty exploded again the little bastard look the point is whats he expecting you to do hes waiting for instant retaliation and hes going to get it hell be ready wouldnt it be better to catch him offguard that little bastard hasnt been offguard since he was lifted from the cradle shall i tell you why he did it caffertys anger ebbed again why because he says you killed matsumoto who a business acquaintance whoever did it made it look like i was behind the wheel it wasnt me try telling telford that he thinks you ordered me to do it we know differently thats right we know someone was setting me up trying to get me out of the way what was his name again the dead one matsumoto is that japanese rebus wished he could see caffertys eyes even then it was hard to tell when the man was playing games he was japanese rebus stated what the hell did he have to do with telford sounds to me like your intelligence has gone to pot there was silence on the line about your daughter rebus froze what about her a secondhand shop in porty meaning portobello the owner bought some stuff from a seller including opera tapes and roy orbison stuck in his mind they dont naturally go together rebuss hand tightened on the receiver which shop what did the seller look like cold laughter were working on it strawman just leave everything to us now about this japanese fellow i said id put telford out of the game that was the agreement ive yet to see any action im working on it i want to hear about him anyway rebus paused how is samantha anyway cafferty asked thats her name isnt it shes because it looks like ill be fulfilling my side of our bargain any day while you on the other hand matsumoto was yakuza heard of them a moments silence ive heard of them telfords helping them buy a country club what in gods name do they want with that im not sure cafferty was silent again rebus almost thought his mobile had died then hes got big ideas hasnt he like there was just a touch of respect there battling the sense of territorial breach weve both seen people overreach themselves an idea formed in rebuss mind a sudden notion of where everything was headed looks like telfords got plenty of stretch left in him though cafferty was saying and me im not even halfway through my stretch know something cafferty every time you start to sound beaten thats when i know youre just coming to the boil you know im going to have to retaliate whether i want to or not a little ritual we have to go through like shaking hands how many men have you got more than enough listen one last thing rebus couldnt believe he was telling his archenemy this jake tarawicz arrived here today i think the fireworks were meant to impress him telford torched my house just so hed have something to show that ugly russian bastard like a kid showing off to his elders rebus was thinking overreaching himself thats it strawman cafferty was back to being furious all bets are off those two want to get dirty with morris gerald cafferty ill give them both anthrax ill infect the pair of them theyll think theyve caught fullblown fucking aids by the time im finished which was about as much as rebus could take he put down the phone drank his cold coffee checked his messages patience wondered if he could make it to supper rhona said theyd carried out another scan bobby hogan wanted a word he called the hospital first rhona said something about a new scan to assess the amount of damage done to the brain then why the hell didnt they give her that scan straight away i dont know did you ask why dont you come down here why dont you ask seems like when im not here youre happy enough spending time with samantha even sleeping in the chair what is it do i scare you off look rhona im sorry its been a rough day for you and everyone else i know im a selfish bastard the rest of their conversation was predictable it was a relief to say goodbye he tried patience got her answering machine and told it hed be happy to accept the invitation then he called bobby hogan hiya bobby whatve you got not much i had a word with telford i know he told me youve been speaking to him says he never knew lintz did you talk to the family the ones who frequent the office same story did you mention the five thou think im stupid listen i thought you might be able to help me fire away lintzs address book i found a couple of addresses for a dr colquhoun thought at first it must be his gp hes a slavic studies lecturer only lintz seems to have been keeping track of him three changes of address going back twenty years first two addresses have phone numbers with them but not the most recent i checked and colquhouns only been at this latest address three years so so lintz didnt have his home phone number so if he wanted to speak to him rebus twigged hed phone the university the call on lintzs bill twentyodd minutes rebus was remembering what colquhoun had said about lintz i met him at a few social functions our departments werent that close as i say me werent close they werent in the same department rebus said colquhoun told me theyd barely met so how come lintz has been keeping up with colquhouns various moves around the city beats me bobby have you asked him no but i intend to hes lying low ive been trying to talk to him for a week last seen at the morvena did colquhoun link telford to lintz well hes back now what ive an appointment with him at his office count me in rebus said getting to his feet as rebus parked in buccleuch place he was in an unmarked astra courtesy of st leonards he saw the car in the neighbouring bay make to leave he waved but kirstin mede didnt see him and by the time hed found the horn shed pulled away he wondered how well she knew colquhoun after all shed been the one to suggest him as a translator hogan standing by the railings had seen rebuss attempts at communication someone you know kirstin mede hogan placed the name the one who did those translations rebus looked up at the slavic studies building have you tracked down david levy daughter still hasnt heard from him how long has that been long enough to seem suspicious in itself only she doesnt seem too bothered how do you want to play this rebus asked depends what hes like you ask your questions me i just want to be there hogan looked at him then shrugged and pushed open the door they started to climb the worn stone steps hope they havent put him in the penthouse colquhouns name was on a piece of card stuck to a door on the second floor they pushed it open and were confronted with a short hallway and another five or six doors colquhouns office was first on the right and he was already standing in the doorway thought i heard you sound carries in this place come in come in he wasnt expecting hogan to have company his words dried up when he saw rebus he walked back into his office motioned for both officers to sit then fussed about moving their chairs around so theyd be facing his desk terrible muddle he said kicking over a pile of books know the feeling sir hogan said colquhoun peered in rebuss direction my secretary says you used the library filling in some of the gaps sir rebus kept his voice level yes candice colquhoun was thoughtful is she i mean did she but today sir hogan interrupted we want to talk to you about joseph lintz colquhoun sat down heavily in his wooden chair which creaked under the weight then he sprang to his feet again tea coffee you must excuse the mess not normally this disorganised not for us sir hogan said if youd just take a seat of course of course again colquhoun collapsed on to his chair joseph lintz sir hogan prompted terrible tragedy terrible they think its murder you know yes sir we do know of course you do apologies the desk in front of colquhoun was venerable and spotted with woodworm the shelves were bowed under the weight of textbooks there were old framed prints on the walls and a blackboard with the single word character on it university paperwork was piled on the window ledge all but blacking out the bottom two panes the smell in the room was that of intellect gone awry its just that mr lintz had your name in his address book sir hogan continued and were talking to all his friends friends colquhoun looked up i wouldnt call us friends exactly we were colleagues but i dont think i met him socially more than three or four times in twentyodd years funny he seems to have taken an interest in you sir hogan flipped open his notebook starting with your address in warrender park terrace i havent lived there since the seventies he also has your telephone number there after that its currie i thought i was ready for the rural life in currie hogan sounded sceptical colquhoun tipped his head i eventually realised my mistake and moved to duddingston not at first i rented a few properties while i was looking for a place to buy mr lintz has your telephone number in currie but not for the duddingston address interesting i went exdirectory when i moved any reason for that sir colquhoun swayed in his chair well im sure it sounds awful try us i didnt want students bothering me did they do that oh yes phoning to ask questions advice worried about exams or wanting deadlines extended do you remember giving mr lintz your address sir no i dont youre sure of that yes but it wouldnt have been hard for him to find out i mean he could just have asked one of the secretaries colquhoun was beginning to look more agitated than ever the little chair could barely contain him sir hogan said is there anything you want to tell us about mr lintz anything at all colquhoun just shook his head staring at the surface of his desk rebus decided to use their joker mr lintz made a phone call to this office he was talking for over twenty minutes thats simply not true colquhoun mopped his face with a handkerchief look gentlemen id like to help but the fact is i barely knew joseph lintz and he didnt phone you no and youve no idea why hed keep note of your edinburgh addresses for the past three decades no hogan sighed theatrically then were wasting your time and ours he got to his feet thank you dr colquhoun the look of relief on the old academics face told both detectives all they needed to know they said nothing as they walked back downstairs like colquhoun had said sound could travel hogans car was nearest they rested against it as they talked he was worried rebus said hiding something think we should go back up rebus shook his head let him sweat for a day or so then hit him he didnt like the fact you were there i noticed that restaurant lintz dining with an elderly gent we could tell him weve got a description from the restaurant staff without going into specifics rebus nodded see if it flushes him out what about the other person lintz took to lunch the young woman no idea posh restaurant old man young woman a call girl hogan smiled do they still call them that rebus was thoughtful it might explain the phone call to telford only i doubt telfords daft enough to discuss business like that from his office besides his escort agency runs from another address fact is he called telfords office and nobodys owned up to talking to him escort agency stuff could be very innocent he doesnt want to eat alone hires some company afterwards a peck on the cheek and separate taxis hogan exhaled this ones running in circles i know the feeling bobby they looked up at the secondfloor windows saw colquhoun staring down handkerchief to his face lets leave him to it hogan said unlocking his car ive been meaning to ask how did you get on with abernethy he didnt give me too much trouble hogan avoided rebuss eyes so hes gone hogan had disappeared into the drivers seat hes gone see you john leaving rebus on the pavement a frown on his face he waited till hogans car had turned the corner then went back into the stairwell and climbed the steps again colquhouns office door was open the old man fidgeting behind his desk rebus sat down opposite him said nothing ive been ill colquhoun said youve been hiding colquhoun started shaking his head you told them where to find candice head still shaking then you got worried so they hid you away maybe in a room at the casino rebus paused how am i doing ive no comment to make colquhoun snapped what if i just keep talking then i want you to leave now if you dont go ill have to call my lawyer name of charles groal rebus smiled they might have spent the last few days tutoring you but they cant change what youve done rebus stood up you sent candice back to them you did that he leaned down over the desk you knew all along who she was didnt you thats why you were so nervous how come you knew who she was dr colquhoun how come youre so chummy with a turd like tommy telford colquhoun picked up the receiver his hands shaking so badly he kept missing the digits dont bother rebus said im going but well talk again and you mill talk youll talk because youre a coward dr colquhoun and cowards always talk eventually the crime squad office at fettes home of country and western claverhouse terminating a phone call no sign of ormiston and clarke theyre out on a call claverhouse said any progress on that stabbing what do you think i think theres something you should know rebus seated himself behind siobhan clarkes desk admiring its tidy surface he opened a drawer it was tidy too compartments he thought to himself clarke was very good at dividing her life into separate compartments jake tarawicz is in town hes got this outrageous white limo hard to miss rebus paused and hes brought candice with him whats he doing here i think hes here for the show what show cafferty and telford fifteen rounds of bareknuckle and no referee rebus leaned forward arms on the desk and ive got an idea where its headed rebus went home called patience and told her he might be late how late she asked how late can i be without us falling out she thought about it halfnine ill be there he checked his answering machine david levy saying he could be reached at home where the hell have you been rebus asked when levys daughter had put her father on i had business elsewhere you know your daughters been worried you might have phoned her does this counselling service come free my fee cancels out when you answer a few questions you know lintz is dead ive heard where were you when you heard ive told you i had business inspector am i a suspect practically the only one weve got levy gave a harsh laugh this is preposterous im not a he couldnt say the word rebus guessed his daughter was within hearing distance hold on a moment please the receiver was muffled levy ordering his daughter out of the room he came back on voice lower than before inspector for the record i feel i must let you know how angry i felt when i heard the news justice may have been done or not done i cant argue those points just now but what is absolutely certain is that history has been cheated here of the trial of course and the rat line too with each suspect who dies were that much less likely to prove its existence lintz isnt the first you know one man the brakes failed on his car another fell from an upstairs window thereve been two apparent suicides six more cases of what look like natural causes am i going to get the full conspiracy theory this isnt a joke inspector did you hear me laughing what about you mr levy when did you leave edinburgh before lintz died did you see him rebus knowing he had but seeking a lie levy paused confronted would be a more apposite term just the once three times he wasnt keen to talk about himself but i stated my case nonetheless and the phone call levy paused what phone call when he called you at the roxburghe i wish id recorded it for posterity rage inspector foulmouthed rage im positive he was mad mad you didnt hear him hes very good at seeming perfectly normal he must be or he wouldnt have gone undetected for so long but the man is was mad truly mad rebus was remembering the crooked little man in the cemetery and how hed suddenly let fly at a passing dog poise to rage to poise again the story he told levy sighed was this in the restaurant what restaurant sorry i thought the two of you went out to lunch i can assure you we didnt so what story is this then these men inspector they come to justify their actions by blanking them out or by transference transference is the more common they tell themselves someone else did it yes and that was lintzs story less believable than most he said it was all a case of mistaken identity and who did he think you were mistaking him for a colleague at the university a dr colquhoun rebus called hogan gave him the story i told levy youd want to speak to him ill phone him right now what do you think colquhoun a war criminal hogan snorted me too rebus said i asked levy why he didnt think any of this worth telling us and he said as he gave it no credence it was worthless all the same wed better talk to colquhoun again tonight ive other plans for tonight bobby fair enough john look i really appreciate all your help youre going to talk to him alone ill have someone with me rebus hated being left out if he cancelled that late supper let me know how you get on rebus put the telephone down on the hifi eddie harris upbeat and melodic he went and soaked in a bath facecloth across his eyes everyone it seemed to him lived their lives out of little boxes opening different ones for different occasions nobody ever gave their whole self away cops were like that each box a safety mechanism most people you met in the course of your life you never even learned their names everybody was boxed off from everybody else it was called society he was wondering about joseph lintz always questioning turning every conversation into a philosophy lesson stuck in his own little box identity blocked off elsewhere his past a necessary mystery joseph lintz furious when cornered possibly clinically mad driven there by what memories or the lack of them driven there by other people the eddie harris cd was on its last track by the time he emerged from the bathroom he put on the clothes hed be wearing to patiences only he had a couple of stops to make first check on sammy at the hospital and then a meeting at torphichen the gangs all here he said walking into the cid room shug davidson claverhouse ormiston and siobhan clarke all seated around the one big desk drinking coffee from identical rangers mugs rebus pulled a chair over have you filled them in shug davidson nodded what about the shop i was just getting to that davidson picked up a pen played with it the last owner went out of business not enough passing trade the shop was shut the best part of a year then suddenly reopened under new management and with prices that stopped the locals looking elsewhere and got the workers at macleans interested too rebus added so how longs it been going five weeks selling cutprice everything no profit motive you see rebus looked around the table this was mostly for the benefit of ormiston and clarke hed given claverhouse the story already and the owners clarke asked well the shops run by a couple of lads called declan delaney and ken wilkinson guess where they come from paisley claverhouse said keen to hurry things on so theyre part of telfords gang ormiston asked not in so many words but theyre connected to him no doubt about that davidson blew his nose loudly of course dec and ken are running the shop but they dont own it telford does rebus stated okay claverhouse said so weve got telford owning a lossmaking business in the hope of gathering intelligence i think it goes further than that rebus said i mean listening in on gossip is one thing but i dont suppose any of the workers are standing around talking about the various security systems and how to beat them dec and ken are garrulous perfect for the job telfords given them but its going to look suspicious if they start asking too many questions so whats telford looking for ormiston asked siobhan clarke turned to him a mole she said makes sense davidson went on that place is wellprotected but not impregnable we all know any breakins going to be a lot easier with someone on the inside so what do we do clarke asked we fight telfords sting with our own rebus explained he wants a man on the inside me give him one im seeing the head of macleans later on tonight davidson said ill come with you claverhouse said keen not to be left out so we put someone of our own inside the factory clarke was working it out for herself and they shoot their mouth off in the shop making them an attractive proposition and we sit and pray that telford approaches them rather than anyone else the less luck we have to rely on the better claverhouse said got to do this right which is why we work it like this rebus said theres a bookie called marty jones he owes me one big favour say our mans just been into telfords shop as hes coming out a car pulls up marty and a couple of his men marty wants some bets paid off big argybargy and a punch in the guts as warning clarke could see it he stumbles back into the shop sits down to catch his breath dec and ken ask him whats going on and he gives them the whole sorry story gambling debts broken marriage whatever to make him more attractive still davidson said we make him a security guard ormiston looked at him you think macleans will go for it well persuade them claverhouse said quietly more importantly clarke asked will telford go for it depends how desperate he is rebus answered a man on the inside ormistons eyes were alight working for telford its what weve always wanted claverhouse nodded just one thing he looked at rebus and davidson whos it going to be telford knows us we get someone from outside rebus said someone ive worked with before telford wont have heard of him hes a good man is he willing there was silence around the table depends whos asking a voice called from the doorway a stocky man with thick wellgroomed hair and narrow eyes rebus got up shook jack mortons hand made the introductions ill need a history morton said all business johns explained the deal and i like it but ill need a flat something scruffy and local first thing tomorrow claverhouse said look we need to talk to our bosses about this make sure its cleared he looked at morton what did you tell your own boss jack ive got a few days off didnt think it was worth mentioning claverhouse nodded ill talk to him as soon as we get the goahead we need that goahead tonight rebus said telfords men may already have lined someone up if we hang around we might lose it agreed claverhouse said checking his watch ill make a few phone calls interrupt a few postprandial whiskies ill back you up if need be davidson said rebus looked at jack morton his friend and mouthed the word thanks morton shrugged it off then rebus got to his feet im going to have to leave you to it he told the assembly youve got my pager number and mobile if you need me he was halfway down the hall when siobhan clarke caught him i just wanted to say thanks rebus blinked what for ever since you got claverhouse excited the tape machines stayed off supper was fine he talked to patience about sammy rhona his obsession with sixties music his ignorance of fashion she talked about work an experimental cookery class shed been taking a trip to orkney she was thinking of they ate fresh pasta with a homemade mussel and prawn sauce and shared a bottle of highland spring rebus tried his damnedest to forget about the sting operation tarawicz candice lintz she could see at least half his mind was elsewhere tried not to feel betrayed she asked him if he was going home is that an invitation im not sure i suppose so lets pretend it wasnt then i wont feel like complete scum when i turn it down that sounds reasonable things on your mind im surprised you cant see them leaking out of my ears do you want to talk about any of it i mean you may not have noticed but weve talked about practically everything tonight except us i dont think talking would help but bottling it up does she threw out an arm behold the scottish male at his happiest when in denial what am i denying for a start youre denying me access to your life sorry christ john get the word put on a tshirt thanks maybe i will he got up from the sofa oh hell im sorry she smiled look youve got me at it now yes its catching all right she stood up touched his arm youre worried about taking the test right now believe it or not thats the least of my worries it should be everythings going to be fine hunky dory hunky dory she repeated smiling again she pecked him on the cheek you know ive never quite understood what that meant hunky dory she nodded its a david bowie album he kissed her brow he would never know what instinct made him decide on the detour but he was glad hed made it for there parked outside the morvena casino stood the white stretch limo the driver leaned against it smoking a cigarette looking bored from time to time he took out a mobile phone and had a short conversation rebus stared at the morvena thinking tommy telford has a slice of the place the hostesses come from eastern europe provided by mr pink eyes rebus wondered how closely entwined the two empires telfords and tarawiczs really were and add a third strand the yakuza something refused to add up what was tarawicz getting out of it miriam kenworthy had suggested muscle scottish hardmen trained in telfords organisation then shipped south but it wasnt enough of a trade there had to be more was mr pink eyes due a share of the macleans payout was telford tempting him with some yakuza action what about the theory that telford was tarawiczs supplier at quarter to midnight another phone call had the driver springing into action he flicked his cigarette on to the road started opening doors tarawicz and his entourage breezed out of the casino looking like they owned the world candice was wearing a black full length coat over a shimmering pink dress which didnt quite reach her knees she was carrying a bottle of champagne rebus counted three of tarawiczs men remembering them from the scrapyard two noshows the lawyer and the crab telford was there too with a couple of minders one of them prettyboy prettyboy was making sure his jacket hung right trying to decide whether it would look better buttoned but his eyes raked the darkened street rebus had parked away from the streetlights confident he was invisible they were piling into the limo rebus watched it move off waited until it had signalled and turned a corner before switching on his own headlamps and starting the engine they drove to the same hotel matsumoto had stayed at telfords range rover was parked outside pedestrians late night couples hurrying home from the pub turned to stare at the limo saw the entourage spill out probably mistook them for pop stars or film people rebus as casting director candices startlet being mauled by sleazy producer tarawicz telford a sleek young operator on his way up looking to learn from the producer before toppling him the others were bit players except maybe prettyboy who was hanging on to his bosss coattails maybe readying himself for his own big break if tarawicz had a suite there might be room for them all if not theyd be in the bar rebus parked followed them inside the lights hurt his eyes the reception area was all mirrors and pine brass and potplants he tried to look like hed been left behind by the party they were settling down in the bar through a double set of swingdoors with glass panels rebus hung back sitting target in the empty reception bigger target in the bar retreat to the car someone was standing up shrugging off along black coat candice smiling now saying something to tarawicz who was nodding took her hand and planted a kiss in the palm went further a slow lick across the palm and up her wrist everyone laughing whistling candice looking numb tarawicz got to the inside of her elbow and took a bite she squealed pulled back rubbed her arm tarawicz had his tongue out playing to the gallery give tommy telford credit he wasnt grinning along with everyone else candice stood there a stooge to her owners little act then he waved her off with a flick of his hand permission granted she started for the doors rebus moved back into a recess where the public telephones sat she turned right out of the doors disappeared into the ladies at the table they were busy ordering more champagne and an orange juice for prettyboy rebus looked around took a deep breath walked into the ladies toilets like it was the most natural thing in the world she was splashing her face with water a little brown bottle sat next to the sink three yellow tablets lying ready rebus swept them on to the floor hey she turned saw him put a hand to her mouth she tried backing away but there was nowhere to go is this what you want dunya using her real name as a weapon friendly fire she frowned shook her head incomprehension on her face he grabbed her shoulders squeezed sammy he hissed sammys in hospital very ill he pointed towards the hotel bar they tried to kill her the gist got through candice shook her head tears were smudging her mascara did you tell sammy anything she frowned again anything about telford or tarawicz did you talk to sammy about them a slow determined shake of the head sammy hospital he nodded turned his hands into a steeringwheel made engine noises then slammed a fist into his open palm candice turned away grabbed the sink she was crying shoulders jerking she scrabbled for more tablets rebus tore them from her hand you want to blank it all out forget it he threw them on to the floor crushed them under his heel she crouched down licked a finger and dabbed at the powder rebus hauled her to her feet her knees wouldnt lock he had to keep holding her upright she wouldnt look him in the eyes its funny we first met in a toilet remember you were scared you hated your life so much youd slashed your arms he touched her scarred wrists thats how much you hated your life and now youre straight back in it her face was against his jacket tears dropping on to his shirt remember the japanese he cooed remember juniper green the golf club she drew back wiped her nose on her bare wrist juniper green she said thats right and a big factory the car stopped and everyone looked at the factory she was nodding did anyone talk about it did they say anything she was shaking her head john her hands on his lapels she sniffed swiped at her nose again she slid down his jacket his shirt she was on her knees looking up at him blinking tears while her damp fingers scored white powder from the tiles rebus crouched down in front of her come with me he said ill help you he pointed towards the door towards the world outside but she was busy in her own world now fingers going to her mouth someone pushed open the door rebus looked up a woman young drunk hair falling into her eyes she stopped and studied the two people on the floor then smiled and headed for a cubicle save some for me she said sliding the lock go john there was powder at the corners of candices mouth a tiny piece of tablet had lodged between her front two teeth please go now i dont want you getting hurt he sought her hands squeezed them i do not hurt any more she got to her feet and turned from him checked her face in the mirror wiped away the powder and dabbed at her mascara blew her nose and took a deep breath walked out of the toilets rebus waited a moment time enough for her to reach the table then he opened the door and made his exit walked back to his car on legs that seemed to belong to someone else drove home not quite crying but not quite not four in the morning the blessed telephone pulled him out of a nightmare prisoncamp prostitutes with teeth filed to points were kneeling in front of him jake tarawicz in full ss regalia held him from behind telling him resistance was useless through the barred window rebus could see black berets the maquis busy freeing the camp but leaving his billet till last alarm bells ringing everything telling him that salvation was at hand alarm becoming his telephone he staggered from his chair picked it up yes john the chief supers voice aberdonian instantly recognisable yes sir weve got a spot of bother get down here what kind of bother ill tell you when you get here now shift night shift to be precise the city asleep st leonards was lit up the tenements around it dark no sign of the farmers spot of bother the chief supers office the farmer in conference with gill tempter sit down john coffee no thanks sir while tempter and the chief super were deciding who should speak rebus helped them out tommy telfords businesses have been hit tempter blinked telepathy caffertys offices and taxis got firebombed so did his house rebus shrugged we knew thered be payback did we what could he say i did because cafferty told me he didnt think theyd like that i just put two and two together the farmer poured himself a mug of coffee so now weve got open war what got hit the arcade on flint street templer said not too much damage the place has a sprinkler system she smiled an amusement arcade with a sprinkler system not that telford was careful or anything plus a couple of nightclubs the farmer added and a casino which one the chief super looked to tempter who answered the morvena any injuries the manager and a couple of friends concussion and bruising which they got falling over each other as they ran down the stairs rebus nodded funny how some people have trouble with stairs he sat back so what does all this have to do with me dont tell me having disposed of telfords japanese partner i decided to take up fireraising john the farmer got up rested his backside against the desk the three of us we know you had nothing to do with that tell me we found an untouched halfbottle of malt under your drivers seat rebus nodded its mine another of his little suicide bombs so why would you be drinking a supermarket blend is that what the screwtop was the cheap bastards no alcohol in your blood either meantime as you say caffertys in the frame for this and cafferty and you you want me to talk to him gill tempter leaned forward in her chair we dont want war takes two to make a ceasefire ill talk to telford she said hes a sharp little bugger watch out for him she nodded will you talk to cafferty rebus didnt want a war it would take telfords mind off the macleans heist hed need all the troops he could get the shop might even have to close no rebus didnt want a war ill talk to him he said breakfasttime at barlinnie rebus jangling after the drive knowing a whisky would smooth out his nerveendings cafferty waiting for him same room as before top of the morning strawman arms folded looking pleased with himself youve had a busy night on the contrary i slept as well as i ever have done in this place what about you i was up at four oclock checking damage reports i could have done without driving all the way here maybe if you gave me the number of your mobile cafferty grinned i hear the nightclubs were gutted i think your boys are making themselves look good caffertys grin tightened telfords premises seem to have state of the art fire prevention smoke sensors sprinklers firedoors the damage was minimal this is just the start cafferty said ill have that little arsewipe i thought that was supposed to be my job ive seen precious little from you strawman ive got something in the pipeline if it comes off youll like it caffertys eyes narrowed give me details make me believe you but rebus was shaking his head sometimes you just have to have faith he paused deal i must have missed something rebus spelled it out back off leave telford to me weve been through this he hits me and i do nothing i look like something youd step around on the pavement were talking to him warning him off and meantime im supposed to trust you to get the job done we shook hands on it cafferty snorted ive shaken hands with a lot of bastards and now youve met an exception to the rule youre an exception to a lot of rules strawman cafferty looked thoughtful the casino the clubs the arcade they werent badly hit my guess is the sprinklers will have done as much damage as anything caffertys jaw hardened makes me look even more of a mug rebus sat in silence waiting for him to finish whatever chessgame was being played inside his head okay the gangster said at last ill call off the troops maybe its time to do some recruiting anyway he looked up at rebus time for some fresh blood which reminded rebus of another job hed been putting off danny simpson lived at home with his mother in a terraced house in wester hailes this bleak housingscheme designed by sadists whod never had to live anywhere near it had a heart which had shrivelled but refused to stop pumping rebus had a lot of respect for the place tommy smith had grown up here practising with socks stuffed into the mouth of his sax so as not to disturb the neighbours through the thin walls of the highrise tommy smith was one of the best sax players rebus had ever heard in a sense wester hailes existed outside the real world it wasnt on a route from anywhere to anywhere rebus had never had cause to drive through it he only went there if he had business there the city bypass flew past it offering many drivers their only encounter with wester hailes they saw highrise blocks terraces tracts of unused playing field they didnt see people not so much concrete jungle as concrete vacuum rebus knocked on danny simpsons door he didnt know what he was going to say to the young man he just wanted to see him again he wanted to see him without the blood and the pain wanted to see him whole and of a piece wanted to see him but danny simpson wasnt in and neither was his mother a neighbour lacking her top set of dentures came out and explained the situation the situation took rebus to the infirmary where in a small gloomy ward not easily found danny simpson lay in bed head bandaged sweating like hed just played a full ninety minutes he wasnt conscious his mother sat beside him stroking his wrist a nurse explained to rebus that a hospice would be the best place for danny supposing they could find him a bed what happened we think infection must have set in when you lose your resistance the worlds a lethal place she shrugged looked like shed been through it all once too often dannys mother had seen them talking maybe she thought rebus was a doctor she got up and came towards him then just stood there waiting for him to speak i came to see danny he said yes the night he the night of his accident i was the one who brought him here i just wondered how he was doing see for yourself her voice was breaking rebus thought a fiveminute walk from here hed be in sammys room hed thought her situation unique because it was unique to him now he saw that within a short radius of sammys bed other parents were crying and squeezing their childrens hands and asking why im really sorry he said i wish me too the woman said you know hes never been a bad laddie cheeky but never bad his problem was he was always itching for something new something to stop him getting bored we all know where that can lead rebus nodded suddenly not wanting to be here not wanting to hear danny simpsons life story he had enough ghosts to contend with as it was he squeezed the womans arm look he said im sorry but i have to go she nodded distractedly wandered off in the direction of her sons bed rebus wanted to curse danny simpson for the mere possibility that hed passed on the virus he realised now that if theyd met on the doorstep thats the way their conversation would have gone and maybe rebus would have gone further he wanted to curse him but he couldnt it would be every bit as efficacious as cursing the big man a waste of time and breath so instead he went to sammys room to find that she was back on her own no other patients no nursing staff no rhona he kissed her forehead it tasted salty sweat she needed wiping down there was a smell he hadnt noticed before talcum powder he sat down took her warm hands in his how are you doing sammy i keep meaning to bring in some oasis see if that would bring you round your mum sits here listening to classical i wonder if you can hear it i dont even know if

the button beside her bed waited for a nurse to come pushed it again come on come on eyelids fluttering then stopping sammy door opening nurse coming in what is it rebus i thought i saw she was moving

anyway eyes boring into the doctors shes asleep she has dreams sometimes when you dream you experience rem rapid eye movement so it could be rebus sought the word involuntary as i say its hard to tell latest scans show definite improvement he paused minor improvement but certainly there rebus nodding trembling the doctor saw it asked if he needed anything rebus shaking his head the doctor checking his watch other places to be the nurse shuffling her feet rebus thanked them both and headed out hogan you agree to this interview being taped dr colquhoun colquhoun ive no objections hogan its in your interests as well as ours colquhoun ive nothing to hide inspector hogan coughs hogan fine sir maybe well just start then colquhoun might i ask a question just for the record you want to ask me about joseph lintz nothing else hogan what else might there be sir colquhoun i just wanted to check hogan you wish to have a solicitor present colquhoun no hogan right you are sir well if i can begin its really just a question of your relationship with professor joseph lintz colquhoun yes hogan only when we spoke before you said you didnt know professor lintz colquhoun i think i said i didnt know him very well hogan okay sir if thats what you said colquhoun it is to the best of my recollection hogan only weve had some new information colquhoun yes hogan that you knew professor lintz a little better than that colquhoun and this is according to hogan new information in our possession the informant tells us that joseph lintz accused you of being a war criminal anything to say to that sir colquhoun only that its a lie an outrageous lie hogan he didnt think you were a war criminal colquhoun oh he thought it all right he told me to my face on more than one occasion hogan when colquhoun years back he got it into his head the man was mad inspector i could see that driven by demons hogan what did he say exactly colquhoun hard to remember this was a long time ago the early s i suppose hogan it would help us if you could colquhoun he came out with it in the middle of a party i believe it was some function to welcome a visiting professor anyway joseph insisted on taking me to one side he looked feverish then he came out with it i was some sort of nazi and id come to this country by some circuitous route he kept on about it hogan what did you do colquhoun told him he was drunk babbling hogan and colquhoun and he was had to be taken home in a taxi i said no more about it in academic circles one becomes used to a certain amount of eccentric behaviour were obsessive people it cant be helped hogan but lintz persisted colquhoun not really no but every few years thered hed say something allege some atrocity hogan did he approach you outside the university colquhoun for a time he telephoned my home hogan you moved colquhoun yes hogan to an unlisted phone number colquhoun eventually hogan to stop him calling you colquhoun i suppose that was part of it hogan did you speak to anyone about lintz colquhoun you mean the authorities no no one he was a nuisance nothing more hogan and then what happened colquhoun then these stories started appearing in the papers saying joseph might be a nazi a war criminal and suddenly he was on my back again hogan he phoned you at your office colquhoun yes hogan you lied to us about that colquhoun im sorry i panicked hogan what was there to panic about colquhoun just i dont know hogan so you met him to straighten things out colquhoun we had lunch together he seemed lucid only what he was saying it was the stuff of madness he had a whole history mapped out only it wasnt mine i kept saying to him joseph when the war ended i wasnt out of my teens besides i was born and raised here its all on record hogan what did he say to that colquhoun he said records could be faked hogan faked records one way josef linzstek could have gone undetected colquhoun i know hogan you think joseph lintz was josef linzstek colquhoun i dont know maybe the stories got to him he started to believe i dont know hogan yes but these accusations they began before the media circus decades before colquhoun thats true hogan so he was hounding you did he say he would go to the media with his version of events colquhoun he may have i cant remember hogan mmm colquhoun youre looking for a motive arent you youre looking for reasons why id want him dead hogan did you kill him dr colquhoun colquhoun emphatically not hogan any idea who did colquhoun no hogan why didnt you tell us why tell lies colquhoun because i knew this would happen these suspicions stupidly i thought i could circumvent them hogan circumvent colquhoun yes hogan a young woman was seen dining with lintz same restaurant he took you to any idea who she might be colquhoun none hogan you knew professor lintz a long time what did you think were his sexual proclivities colquhoun never thought about it hogan no colquhoun no hogan what about yourself sir colquhoun i dont see what that well for the record inspector im monogamous and heterosexual hogan thank you sir i appreciate your frankness rebus switched off the tape ill bet you did what do you think bobby hogan asked i think you mistimed the did youdoit otherwise not bad rebus tapped the tape machine is there much more not a lot rebus switched it back on hogan when you met in the restaurant it was the same routine as before colquhoun oh yes names dates countries i was taken through on my way into britain from the continent hogan he told you how this was achieved colquhoun he called it the rat line said it was operated by the vatican if you can believe that and all the western governments were in cahoots to get the top nazis the scientists and intellectuals away from the russians i mean really its ian fleming meets john le carre isnt it hogan but he was very detailed colquhoun yes but it can be that way with obsessives hogan there have been books written alleging the same thing professor lintz was talking about colquhoun have there hogan nazis smuggled overseas war criminals rescued from the gallows colquhoun well yes but those are just stories you dont seriously think hogan im just collecting information dr colquhoun in my job we dont throw anything away colquhoun yes i can see that the problem is sorting out the wheat from the chaff hogan you mean the truths from the lies yes thats one problem colquhoun i mean the stories you hear about bosnia and croatia slaughterhouses mass torture the guilty being spirited away its hard to know whats true hogan just before we finish any idea what happened to the money colquhoun what money hogan the withdrawal lintz made from his bank five thousand pounds in cash colquhoun this is the first ive heard of it another motive hogan thank you for your time dr colquhoun it might be necessary for us to talk again im sorry but you shouldnt have lied to us it makes our job that much more difficult colquhoun im sorry inspector hogan i quite understand but i hope you can comprehend why i did it hogan my mum always told me never to lie sir thanks again for your time rebus looked at hogan your mum hogan shrugged maybe it was my granny rebus drained his coffee so we know one of lintzs mealtime companions and we know he was hounding colquhoun is he a suspect im not exactly snowed under with them fair point but all the same you think hes on the level i dont know bobby he sounded like he had it rehearsed and he was relieved at the end you dont think i got it all i could bring him in again rebus was thinking stories you hear the guilty being spirited array not stories you read but ones you hear who might he have heard them from candice jake tarawicz hogan rubbed the bridge of his nose i need a drink rebus dropped his beaker into a wastebin message received and understood by the way any word from abernethy hes a bloody nuisance hogan said turning away hes in place claverhouse said when rebus phoned him to ask about jack morton got him a little onebedroom shithole in polwarth measured him up for his uniform and hes now officially a member of onsite security is anyone else in on it just the big boss his names livingstone we had a long session with him last night wont the other security men find it a bit odd a stranger arriving in their midst its down to jack to put them at ease he was pretty confident whats his cover secret drinker open gambler busted marriage he doesnt drink yes he told me doesnt matter so long as everyone thinks he does is he in character getting there hes going to be working double shifts that way he makes more trips to the shop some in the evening when the place is quieter more chance to get to know ken and dec weve no contact with him during the day debriefing takes place once hes reached home telephone only cant risk too many meetings you think theyll watch him if theyre being thorough and if they fall for the plan did you talk to marty jones thats set for tomorrow hell bring a couple of heavies but theyll go easy on jack isnt tomorrow a bit soon can we afford to wait they might already have someone in mind were asking a lot of him he was your idea i know you dont think hes up to it its not that but hes stepping into a war then get the ceasefire sorted out it is thats not what i hear rebus heard it too as soon as he got off the phone he knocked on the chief supers door the farmer was in conference with gill templer did you talk to him the farmer asked he agreed to a ceasefire rebus said he was looking at templer what about you she took a deep breath i spoke to mr telford his solicitor was present throughout i kept telling him what we wanted and the lawyer kept telling me i was blackening his clients name and telford just sat there arms folded smiling at the wall colour was creeping up her face i dont think he looked at me once but you gave him the message yes you said cafferty would comply she nodded then what the hells happening we cant let it get out of control the farmer said looks to me like it already is the latest scoreline two of caffertys men their faces mashed to something resembling fruitpulp lucky theyre not dead the farmer went on you know whats happening rebus said its tarawicz hes the problem tommys playing up to him its times like this you yearn for independence the farmer agreed then we could just extradite the bugger why dont we rebus suggested tell him his presence here is no longer acceptable and if he stays we shadow him make sure everyone knows were doing it we make nuisances of ourselves you think that would work gill templer sounded sceptical probably not rebus agreed slumping into a chair weve no real leverage the farmer said glancing at his watch which isnt going to please the chief constable he wants me in his office in half an hour he got on the phone ordered a car rose to his feet look see if you can thrash something out between you rebus and templer exchanged a look ill be back in an hour or two the farmer looked around as if he were suddenly lost lock the door when you leave with that and a wave of his hand he left there was silence in the room has to keep his office locked rebus said to stop people stealing the secret of his terrible coffee actually its been getting better recently maybe your taste buds are being corroded so chief inspector rebus turned his chair to face hers what about thrashing it out then eh she smiled he thinks hes losing it is he in for a bollocking probably so its down to us to come to the rescue i dont really see us as the dynamic duo do you no then theres always that part of you that says let them tear each other apart so long as no civilians get caught in the crossfire rebus thought of sammy of candice thing is he said they always do she looked at him how are you doing same as ever as bad as that its my calling youre done with lintz though rebus shook his head theres half a chance he ties in to telford you still think telford was behind the hitandrun telford or cafferty cafferty setting up telford the way someone tried to set me up for matsumoto you know youre not out of the woods he looked at her an internal inquiry the men with rubber soles she nodded bring them on he sat forward in his chair rubbed his temples no reason they should be left out of the party what party the one inside my head the party that never stops rebus leaned across the desk to answer the phone no hes not here can i take a message this is di rebus a pause he was looking at gill tempter yes im working that case he found pen and paper started writing mmm i see yes sounds like ill let him know when he gets back eyes boring into hers then the punchline how many did you say were dead just the one another fled the scene holding his arm all but severed from the shoulder he turned up at a local hospital later needing surgery and a huge transfusion of blood in broad daylight not in edinburgh but paisley telfords hometown the town he still ruled four men dressed in council work jackets like a road team but in place of picks and shovels theyd toted machetes and a largecalibre revolver theyd chased two men into a housing scheme kids playing on tricycles kicking a ball up the street women hanging out of their windows and grown men itching to hurt one another a machete swung overhead coming down hard the wounded man kept running his friend tried hurdling a fence wasnt agile enough three inches higher and hed have made it as it was his toe caught and he fell he was pushing himself back up when the barrel of the gun touched the back of his head two shots a fine drizzle of blood and brain the children not playing any more the women screaming for them to run but something had been satisfied by those two shots the chase was over the four men turned and jogged back down the street towards a waiting van a public execution in tommy telfords heartland the two victims known moneylenders the one in hospital was called wee stevie murray age twentytwo the one in the mortuary was donny draper known since childhood as curtains theyd be making jokes about that curtains was two weeks shy of his twentyfifth birthday rebus hoped hed made the most of his short time on the planet paisley police knew about telfords move to edinburgh knew there were some problems there a courtesy call had been placed to chief superintendent watson the caller said the men were two of telfords brightest and best the caller said descriptions of the attackers were vague the caller said the children werent talking they were being shielded by their parents fearful of reprisals well they might not be talking to the police but rebus doubted theyd be so reticent when tommy telford came calling armed with his own questions and determined to have answers this was bad this was escalation firebombings and beatings these could be remedied but murder murder put the grudgematch on to a much higher plane is it worth talking to them again gill tempter asked they were in the canteen sandwiches untouched in front of them what do you think he knew what she thought she was talking because she thought talking was better than doing nothing he could have told her to save her breath they used a machete he said same thing they took to danny simpsons scalp rebus nodded ive got to ask she said what about lintz what you said he drained the last inch of his cold coffee fancy another john he looked at her lintz had some phone calls he was trying to hide one of them was to tommy telfords office in flint street we dont know how it ties in but we think it does tie in what could lintz and telford have had in common maybe lintz went to him for help maybe he rented prossies off him like i say we dont know which is why were keeping it under the table you want telford very badly dont you rebus stared at her thought about it not as much as i did hes not enough any more you want cafferty too and tarawicz and the yakuza and anybody else whos along for the ride she nodded this is the party you were talking about he tapped his head theyre all in here gill ive tried kicking them out but they wont leave maybe if you stopped playing their kind of music he smiled tiredly now theres an idea what do you reckon elp the enid how about a yes triple album your department not mine thank god you dont know what youre missing yes i do i was there first time round old scottish proverb he who has had knuckles rapped will want to rap someone elses which is why rebus found himself back in watsons office the farmers cheeks were still red from his meeting with the chief constable when rebus made to sit watson told him to get back on his feet youll sit when youre told and not before thank you sir what the bloody hells going on john pardon sir the farmer looked at the note rebus had left on his desk whats this one dead one seriously wounded in paisley sir telfords men caffertys hitting him where it hurts probably reckons that telfords territorys spun a bit thin leaves him open to breaches paisley the farmer stuffed the note in his drawer not our problem it will be sir when telford hits back itll be right here never mind that inspector lets talk about macleans pharmaceuticals rebus blinked relaxed his shoulders i was going to tell you sir but instead i had to hear it from the chief constable not really my baby sir crime squad are pushing the pram but who put the baby in the pram i was going to tell you sir know how it makes me look i walk into fettes and i dont know something one of my junior officers knows i look like a mug with respect sir im sure thats not the case i look like a mug the farmer slammed the desk with both palms and its not as though this was the first time ive always tried to do my best for you you know that yes sir always been fair absolutely sir and you pay me back like this it wont happen again sir the farmer stared at him rebus held it returned it i bloody well hope not the farmer leaned back in his chair hed calmed down a little bollocking as therapy nothing else you want to tell me is there while ive got you here no sir except well go on the farmer sat forward again its the man in the flat above me sir rebus said i think he might be lord lucan leonard cohen there is a war they were waiting for telfords retaliatory strike the chief constables idea visible presence as deterrent it came as no surprise to rebus probably even less so to telford who had charles groal ready claiming harassment the minute the patrol cars turned up in flint street how was his client supposed to carry on with his legitimate and substantial business interests as well as his many community developments under the pressure of unwarranted and intrusive police surveillance community developments meaning the pensioners and their rentfree flats telford wouldnt hesitate to use them as pawns the media would love it the patrol cars would be pulled it was just a matter of time and afterwards firework night all over again thats what everyone was expecting rebus went to the hospital sat with rhona the room so familiar to him now was an oasis where calm and order reigned where each hour of the day brought its comforting rituals theyve washed her hair he said shes had another scan rhona explained they had to get the gunk off afterwards rebus nodded they said youd noticed eye movement i thought i did rhona douched his arm jackie says he might manage to come up again at the weekend call this fair warning received and understood you look tired he smiled one of these days someones going to tell me how terrific im looking but not today rhona said must be all the booze clubbing and women thinking coke the morvena casino and candice thinking why do i feel like piggy in the middle are cafferty and telford both playing games with me thinking i hope jack mortons okay the phone was ringing when he got back to arden street he picked up just as the answering machine was cutting in hold on till i stop this thing found the right button and hit it technology eh strawman cafferty what do you want ive heard about paisley you mean youve been talking to yourself i had nothing to do with it rebus laughed out loud im telling you rebus fell into his chair and im supposed to believe you games he was thinking whether you believe me or not i wanted you to know thanks im sure ill sleep better for that im being set up strawman telford doesnt need to set you up rebus sighed stretched his neck to left and right look have you considered another possibility what your men have lost it theyre going behind your back id know youd know what your own lieutenants tell you what if theyre lying im not saying its the whole gang could be just two or three gone rogue id know the emotion had drained from caffertys voice he was thinking it over fine okay youd know whod be the first to tell you cafferty youre on the other side of the country youre in prison how hard would it be to keep stuff from you these are men id trust with my life cafferty paused theyd tell me if they knew if they hadnt been warned not to tell you see what im saying two or three gone rogue cafferty echoed you must have candidates jeffries would know jeffries is that the weasels name dont let him hear you call him that give me his number ill talk to him no but ill get him to call you and if hes part of the breakaway we dont know there is one but you admit it makes sense i admit tommy telfords trying to put me in a box rebus stared from his window you mean literally ive heard word of a contract but youve got protection cafferty chuckled strawman you almost sound concerned youre imagining things look there are only two ways out of this one you deal with telford two i deal with him are we agreed on that i mean im not the one who went poaching players and territory and putting out frighteners maybe hes just more ambitious than you maybe he reminds you of the way you used to be are you saying ive gone soft im saying its adapt or die have you adapted strawman maybe a little aye a fucking speck if that were not talking about me though youre as involved as anyone remember that strawman and sweet dreams rebus put down the phone he felt exhausted and depressed the kids across the way were in bed shutters closed he looked around the room jack morton had helped him paint it back when rebus was thinking of selling jack had helped him off the sauce too he knew he wouldnt be able to sleep got back into the car and headed for young street the oxford bar was quiet a couple of philosophers in the corner and through in the backroom three musicians whod packed up their fiddles he drank a couple of cups of black coffee then drove to oxford terrace parked the car outside patiences flat turned off the ignition and sat there for a while jazz on the radio he hit a good streak astrid gilberto stan getz art pepper duke ellington told himself hed wait till a bad record came on then go knock on patiences door but by then it was too late he didnt want to turn up unannounced it would be it wouldnt look right he didnt mind that it smacked of desperation but he didnt want her to think he was pushing he started the engine again and moved off drove around the new town and down to granton sat by the edge of the forth window down listening to water and the nighttime traffic of hgvs even with eyes closed he couldnt shut out the world in fact in those moments before sleep came his images were at their most vivid he wondered what sammy dreamed about or even if she dreamed at all rhona said that sammy had come north to be with him he couldnt think what hed done to deserve her back into town for an espresso at gordons trattoria then the hospital easy to find a parking space this time of night a taxi was idling outside the entrance he made his way to sammys room was surprised to see someone there his first thought rhona the only illumination in the room was that given through the closed curtains a woman kneeling by the bed head resting on the covers he walked forwards she heard him turned face glistening with tears candice her eyes widened she stumbled to her feet i wanting see her she said quietly rebus nodded in shadows she looked even more like sammy same build similar hair and shape to her face she wore a long red coat fished in the pocket for a paper hankie i like her she said he nodded again does tarawicz know where you are he asked she shook her head the taxi outside he guessed she nodded they went casino i said sore head she spoke falteringly checking each word was right before using it will he find out youve gone she thought about it shook her head you sleep in the same room rebus asked she shook her head again smiled jake not liking women this was news to rebus miriam kenworthy had said something about him marrying an englishwoman but put that down to immigration he remembered the way tarawicz had pawed candice realised now it had been for telfords benefit hed been showing telford that he could control his women while telford well telford had let her get arrested then be taken in by the crime squad a small sign of rivalry between the two partners something to be exploited is she will she rebus shrugged we hope so candice she looked down at the floor my name is dunya dunya he echoed sarajevo was she looked up at him you know like really i was escaping lucky they all said to me you lucky you lucky she stabbed at her chest with a finger lucky survivor she broke down again and this time he held her the stones soul survivor only sometimes it was the body alone that survived the soul eaten into chewed up by experience dunya he said repeating her name reinforcing her true identity trying to get through to the one part of her shed kept hidden since sarajevo dunya sshhh its going to be all right sshhh and stroking her hair her face his other hand on her back feeling her tremble blinking back his own tears and watching sammys body the atmosphere in the room crackled like electricity he wondered if any part of it was reaching sammys brain dunya dunya dunya she pulled away turned her back on him he wouldnt let her go walked up to her and rested his hands on her shoulders dunya he said how did tarawicz find you she seemed not to understand in lower largo his men found you brian she said quietly rebus frowned brian summers prettyboy he tell jake he told tarawicz where you were but why not just take her back to edinburgh rebus thought he knew she was too dangerous shed been too close to the police best get her out of the way not a killing that would have implicated all of them but tarawicz could control her mr pink eyes bailing out his friend one more time he brought you here so he could gloat over telford rebus was thoughtful he looked at candice what could he do with her where would be safe she seemed to sense his thoughts squeezed his hand you know i have a she made a cradling motion with her hands a boy rebus said she nodded and tarawicz knows where he is she shook her head the lorries they took him tarawiczs refugee lorries she nodded again and you dont know where he is jake knows he says his man she made scuttling motions with her hands will kill my boy if scuttling motions the crab something struck rebus why isnt the crab up here with tarawicz she was looking at him tarawicz here he said crab in newcastle why she shrugged looked thoughtful he dont come she was remembering some snippet of conversation danger dangerous rebus frowned who for she shrugged again rebus took her hands you cant trust him dunya you have to leave him she smiled up at him eyes glinting i tried they looked at one another held one another for a while afterwards he walked her back out to her taxi in the morning he called the hospital found out how sammy was doing then asked to be transferred hows danny simpson getting on im sorry are you family which told him everything he identified himself asked when it had happened in the night the nurse said body at its lowest ebb the dying hours rebus called the mother identified himself again sorry to hear the news he said is the funeral just family if you dont mind no flowers were asking for donations to be sent to an to a charity danny was well thought of you know im sure rebus took down details of the charity an aids hospice the mother couldnt bring herself to say the word terminated the call got an envelope out and put in ten pounds plus a note in memory of danny simpson he wondered about going for that test his phone rang and he picked it up hello lots of static and engine noise carphone on the move at speed this takes persecution to new levels telford what do you mean rebus trying to compose himself danny simpsons been dead six hours and already youre on the phone to his mum how do you know i was there paying my respects same reason i phoned then know what telford i think youre taking persecution complexes to new levels yes and caffertys not out to shut me down he says he didnt have anything to do with paisley i bet you believed in the tooth fairy when you were a kid i still do youll need more than a good fairy if you side with cafferty is that a threat dont tell me tarawicz is in the car with you silence bingo rebus thought you think tarawicz will respect you because you badmouth cops hes got no respect for you whatsoever look how hes waving candice in your face mixing levity with fury hey rebus you and candice in that hotel what was she like jake tells me shes vindaloo background laughter mr pink eyes who according to candice had never touched her for laughter read bravado telford and tarawicz playing games between themselves playing games with the world rebus found the tone of voice he wanted i tried to help her if shes too stupid to know that she deserves the likes of you and tarawicz telling them he had no further interest in her anyway tarawicz didnt have any trouble taking her off your hands rebus jabbing away looking for gaps in the armour of the telford tarawicz relationship what if cafferty wasnt behind paisley he asked into the silence it was his men gone rogue he cant control them thats his lookout hes a joke rebus hes finished rebus didnt say anything listened instead to a muted conversation then telford again mr tarawicz wants a word the phone was handed over rebus i thought we were civilised men in what way when we met in newcastle i thought we came to an understanding the unspoken agreement leave telford alone have nothing more to do with cafferty and candice and her son would be safe what was tarawicz getting at ive kept my side a forced chuckle you know what paisley represents what the beginning of the end of morris gerald cafferty and i bet youd send flowers to the grave dead flowers at that rebus went into st leonards got settled in front of his computer screen and took a look at the crab the crab william andrew colton plenty of form rebus decided hed like to read the files phoned in and requested them backed up the request in writing buzzed from downstairs a man to see him no name supplied description the weasel rebus went downstairs the weasel was outside smoking a cigarette he was wearing a green waxed jacket torn at both pockets a lumberjack hat with its flaps down protected his ears from the wind lets walk rebus said the weasel got into step with him they wandered through an estate of new flats satellite dishes and windows picked from lego boxes behind the flats sat salisbury crags dont worry rebus said im not in the mood for rockclimbing im in the mood for indoors the weasel tucked his chin into the upturned collar of his coat whats the news on my daughter were close i told you how close the weasel measured his response weve got the tapes from the car the guy who sold them he says he got them from another party and he is a sly smile the weasel knew he had control over rebus hed play it out as long as possible youre going to be meeting him fairly shortly even so say the tapes got taken from the car after it was abandoned the weasel was shaking his head thats not how it was then how was it he wanted to pull his tormentor down on to the ground and start hammering his skull on the pavement give us a day or two well have everything you need the wind gusted some grit towards them they turned their faces rebus saw a heavyset man loitering sixty yards behind dont worry the weasel said hes with me getting jittery after paisley telfords out for blood what do you know about paisley the weasels eyes became slits nothing no caffertys beginning to suspect some of his own men might have gone rogue rebus watched the weasel shake his head i dont know the first thing about it whos your bosss main man ask mr cafferty the weasel was looking around as if bored by the conversation he made a signal to the backmarker who passed it along seconds later a newish jaguar arterialred paintjob cruised to a stop beside them rebus saw a driver itching for a less sedentary occupation cream leather interior the backmarker jogging forwards opening the door for the weasel its you rebus said the weasel caffertys eyes and ears on the street the man with the look and dresscode of a downandout the weasel was running the show all the lieutenants in the various outposts all the tailormade suits the collective which according to police intelligence ran caffertys kingdom in their masters absence they were a smokescreen the hunched man pulling off his lumberjack hat the man with bad teeth and a blunt razor he was in charge rebus actually laughed the bodyguard got into the cars passenger seat having made sure his boss was comfortable in the back rebus tapped on the window the weasel lowered it tell me rebus asked have you got the bottle to wrest it away from him mr cafferty trusts me he knows ill do right by him what about telford the weasel stared at him telfords not my concern then who is but the window was rising again and the weasel cafferty had called him jeffries had turned his face away dismissing rebus from his mind he stood there watching the car drive off was cafferty making a big mistake putting the weasel in charge was it just that his best men had scarpered or gone over to the other side or was the weasel every bit as sly clever and vicious as his namesake back at the station rebus sought out bill pryde pryde was shrugging his shoulders even before rebus had reached his desk sorry john no news nothing at all what about the stolen tapes pryde shook his head thats funny ive just been talking to someone who claims to know who sold them on and who he got them from pryde sat back in his chair i wondered why you hadnt been chasing me up whatve you done hired a private eye blood was rising to his face ive been working my arse off on this john you know i have now you dont trust me to do the job its not like that bill rebus suddenly found himself on the defensive whove you got working for you john just people on the street wellconnected people by the sound of it he paused are we talking villains my daughters in a coma bill im well aware of that now answer my question people around them were staring rebus lowered his voice just a few of my grasses then give me their names come on bill prydes hands gripped the table these past days ive been thinking youd lost interest thinking maybe you didnt want an answer he was thoughtful you wouldnt go to telford cafferty his eyes widened is that it john rebus turned his head away christ john whats the deal here he hands over the driver what do you hand him its not like that i cant believe youd trust cafferty you put him away for christs sake its not a question of trust but pryde was shaking his head theres a line we dont cross get a grip bill theres no line rebus spread his arms if there is show me it pryde tapped his forehead its up here then its a fiction you really believe that rebus sought an answer slumped against the desk ran his hands over his head he remembered something lintz had once said when me stop believing in god me dont suddenly believe in nothing me believe anything john someone called phone call rebus stared at pryde later he said he walked across to another desk took the call rebus here its bobby bobby hogan what can i do for you bobby for a start you can help get that special branch arsehole off my back abernethy he wont leave me alone keeps phoning you christ john arent you listening hes here when did he get in he never went away whoah hold on and hes driving me round the twist he says he knows you from way back so how about having a word are you at leith where else ill be there in twenty minutes i got so pissed off i went to my boss and thats something i seldom have to resort to bobby hogan was drinking coffee like it was something best taken intravenously the top button of his shirt was undone tie hanging loose only he went on his boss had a word with my bosss boss and i ended up with a warning cooperate or else meaning i wasnt to tell anyone he was still around thanks pal so whats he actually doing what isnt he doing he wants to be in on any interviews he wants copies of tapes and transcripts he wants to see all the paperwork wants to know what im planning to do next what i had for breakfast i dont suppose hes managing to be helpful in any shape or form hogans look gave rebus his answer i dont mind him taking an interest but this verges on the obstructive hes slowing the case to a dead stop maybe thats his plan hogan looked up from his cup i dont get it neither do i look if hes being obstructive lets put on a show see how he reacts what sort of show what time will he be in hogan checked his watch half an hour or so thats when my work stops for the day while i fill him in half an hours enough mind if i use your phone when abernethy arrived he didnt manage not to look surprised the space put aside for the investigation hogans space now contained three bodies and they were working at the devils own pace hogan was on the telephone to a librarian he was asking for a rundown of books and articles about the rat line rebus was sorting through paperwork putting it in order crossreferencing laying aside anything he didnt think useful and siobhan clarke was there too she appeared to be on the phone to some jewish organisation and was asking them about lists of war criminals rebus nodded towards abernethy but kept on working whats going on abernethy asked taking off his raincoat helping out bobbys got so many leads to work on he nodded towards siobhan and crime squad are interested too since when rebus waved a piece of paper this might be bigger than we think abernethy locked around he wanted to speak to hogan but hogan was still on the phone rebus was the only one with time to talk which was just the way rebus had planned it hed only had five minutes in which to brief siobhan but she was a born actress even holding a conversation with the dialling tone hogans fantasy librarian meantime was asking him all the right questions and abernethy was looking glazed what do you mean in fact rebus said putting down a file you might be able to help how youre special branch and special branch has access to the secret services rebus paused right abernethy licked his lips and shrugged see rebus went on were beginning to wonder something there could be a dozen reasons why someone would want to kill joseph lintz but the one weve been practically ignoring ignoring at abernethys suggestion according to hogan is the one that just might provide the answer im talking about the rat line what if lintzs murder had something to do with that how could it it was rebuss turn to shrug thats why we need your help we need any and all information we can get on the rat line but it never existed funny a lot of books seem to say it did theyre wrong then there are all these survivors except they havent survived suicides car crashes a fall from a window lintz is just one of along line of dead men siobhan clarke and bobby hogan had finished their calls and were listening youre climbing the wrong tree abernethy said well you know if youre in a forest climbing any tree will give you a better view there is no rat line youre an expert ive been collating yes yes all the investigations and how far have you got is any one of them going to make it to trial its too early to tell and soon it may be too late these men arent getting any younger ive seen the same thing all around europe delay the trial until the defendants are so old they snuff it or go doolally results the same no trial look this has nothing to do with why are you here abernethy why did you come up that time to speak to lintz look rebus its not if you cant tell us talk to your boss get him to do it otherwise the way were digging were bound to throw up an old bone sooner or later abernethy stood back a pace i think i get it he said and he began to smile youre trying to stiff me he was looking at hogan thats what this is not at all rebus answered what im saying is well redouble our efforts well sniff into every little corner the rat line the vatican turning nazis into cold war spies for the allies it could all count as evidence the other men on your list the other suspects well need to talk to all of them see if they knew joseph lintz maybe they met him on the trip over abernethy was shaking his head im not going to let you do that youre going to obstruct the investigation thats not what i said no but its what youll do rebus paused if you think were climbing the wrong tree and incidentally that should be barking up go ahead and prove it give us everything youve got on lintzs past abernethys eyes were fierce or we go on digging and sniffing rebus opened another file lifted out the first sheet hogan picked up his telephone made another call siobhan clarke looked at a list of numbers and chose one hello is that the city synagogue hogan was saying yes its detective inspector hogan here leith cid do you by any chance have information on a joseph lintz abernethy grabbed his coat turned on his heels and left they waited thirty seconds then hogan put the receiver down he looked nettled thats one christmas wish i can chalk off siobhan clarke said thanks for your time siobhan rebus said happy to oblige but why did it have to be me because he knows youre crime squad i wanted him to think interest was escalating and because the two of you didnt exactly hit it off last time you met antagonism always helps and what did we accomplish bobby hogan asked beginning to gather together the files half of which belonged to other cases we rattled his cage rebus said hes not up here for the good of his health or yours come to that hes here because special branch in london want to know all about the investigation and to me that means theyre scared of something the rat line that would be my guess abernethys been keeping an eye on all the new cases nationwide someone in london is getting a bit sweaty theyre worried this rat line will connect to whoever killed lintz im not sure it goes that far rebus said meaning he looked at clarke meaning im not sure it goes that far well hogan said looks like hes off my back for a little while at least for which im grateful he got to his feet get anyone a coffee clarke checked her watch go on then rebus waited till hogan was gone then thanked siobhan again i wasnt sure youd be able to spare the time were giving jack morton a wide berth she explained nothing to do but bite our fingernails and wait what about you what are you up to keeping my nose clean she smiled ill bet hogan came back with three coffees powdered milk sorry clarke wrinkled her nose actually ive got to be getting back she stood up and put on her coat thats one i owe you hogan said shaking her hand i wont let you forget she turned to rebus see you later cheers siobhan hogan put her cup beside his own so we got abernethy off my back but did we get anything else wait and see bobby i didnt exactly have much time to devise a strategy the phone rang just as hogan took a mouthful of scalding coffee rebus picked up hello is that you john country and western twanging in the background claverhouse youve just missed her rebus told him its not clarke i wanted its you oh something i thought you might be interested in its just filtered down from ncis rebus heard claverhouse pick up a sheet of paper sakiji shoda i think ive pronounced that right flew into heathrow from kansai airport yesterday southeast regional crime squad were apprised terrific he didnt hang around caught a connection to inverness stayed the night in a local hotel and now i hear hes in edinburgh rebus looked out of the window not exactly golfing weather i dont think hes up here for the golf according to the original report mr shoda is a highranking member of the cant make it out on the fax sockysomething sokaiya rebus sat up that looks about right where is he now i tried a couple of hotels hes staying at the caly whats the sokaiya its the upper echelons of the yakuza how does it read to you i was going to suggest hes matsumotos replacement but it sounds to me like hes a few grades higher matsumotos boss which meant hes probably here to find out what happened to his boy rebus tapped a pen against his teeth hogan was listening but not getting any of it why inverness why not direct to edinburgh ive been wondering that claverhouse sneezed how pissed off will he be somewhere between mildly and very more importantly how are telford and mr pink eyes going to react you think telford will drop macleans on the contrary i think hell want to show mr shoda that he can do some things right rebus thought back to something claverhouse had said southeast crime squad yes rather than scotland yard maybe the two are the same maybe do you have a contact number claverhouse gave it to him youll speak to jack morton tonight rebus asked yes better tell him about this talk to you again rebus put down the receiver picked it up again got an outside line and made the call explained his reason for calling and asked if there was anyone who could help him he was told to hold is this to do with telford hogan asked rebus nodded hey bobby did you ever talk to telford again i tried a couple of times he just kept saying it mustve been a wrong number and this was echoed by his staff hogan nodded smiled tell you a funny thing i walked into telfords office and someone was at his desk back to me i apologised said id come back when hed finished with the lady well the lady turns face like fury prettyboy hogan nodded and pretty fucking angry the last i saw him hogan laughed putting you through the switchboard told rebus how can i help you the voice sounded welsh my names di rebus scottish crime squad rebus winked at hogan the lie would give him more clout yes inspector and you are di morgan we had this message this morning yes concerning sakiji shoda that would be my boss has sent you that what im wondering is whats your interest well inspector im more of an expert on vory y zakone that clears things up then morgan chuckled thieves within the code meaning mafiya russian mafia thats it youll have to help me here whats that got to do with why do you want to know rebus took a sip of coffee weve had a spot of bother with the yakuza up here one victim so far my guess is that shoda is the victims boss and hes up there for a sort of unofficial committal we dont have the committal stage in scotland di morgan well pardon me for breathing thing is weve also got a russian gangster up here i say hes russian word is hes chechen is it jake tarawicz youve heard of him thats my job sonny boy well anyway with the yakuza and the chechens in town youve got a nightmare scenario understood well look what about if you give me your number there and ill call back in five minutes need to put some facts together first rebus gave him the number then waited ten minutes for the call back you were checking me out he told the welshman got to be careful bit naughty of you to say you were crime squad lets just say im the next best thing so is there anything you can tell me morgan took a deep breath weve been chasing a lot of dirty money around the world rebus couldnt find a clean sheet of paper to write on hogan gave him a pad see morgan was saying the old soviet asia is now the biggest supplier of raw opium in the world and wherever theres drugs theres money needs laundering and this money makes its way to britain on its way elsewhere companies in london private banks in guernsey the money gets filtered down getting cleaner all the time everyone wants to do business with the russians why because they make everyone money russias one giant bazaar you want weapons counterfeit goods money fake passports even plastic surgery you want any of that its in russia the place has open borders airports nobody knows exist its ideal if you happen to be an international mobster exactly and the mafiya have made links with their sicilian cousins with the camorra the calabrians i could go on forever british villains go shopping there they all love the russians and now theyre here oh theyre here all right running protection and prossies dealing drugs prostitutes drugs mr pink eyess territory telfords territory any evidence of a hookup with the yakuza not that i know of but if they moved into britain theyd be trying to control drugs and prostitution theyd be laundering money ways to launder money through legitimate businesses such ascountry clubs and the like by swopping dirty money for casino chips at an establishment like the morvena rebus already knew that the yakuza liked to smuggle artworks back into japan rebus already knew mr pink had made his early money smuggling icons out of russia put the two together then add tommy telford to the equation did they need the haul from macleans it didnt sound to rebus like they did so why was tommy telford doing it two possible reasons one to show off two because theyd told him to some rite of passage if he wanted to play with the big boys he had to prove himself he had to wipe out cafferty and pull off what would be the biggest heist in scottish history something hit rebus between the eyes telford wasnt meant to succeed telford was meant to fail telford was being set up by tarawicz and the yakuza because he had something they wanted a steady supply of drugs a kingdom waiting to be plucked from his grasp miriam kenworthy had said as much rumour was the drugs were going south frorn scotland which meant telford had a supply something nobody knew about with cafferty out of the way thered be no competition the yakuza would have their british base solid respectable reliable the electronics factory would act as perfect cover maybe even as a laundering operation itself every way rebus looked at it telford was unnecessary to the equation like a zero that could be safely cancelled out which was where rebus wanted telford only not at the price being asked thanks for your help he said he noticed that hogan had stopped listening and was staring into space rebus put the phone down sorry to have bored you hogan blinked no nothing like that its just that i thought of something what prettyboy i mistook him for a woman youre probably not the first exactly im not sure i follow you in the restaurant lintz and a young woman hogan shrugged its a long shot rebus saw it talking business hogan nodded prettyboy runs telfords stable and takes a personal interest in the higherprice models its worth a try bobby what do you think bring him in definitely beef up the restaurant angle say theres a positive id see what he says to that same gag we pulled with colquhoun prettyboys bound to deny it doesnt mean it aint so rebus patted hogan on the shoulder what about your call my call rebus looked at his scrawled notes gangsters preparing to carve up scotland it wasnt the worst news ive ever had and is that saying much afraid not bobby rebus said putting on his jacket afraid not by the end of play rebus still hadnt received the files on the crab but he had fielded a frank and foulmouthed call from abernethy accusing him of everything from obstruction which was pretty rich considering to racism which rebus thought nicely ironic theyd given him back his car someone had run their finger through the dirt crusted on the boot creating two messages terminal case arid washed by stevie wonder the saab affronted started first time and seemed to have shrugged off some of its repertoire of clanks and thunks on the drive home rebus kept the windows open so he wouldnt smell the whisky that had soaked into the upholstery the evening had turned out fine the sky clear temperature dropping sharply the low red sun curse of the citys drivers had disappeared behind the rooftops rebus left his coat unbuttoned as he walked down to the chip shop he bought a fish supper two buttered rolls and a couple of cans of irnbru then returned to the flat nothing on the tv so he put on a record van morrison astral weeks the record had more scratches than a dog with eczema the opening track contained the refrain to be born again rebus thought of father leary shored up by a fridge full of medicine then he thought of sammy crowned with electrodes machines rising either side of her like she was being offered to them in sacrifice leary often talked of faith but it was hard to have faith in a human race that never learned that seemed ready to accept torture murder destruction he opened his newspaper kosovo zaire rwanda punishment beatings in northern ireland a young girl found murdered in england another girls disappearance termed a cause for concern the predators were out there no doubt about it strip the veneer and the world had moved only a couple of steps from the cave to be born again but sometimes only after a baptism of fire belfast a snipers bullet blew open the skull of a british squaddie the victim was nineteen came from glasgow back in the barracks thered been little mourning just an overspill of anger the assassin would never be caught hed slipped back into the shadows of a towerblock and from there deep into the catholic housing estate leaving one more newspaper story one early statistic in the troubles and anger the ringleader went by the nickname of mean machine he was a lancecorporal came from somewhere in ayrshire cropped blond hair looked like hed played rugby liked to work out even if it was just pressups and situps in the barracks he started the campaign for retribution it was to be covert meaning behind the backs of the brass it was to be a releasevalve for the frustration the pressure that was building in the cramped confines of the barracks the world outside was enemy terrain everyone a potential foe knowing there was no way to punish the sniper mean machine had decided to hold the entire community to blame collective responsibility for which there would be collective justice the plan a raid on a known ira bar a place where sympathisers drank and colluded the pretext a man with a handgun chased into the bar necessitating a search maximum harassment ending with the beating of the local ira fundraiser and rebus went along with it because it was collective you were either part of the team or you were dead meat and rebus wasnt in the market for pariah status but all the same he knew the line between good guys and bad guys had become blurred and during the incursion it disappeared altogether mean machine went in hardest teeth bared eyes ablaze he swung with his rifle cracking skulls tables flew pint glasses shattered initially the other soldiers seemed shocked by the sudden violence they looked to each other for guidance then one of them lashed out and the others fell in beside him a mirror dissolved into glittering stars stout and lager washed over the wooden floor men were shouting begging crawling on hands and knees across the glass minefield mean machine had the ira man pinned to a wall kneeing him in the groin he twisted his body threw him to the floor then started pummelling him with the riflebutt more soldiers were pouring into the drinkingclub armoured cars arriving outside a chair crashed into the row of optics the smell of whisky was almost overpowering rebus tried to shut it out his own teeth bared not in angerbut anguish then he aimed his rifle at the ceiling and let loose a single shot and everything froze a final kick to the bloodied figure on the floor and mean machine turned and walked out of the club the others hesitated again then followed hed proved something to the other men for all his lowly rank hed become their leader they enjoyed themselves that night in the barracks chiding rebus for letting his triggerfinger slip they cracked open cans of beer and told stories stories which were already being exaggerated turning the event into a myth giving it a grandeur it had lacked turning it into a lie a few weeks later the same ira man was found shot dead in a stolen car south of the city on a farm road with a view of hills and grazing land protestant paramilitaries took the blame but mean machine though he admitted nothing would wink and grin when the incident was mentioned bravado or confession rebus was never sure all he knew was that he wanted out away from mean machines newly minted code of ethics so he did the one thing he could applied to join the sas nobody would think him a coward or a turncoat for applying to join the elite to be born again side one had finished rebus turned the record over switched off the lights and went to sit in his chair he felt a chill run through him because he knew how events like villefranche could come to be because he knew how the worlds continuing horrors could come to be perpetrated at the cusp of the twentieth century he knew that mankinds instinct was raw that every act of bravery and kindness was countered by so many acts of savagery and he suspected that if his daughter had been that snipers victim hed have run into the bar with his triggerfinger already working telfords gang ran in a pack too trusted their leader but now he wanted to run with an even bigger gang the phone rang and he picked up john rebus he said john its jack jack morton rebus put down his can hello jack where are you in the poky onebedroomed flat our friends at fettes so graciously provided it has to fit the image aye i suppose so got a phone though coin job but you cant have everything he paused you okay john you sound not all there that just about sums me up jack whats it like being a security guard a dawdle pal should have taken it up years ago wait till your pensions safe aye right and it went okay with marty jones oscars all round they were just heavy enough i stumbled back into the shop said i had to sit down the gruesome twosome were very solicitous then started asking me all these questions not very subtle you dont think they twigged like you i was a bit dubious about setting it up so fast but i think they fell for it whether their boss goes along is a different story well hes under a lot of pressure with the war going on i dont think thats the whole story jack i think hes under pressure from his partners the russian and the japs i think theyre setting him up for a fall and macleans is the precipice evidence gut feeling jack was thoughtful so where do i stand just ca canny jack i never thought of that rebus laughed when do you think theyll make contact they followed me home thats how desperate they are theyre sitting outside right now they must think youre a good thing rebus could see the way it was going dec and ken getting panicky needing a quick result feeling vulnerable so far away from flint street not knowing if theyd be caffertys next victims telford pressure applied by tarawicz and now with the yakuza boss in town needing a result something to show he was top dog what about you john its been a while yes how are you holding up im on soft drinks only if thats what you mean and a car doused in whisky he could taste it in his lungs hang on jack said someones at the door ill call you back be careful the phone went dead rebus gave it an hour when jack hadnt called he got on the blower to claverhouse its okay claverhouse told him from his mobile tweedledee and tweedledum came calling took him off somewhere youre watching the flat decorators van parked down the street so youve no idea where theyve taken him id guess hes at flint street with no backup thats how we all wanted it christ i dont know thanks for the vote of confidence its not you in the firing line and im the one who volunteered him he knows the score john so now you wait for him either to come home or end up on a slab christ john calvin was charlie chester compared to you claverhouse had lost all patience rebus tried to think of a comeback slammed the phone down instead suddenly he couldnt be doing with van the man put on bowie instead aladdin sane nicely discordant mike garsons piano in key with his thoughts empty juice cans and a dead pack of cigarettes stared up at him he didnt know jacks address the only person whod give it to him was claverhouse and he didnt want to pick up their conversation he took bowie off halfway through side one substituted quadrophenia liner notes schizophrenic im bleeding quadrophenic which was just about right quarter past midnight the phone rang it was jack morton back home safe and sound rebus asked right as nails have you spoken to claverhouse he can wait his turn i said id phone you back so what did you get the third degree basically some guy with dyed black hair frizzy tight jeans prettyboy wears mascara looks like so what was the gist second hurdle passed nobodys mentioned what the job is yet tonight was a sort of preface wanted to know all about me told me my money worries could be over if i could help them with a little problem prettyboys words you asked what the problem was he wasnt saying if you ask me he goes to telford talks it through then theres another meeting and thats where they tell me the plan and youll be miked up yes and if they strip you claverhouse has access to some miniaturised stuff cufflinks and the like and your character would obviously wear cufflinks true enough maybe fit a transmitter into a bookies pencil now youre thinking im thinking im wiped out what was the mood like fraught any sign of tarawicz or shoda nope just prettyboy and the gruesome twosome claverhouse calls them tweedledum and tweedledee hes obviously classically educated morton paused youve spoken to him when you didnt call back im touched do you think hes up to it claverhouse rebus thought about it id feel better if i was in charge but that probably puts me in a minority i didnt say that youre a pal jack theyre running a check on me but thats all in place with luck ill pass what did they say to your sudden arrival at macleans ive been transferred from another plant if they go looking im in the personnel files morton paused again one thing i want to know what prettyboy handed me a hundred quid on account what do i do with t thats between you and your conscience jack see you soon night john for the first time in a while rebus actually made it as far as his bed his sleep was deep and dreamless doctors in white coats were doing things to sammy when rebus arrived at the hospital next morning taking her pulse shining lights in her eyes they were setting up another scanner a nurse trying to untangle the thin coloured leads rhona looked like shed lost some sleep she jumped up and ran towards him she woke up it took him a second to take it in rhona was holding his arms shaking him she woke up john he pushed his way to the bedside when last night why didnt you phone me i tried three four times you were engaged i tried patience but there was no answer there what happened to him sammy looked the same as ever she just opened her eyes no first off it was like she was moving her eyeballs you know with her eyelids closed then she opened her eyes rebus could see that the medical personnel were finding their work hampered half of him wanted to lash out were her fucking parents the other half wanted them to do all they could to bring her round again he took rhona by the shoulder and guided her out into the hallway did she did she look at you did she say anything she was just staring at the ceiling where the striplight is then i thought she was going to blink but she closed her eyes again and they stayed shut rhona burst into tears it was like i lost her all over again rebus took her in his arms she hugged him back she did it once he whispered into her ear shell do it again thats what one of the doctors said he said theyre very hopeful oh john i wanted to tell you i wanted to tell everyone and hed been busy with work claverhouse jack morton and hed got sammy into all this in the first place sammy and candice pebbles dropped into a pool and now the ripples had grown so that hed all but forgotten about the centre the starting point just like when he was married work consuming him becoming an end in itself and rhonas words youve exploited every relationship you ever had to be born again im sorry rhona he said can you let ned know she started crying again come on he said lets get some breakfast have you been here all night i couldnt leave i know he kissed her cheek the person in the car what she looked at him i dont care any more i dont care who they were or whether they get caught all i want is for her to wake up rebus nodded told her he understood told her breakfast was on him he kept the talk going his mind not really on it instead her words bounced around in his head i dont care who they were or whether they get caught whichever stress he put on it he couldnt make it sound like surrender at st leonards he broke the news to ned farlowe farlowe wanted to go to the hospital but rebus shook his head farlowe was crying as rebus left his cell back at his desk the files on the crab were waiting the crab real name william andrew colton he had form going back to his teens celebrated his fortieth birthday on guy fawkes day rebus hadnt had many dealings with him during his time in edinburgh looked like the crab had lived in the city for a couple of years in the earlys and again in the earlys rebus gave evidence against him in a conspiracy trial charges dropped he was in trouble again a fight in a pub left one man in a coma and his girlfriend needing sixty stitches to her face sixty stitches you could knit a pair of mittens with less the crab had held various jobs bouncer bodyguard general labourer the inland revenue had a go at him in by he was on the west coast which was presumably where tommy telford had found him knowing good muscle when he saw it hed put the crab on the doors of his club in paisley more bloodspilling more accusations nothing came of them the crab had lived a charmed life the sort of life that niggled at cops the world over witnesses too scared to testify withdrawing or refusing to give evidence the crab didnt often make it to trial hed served three adult sentences a total of twentyseven months in a career that was now entering its fourth decade rebus went through the paperwork again picked up the phone and called cid in paisley the man he wanted to speak to had been transferred to motherwell rebus made the call eventually got through to detective sergeant ronnie hannigan and explained his interest its just that reading between the lines you suspected the crab of a lot more than ever got put down on paper youre right hannigan cleared his throat never got close to proving anything though you say hes south of the border now telford placed him with a gangster in newcastle have criminal tendencies will travel well lets hope they keep him he was a oneman reign of terror and thats no exaggeration probably why telford palmed him off on someone else the crab was getting out of control my theory is telford tried him out as a hitman crab wasnt suitable so telford needed to jettison him what was the hit down in ayr mustve been four years ago lot of drugs swilling around most of them inside a danceclub cant remember its name i dont know what happened maybe a deal went sour maybe someone was skimming whatever there was a hit outside the club guy got his face half torn off with a carving knife you put the crab in the frame he had an alibi of course and the eyewitnesses all seemed to have suffered temporary blindness could be a plot for the xfiles in that a knife attack outside a nightclub rebus tapped his desk with a pen any idea how the attacker got away on a motorbike the crab likes bikes crash helmet makes a good disguise we had an almost identical attack recently guy on a motorbike went for a drug dealer outside one of tommy telfords nightclubs killed a bouncer instead and cafferty denied any involvement well like you say the crabs in newcastle yes and staying put scared to come north warned off by tarawicz because edinburgh was too dangerous people might remember him do you know how far away newcastle is a couple of hours no distance at all by bike anything else i should know well telford tried the crab in the van but he wasnt much good what van the icecream van rebus nearly dropped the phone explain he said easy telfords boys were selling dope from an icecream van the fivepound special they called it you handed over a fiver and got back a cone or wafer with a wee plastic bag tucked inside rebus thanked hannigan and terminated the call fivepound specials mr taystee with his clients who ate icecream in all weathers his daytime pitches near schools his nighttime pitches outside telfords clubs fivepound specials on the menu telford taking his cut the new merc mr taystees big mistake telfords moneymen wouldnt have taken long to work out their boy was skimming telford would have decided to turn mr taystee into a lesson it was coming together he spun his pen caught it and made another call this time to newcastle nice to hear from you miriam kenworthy said any sign of your lady friend shes turned up here great in tow with mr pink eyes not so great i wondered where hed gone and hes not here to see the sights ill bet he isnt which is really why im calling mmm im just wondering if hes ever been linked to machete attacks machetes let me think she was so quiet for so long he thought the connection had failed you know that does ring a bell let me put it up on the screen clacketyclack of her keyboard rebus was biting his bottom lip almost drawing blood god yes she said a year or so back a battle on an estate rival gangs that was the story but everyone knew what was behind it namely drugs and pitch incursions and where theres drugs theres tarawicz there was a rumour his men were involved and they used machetes one of them did his names patrick kenneth moynihan known to all and sundry as pk can you give me a description i can fax you his picture but meantime tall heavy build curly black hair and a black beard he wasnt part of the tarawicz retinue two of mr pinks best musclemen had been left behind in newcastle for safetys sake rebus pint pk down as one of the paisley attackers cafferty again in the clear thanks miriam listen about that rumour remind me telford supplying tarawicz rather than the other way round anything to back it up we tracked pink eyes and his men a couple of jaunts to the continent only they came back clean leading you up the garden path which made us start reassessing where would telford be getting the stuff we didnt reassess that far well thanks again hey dont leave me hanging whats the story morning glory cheers miriam rebus went and got a coffee put sugar in it without realising had finished half the cup before he noticed tarawicz was attacking telford telford was blaming cafferty the resulting war would destroy cafferty and weaken telford then telford would pull off the macleans breakin but be grassed up and tarawicz would fill the vacuum that had been the plan all along bluesbreakers doublecrossing time christ it was beautiful set the two rivals against one another and wait for the carnage to end the prize something rebus didnt yet know there had to be something big tarawicz the theory went was sourcing his drugs not from london but from scotland from tommy telford what did telford know what was it that made his supply so valuable did it have something to do with macleans rebus got another coffee washed down three paracetamol with it his head felt ready to explode back at his desk he tried claverhouse couldnt get him paged him instead and got an immediate call back im in the van claverhouse said ive something to tell you what rebus wanted to know what was happening wanted in on the action its got to be face to face where are you parked claverhouse sounded suspicious down from the shop white decorators van this definitely isnt a good idea you want to hear what ive got sell me the idea it clears everything up rebus lied claverhouse waited for more but rebus wasnt obliging theatrical sigh life was hard on claverhouse ill be there in half an hour rebus said he put down the phone looked around the office anyone got a set of overalls nice disguise claverhouse said as rebus squeezed into the front seat ormiston was in the drivers seat plastic piecebox open in front of him a flask of tea had been opened steaming up the windscreen the back of the van was full of painttins brushes and other paraphernalia a ladder was strapped to the roof and another was leaning against the wall of the tenement beside which the van had been parked claverhouse and ormiston were in white overalls daubed with swatches of old paint the best rebus could come up with was a blue boilersuit tight at the waist and chest he pulled the first few studs open as he settled in anything happening jacks been in twice this morning claverhouse looked towards the shop once for ciggies and a paper once for a can of juice and a filled roll he doesnt smoke he does for this operation perfect excuse to nip to the shop he hasnt given you any signal you expecting him to put the flags out ormiston exhaled fishpaste just asking rebus checked his watch either of you want a break were fine claverhouse said whats siobhan up to paperwork ormiston said with a smile ever come across a woman house painter done much house painting yourself ormie this brought a smile from claverhouse so john he said what is it youve got for us rebus filled them in quickly noting claverhouses mounting interest so tarawicz is planning to doublecross telford ormiston said at the end rebus shrugged thats my guess then why the hell are we bothering to set up a sting just let them get on with it that wouldnt give us tarawicz claverhouse said his eyes slitted in concentration if he sets up telford for a fall hes home and dry telford gets put away and all weve done is replace one villain with another and an altogether nastier species at that rebus said what and telfords robin hood no but at least with him we know what were dealing with and the old dears in his flats love him claverhouse said rebus thought of mrs hetherington readying herself for her trip to holland the only drawback she had to fly from inverness sakiji shoda had flown from london to inverness rebus started laughing whats so funny he shook his head still laughing wiping his eyes it wasnt funny not really we could let telford know what we know claverhouse said studying rebus set him against tarawicz let them eat each other alive rebus nodded took a deep breath thats certainly one option give me another later rebus said he opened the door where are you off to claverhouse asked got to fly but in fact he was driving a long drive too north through perth and from there into the highlands taking a route which could be cut off during the worst of the winter it wasnt a bad road but traffic was heavy hed get past one slowmoving lorry only to catch up with another he knew he should be thankful for small mercies in the summer caravans could end up fronting milelong tailbacks he did pass a couple of caravans outside pitlochry they were from the netherlands mrs hetherington had said it was out of season for a trip to holland most people her age would go in the spring ready to fill their senses with the bulbfields but not mrs hetherington telfords offer go when i say telford probably provided spending money too told her to have a good time not worry about a thing as he neared inverness rebus hit dual carriageway again hed been on the road well over two hours sammy might be coming round again rhona had his mobile number inverness airport was signposted from the road into town rebus parked and got out stretched his legs and arched his back feeling the vertebrae pop he went into the terminal and asked for security he got a small balding man with glasses and a limp rebus introduced himself the man offered coffee but rebus was jumpy enough after the drive hungry though no lunch he gave the man his story and eventually they tracked down a representative of her majestys customs during his tour of the facilities rebus got the impression of a lowkey operation the customs official was in her earlythirties rosycheeked and with black curly hair there was a purple birthmark the size of a small coin in the middle of her forehead looking for all the world like a third eye she took rebus into the customs area and found a room they could use for their conversation theyve just started direct international flights she said in answer to his question its shocking really why because at the same time theyve cut back on manpower you mean in customs she nodded youre worried about drugs of course she paused and everything else are there flights to amsterdam there will be but as of now she shrugged you can fly to london make the connection there rebus was thoughtful there was a guy a few days ago flew from japan to heathrow then got a flight to inverness did he stop off in london rebus shook his head caught the first connection that counts as an international connection meaning his luggage would be put on the plane in japan and he wouldnt see it again until inverness so youd be the first customs point she nodded and if his flight came in at some horrible hour she shrugged again we do what we can inspector yes rebus could imagine a lone blearyeyed customs official wits not at their sharpest so the bags change planes at heathrow but no one checks them there thats about it and if you were flying from holland to inverness via london same deal rebus knew now knew the brilliance of tommy telfords thinking he was supplying drugs for tarawicz and christ knew how many others his little old ladies and men were bringing them in past earlymorning or latenight customs posts how difficult would it be to slip something into a piece of luggage then telfords men would be on hand to take everyone back to edinburgh carry their luggage upstairs and surreptitiously remove each package old age pensioners as unwitting drugs couriers it was stunning and shoda hadnt flown into inverness so he could check out the local tourist amenities hed flown in so he could see how easy it was what a brilliant route telford had found quick and efficient with a minimum of risk rebus had to laugh again the highlands had its own drugs problem these days bored teenagers and cashrich oilworkers rebus had smashed one northeast ring back in early summer only to have tommy telford come along cafferty would never have thought of it cafferty would never have been so daring but cafferty would have kept it quiet he wouldnt have sought to expand wouldnt have brought partners into the scheme telford was still a kid in some respects the passengerseat teddy bear was proof of that rebus thanked the customs official and went in search of food parked in the middle of town and grabbed a burger sat at a window table and thought it all through there were still aspects that didnt make sense but he could cope with that he made two calls one to the hospital one to bobby hogan sammy hadnt woken up again hogan was interviewing prettyboy at seven oclock rebus said hed be there the weather was kind on the trip south the traffic manageable the saab seemed to enjoy long drives or maybe it was just that at seventy miles an hour the engine noise disguised all the rattles and bumps he drove straight to leith copshop looked at his watch and found he was quarter of an hour late which didnt matter since they were just starting the interview prettyboy was there with charles groal allpurpose solicitor hogan was sitting with another cid officer dc james preston a taperecorder had been set up hogan looked nervous realising how speculative this whole venture was especially with a lawyer present rebus gave him a reassuring wink and apologised for having been detained the burger had given him indigestion and the coffee hed had with it had done nothing for his frayed nerves he had to shake his head clear of inverness and all its implications and concentrate on prettyboy and joseph lintz prettyboy looked calm he was wearing a charcoal suit with a yellow tshirt black suede winklepicker boots he smelt of expensive aftershave in front of him on the desk a pair of tortoiseshell raybans and his car keys rebus knew hed own a range rover it was mandatory for telford employees but the keyring boasted the porsche marque and on the street outside rebus had parked behind a cobalt blue prettyboy showing a touch of individuality groal had his briefcase open on the floor beside him on the desk in front of him an a pad of ruled paper and a fat black mont blanc pen lawyer and client oozed money easily made and just as easily spent prettyboy used his money to buy class but rebus knew his background workingclass paisley a granitehard introduction to life hogan identified those present for the benefit of the taperecorder then looked at his own notes mr summers prettyboys real name brian summers do you know why youre here prettyboy made an o of his glossy lips and stared ceilingwards mr summers charles groal began has informed me that he is willing to cooperate inspector hogan but that hed like some indication of the accusations against him and their validity hogan stared at groal didnt blink who said hes accused of anything inspector mr summers works for thomas telford and your police forces harassment of that individual is on record nothing to do with me mr groal or this station hogan paused nothing at all to do with my present inquiries groal blinked half a dozen times in quick succession he looked at prettyboy who was now studying the tips of his boots you want me to say something prettyboy asked the lawyer im just im not sure if prettyboy cut him off with a wave of his hand then looked at hogan ask away hogan made show of studying his notes again do you know why youre here mr summers general vilification as part of your witchhunt against my employer he smiled at the three cid men bet you didnt think id know a word like vilification his gaze rested on rebus then he turned to groal di rebus isnt based at this station groal took the hint thats true inspector might i ask by what authority youve been allowed to sit in on this interview that will become clear hogan said if youll allow us to begin groal cleared his throat but said nothing hogan let the silence lie for a few moments then began mr summers do you know a man called joseph lintz no the silence stretched out summers recrossed his feet he looked up at hogan and blinked the blink deteriorating into a momentary twitch of one eye he sniffed rubbed at his nose trying to make out that the twitch meant nothing youve never met him no the name means nothing to you youve asked me about him before ill tell you same as i told you then i never knew the cat summers sat up a bit straighter in his chair youve never spoken to him by telephone summers looked at groal hasnt my client made himself clear inspector id like an answer i dont know him summers said forcing himself to relax again ive never spoken to him he gave hogan his stare again and this time held it there was nothing behind the eyes but naked self interest rebus wondered how anyone could ever think him pretty when his whole outlook on life was so fundamentally ugly he didnt phone you at your business premises i dont have any business premises the office you share with your employer prettyboy smiled he liked those phrases business premises your employer they all knew the truth yet played this little game and he liked playing games ive already said i never spoke to him funny the phone company says differently maybe they made a mistake i doubt that mr summers look weve been through this before summers sat forward in his chair maybe it was a wrong number maybe he spoke to one of my associates and they told him he had a wrong number he opened his arms this is going nowhere i agree with my client inspector charles groal said scribbling something down i mean is this leading anywhere its leading mr groal to an identification of mr summers where and by whom in a restaurant with mr lintz the same mr lintz he claims never to have met never to have spoken to rebus saw hesitation cross prettyboys face hesitation rather than surprise he made no immediate denial an identification made by a member of staff at the restaurant hogan continued corroborated by another diner groal looked to his client who wasnt saying anything but the way he was staring at the table rebus wondered a smoking hole didnt start appearing in it well groal went on this is fairly irregular inspector hogan wasnt interested in the lawyer it was prettyboy and him now what about it mr summers care to revise your version of events what were you talking about with mr lintz was he looking for female company i believe thats your particular area of expertise inspector i must insist insist away mr groal it wont change the facts im just wondering what mr summers will say in court when hes asked about the phone call the meeting when the witnesses identify him im sure hes got a fund of stories but hell have to find a bloody good one summers slapped the desk with both palms halfrose to his feet there wasnt an ounce of fat on him veins stood out on the backs of his hands i told you ive never met him never talked to him period end of story finito and if youve got witnesses theyre lying maybe youve told them to lie and thats all ive got to say he sat back down put his hands in his pockets ive heard rebus said as though attempting to liven up a flagging conversation between friends that you run the more upmarket girls the threefigure jobs rather than the gamandbam merchants summers snorted and shook his head inspector groal said i cant allow these accusations to continue was that what lintz wanted did he have expensive tastes summers continued shaking his head he seemed about to say something but caught himself laughed instead i would like to remind you groal went on unheeded by anyone that my client has cooperated fully throughout this outrageous rebus caught prettyboys eyes held their stare there was so much he wasnt telling so much he very nearly wanted to tell rebus thought of the length of rope in lintzs house he liked to tie them up didnt he rebus asked quietly groal stood up yanking summers to his feet brian rebus asked thank you gentlemen groal said he was stuffing his notepad into his case closing its brass locks if you should find yourselves with any questions worth my clients time well be pleased to assist but otherwise id advise you to brian pc preston had turned off the tape recorder and gone to open the door summers picked up his car keys slipped his sunglasses on gentlemen he said its been educational s ampm rebus persisted getting in prettyboys face did he tie them up prettyboy snorted shook his head again he paused as his lawyer led him past rebus it was for him he said in an undertone it was for him rebus drove to the hospital sat with sammy for twenty minutes twenty minutes of meditation and headclearing twenty reviving minutes at the end of which he squeezed his daughters hand thanks for that he said back at the flat he thought of ignoring the answeringmachine until after hed had a bath his shoulders and back were aching from the drive to inverness but something made him press the button jack mortons voice im on for a meeting with tt lets meet after halften at the ox ill aim for that but cant promise wish me luck he walked in at eleven there was folk music in the back room the front would have been quiet if it werent for two loudmouths who looked like theyd been at it since their office closed for the night they still wore worksuits newspapers rolled in their pockets they were drinking g ampt rebus asked jack morton what he wanted a pint of orange and lemonade so how did it go rebus ordered the drink in forty minutes hed managed to put away two cokes and was now on coffee they seem keen so who was at the meeting my sponsors from the shop plus telford and a couple of his men the transmitter worked okay sound as a pound did they search you morton shook his head they were sloppy seemed really sweaty about something want to hear the plan rebus nodded middle of the night truck arrives at the factory and i let it through the gates my story is i had a phone call from the boss okaying the delivery so i wasnt suspicious only your boss never made the call thats right so i was duped by a voice and thats all i need to tell the police wed sweat the truth out of you like i say john the whole plans halfbaked ill give them this though they did check my background seemed satisfied whos going to be in the truck ten men armed to the teeth im to get a rough plan of the place to telford tomorrow let him know how many people will be around what the alarm systems like whats in it for you five grand hes judged that right five gets my debts repaid and puts a wedge in my pocket five grand the amount joseph lintz had taken out of his bank your storys holding theyve staked out my flat and they didnt follow you here morton shook his head and rebus filled him in on what hed learned and what he suspected while morton was taking it in rebus threw a question at him how does claverhouse want to play it the tape evidence is good telford talking me making sure i called him mr telford and tommy a few times its obviously him on the recording but claverhouse wants telfords crew caught redhanded got to do it right that seems to be his catchphrase is there a date saturday all being well whats the betting we get a tipoff on friday if your theorys right if im right he agreed the tipoff didnt come until saturday lunchtime but when it did rebus knew his hunch had been right claverhouse was the first to congratulate him which surprised rebus because claverhouse had a lot on his plate and had acted very casually when the call had come pinned to the walls of the crime squad office were detailed maps of the drugs plant along with staff rosters coloured stickers showed where personnel would be stationed during the night it was security only unless some big order was demanding overtime tonight the usual security staff would be augmented by lothian amp borders police twenty people inside the plant with marksmen stationed on roofs and at certain key windows a dozen cars and vans as backup it was the biggest operation of claverhouses career a lot was expected of him he kept saying it has to be done right he said he would leave nothing to chance those two phrases had become his mantra rebus had listened to a recording of the snitch call be at macleans factory in slateford tonight two in the morning its going to be turned over ten men tooled up driving a lorry if youre canny you can catch all of them scots accent but sounding long distance rebus smiled looked at the turning spools and said hello again crab out loud no mention of telford which was interesting telfords men were loyal theyd go down without saying a word and tarawicz wasnt grassing up telford he couldnt know the police already had taped evidence of telfords involvement which meant he was planning on letting telford go no think it through with the plan dead in the water and ten of his best men in custody tarawicz didnt need telford under lock and key he wanted him out in the open and worried yakuza breathing down his neck all his frailties exposed he could be picked off at any time or made to hand over everything no bloodletting required it would be a simple business proposition it has to be done right rebus said claverhouse we know okay claverhouse lost it youre only here because i tolerate you so lets get that straight for a start i snap my fingers and youre out of the game understood rebus just stared at him a line of sweat was running down claverhouses left temple ormiston was looking up from his desk siobhan clarke briefing another officer beside a wallchart stopped talking i promise ill be a good boy rebus said quietly if youll promise to stop with the broken record routine claverhouses jaw was working but eventually he produced a nearsmile of apology lets get on with it then not that there was much for them to do jack morton was working a double shift wouldnt start till three oclock theyd be watching the place from then on just in case telford changed the gameplan this meant personnel were going to miss the big match hibs against hearts at easter road rebus had his money on a home win ormistons summingup easiest quid youll ever lose rebus retired to one of the computers and got back to work siobhan clarke had already come round snooping writing it up for one of the tabloids no such luck he tried to keep it simple and when he was happy with the finished product he printed off two copies then he went out to buy a couple of nice bright folders he dropped off one of the folders then returned home too restless to be much use at fettes three men were waiting in his tenement stairwell two more came in behind him blocking the only escape route rebus recognised jake tarawicz and one of his musclemen from the scrapyard the others were new to him up the stairs tarawicz ordered rebus was a prisoner under escort as they climbed the steps unlock the door if id known you were coming id have got in some beers rebus said searching his pockets for keys he was wondering which was safer let them in or keep them out tarawicz made the decision for him nodded some signal rebuss arms were grabbed hands went into his jacket and trousers found his keys he kept his face blank eyes on tarawicz big mistake he said in tarawicz ordered they pushed rebus into the hallway walked him to the living room sit hands pushed rebus on to the sofa at least let me make a pot of tea he said inside he was trembling knowing everything he couldnt afford to give away nice place mr pink eyes was saying lacks the feminine touch though he turned to rebus where is she two of the men had peeled off to search the place who i mean who else would she turn to not your daughter not now shes in a coma rebus stared at him what do you know about that the two men returned shook their heads i hear things tarawicz pulled out a diningchair and sat down there were two men behind the sofa two in front make yourselves at home lads wheres the crab jake reasoning a question he might be expected to ask down south whats it to you rebus shrugged shame about your daughter going to make a recovery is she rebus didnt answer tarawicz smiled national health service i wouldnt trust it myself he paused where is she rebus using my finely honed detectives skills ill assume you mean candice meaning shed done a runner trusting to herself for once rebus was proud of her tarawicz snapped his fingers arms grabbed rebus from behind pinning back his shoulders one man stepped forward and punched him solidly on the jaw stepped back again second man forward gut punches a hand tugged his hair forcing his eyes up to the ceiling he didnt see the flathanded chop aiming for his throat when it came he thought he was going to cough out his voicebox they let him go and he pitched forward hands going to his throat retching for breath a couple of teeth felt loose and the skin inside his cheek had burst he got out a handkerchief spat blood unfortunately tarawicz was saying i have no sense of humour so i hope youll understand im not joking when i say that ill kill you if i have to rebus shook his head free of all the secrets he knew all the power he held over tarawicz he told himself you dont know anything he told himself youre not going to die even if i did know fighting for breath i wouldnt tell you if the two of us were standing in a minefield i wouldnt let you know want me to tell you why sticks and stones rebus its not because of who you are its what you are you trade in human beings rebus dabbed at his mouth youre no better than the nazis tarawicz put a hand to his chest im struck to the quick chance would be a fine thing rebus coughed again tell me why do you want her back rebus knowing the answer because he was about to head south leaving telford in shit street because to return to newcastle without her was a small but palpable defeat tarawicz wanted it all he wanted every last crumb on the plate my business tarawicz said another signal and the hands grabbed him again rebus resisting this time packingtape was being wound around his mouth everybody tells me how genteel edinburgh is tarawicz was saying cant have the neighbours complaining about the screams put him on a chair rebus was lifted up he struggled a kidney punch buckled his knees they forced him down on to a diningchair tarawicz was removing his jacket undoing gold cufflinks so he could roll up the sleeves of his pink and blue striped shirt his arms were hairless thick and the same mottled colour as his face a skin complaint he explained removing his bluetinted glasses some distant cousin of leprosy they tell me he loosened his top button im not as pretty as tommy telford but i think youll find me his master in every other respect a smile to his troops a smile rebus wasnt supposed to understand we can start anywhere you want rebus and you get to choose when we stop just nod your head tell me where she is and i walk out of your life forever he got in close to rebus the sheen on his face like a protective seal his pale blue eyes had tiny black pupils rebus thought consumer as well as pusher tarawicz waited for a nod which didnt come then retreated found an anglepoise lamp next to rebuss chair planted both feet on its base and yanked on the mains cable ripping it free bring him over here he ordered two men pulled both rebus and chair over towards where tarawicz was checking that the cable was plugged into the wall and that the socket was switched on another man closed the curtains no free show for the kids across the way tarawicz was dangling the cable letting rebus see the loose wires the very live wires twohundredandforty volts just waiting to make his acquaintance believe me tarawicz said this is nothing the serbs had torture down to a fine art much of the time they werent even looking for a confession ive helped a few of the more intelligent ones the ones who knew when it was time to run there was money to be made in the early days power for the taking now the politicians are moving in bringing trialjudges with them he looked at rebus the intelligent ones always know when its time to quit one last chance rebus remember a nod of the head the wires were inches from his cheek tarawicz changed his mind moved them towards his nostrils then his eyeballs a nod of the head rebus was twisting arms holding him down his legs arms shoulders hands holding his head chest wait the shock would pass straight through tarawiczs men rebus saw it for a bluff his eyes met tarawiczs and they both knew tarawicz pulled back tape him to the chair twoinchwide runs of tape fixing him in place this time for real rebus to his men hold him till i get close pull away when i say rebus thinking thered be a splitsecond after they let go a moment in which to break free the tape wasnt the strongest hed seen but there was plenty of it maybe too much he flexed his chest against it felt no sign that it would break here we go tarawicz said first the face then the genitals you mill tell me we both know it how much bravado you want to show is up to you but dont think it means anything rebus said something behind the gag no point talking tarawicz said the only thing i want from you is a nod understood rebus nodded was that a nod forcing a smile rebus shook his head tarawicz didnt look impressed his mind was on business that was all rebus was to him he aimed the wire at rebuss cheek let go the pressure on rebus fell away he pushed against his bonds couldnt budge them electricity flashed through his nervous system and he went rigid his heart felt like it had doubled in size his eyeballs bulged tongue pushing against the gag tarawicz lifted the cable away hold him arms fell on rebus again finding less resistance than before doesnt even leave a mark tarawicz said and the real beauty is you end up paying for it from your own electric bill his men laughed they were beginning to enjoy themselves tarawicz crouched down face to face his eyes sought rebuss for your information that was a fivesecond jolt things only start to get interesting at the halfminute mark hows your heart for your sake i hope its in good condition rebus felt like hed just mainlined adrenaline five seconds it had seemed much longer he was changing strategies trying to think up some new lies mr pink might believe anything to get him out of the flat undo his trousers tarawicz was saying lets see what a jolt down there will do behind the gag rebus started screaming his tormentor was looking around the room again definitely lacks the feminine touch hands were loosening his trouserbelt they stopped when a buzzer sounded there was someone at the main door just wait tarawicz said quietly theyll go away the buzzer sounded again rebus wrestled with his bonds silence then the buzzer again more insistent now one of the men went for the window dont tarawicz snapped buzzer again rebus hoped it would go on forever couldnt think who it might be rhona patience a sudden thought what if they persisted and tarawicz decided to allow them inside rhona or patience time stretched no more buzzing theyd gone away tarawicz was beginning to relax focusing his mind on his work once more then there was a knock at the flat door the person had got into the tenement now they were on the landing outside knocking again lifting the flap of the letterbox rebus a male voice tarawicz looked to his men nodded another signal curtains were opened rebuss bonds cut the tape ripped from his face tarawicz rolled down his sleeves put his jacket back on left the flex lying on the floor one last word to rebus well speak again then he marched his men to the door opened it excuse us rebus was left sitting on the chair he couldnt move felt too shaky to stand up hang on a minute chief rebus placed the voice abernethy it didnt sound as if tarawicz was heeding the special branch man whats the score now abernethy was in the livingroom looking around business meeting rebus croaked abernethy came forward funny old business where you have to unzip your flies rebus looked down started to make repairs who was that abernethy persisted a chechen from newcastle likes to travel mobhanded does he abernethy walked around the room found the bare flex and tuttutted unplugged it at the socket fun and games he said dont worry rebus told him its under control abernethy laughed what do you want anyway brought someone to see you he nodded towards the doorway a distinguishedlooking man was standing there dressed in three quarterlength black woollen coat and white silk scarf he was completely bald with a huge dome of a head and cheeks reddened from cold he had a sniffle and was wiping his nose with a handkerchief thought we might pop out somewhere the man said locution impeccable his eyes everywhere but on rebus get a spot to eat if youre hungry im not rebus said something to drink then theres whisky in the kitchen the man looked reluctant look pal rebus told him im staying right here you can join me or you can bugger off i see the man said he put the handkerchief away and stepped forward stretched out a hand names harris by the way rebus took the hand expecting sparks to leap from his fingertips mr harris lets sit at the diningtable rebus got to his feet he was shaky but his knees held till hed crossed the floor abernethy appeared from the kitchen with the bottle and three glasses left again and returned with a milkjug of water ever the host rebus poured sizing up the trembling in his right arm he felt disoriented adrenaline and electricity coursing through him slainte he said lifting the glass but he paused with it at his nostrils pact with the big man no drinking and sammy back his throat hurt when he swallowed but he put the glass down untouched harris was pouring too much water into his own glass even abernethy looked disapproving so mr harris rebus said rubbing his throat just who the hell are you harris affected a smile he was playing with his glass im a member of the intelligence community inspector i know what that probably conjures up in your mind but im afraid the reality is far more prosaic intelligencegathering means just that lots of paperwork and filing and youre here because of joseph lintz im here because di abernethy says youre determined to link the murder of joseph lintz with the various accusations which have been made against him and and that of course is your prerogative but there are matters not necessarily germane which might prove embarrassing if brought into the open such as that lintz really was linzstek and was brought to this country by the rat line probably with help from the vatican as to whether lintz and linzstek were the same man i cant tell you a lot of the documentation was destroyed just after the war but joseph lintz was brought to this country by the allies yes and why did we do that lintz was useful to this country inspector rebus poured a fresh whisky for abernethy harris hadnt touched his how useful he was a reputable academic as such he was invited to attend conferences and give guest lectures all round the world during this time he did some work for us translation intelligencegathering recruitment he recruited people in other countries rebus stared at harris he was a spy he did some dangerous and influential work for this country and got his reward the house in heriot row he earned every penny in the early days harriss tone told rebus something what happened he became unreliable harris lifted the glass to his nose sniffed it but put it down again untouched drink it before it evaporates abernethy chided harris looked at him and the londoner mumbled an apology define unreliable rebus said pushing aside his own glass he began to fantasise he thought a colleague at the university had been in the rat line harris was nodding he became obsessed with the rat line began to imagine that everyone around him had been involved in it that we were all culpable paranoia inspector it affected his work and eventually we had to let him go this was years back he hasnt worked for us since so why the interest what does it matter if any of this comes out harris sighed youre right of course the problem is not the rat line per se or the notion of vatican involvement or any of the other conspiracy theories then what is rebus broke off realised the truth the problem is the personnel he stated the other people brought in by the rat line he nodded to himself who are we talking about who might be implicated senior figures harris admitted hed stopped playing with the glass his hands were flat on the table he was telling rebus this is serious past or present past plus people whose children have gone on to achieve positions of power mps government ministers judges harris was shaking his head i cant tell you inspector i havent been trusted with that knowledge myself but you could hazard a guess i dont deal in guesswork he looked at rebus there was steel behind the eyes i deal in known quantities its a good maxim one you should try but whoever killed lintz did so because of his past are you sure it doesnt make sense otherwise di abernethy tells me theres a link with some criminal elements in edinburgh perhaps a question of prostitution it all sounds sordid enough to be believable and if its believable thats good enough for you harris stood up thank you for listening he blew his nose again looked to abernethy time to go i believe di hogan is waiting for us harris rebus said you said yourself lintz had gone loopy become a liability whos to say you didnt have him killed harris shrugged if wed arranged it his demise would not have been quite so obvious car crash suicide falling from a window goodbye inspector as harris walked to the door abernethy stood up and locked eyes with rebus he didnt say anything but the message was there this is deeper water than either of us wants to be in so do yourself a favour swim for shore rebus nodded reached out a hand the two men shook two in the morning frost on the car windscreens they couldnt clear them had to blend in with the other cars on the street backup four units parked in a builders yard just round the corner bulbs had been removed from streetlights leaving the area in almost total darkness macleans was like a christmas tree security lights every window blazing same as every other night no heating in the unmarked cars heat would melt the frost exhaust fumes a dead giveaway this all seems very familiar siobhan clarke said the surveillance on flint street seemed a lifetime ago to rebus clarke was in the driving seat rebus in the back two to each car that way they had space to duck should anyone come snooping not that they expected anyone to do that the whole heist was halfbaked telford desperate and with his mind on other things sakiji shoda was still in town a quiet word with the hotel manager had revealed a monday morning checkout rebus was betting tarawicz and his men had already gone you look pretty snug rebus said referring to her padded skijacket she brought a hand out of her pocket showed him what it was holding it looked like a slim lighter rebus lifted it from her palm it was warm what the hell is it clarke smiled i got it from one of those catalogues its a handwarmer how does it work fuel rods each one lasts up to twelve hours so youve got one warm hand she brought her other hand out showed him an identical rod i bought two she said you might have said rebus closed his fingers around the handwarmer stuck it deep into his pocket thats not fair call it a privilege of rank lights she warned they dived for cover surfaced again when the car had sped past false alarm rebus checked his watch jack morton had been told to expect the truck some time between onethirty and twofifteen rebus and clarke had been in the car since just after midnight the snipers on the roof poor bastards had been in position since one oclock rebus hoped they had a good supply of fuel rods he still felt jittery from the afternoons events he didnt like that he owed abernethy such a huge favour indeed maybe owed him his life he knew he could cancel it out by agreeing along with hogan to softpedal on the lintz inquiry he didnt like the idea but all the same and the days silver lining candice had made the break from tarawicz clarkes police radio was silent they had maintained silence since before midnight claverhouses words the first person to speak will be me understood anyone uses a radio before me theyre in farmyard shit and i wont utter a sound until the trucks entered the compound is that clear nods all around they could be listening in so this is important weve got to do this right averting his eyes from rebus as he said it id wish us all luck but the less lucks involved the better ill like it a few hours from now if we stick to the plan we should have broken up tommy telfords gang he paused just let that sink in well be heroes he swallowed realising the immensity of the prize rebus couldnt get so excited the whole enterprise had shown him a simple truth no vacuum where you had society you had criminals no belly without an underbelly rebus knew his own criteria came cheaply his flat books music and clappedout car and he realised that he had reduced his life to a mere shell in recognition that he had completely failed at the important things love relationships family life hed been accused of being in thrall to his career but that had never been the case his work sustained him only because it was an easy option he dealt every day with strangers with people who didnt mean anything to him in the wider scheme he could enter their lives and leave again just as easily he got to live other peoples lives or at least portions of them experiencing things at one remove which wasnt nearly as challenging as the real thing sammy had brought home to him these essential truths that he was not only a failed father but a failed human being that police work kept him sane yet was a substitute for the life he could have had the kind of life everyone else seemed to lead and if he became obsessed with his casework well that was no different from being obsessed with train numbers or cigarette cards or rock albums obsession came easy especially to men because it was a cheap way of achieving control albeit control over something practically worthless what did it matter if you could reel off the track listing to every s stones album it didnt matter a damn what did it matter if tommy telford got put away tarawicz would take his place and if he didnt there was always big ger cafferty and if not cafferty then someone else the disease was endemic no cure in sight what are you thinking about clarke asked switching her rod from left hand to right my next cigarette patiences words happiest when in denial they heard the truck before they saw it changing gears noisily slid down into their seats then up again as it made to pull into macleans a wheeze of airbrakes as it jolted to a stop at the gates a guard came out to talk to the driver he carried a clipboard jack really suits a uniform rebus said clothes maketh the man you reckon your boss has got it right he meant claverhouses plan when the truck was in the compound theyd use a megaphone and show the marksmen to whoever was in the drivers cab tell them to come out the rest of the men could stay locked in the back of the vehicle theyd have them toss out any arms and then come out one at a time it was either that or wait until they were all out of the truck merit of this second plan theyd know what they were dealing with merit of the first most of the gang would be nicely stowed in the truck and could be dealt with as and when claverhouse had plumped for plan one marked and unmarked cars were to move in as soon as the truck had come to a stop engine off in the compound they would block the exit then watch from safety while claverhouse at a firstfloor window with his megaphone and the marksmen roof ground floor windows did their stuff negotiation with force was how claverhouse had described it jacks opening the gates rebus said peering through the side window engine roar and the truck jerked forward driver seems a bit nervous clarke commented or isnt used to hgvs okay theyre in rebus stared at the radio willing it to burst into life clarke had turned the ignition one click away from starting jack morton was watching the truck move into the compound he turned his head towards the line of cars parked across the way any second the trucks brakelights came on then went off again airbrakes sounded the radio fizzed a single word nom clarke turned the engine revved hard five other cars did the same exhaust smoke billowed suddenly into the night air the noise was like the start of a stockcar race rebus wound his window down the better to hear claverhouses megaphone diplomacy clarkes car leaped forward first to the gates both she and rebus jumped out keeping their heads down the car a shield between themselves and the truck engines still running rebus hissed what the truck its engines still running claverhouses voice warbling partly nerves partly megaphone quality armed police open the cab doors slowly and come out one at a time hands held high i repeat armed police discard weapons before coming out i repeat discard weapons do it rebus hissed then tell them to switch off the bloody engine claverhouse the gate is blocked theres no escape and we dont want anyone getting hurt tell them to throw out the keys cursing rebus dived back into the car grabbed the handset claverhouse tell them to ditch the bloody keys windscreen frosted over he couldnt see a thing heard clarkes yell get out saw dim white lights the truck was reversing at speed a roar from its engine veering crazily but heading for the gates heading straight for him an explosion bricks flying from the factorys front wall rebus dropped the handset got his arm stuck in the seatbelt clarke was screaming as he leaped clear a second later truck and car connected in a rending of metal and smashing of glass domino effect clarkes car hit the one behind throwing officers off balance the road was like a skating rink the truck pushing one car two cars then three cars back on to the highway claverhouse was on the megaphone choking on dust no shooting officers too close officers too close yes all they needed now was to be pinned down by sniper fire men and women were slipping losing their footing clambering from their cars some of them armed but dazed the trucks back doors buckled by the initial collision flew open seven or eight men hit the ground running two of them had handguns and loosed off three or four shots apiece shouts screams the megaphone the glass wall of the gatehouse exploded as a bullet hit it rebus couldnt see jack morton couldnt see siobhan he was lying on his front on a section of grass verge hands over his head classic defencedefeat posture and bloody useless with it the whole area was picked out by floodlights and one of the gunmen declan from the shop was now aiming at those other members of the gang had headed out into the street and were running for it they carried shotguns pickaxe handles rebus recognised a few more faces ally cornwell deek mcgrain the streetlights were dead of course giving them all the cover they could want rebus hoped the backup cars from the builders yard were coming yes turning the corner now all lights blazing sirens howling tenement curtains were twitching palms rubbing at windows and right in front of rebus about an inch from his nose a thickly rimed blade of grass he could make out each sliver of frost and the complex patterns which had formed but he realised it was melting fast as his breath hit it and his front was growing cold and the marksmen were running from the building lit up like a firingrange and siobhan clarke was safe he could see her lying beneath a car good girl and one policewoman also lying low had been wounded in the knee she kept touching it with her hand then pulling the hand away to stare at the blood and there was still no sign of jack morton the gunmen were returning fire scattering shots smashing windscreens uniforms were ordered out of the front backup car four of the gang got in second car uniforms out three of the gang got in no windscreens but they were rolling yelling and whooping waving their weapons the two remaining gunmen were cool they were taking a good look round assessing the situation did they want to be here when the marksmen arrived maybe they did maybe they fancied their chances in that arena too their luck had held this far after all claverhouse the less lucks involved the better ill like it rebus got on to his knees then his feet staying at a crouch he felt moderately safe after all his luck had held today too you okay siobhan voice low eyes on the gunmen the two getaway cars added up to seven men two still left where was number ten fine clarke said what about you im okay rebus left her worked his way round to the front of the truck the driver was unconscious behind his wheel head bleeding where it had connected after the collision there was some kind of grenade launcher on the seat beside him it had left a bloody great hole in the wall of macleans rebus checked the driver for firearms found none then checked the pulse steady recognised the face one of the arcade regulars looked about nineteen twenty rebus took out his handcuffs hooked the driver to the steeringwheel threw the grenade launcher on to the road then headed for the gatehouse jack morton in uniform but missing his cap prone on the floor covered by a glass shroud the bullet had pierced his right breastpocket pulse was weak christ jack there was a telephone in the booth rebus punched and asked for ambulances police officers down at the macleans factory on slateford road staring down at his friend whereabouts on slateford road believe me they wont be able to miss it five marksmen dressed in black aimed rifles at rebus from outside saw him on the phone saw him shake his head moved on saw their targets out on the road getting into a patrol car yelled the order to stop warning that they would fire response muzzleflash rebus ducked again fire was returned the noise deafening but momentary shouts from the road got them a plaintive wail one of the gunmen wounded rebus looked the other was lying quite still on the road marksmen yelling to the wounded man drop the weapon turn on to your front hands behind your back response im shot rebus to himself bastards only wounded finish him off jack morton unconscious rebus knew better than to move him he could staunch the bleeding that was all removed his jacket folded it and pressed it to his friends chest mustve hurt but jack was out of it rebus dug the fuel rod out of his own pocket the tiny canister still warm pressed it into jacks right hand curled the fingers around it stick around pal just keep sticking around siobhan clarke art the doorway tears welling in her eyes rebus pushed past her slid his way across the road to where the armed response team were cuffing the wounded man nobody much bothering with his dead partner a little group of onlookers keeping their distance rebus walked right up to the corpse prised the handgun from its fingers walked back around the front of the car heard someone call out hes got a gun rebus bending down until the barrel of the gun touched the back of the wounded mans neck declan from the shop breath coming in short gasps hair matted with sweat burrowing his face into the tarmac john claverhouse no megaphone needed standing right behind him you really want to be like them like them like mean machine like telford and cafferty and tarawicz hed crossed the line before made several trips forth and back his foot was on declans neck the gun barrel so hot it was singeing napeskin please no oh christ please dont dont shut up rebus hissed he felt claverhouses hand close over his flick on the safety my responsibility john my fuckup dont make it yours too jack i know rebuss vision blurred theyre getting away claverhouse shook his head road blocks backup are already on it and telford claverhouse checked his watch ormie will be picking him up right about now rebus grabbed claverhouses lapels nail him sirens nearing rebus shouted for the drivers to move their cars make room for the ambulance then he ran back to the gatehouse siobhan clarke was kneeling beside jack stroking his forehead her face was streaked with tears she looked up at rebus and shook her head hes gone she said no but he knew the truth which didnt stop him saying the word over and over again they divided the gang between two different locations torphichen and fettes and took telford and a few of his lieutenants to st leonards result a logistical nightmare claverhouse was washing proplus down with double strength coffee part of him wanting to do things right the other part knowing he was answerable for the bloodbath at macleans one officer dead six wounded or otherwise injured one of them seriously one gunman dead one wounded not seriously enough to some peoples minds the getaway cars had been apprehended and arrests made shots exchanged but no bloodshed none of the gang was saying anything not a single damned word rebus was sitting in an empty interview room at st leonards arms on the table head resting on arms hed been sitting there for a while just thinking about loss about how suddenly it could strike a life a friendship just snatched away irretrievable he hadnt cried and didnt think he would instead he felt numb as if his soul had been spiked with novocaine the world seemed to have slowed like the mechanism was running down he wondered if the sun would have the energy to rise again and i got him into it he had wallowed before in feelings of guilt and inadequacy but nothing to measure up to this this was overwhelming jack morton a copper with a quiet patch in falkirk murdered in edinburgh because a friend had asked a favour jack morton whod brought himself back to life by swearing off cigarettes and booze getting into shape eating right taking care of himself lying in the mortuary deepbody temperature dropping and i put him there he jumped up suddenly threw the chair at the wall gill templer walked into the room all right john he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand fine my office is empty if you want to get your head down no ill be fine just he looked around is this place needed she nodded right okay he picked up the chair who is it brian summers she said prettyboy rebus straightened his back i can make him talk templer looked sceptical honest gill hands trembling he doesnt know what ive got on him she folded her arms and whats that i just need he checked his watch an hour or so two hours tops bobby hogan needs to be here and i want colquhoun brought in pronto whos he rebus found the business card and handed it over pronto he repeated he worked at his tie making himself presentable smoothed back his hair said nothing john im not sure youre in any state to he pointed at her turned it into a wagging finger dont presume gill if i say i can break him i mean it no one else has said a single word summers will be different he stared at her believe me looking back at him she believed ill hold him back till hogan gets here thanks gill and john yes im really sorry about jack morton i didnt know him but ive heard what everyones saying rebus nodded theyre saying hed be the last one to blame you rebus smiled right at the back of the queue theres only one person in the queue john she said quietly and youre it rebus phoned the nightdesk at the caledonian hotel learned that sakiji shoda had checked out unexpectedly less than two hours after rebus had dropped off the green folder which had cost him fiftyfive pence at a stationers on raeburn place actually the folders had come in threepacks at one sixtyfive he had the other two in his car only one of them empty bobby hogan was on his way he lived in portobello he said to give him half an hour bill pryde came over to rebuss desk and said how sorry he was about jack morton how he knew the two of them had been old friends just dont get too close to me bill rebus told him the people closest to me tend to lose their health he got a message from reception someone there to see him he headed downstairs found patience aitken patience she had all her clothes on but not necessarily in the right order like shed dressed in a powercut i heard on the radio she said i couldnt sleep so i had the radio on and they said about this police raid and how people were dead and you werent in your flat so i he hugged her im okay he whispered i should have called you its my fault i she looked at him you were there i can see it on your face he nodded what happened i lost a friend oh christ john she hugged him again she was still warm from the bedclothes he could smell shampoo on her hair perfume on her neck the people closest to me he pulled away gently planted a kiss on her cheek go get some sleep he told her come for breakfast i just want to go home and crash you could sleep at my place its sunday we could stay in bed i dont know what time ill finish here she found his eyes dont feed on it john dont keep it all inside okay doc he pecked her cheek again now vamoose he managed a smile and a wink both felt treacherous he stood at the door and watched her leave a lot of times while hed been married hed thought of just walking there were times when all the responsibilities and the shite at work and the pressure and the need would make him dream of escape he was tempted again now push open the door and head off to somewhere that wasnt here to do something that wasnt this but that too would be treachery he had scores to settle and a reason to settle them he knew telford was somewhere in the building probably consulting with charles groal saying nothing to anyone else he wondered how the team were playing it when would they let telford know about the tape when would they tell him the security guard had been a plant when would they tell him that same man was now dead he hoped they were being clever he hoped they were rattling telfords cage he couldnt help wondering and not for the first time if it was all worth it some cops treated it like a game others like a crusade and for most of the rest it was neither just a way of earning their daily bread he asked himself why hed invited jack morton in answers because hed wanted a friend involved someone whod keep him in the game because hed thought jack was bored and would enjoy the challenge because tactics had demanded an outsider there were plenty of reasons claverhouse had asked if morton had any family anyone who should be informed rebus had told him divorced four kids did rebus blame claverhouse easy to be wise after the event but then claverhouses reputation had been built on being wise before the event and hed failed monumentally icy roads theyd needed the gates closed the blockade had been too easy to move with the horsepower available to a truck marksmen in the building fine in the enclosed space of the yard but theyd failed to keep the truck there and the marksmen had been ineffectual once the truck had reversed out more armed officers behind the truck producing little but a crossfire hazard claverhouse should have got them to turn off the ignition or better still waited for it to be turned off before making his presence known jack morton should have kept his head down and rebus should have warned him only a shout would have turned the gunmens attention towards him cowardice was that what was at the bottom of his feelings simple human cowardice like in the bar in belfast when he hadnt said anything fearing mean machines wrath fearing a riflebutt turned on him maybe that was why no of course that was why lintz had got beneath rebuss skin because when it came down to it if rebus had been in villefranche drunk on failure the dream of conquest over if hed been under orders just a lackey with a gun if hed been primed by racism and the loss of comrades who was to say what hed have done christ john how long have you been out here it was bobby hogan touching his face prising the folder from frozen fingers youre like ice man lets get you inside im fine rebus breathed and it had to be true how else to explain the sweat on his back and his brow how else to explain that he only started shivering after bobby led him indoors hogan got two mugs of sweet tea into him the station was still buzzing shock rumour theories rebus filled hogan in theyll have to let telford walk if nobody talks what about the tape theyll want to spring that later if theyre being canny whos in with him rebus shrugged farmer watson himself last time i heard he was doing a doubleact with bill pryde but i saw bill later so theyve either taken a break or else done a swop hogan shook his head what a fucking business rebus stared at his tea i hate sugar you drank the first mug all right did i he took a mouthful squirmed what the hell did you think you were doing out there catching a breath catching your death more like hogan patted down an unruly clump of hair i had a visit from a man called harris what are you going to do hogan shrugged let it go i suppose rebus stared at him you might not have to colquhoun didnt look happy to be there thanks for coming in rebus told him i didnt have much choice he had a solicitor sitting beside him a middleaged man one of telfords rebus couldnt have cared less you might have to get used to not having choices dr colquhoun know who else is in here tonight tommy telford brian summers who rebus shook his head youre getting your script wrong its okay for you to know who they are we talked about them in front of candice colquhouns face flushed you remember candice dont you her real names dunya did i ever tell you that shes got a son somewhere only they took him away maybe shell find him one day maybe not i dont see what this telford and summers are going to be spending a while behind bars rebus sat back if i want to i could have a damned good go at putting you in there with them how would you like that dr colquhoun conspiracy to pervert et cetera rebus could feel himself relaxing into his work doing it for jack the solicitor was about to say something but colquhoun got in first it was a mistake a mistake rebus hooted one way of putting it i suppose he sat forward resting his elbows on the table time to talk dr colquhoun you know what they say about confession brian prettyboy summers looked immaculate he had a lawyer with him too a senior partner who looked like an undertaker and wasnt taking kindly to being kept waiting as they settled at the table in the interview room and hogan slotted tapes into cassette machine and video recorder the lawyer started the protest hed spent the past hour or two preparing in his head on behalf of my client inspector i feel duty bound to say that this is some of the most appalling behaviour ive you think youve seen appalling behaviour rebus answered in the words of the song you aint seen nothing yet look its clear to me that you rebus ignored him slapped the folder down on to the table slid it towards prettyboy take a look prettyboy was wearing a charcoal suit and purple shirt open at the neck no sunglasses or carkeys hed been brought in from his flat in the new town comment from one of the men whod gone to fetch him biggest hifi ive seen in my life bugger was wide awake listening to patsy cline rebus started whistling crazy that got prettyboys attention and a wry smile but he kept his arms folded i would if i were you rebus said ready hogan said meaning he had the tapes running they went through the formalities date and time location individuals present rebus looked towards the lawyer and smiled he looked pretty expensive telford would have ordered the best same as always know any elton john brian rebus asked hes got this song someone saved my life tonight youll be singing it to me once youve looked inside he tapped the folder go on you know it makes sense im not playing some trick and you dont have to say anything but you really should do yourself a favour ive got nothing to say rebus shrugged just open the folder take a look prettyboy looked to his lawyer who seemed uncertain your client wont be incriminating himself rebus explained if you want to read whats in there first thats fine it might not mean much to you but go ahead the lawyer opened the folder found a dozen sheets of paper sorry in advance for any mistakes rebus said i typed it in a bit of a rush prettyboy didnt so much as glance towards the material he kept his eyes on rebus while the lawyer sifted through the papers these allegations the lawyer finally said you must realise theyre worthless if thats your opinion fair enough im not asking mr summers to admit or deny anything like i said he can do a deaf and dumb routine for all i care so long as he uses his eyes a smile from prettyboy then a glance towards his lawyer who shrugged his shoulders saying there was nothing here to fear a glance back at rebus and prettyboy unfolded his arms picked up the first sheet and started reading just so we have a record for the tape rebus said mr summers is now reading a draft report prepared by myself earlier today rebus paused actually i mean yesterday saturday hes reading my interpretation of recent events in and around edinburgh events concerning his employer thomas telford a japanese business consortium which is really in my opinion a yakuza front and a gentleman from newcastle by the name of jake tarawicz he paused the lawyer said agreed thus far rebus nodded and continued my version of events is as follows jake tarawicz became an associate of thomas telford only because he wanted something telford had namely a slick operation to bring drugs into britain without raising suspicion either that or it was only later on once their relationship had become established that tarawicz decided he could move in on telfords turf to facilitate this he manufactured a war between telford and morris gerald cafferty this was easily accomplished telford had moved in aggressively on caffertys territory probably with tarawicz egging him on all tarawicz had to do was make sure things escalated to this end he had one of his men attack a drug dealer outside one of telfords nightclubs telford immediately placing the blame on cafferty he also had some of his men attack a telford stronghold in paisley meanwhile there were attacks on caffertys territory and associates retaliation by telford for perceived wrongs rebus cleared his throat took a sip of tea a fresh cup no sugar does this sound familiar mr summers prettyboy said nothing he was busy reading my guess is that the japanese were never meant to become involved in other words they had no knowledge of what was happening telford was showing them around easing the way for them as they tried to buy a country club rest and recreation for their members plus a good way of laundering money less suspect than a casino or similar operation especially when an electronics factory is about to open so that the yakuza slip into the country as just a few more japanese businessmen i think when tarawicz saw this he began to worry he didnt want to get rid of tommy telford just to leave the way open for other competitors to muscle in so he decided theyd have to become part of his plan he had matsumoto followed he had him killed and in a nice twist made me the chief suspect why two reasons first tommy telford had me pegged as caffertys man so by fingering me tarawicz was fingering cafferty second he wanted me out of the game because id gone to newcastle and had met one of his men a guy called william the crab cotton i knew the crab of old and it so happened tarawicz had used him for the hit on the drug dealer he didnt want me putting two and two together rebus paused again hows it sounding brian prettyboy had finished reading his arms were folded again eyes on rebus weve yet to see any evidence inspector the lawyer said rebus shrugged i dont need evidence see the same file youve got there i delivered a copy to a mr sakiji shoda at the caledonian hotel rebus watched prettyboys eyelids flutter now the way i see it mr shoda is going to be a bit pissed off i mean hes already pissed off thats why he was here hed seen telford screw up and wanted to see if he could do anything right i dont suppose the raid on macleans will have given him any renewed sense of confidence but he was also here to find out why one of his men had been killed and who was responsible this report tells him tarawicz was behind it and if he chooses to believe that hell go after tarawicz in fact he checked out of his hotel yesterday evening seems he was in a bit of a rush im wondering if he was on his way home via newcastle doesnt matter what matters is that hell still be pissed off at telford for letting it happen and meantime jake tarawicz is going to be wondering who shopped him to shoda the yakuza are not nice people brian you lot are nursery school by comparison rebus sat back in his chair one last point he said tarawiczs base is newcastle im betting he had eyes and ears here in edinburgh in fact i know he did ive just been having a chat with dr colquhoun you remember him brian youd heard about him from lintz then when tarawicz offered east europeans as working girls you reckoned maybe tommy should have a few foreign phrases to hand colquhoun did the teaching you told him stories about tarawicz about bosnia catch was hes the only person round these parts who knew the subject so when we picked up candice we ended up using him too colquhoun sussed straight off what was happening he wasnt sure if he had anything to fear hed never met her and her answers were reassuringly vague or he kept them that way all the same he came to you your solution ship candice to fife then snatch her and take colquhoun out of the game till the heat died rebus smiled he told you about fife yet it was tarawicz who got candice i think tommy will find that a bit odd dont you so here we sit and i can tell you that the minute you walk out of here youre going to be a marked man could be the yakuza could be cafferty could be your own boss or tarawicz himself you havent got any friends and nowheres safe any more rebus paused unless me help you ive talked to chief superintendent watson and hes agreeing to witness protection new identity whatever you want there may be a short sentence to serve just so it looks right but itll be a soft option room of your own no other prisoners allowed near and afterwards youll be home and dry thats a big commitment on our part and well need a big commitment from you well want everything rebus counted off on his fingers the drug shipments the war with cafferty the newcastle connection the yakuza the prostitutes he paused again drained his tea tall order i know your boss had a meteoric rise brian and he nearly made it but thats all over best thing you can do now is talk its either that or spend the rest of your days waiting for the bullet or the machete to strike the lawyer started to protest rebus held up a hand well need all of it brian including lintz lintz prettyboy said dismissively lintz is nothing so wheres the harm the look in prettyboys eyes was a mix of anger fear and disorientation rebus stood up i need something else to drink what about you gentlemen coffee the lawyer said black no sugar prettyboy hesitated then said get me a coke and at that point for the very first time rebus knew a deal might be done he stopped the interview hogan switched off the tapes and both men left the room hogan patted him on the back farmer watson was coming along the corridor towards them rebus moved to meet him leading them away from the door i think we might be in with a shout sir rebus said hell try to twist the deal give us less than we want but i think theres a chance watson beamed a smile as rebus leaned against the wall eyes closed i feel about a hundred years old experience tells hogan said rebus growled at him then they went to fetch the drinks mr summers the lawyer said as rebus handed him his cup would like to tell you the story of his relationship with joseph lintz but first well need some assurances what about everything else i mentioned these can be negotiated rebus stared at prettyboy you dont trust me prettyboy picked up his can said no and drank fine rebus walked over to the far wall in that case youre free to go he checked his watch soon as youve finished your drinks i want you out of here interview rooms are at a premium tonight di hogan mark up the tapes will you hogan ejected both cassettes rebus sat down beside him and they started discussing work as though prettyboy had been dismissed from their minds hogan examined a sheet of paper checking who was due to be interviewed next from the corner of his eye rebus saw prettyboy leaning in towards his lawyer whispering something he turned on them can you do that outside please we need to vacate this room prettyboy knew rebus was bluffing knew the policeman needed him but he realised too that rebus was not bluffing about giving the file to shoda and he was far too intelligent not to be scared he didnt move from the chair and held his lawyers arm so he had to stay and listen eventually the lawyer cleared his throat inspector mr summers is willing to answer your questions all my questions the lawyer nodded but i must insist on hearing more of the deal youre proposing rebus looked at hogan go get the chief super rebus left the room stood in the hallway while hogan was away cadged a cigarette off a passing uniform hed just got it lit when farmer watson came barrelling towards him hogan behind as though attached to watson by an invisible leash no smoking john you know that yes sir rebus said crimping the tip i was just holding it for inspector hogan watson nodded towards the door what do they want weve been talking possible immunity from prosecution at the very least hell want a soft sentence and a safe one plus new id afterwards watson was thoughtful we havent had a cheep out of any of them not that it matters greatly theres the gang we caught redhanded plus telford on the audio tape summers is a real insider knows telfords organisation so how come hes willing to spill because hes scared and his fear is overwhelming his loyalty im not saying well get every last detail out of him but well probably get enough to start pressing the other members once they know someones yapping theyll all want a trade whats his lawyer like expensive no point shillyshallying then i couldnt have put it better myself sir the chief super pinned back his shoulders all right lets do a deal when did you first meet joseph lintz prettyboys arms were no longer folded he was resting them on the desk head in his hands his hair flopped forward making him look younger than ever about six months ago wed spoken on the phone before that he was a punter yes meaning what exactly prettyboy looked at the turning spools you want me to explain for all our listeners thats right joseph lintz was a client of the escort service for which i worked come on brian you were a bit more than a flunkey you ran it didnt you if you say so anytime you want to walk brian eyes burning okay i ran it for my employer and mr lintz phoned wanting an escort he wanted one of our girls to go to his home and and that was it hed sit there opposite her and just stare for half an hour both of them fully clothed yes nothing else not at first ah rebus paused you must have been curious prettyboy shrugged takes all sorts doesnt it i suppose it does so how did your business relationship progress well on a gig like that theres always a chaperone yourself yes you didnt have better things to do another shrug i was curious about what the address heriot row mr lintz had class coming out his ears i mean ive met plenty fat cats corporate types looking for a shag in their hotel but lintz was a long way from that he just wanted to look at the girls thats right and this huge house he had you went in you didnt just wait in the car told him it was company policy a smile really all i wanted was to snoop did you talk to him later yes you became friends not really maybe he knew things had a real brain on him you were impressed prettyboy nodded yes rebus could imagine his previous role model had always been tommy telford but pretty boy had aspirations he wanted class he wanted people to acknowledge him for his mind rebus knew how seductive lintzs storytelling could be how much more seductive would prettyboy have found it then what happened prettyboy shifted his tastes changed or his real tastes started to emerge thats what i wondered so what did he want he wanted the girls he had this length of rope hed made it into a noose prettyboy swallowed his lawyer had stopped writing was listening intently he wanted the girls to slip it over their heads then lie down like they were dead dressed or naked naked and and hed hed sit on his chair and get off some of the girls wouldnt go along he wanted the works bulging eyes tongue sticking out neck twisted prettyboy rubbed his hands through his hair did you ever talk about it with him no never so what did you talk about all sorts of things prettyboy looked up at the ceiling laughed he told me once he believed in god said the problem was he wasnt sure god believed in him that seemed clever at the time he always managed to get me thinking and this was the same guy who tossed himself off over bodies with ropes round their necks all this personal attention you were giving him rebus said you were sizing him up werent you prettyboy looked into his lap nodded for the tape please tommy always wanted to know if a punter was worth squeezing and prettyboy shrugged we found out about the nazi stuff realised we couldnt hurt him any more than he was already being hurt turned into a bit of a joke there we were thinking of threatening him with exposure as a perv and at the same time the papers were saying he was a mass murderer he laughed again so you dropped that idea yes but he paid you five grand rebus fishing prettyboy licked his lips hed tried topping himself he told me that tying the rope to the top of his banister and jumping off only it didnt work banister snapped and he fell half a flight rebus remembering the broken stairrail rebus remembering lintz with a scarf around his neck his voice hoarse telling rebus he had a throat bug he told you this he phoned the office said we had to meet that was unusual in the past hed always used phone boxes and got me on my mobile safe old bugger id always thought then he calls from home right to the office where did you meet in a restaurant he bought me lunch the young woman told me hed tried killing himself and couldnt do it he kept saying hed proved himself a moral coward whatever that means so what did he want prettyboy stared up at rebus he needed someone to help him you prettyboy shrugged and the price was right no haggling necessary he wanted it done in warriston cemetery did you ask him why i knew he liked the place we met at his house really early i drove him down there he seemed the same as ever except he kept thanking me for my resolve i wasnt sure what he meant by that to me resolve is something you take after a hard night rebus smiled as was expected go on he said not much more to tell is there he put the noose over his head he told me to pull on the rope i had a last go at talking him out of it but the bugger was determined its not murder is it assisted suicide a lot of places its legal how did the dent get on his head he was heavier than i thought first time i hauled him up the rope slipped and he fell thumped himself on the ground bobby hogan cleared his throat brian did he say anything right at the end famous last words and all that prettyboy shook his head all he said was thank you poor old sod one thing he wrote it all down what about me helping him a sort of insurance in case anyone ever linked us letter says he paid me begged me to help where is this in a safe i can get it for you rebus nodded stretched his back did you ever talk about villefranche a little bit mostly about the way the papers and tv were hounding him how difficult it made it when he wanted company but not the massacre itself prettyboy shook his head know something else even if he had told me i wouldnt tell you rebus tapped his pen against the desk he knew the lintz story was as closed as it was ever going to be bobby hogan knew it too they had the secret at last the story of how lintz had died they knew hed been helped by the rat line but theyd never know whether hed been josef linzstek or not the circumstantial evidence was overwhelming but so was the evidence that lintz had been hounded to death hed started putting the escorts into nooses only after the accusations had been made hogan caught rebuss eye and shrugged as if to say what does it matter rebus nodded back part of him wanted to take a break but now that prettyboy was rolling it was important to keep up the steam thanks for that mr summers we may come back to mr lintz if we think of any more questions but meantime lets move on to the relationship between thomas telford and jake tarawicz prettyboy shifted as if trying to get comfortable this could take a while he said take as long as you like rebus told him they got it all in time prettyboy had to rest and so did they other teams came in worked on different areas the tapes were filling up being listened to elsewhere notes and transcripts made backup questions were forwarded to the interview room telford wasnt talking rebus went and took a look at him sat across from him telford didnt blink once he sat ramrodstraight hands on knees and all the while prettyboys confession was being used to squeeze other gang members without letting slip who was singing the ranks broke slowly at first and then in a cataract of accusation selfdefence and denial and they got it all telford and tarawicz european prostitutes heading north muscle and dope heading south mr taystee taking more than his fair share dealt with accordingly the japanese using telford as their introduction to scotland finding it a good base of operations only now rebus had scuppered that in his folder to shoda hed warned the gangster to leave poyntinghame alone or hed be implicated in ongoing criminal investigations the yakuza werent stupid he doubted theyd be back for a while at least his last trip of the night rebus went down to the cells unlocked one of the doors and told ned farlowe he was free told him he had nothing to fear unlike mr pink eyes the yakuza had a score to settle and it didnt stay unsettled long he was found in his carcrusher seatbelt welded shut his men had started running some of them were running still rebus sat in his livingroom staring at the door jack morton had stripped and varnished he was thinking about the funeral about how the juice church would be there in force he wondered if theyd blame him jacks kids would be there too rebus had never met them didnt think he wanted to see them wednesday morning he was back in inverness meeting mrs hetherington off her flight shed been delayed in holland answering customs questions theyd laid a little trap caught a man called de gier a known trafficker planting the kilo package of heroin in mrs hetheringtons luggage a secret compartment in her suitcase the suitcase itself a gift from her landlord several of telfords other elderly tenants were enjoying short breaks in belgium theyd be questioned by local police home again rebus telephoned david levy lintz committed suicide he told him thats your conclusion its the truth no conspiracy no coverup a sigh its of little consequence inspector what matters is that weve lost another one villefranche doesnt mean a thing to you does it the rat line thats all you care about theres nothing we can do about villefranche rebus took a deep breath a man called harris came to see me he works for british intelligence theyre protecting some big names highlevel people rat line survivors maybe their children tell mayerlink to keep digging there was silence for a moment thank you inspector rebus was in a car it was the weasels jag the weasel was in the back with him their driver was missing a big chunk of his left ear the shape made him resemble a pixie but only from the side and you wouldnt want to tell him to his face you did well the weasel was saying mr caffertys pleased how long have you been holding him the weasel smiled nothing gets past you rebus rangers have offered me a trial in goal how long have you had him a few days had to be sure we had the right one didnt we and now youre sure absolutely positive rebus looked out of the window at the passing parade of shops pedestrians buses the car was heading down towards newhaven and granton you wouldnt be setting up some loser to take the blame hes genuine you could have spent the past few days making sure he was going to say the right things the weasel seemed amused such as such as that he was in telfords pay rather than mr caffertys you mean rebus glared at the weasel who laughed i think youll find him a pretty convincing candidate the way he said it made rebus shiver hes still alive isnt he ah yes how long he remains so is entirely up to you you think i want him dead i know you do you didnt go to mr cafferty because you wanted justice you went out of revenge rebus stared at the weasel you dont sound like yourself you mean i dont sound like my persona different thing entirely and do many people get behind the persona the who can you see the real me the weasel smiled again i thought you deserved it after all the trouble youve gone to i didnt break telford just to please your boss nevertheless the weasel slid across his seat towards rebus hows sammy by the way shes fine recuperating yes thats good news mr cafferty will be pleased hes disappointed you havent been to see him rebus took a newspaper from his pocket it was folded at a story fatal stabbing at jail your boss he said handing the paper over the weasel made show of reading it aged twentysix from govan stabbed through the heart in his cell no witnesses no weapon recovered despite a thorough search he tutted bit careless hed taken up the contract on cafferty had he the weasel looked amazed fuck off rebus said turning back to his window by the way rebus if you decide not to go to trial with the driver the weasel was holding something out a homemade screwdriver filed to a point grip covered in packingtape rebus looked at it in disgust i washed the blood off the weasel assured him then he laughed again rebus felt like he was being ferried straight to hell in front of him he could see the grey expanse of the firth of forth and fife beyond it they were coming into an area of docks gasplant and warehouses it had been earmarked for a development spillover from leith the whole city was changing traffic routes and priorities were altered overnight cranes were kept busy on buildingsites and the council who always complained about being broke had all manner of schemes underway to further alter the shape and scope of his chosen home nearly there the weasel said rebus wondered if thered be any turning back they stopped at the gates to a warehouse complex the driver undid the padlock pulled the chain free the gates swung open in they went the weasel ordered the driver to park around the back there was a plain white van there more rust than metal its back windows had been painted over turning it into a suitable hearse should occasion demand they got out into a salt wind the weasel shuffled over towards a door and banged once the door was pushed open from within they stepped inside a huge open space filled with only a few packing cases a couple of pieces of machinery covered with oilcloth and two men the one whod let them in and another at the far end this man was standing in front of a wooden chair there was a figure tied to the chair halfhidden by the man the weasel led the procession rebus tried to control his breathing which was growing painfully shallow his heart was racing nerves jangling he pushed back the anger wasnt sure he could hold it when they were eight feet from the chair the weasel nodded and the man stood away revealing to rebus the terrified figure of a kid a boy nine or ten no older one black eye nose caked with blood both cheeks bruised and a graze on his chin burst lip beginning to heal trousers torn at the knees one shoe missing and a smell as if hed wet himself maybe even worse what the hell is this rebus asked this the weasel said is the little bastard who stole the car this is the little bastard who lost his nerve at a red light and gunned through it losing control of the pedals because he could barely reach them this the weasel stepped forward planted a hand on the kids shoulder this is the culprit rebus looked at the faces around him is this your idea of a joke no joke rebus he looked at the boy dried teartracks eyes bloodshot from crying shoulders trembling theyd tied his arms behind him tied his ankles to the chairlegs puhplease mister dry cracked voice i please nicked the car the weasel recited then did the hit and run got scared and dumped the car near where he lives took the cassette and the tapes he wanted the car for a race thats what they do race cars around the schemes this little runt can start an engine in ten seconds flat he rubbed his hands together so here we all are help me rebus recalling the citys graffiti wont anyone help the weasel nodding towards one of his men the man producing a pickaxehandle or the screwdriver the weasel said or whatever you like really we are at your command and he gave a little bow rebus could hardly speak cut the ropes silence in the warehouse cut those fucking ropes a sniff from the weasel you heard the man tony cachink of a flickknife opening ropes severed like through butter rebus walked to within inches of the boy whats your name j jordan is that your first name or your second the boy looked at him first okay jordan rebus leaned down the boy flinched but did not help me puh cutting resist as rebus picked him up he weighed almost nothing rebus started walking with him what now rebus the weasel asked but rebus didnt answer he carried the boy to the threshold kicked open the door stepped out into sunshine im im really sorry the boy had a hand across his eyes unused to the light he was starting to cry you know what you did jordan nodded ive been ever since that night i knew it was bad now the tears came did they say who i was please dont kill me im not going to kill you jordan the boy blinked trying to clear tears from his eyes the better to know whether he was being lied to i think youve been through enough pal rebus said then added i think we both have so after everything it had come to this bob dylan simple twist of fate segue to leonard cohen is this what you wanted rebus didnt know the answer to that clean and sober he went to the hospital an open ward this time set hours for visitors no more darkened vigils no return visit by candice though nurses spoke of regular phone calls by someone foreignsounding no way of knowing where she was maybe out there searching for her son it didnt matter so long as she was safe so long as she was in control when he reached the wards far end two women rose from their chairs so he could kiss them rhona and patience he had a carrierbag with him magazines and grapes sammy was sitting up supported by three pillows pa broon propped beside her her hair had been washed and brushed and she was smiling at him womens magazines he said shaking his head they should be on the topshelf i need a few fantasies to sustain me in here sammy said rebus beamed at her said hello then bent down and kissed his daughter the sun was shining as they walked through the meadows a rare day off for both they held hands and matched people sunbathing and playing football he knew rhona was excited and thought he knew why but he wasnt going to spoil things with speculation if you had a daughter what mould you call her she asked he shrugged havent really thought about it what about a son i quite like sam sam when i was a kid i had a bear called sam my mum knitted it for me sam she tried the name out it mould work both ways wouldnt it he stopped circled his arms around her waist how do you mean well it could be samuel or samantha you dont get many of those names that work both ways i suppose not rhona is there she put a finger to his lips then kissed him they walked on there didnt seem to be a cloud in the whole damned sky afterword my fictional french village of villefranche dalbarede owes its existence to the real village of oradoursurglane which was the subject of an attack by the rd company of the ss der fuhrer regiment on the afternoon of saturday june rd company known as das reich entered the village and rounded up everyone the women and children were herded into the church while the men were split into groups and marched to various barns and other buildings around the village then the slaughter began some victims have been accounted for but the estimate is that up to a thousand people may have perished that day only fiftythree corpses were ever identified one boy from lorraine having firsthand knowledge of s s atrocities managed to flee when the troops entered the village five men escaped the massacre in laudys barn wounded they were able to crawl from the burning building and hide until the next day one woman escaped from the church climbing out of a window after playing dead beside the corpse of her child soldiers went from house to house finding villagers too sick or elderly to leave their beds these people were shot and their houses set alight some of the bodies were hidden in mass graves or dumped down wells and in bread ovens general lammerding was the commanding officer on june hed ordered the deaths of ninetynine hostages in tulle he also gave the order for the oradour massacre later on in the war lammerding was captured by the british who refused his extradition to france instead he was returned to dusseldorf where he ran a successful company until his death in in the general euphoria of the normandy landings the tragedy at oradour went almost unnoticed eventually in january the trial opened in bordeaux of sixtyfive men identified as having been involved in the massacre of these sixtyfive only twentyone were present seven germans and fourteen natives of french alsace none of the men was of officer rank every individual found guilty at the bordeaux trial left court a free man a special act of amnesty had been passed in the interests of national unity people in alsace were disgruntled that their countrymen had been picked out for condemnation meantime the germans were said to have already served their terms as a result oradour broke off all relations with the french state a rupture which lasted seventeen years in may a man stood trial in east berlin charged with having been a lieutenant in das reich during the oradour massacre he admitted everything and was sentenced to life imprisonment in june it was reported that around foreign volunteers to the waffen ss are still receiving pensions from the federal german government one of these pensioners a former obersturmbannfuhrer was a participant at oradour oradour still stands as a shrine the village has been left just the way it was on that day in june
