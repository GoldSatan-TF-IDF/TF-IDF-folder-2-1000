jeffery deaver the cold moon lincoln rhyme book you cant see me but im always present run as fast as you can but youll never escape me fight me with all your strength but youll never defeat me i kill when i wish but can never be brought to justice who am i old man time i am tuesday time is dead as long as it is being clicked off by little wheels only when the clock stops does time come to life william faulkner chapter how long did it take them to die the man this question was posed to didnt seem to hear it he looked in the rearview mirror again and concentrated on his driving the hour was just past midnight and the streets in lower manhattan were icy a cold front had swept the sky clear and turned an earlier snow to slick glaze on the asphalt and concrete the two men were in the rattling bandaidmobile as clever vincent had dubbed the tan suv it was a few years old the brakes needed servicing and the tires replacing but taking a stolen vehicle in for work would not be a wise idea especially since two of its recent passengers were now murder victims the drivera lean man in his fifties with trim black hairmade a careful turn down a side street and continued his journey never speeding making precise turns perfectly centered in his lane hed drive the same whether the streets were slippery or dry whether the vehicle had just been involved in murder or not careful meticulous how long did it take big vincentvincent with long sausage fingers always damp and a taut brown belt stretching the first holeshivered hard hed been waiting on the street corner after his night shift as a wordprocessing temp it was bitterly cold but vincent didnt like the lobby of his building the light was greenish and the walls were covered with big mirrors in which he could see his oval body from all angles so hed stepped into the clear cold december air and paced and ate a candy bar okay two as vincent was glancing up at the full moon a shockingly white disk visible for a moment through a canyon of buildings the watchmaker reflected aloud how long did it take them to die interesting vincent had known the watchmakerwhose real name was gerald duncanfor only a short time but hed learned that you asked the man questions at your own risk even a simple query could open the door to a monologue man could he talk and his answers were always organized like a college professors vincent knew that the silence for the last few minutes was because duncan was considering his answer vincent opened a can of pepsi he was cold but he needed something sweet he chugged it and put the empty can in his pocket he ate a packet of peanut butter crackers duncan looked over to make sure vincent was wearing gloves they always wore gloves in the bandaidmobile meticulous id say there are several answers to that duncan said in his soft detached voice for instance the first one i killed was twentyfour so you could say it took him twentyfour years to die like yeahthought clever vincent with the sarcasm of a teenager though he had to admit that this obvious answer hadnt occurred to him the other was thirtytwo i think a police car drove by the opposite way the blood in vincents temples began pounding but duncan didnt react the cops showed no interest in the stolen explorer another way to answer the question duncan said is to consider the elapsed time from the moment i started until their hearts stopped beating thats probably what you meant see people want to put time into easytodigest frames of reference thats valid as long as its helpful knowing the contractions come every twenty seconds is helpful so is knowing that the athlete ran a mile in three minutes fiftyeight seconds so he wins the race specifically how long it took them tonight to diewell that isnt important as long as it wasnt fast a glance at vincent im not being critical of your question no vincent said not caring if he was critical vincent reynolds didnt have many friends and could put up with a lot from gerald duncan i was just curious i understand i just didnt pay any attention but the next one ill time it the girl tomorrow vincents heart beat just a bit faster he nodded later today you mean it was after midnight with gerald duncan you had to be precise especially when it came to time right hungry vincent had nosed out clever vincent now that he was thinking of joanne the girl whod die next later today the killer drove in a complicated pattern back to their temporary home in the chelsea district of manhattan south of midtown near the river the streets were deserted the temperature was in the teens and the wind flowed steadily through the narrow streets duncan parked at a curb and shut the engine off set the parking brake the men stepped out they walked for a half block through the icy wind duncan glanced down at his shadow on the sidewalk cast by the moon ive thought of another answer about how long it took them to die vincent shivered againmostly but not only from the cold when you look at it from their point of view the killer said you could say that it took forever chapter what is that from his squeaky chair in the warm office the big man sipped coffee and squinted through the bright morning light toward the far end of the pier he was the morning supervisor of the tugboat repair operation located on the hudson river north of greenwich village there was a moran with a bum diesel due to dock in forty minutes but at the moment the pier was empty and the supervisor was enjoying the warmth of the shed where he sat with his feet up on the desk coffee cradled against his chest he wiped some condensation off the window and looked again what is it a small black box sat by the edge of the pier the side that faced jersey it hadnt been there when the facility had closed at six yesterday and nobody would have docked after that had to come from the land side there was a chainlink fence to prevent pedestrians and passersby from getting into the facility but as the man knew from the missing tools and trash drums go figure if somebody wanted to break in they would but why leave something he stared for a while thinking its cold out its windy the coffees just right then he decided oh hell better check he pulled on his thick gray jacket gloves and hat and taking a last slug of coffee stepped outside into the breathtaking air the supervisor made his way through the wind along the pier his watering eyes focused on the black box the hell is it the thing was rectangular less than a foot high and the low sunlight sharply reflected off something on the front he squinted against the glare the whitecapped water of the hudson slushed against the pilings below ten feet away from the box he paused realizing what it was a clock an oldfashioned one with those funny numbersroman numeralsand a moon face on the front looked expensive he glanced at his watch and saw the clock was working the time was accurate whod leave a nice thing like that here well all right i got myself a present as he stepped forward to pick it up though his legs went out from under him and he had a moment of pure panic thinking hed tumble into the river but he went straight down landing on the patch of ice he hadnt seen and slid no further wincing in pain gasping he pulled himself to his feet the man glanced down and saw that this wasnt normal ice it was reddish brown oh christ he whispered as he stared at the large patch of blood which had pooled near the clock and frozen slick he leaned forward and his shock deepened when he realized how the blood had gotten there he saw what looked like bloody fingernail marks on the wooden decking of the pier as if someone with slashed fingers or wrists had been holding on to keep from falling into the churning waters of the river he crept to the edge and looked down no one was floating in the choppy water he wasnt surprised if what he imagined was true the frozen blood meant the poor bastard had been here a while ago and if he hadnt been saved his bodyd be halfway to liberty island by now fumbling for his cell phone he backed away and pulled his glove off with his teeth a final glance at the clock then he hurried back to the shed calling the police with a stubby quaking finger before and after the city was different now after that morning in september after the explosions the huge tails of smoke the buildings that disappeared you couldnt deny it you could talk about the resilience the mettle the getbacktowork attitude of new yorkers and that was true but people still paused when planes made that final approach to laguardia and seemed a bit lower than normal you crossed the street wide around an abandoned shopping bag you werent surprised to see soldiers or police dressed in dark uniforms carrying black militarystyle machine guns the thanksgiving day parade had come and gone without incident and now christmas was in full swing crowds everywhere but floating atop the festivities like a reflection in a department stores holiday window was the persistent image of the towers that no long were the people no longer with us and of course the big question what would happen next lincoln rhyme had his own before and after and he understood this concept very well there was a time he could walk and function and then came the time when he could not one moment he was as healthy as everyone else searching a crime scene and a minute later a beam had snapped his neck and left him a c quadriplegic almost completely paralyzed from the shoulders down before and after there are moments that change you forever and yet lincoln rhyme believed if you make too grave an icon of them then the events become more potent and the bad guys win now early on a cold tuesday morning these were rhymes thoughts as he listened to a national public radio announcer in her unshakable fm voice report about a parade planned for the day after tomorrow followed by some ceremonies and meetings of government officials all of which logically should have been held in the nations capital but the upwithnewyork attitude had prevailed and spectators as well as protesters would be present in force and clogging the streets making the life of securitysensitive police around wall street far more difficult as with politics so with sports playoffs that should occur in new jersey were now scheduled for madison square gardenas a display for some reason of patriotism rhyme wondered cynically if next years boston marathon would be held in new york city before and after rhyme had come to believe that he himself really wasnt much different in the after his physical condition his skyline you could say had changed but he was essentially the same person as in the before a cop and a scientist who was impatient temperamental okay sometimes obnoxious relentless and intolerant of incompetence and laziness he didnt play the gimp card didnt whine didnt make an issue of his condition though good luck to any building owners who didnt meet the americans with disabilities act requirements for door width and ramps when he was at a crime scene in their buildings as he listened to the report now the fact that certain people in the city seemed to be giving in to selfpity irritated him im going to write a letter he announced to thom the slim young aide in dark slacks white shirt and thick sweater rhymes central park west town house suffered from a bad heating system and ancient insulation glanced up from where he was overdecorating for christmas rhyme enjoyed the irony of his placing a miniature evergreen tree on a table below which a present though an unwrapped one already waited a box of adult disposable diapers letter he explained his theory that it was more patriotic to go about business as usual im going to give em hell the times i think why dont you asked the aide whose profession was known as caregiver though thom said that being in the employ of lincoln rhyme his job description was really saint im going to rhyme said adamantly good for youthough one thing rhyme lifted an eyebrow the criminalist couldand didget great expression out of his extant body parts shoulders face and head most of the people who say theyre going to write a letter dont people who do write letters just go ahead and write them they dont announce it ever notice that thank you for the brilliant insight into psychology thom you know that nothings going to stop me now good repeated the aide using the touchpad controller the criminalist drove his red storm arrow wheelchair closer to one of the half dozen large flatscreen monitors in the room command he said into the voicerecognition system via a microphone attached to the chair word processor wordperfect dutifully opened on the screen command type dear sirs command colon command paragraph command type it has come to my attention the doorbell rang and thom went to see who the visitor was rhyme closed his eyes and was composing his rant to the world when a voice intruded hey linc merry christmas uhm ditto rhyme grumbled to paunchy disheveled lon sellitto walking through the doorway the big detective had to maneuver carefully the room had been a quaint parlor in the victorian era but now was chockablock with forensic science gear optical microscopes an electron microscope a gas chromatograph laboratory beakers and racks pipettes petri dishes centrifuges chemicals books and magazines computersand thick wires which ran everywhere when rhyme began doing forensic consulting out of his town house the powerhungry equipment frequently would blow circuit breakers the juice running into the place probably equaled the combined usage by everyone else on the block command volume level three the environmental control unit obediently turned down npr not in the spirit of the season are we the detective asked rhyme didnt answer he looked back at the monitor hey jackson sellitto bent down and petted a small longhaired dog curled up in an nypd evidence box he was temporarily living here his former owner thoms elderly aunt had passed away recently in westport connecticut after a long illness among the young mans inheritances was jackson a havanese the breed related to the bichon frise originated in cuba jackson was staying here until thom could find a good home for him we got a bad one linc sellitto said standing up he started to take off his overcoat but changed his mind jesus its cold is this a record dont know dont spend much time on the weather channel he thought of a good opening paragraph of his letter to the editor bad sellitto repeated rhyme glanced at sellitto with a cocked eyebrow two homicides same mo more or less lots of bad ones out there lon whyre these any badder as often happened in the tedious days between cases rhyme was in a bad mood of all the perps hed come across the worst was boredom but sellitto had worked with rhyme for years and was immune to the criminalists attitudes got a call from the big building brass want you and amelia on this one they said theyre insisting oh insisting i promised i wouldnt tell you they said that you dont like to be insisted can we get to the bad part lon or is that too much to ask wheres amelia westchester on a case should be back soon the detective held up a waitaminute finger as his cell phone rang he had a conversation nodding and jotting notes he disconnected and glanced at rhyme okay here we have it sometime last night our perp he grabs he rhyme asked pointedly okay we dont know the gender for sure sex what rhyme said genders a linguistic concept it refers to designating words male or female in certain languages sex is a biological concept differentiating male and female organisms thanks for the grammar lesson the detective muttered maybe itll help if im ever on jeopardy anyway he grabs some poor schmuck and takes em to that boat repair pier on the hudson were not exactly sure how he does it but he forces the guy or woman to hang on over the river and then cuts their wrists the vic holds on for a while looks likelong enough to lose a shitload of bloodbut then just lets go body not yet coast guard and esure searching i heard plural okay then we get another call a few minutes later to check out an alley downtown off cedar near broadway the perps got another vic a uniform finds this guy ducttaped and on his back the perp rigged this iron barweighs maybe seventyfive poundsabove his neck the vic has to hold it up to keep from getting his throat crushed seventyfive pounds okay given the strength issues ill grant you the perps sex probably is male thom came into the room with coffee and pastries sellitto his weight a constant issue went for the danish first his diet hibernated during the holidays he finished half and wiping his mouth continued so the vics holding up the bar which maybe he does for a whilebut he doesnt make it whos the vic names theodore adams lived near battery park a nineoneone came in last night from a woman said her brother was supposed to meet her for dinner and never showed thats the name she gave sergeant from the precinct was going to call her this morning lincoln rhyme generally didnt find soft descriptions helpful but he conceded that bad fit the situation so did the word intriguing he asked why do you say its the same mo perp left a calling card at both scenes clocks as in ticktock yup the first one was by the pool of blood on the pier the other was next to the vics head it was like the doer wanted them to see it and i guess hear it describe them the clocks looked oldfashioned thats all i know not a bomb nowadaysin the time of the afterevery item of evidence that ticked was routinely checked for explosives nope wont go bang but the squad sent em up to rodmans neck to check for bio or chemical agents same brand of clock looks like spooky one of the respondings said has this face of a moon on it oh and just in case we were slow he left a note under the clocks computer printout no handwriting and they said sellitto glanced down at his notebook not relying on memory rhyme appreciated this in the detective he wasnt brilliant but he was a bulldog and did everything slowly and with perfection he read the full cold moon is in the sky shining on the corpse of earth signifying the hour to die and end the journey begun at birth he looked up at rhyme it was signed the watchmaker weve got two vics and a lunar motif often an astronomical reference meant that the killer was planning to strike multiple times hes got more on the agenda hey why dyou think im here linc rhyme glanced at the beginning of his missive to the times he closed his wordprocessing program the essay about before and after would have to wait chapter a small sound from outside the window a crunch of snow amelia sachs stopped moving she glanced out at the quiet white backyard she saw no one she was a half hour north of the city alone in a pristine tudor suburban house that was still as death an appropriate thought she reflected since the owner of the place was no longer among the living the sound again sachs was a city girl used to the cacophony of urban noisesthreatening and benign the intrusion into the excessive suburban quiet set her on edge was its source a footstep the tall redhaired detective wearing a black leather jacket navy blue sweater and black jeans listened carefully for a moment absently scratching her scalp she heard another crunch unzipped her jacket so her glock was easily accessible crouching she looked outside fast saw nothing and returned to her task she sat down on the luxurious leather office chair and began to examine the contents of a huge desk this was a frustrating mission the problem being that she didnt know exactly what she was looking for which often happened when you searched a crime scene that was secondary or tertiary or whatever fourtimesremoved might be called in fact youd be hardpressed to call this a crime scene at all it was unlikely that any perpetrators had ever been present nor had any bodies been discovered here any loot hidden this was simply a littleused residence of a man named benjamin creeley whod died miles away and had not been to this house for a week before his death still she had to search and search carefullybecause amelia sachs was not here in the role she usually worked crime scene cop she was the lead detective in the first homicide case of her own another snap outside ice snow branch deer squirrelshe ignored it and continued the search that had started a few weeks earlier all thanks to a knot in a piece of cotton rope it was this length of clothesline that had ended the life of fiftysixyearold ben creeley found dangling from the banister of his upper east side town house a suicide note was on the table no signs of foul play evident just after the mans death though suzanne creeley his widow went to the nypd she simply didnt believe that hed killed himself the wealthy businessman and accountant had been moody lately yes but only she believed because hed been working very long hours on some particularly difficult projects his occasionally dour moods were a far cry from suicidal depression he had no history of mental or emotional problems and wasnt taking antidepressants creeleys finances were solid thered been no recent changes to his will or insurance policy his partner jordan kessler was on a business trip to a clients office in pennsylvania but he and sachs had spoken briefly and he confirmed that while creeley had seemed depressed lately he hadnt kessler believed ever mentioned suicide sachs was permanently assigned to lincoln rhyme for crime scene work but she wanted to do more than forensics exclusively shed been lobbying major cases for the chance to be lead detective on a homicide or terrorist investigation somebody in the big building had decided that creeleys death warranted more looking into and gave her the case aside from the general consensus that creeley wasnt suicidal though sachs at first could find no evidence of foul play but then she made a discovery the medical examiner reported that at the time of his death creeley had a broken thumb his entire right hand was in a cast which simply wouldntve let him tie the knot in his hangmans noose or secure the rope to the balcony railing sachs knew because shed tried a dozen times impossible without using the thumb maybe hed tied it before the biking accident a week prior to his death but it just didnt seem likely that youd tie a noose and keep it handy waiting for a future date to kill yourself she decided to declare the death suspicious and opened a homicide file but it was shaping up to be a tough case the rule in homicides is either theyre solved in the first twentyfour hours or it takes months to close them what little evidence existed the liquor bottle hed been drinking from before he died the note and the rope had yielded nothing there were no witnesses the nypd report was a mere halfpage long the detective whod run the case had spent hardly any time on it typical for suicides and he provided sachs with no other information the trail to any suspects had pretty much dried up in the city where creeley had worked and where the family spent most of their time all that remained in manhattan was to interview the dead mans partner kessler in more depth now she was searching one of the few remaining sources for leads the creeleys suburban home at which the family spent very little time but she was finding nothing sachs now sat back staring at a recent picture of creeley shaking the hand of someone who appeared to be a businessman they were on the tarmac of an airport in front of some companys private jet oil rigs and pipelines loomed in the background he was smiling he didnt look depressedbut who does in snapshots it was then that another crunch sounded very close outside the window behind her then one more even closer thats no squirrel out came the glock one shiny millimeter round in the chamber and thirteen underneath it sachs made her way quietly out the front door and circled around to the side of the house pistol in both hands but close to her side never in front of you when rounding a corner where it can be knocked aside the movies always get it wrong a fast look the side of the house was clear then she moved toward the back placing her black boots carefully on the walkway which was thick with ice a pause listening yes definitely footsteps the person was moving hesitantly maybe toward the back door a pause a step another pause ready sachs told herself she eased closer to the back corner of the house which is when her foot slid off a patch of ice she gave a faint involuntary gasp hardly audible she thought but it was loud enough for the trespasser she heard the pounding of feet fleeing through the backyard crunching through the snow damn in a crouchin case it was a feint to draw her to targetshe looked around the corner and lifted the glock fast she saw a lanky man in jeans and a thick jacket sprinting away through the snow helljust hate it when they run sachs had been dealt a tall body and bum jointsarthritisand the combination made running pure misery im a police officer stop she started sprinting after him sachs was on her own for the pursuit shed never told westchester county police that she was here any assistance would have to come through a call and she didnt have time for that im not going to tell you again stop no response they raced in tandem through the large yard then into the woods behind the house breathing hard a pain below her ribs joining the agony in her knees she moved as fast as she could but he was pulling ahead of her shit im gonna lose him but nature intervened a branch protruding from the snow caught his shoe and he went down hard with a huge grunt that sachs heard from forty feet away she ran up and gasping for breath rested the side of the glock against his neck he stopped squirming dont hurt me please shhhh out came the cuffs hands behind your back he squinted i didnt do anything hands he did as he was told but in an awkward way that told her hed probably never been collared he was younger than shed thoughta teenager his face dotted with acne dont hurt me please sachs caught her breath and searched him no id no weapons no drugs money and a set of keys whats your name greg last name a hesitation witherspoon you live around here he sucked in air nodding to his right the house there next door to the creeleys how old are you sixteen whyd you run i dont know i was scared didnt you hear me say i was police yeah but you dont look like a copa policewoman you really are one she showed him her id what were you doing at the house i live next door you said that what were you doing she pulled him up into a sitting position he looked terrified i saw somebody inside i thought it was mrs creeley or maybe somebody in the family or something i just wanted to tell her something then i looked inside and saw you had a gun i got scared i thought you were with them whos them those guys who broke in thats what i was going to tell mrs creeley about broke in i saw a couple of guys break into their house a few weeks ago it was around thanksgiving did you call the police no i guess i should have but i didnt want to get involved they looked like tough tell me what happened i was outside in our backyard and i saw em go to the back door look around and then kind of you know break the lock and go inside white black white i think i wasnt that close i couldnt see their faces they were just you know guys jeans and jackets one was bigger than the other color of their hair i dont know how long were they inside an hour i guess you see their car no did they take anything yeah a stereo cds a tv some games i think can i stand up sachs pulled him to his feet and marched him to the house she noted that the back door had been jimmied pretty slick job too she looked around a bigscreen tv was still in the living room there was lots of nice china in the cabinet the silver was there too and it was sterling the theft wasnt making sense had they stolen a few things as cover for something else she examined the ground floor the house was immaculateexcept for the fireplace it was a gas model she noted but inside there was a lot of ash with gas logs there was no need for paper or kindling had the burglars set a fire without touching anything inside she shone her flashlight over the contents did you notice if those men had a fire going when they were here i dont know maybe there were also streaks of mud in front of the fireplace she had basic crime scene equipment in the trunk of her car shed dust for prints around the fireplace and desk and collect the ash and mud and any other physical evidence that might be helpful it was then that her cell phone vibrated she glanced at the screen an urgent text message from lincoln rhyme she was needed back in the city asap she sent an acknowledging message what had been burned she wondered staring at the fireplace so greg said like can i go now sachs looked him over i dont know if youre aware of it but after any death the police conduct a complete inventory of everything in the house the day the owner dies yeah he looked down in an hour im calling westchester county police and having them check the list against whats here now if anythings missing theyll call me and ill give them your name and call your parents but the men didnt steal anything at all did they after they left you went in through the back door and helped yourself towhat i just borrowed a few things is all from todds room mr creeleys son yeah and one of the nintendos was mine he never returned it the men did they take anything a hesitation didnt look like it she undid the handcuffs sachs said youll have everything back by then put it in the garage ill leave the door open oh like yeah i promise he said breathlessly definitelyonly he started to cry the thing is i ate some cake it was in the refrigerator i dontill buy them another one sachs said they dont inventory food they dont just get everything else back here i promise really he wiped his face on his sleeve the boy started to leave she asked one thing when you heard that mr creeley killed himself were you surprised well yeah why the boy gave a laugh he had a sevenforty i mean the long one whos going to kill themselves they drive a bmw right chapter they were terrible ways to die amelia sachs had pretty much seen it all or so she thought but these were as cruel means of death as she could recall shed spoken to rhyme from westchester and hed told her to hurry to lower manhattan where she was to run two scenes of homicides committed apparently hours apart by somebody calling himself the watchmaker sachs had already run the simpler of the twoa pier in the hudson river it was a fast scene to process there was no body and most of the trace had been swept away or contaminated by the abrasive wind flowing along the river shed photographed and videoed the scene from all angles she noted where the clock had beentroubled that the scene had been disturbed by the bomb squad when theyd collected it for testing but there was no alternative with a possible explosive device she collected the killers note too partly crusted with blood then shed taken samples of the frozen blood she noted fingernail marks on the pier where the victim had held on dangling above the water then slid off she collected a torn nailit was wide short and unpolished suggesting that the victim was a man the killer had cut his way through the chainlink fence protecting the pier sachs took a sample of the wire to check for tool marks she found no fingerprints footprints or tire tread marks near the point of entry or the pool of frozen blood no witnesses had been located the medical examiner reported that if the victim had indeed fallen into the hudson as seemed likely he would have died of hypothermia within ten minutes or so nypd divers and the coast guard were continuing their search for the body and any evidence in the water sachs was now at the second scene the alleyway off cedar street near broadway theodore adams midthirties was lying on his back duct tape gagging him and binding his ankles and wrists the killer had looped a rope over a fire escape ten feet above him and tied one end to a heavy sixfootlong metal bar with holes in the ends like the eye of a needle this the killer had suspended above the victims throat the other end of the rope hed placed in the mans hands being bound adams couldnt slide out from under the bar his only hope was to use all his strength to keep the massive weight suspended until someone happened along to save him but no one had hed been dead for some time and the bar had continued to compress his throat until the body froze solid in the december cold his neck was only about an inch thick under the crushing metal his expression was the chalky neutral gaze of death but she could imagine how his face must have looked for thewhatten or fifteen minutes hed struggled to stay alive growing red from the effort then purple eyes bulging who on earth would murder in these ways which were obviously picked for prolonged deaths wearing a white tyvek bodysuit to prevent trace from her clothes and hair from contaminating the scene sachs readied the evidence collection equipment as she discussed the scene with two of her colleagues in the nypd nancy simpson and frank rettig officers based at the departments main crime scene facility in queens nearby was their crime scene units rapid response vehiclea large van filled with the essential crime scene investigation equipment she slipped rubber bands around her feet to distinguish her prints from the perps another of rhymes ideas but why bother im in the tyvek rhyme not street shoes sachs had once pointed out hed looked at her wearily oh excuse me i guess a perp would never think to buy a tyvek suit how much do they cost sachs fortynine ninetyfive her first thoughts were that the killings were either organizedcrime hits or the work of a psychopath oc clips were often staged like these to send messages to rival gangs a sociopath on the other hand might set up such an elaborate killing out of delusion or for gratification which might be sadisticif it had a sexual motivationor simply cruel for its own sake apart from lust in her years on the street shed learned that inflicting pain was a source of power in itself and could even be addictive ron pulaski in uniform and leather jacket approached the blond nypd patrolman slim and young had been helping out sachs on the creeley case and was on call to assist on cases that rhyme was handling after a bad runin with a perp had put him in the hospital for a long stay hed been offered medical disability retirement the rookie had told sachs that hed sat down with jenny his young wife and discussed the issue should he go back on duty or not pulaskis twin brother also a cop provided input too and in the end he chose to undergo therapy and return to the force sachs and rhyme had been impressed with his youthful zeal and pulled some strings to get him assigned to them whenever possible he later confessed to sachs never to rhyme of course that the criminalists refusal to be sidelined by his quadriplegia and his aggressive regimen of daily therapy were pulaskis main inspiration to get back on active duty pulaski wasnt in tyvek so he stopped at the yellow tape marking the scene jesus he muttered as he stared at the grotesque sight pulaski told her that sellitto and other officers were checking with security guards and office managers in the buildings around the alley to learn if anyone had seen or heard the attack or knew theodore adams he added the bomb squads still checking on the clocks andll deliver em to rhymes later im going to get all the license plates of the cars parked around here detective sellitto told me to her back to pulaski sachs nodded but she really wasnt paying much attention to this information it wasnt useful to her at the moment she was about to search the scene and was trying to clear her thoughts of distractions despite the fact that by definition crime scene work involves inanimate objects theres a curious intimacy to the job to be effective cs cops have to mentally and emotionally become the perps the whole horrific scenario plays itself out in their imaginations what the killer was thinking where he stood when he lifted the gun or club or knife how he adjusted his stance whether he lingered to watch the victims death throes or fled immediately what caught his attention at the scene what tempted and repulsed him what was his escape route this wasnt psychological profilingthat occasionally helpful mediachic portraitpainting of suspects this was the art of mining the huge clutter at crime scenes for those few important nuggets that could lead to a suspects door sachs was now doing this becoming someone elsethe killer whod engineered this terrible end to another human being eyes scanning the scene up and down sideways the cobblestones the walls the body the iron weight im him im him what do i have in mind why did i want to kill these vics why in these ways why on the pier why here but the cause of death was so unusual the killers mind so removed from hers that she had no answers to these questions not yet she pulled on her headset rhyme you there and where else would i be he asked sounding amused ive been waiting where are you the second scene yes what are you seeing sachs im him alleyway rhyme she said into the stalk mike its a culdesac for deliveries it doesnt go through the vics close to the street how close fifteen feet out of a hundredfoot alley howd he get there no sign of tread marks but he was definitely dragged to the place he was killed theres salt and crud on the bottom of his jacket and pants are there doors near the body yes hes pretty much in front of one did he work in the building no ive got his business cards hes a freelance writer his work address is the same as his apartment he mightve had a client there or in one of the other buildings lons checking now good the door thats closest would thatve been someplace the perp could have waited for him yeah she replied have a guard open it up and i want you to search whats on the other side lon sellitto called from the perimeter of the scene no witnesses everybodys fucking blind oh and deaf tooand there must be forty or fifty different offices in the buildings around the alley if anybody knew him it may take a while to find out sachs relayed the criminalists request to open the back door near the body you got it sellitto headed off on this mission blowing warming breath into his cupped hands sachs videotaped and photographed the scene she looked for and found no evidence of sexual activity involving the body or nearby she then began walking the gridwalking over every square inch of the scene twice looking for physical evidence unlike many crime scene professionals rhyme insisted on a single searcherexcept in the case of mass disasters of courseand sachs always walked the grid alone but whoeverd committed the crime had been very careful not to leave anything obvious behind except the note and the clock the metal bar the duct tape and rope she told him this not really in their nature to make it easy for us is it sachs his cheerful mood grated he wasnt right next to a victim whod died this fucking lousy death she ignored the comment and continued working the scene performing a basic processing of the corpse so it could be released to the medical examiner collecting his effects dusting for fingerprints and doing electrostatic prints of shoe treads collecting trace with an adhesive roller like the sort used for removing pet hairs it was likely that the perp had driven here given the weight of the bar but there were no tread marks the center of the alley was covered with rock salt to melt the ice and the grains prevented good contact with the cobblestones then she squinted rhyme something odd here around the body for probably three feet around it theres something on the ground what do you think it is sachs bent down and with a magnifier examined what seemed to be fine sand she mentioned this to rhyme was it for the ice no its only around him and theres none anywhere else in the alley theyre using salt for the snow and ice then she stepped back but theres only a fine residue left its likeyes rhyme he swept up with a broom swept i can see the straw marks its like he scattered handfuls of sand on the scene and then swept it up but maybe he didnt do it there wasnt anything like this at the first scene on the pier is there any sand on the victim or the bar i dont know wait there is so he did it after the killing rhyme said its probably an obscuring agent diligent perps would sometimes use a powdery or granular material of some kindsand kitty litter or even flourto spread on the ground after committing a crime theyd then sweep or vacuum up the material taking most of the trace particles with it but why rhyme mused sachs stared at the body stared at the cobblestone alley im him why would i sweep perps often wipe fingerprints and take the obvious evidence with them but its very rare when someone goes to the trouble of using an obscuring agent she closed her eyes and as hard as it was pictured herself standing over the young man who was struggling to keep the bar off his throat maybe he spilled something but rhyme said doesnt seem likely he wouldnt be that careless she continued to think im careful sure but why would i sweep im him why rhyme whispered he not he the criminalist corrected youre him sachs remember you im a perfectionist i want to get rid of as much evidence as possible true but what you gain by sweeping up rhyme said you lose by staying on the scene longer i think there has to be another reason going deeper feeling herself lifting the bar putting the rope in the mans hands staring down at his struggling face his bulging eyes i put the clock next to his head its ticking ticking i watch him die i leave no evidence i sweep up think sachs whats he up to im him then she blurted im coming back rhyme what im coming back to the scene i mean hes coming back thats why he swept up because he absolutely didnt want to leave anything thatd give us a description of him no fibers hairs shoe prints dirt in his soles hes not afraid well use it to track him to his hideyholehes too good to be leaving trace like that no hes afraid well find something thatll help us recognize him when he comes back okay that could be it maybe hes a voyeur likes to watch people die likes to watch cops at work or maybe he wants to see whos hunting for himso he can start a hunt of his own sachs felt a trickle of fear down her back she looked around her there was as usual a small crowd of gawkers standing across the street was the killer among them watching her right now then rhyme added or maybe hes already been back he came by earlier this morning to see that the vic was really dead which means that he mightve left some evidence somewhere else outside the scene on the sidewalk the street exactly sachs slipped under the tape out of the designated crime scene and looked over the street then the sidewalk in front of the building there she found a half dozen shoe prints in the snow she had no way of knowing if any of them were the watchmakers but severalmade by wide wafflestomper bootssuggested that somebody a man probably had stood in the mouth of the alley for a few minutes shifting weight from foot to foot she looked around and decided there was no reason for anybody to be standing thereno pay phones mailboxes or windows were nearby got some unusual boot prints here in the mouth of the alley by the curb on cedar street she told rhyme large she searched this area too digging into a snowbank got something else what a gold metal money clip her fingers stinging from the cold through the latex gloves she counted the cash inside its got three hundred forty in new twenties right next to the boot prints did the vic have any money on him sixty bucks also pretty fresh maybe the perp boosted the clip and then dropped it getting away she placed it in an evidence bag then finished searching other portions of the scene finding nothing else the back door of the office building opened sellitto and a uniformed guard from the security staff of the building were there they stood back as sachs processed the door itselffinding and photographing what she described to rhyme as a million fingerprints he only chuckled and the dim lobby on the other side she didnt find anything obviously relevant to the murder suddenly a womans panicky voice cut through the cold air oh my god no a stocky brunette in her thirties ran up to the yellow tape where she was stopped by a patrol officer her hands were at her face and she was sobbing sellitto stepped forward sachs joined them do you know him maam the big detective asked what happened what happened nooh god do you know him the detective repeated wracked with crying the woman turned away from the terrible sight my brotherno is heoh god no he cant be she sank to her knees on the ice this would be the woman whod reported her brother missing last night sachs understood lon sellitto had the personality of a pitbull when it came to suspects but with victims and their relatives he showed a surprising tenderness in a soft voice thickened by a brooklyn drawl he said im so sorry hes gone yes he helped her up and she leaned against the wall of the alley who did it why her voice rose to a screech as she stared at the terrible tableau of her brothers death whod do something like this who we dont know maam sachs said im sorry but well find him i promise you gasping for breath she turned dont let my daughter see please sachs looked past her to a car parked half on the curb where shed left it in her panic in the passenger seat was a teenage girl who was staring at sachs with a frown her head cocked the detective stepped in front of the body blocking the girls view of her uncle the sister whose name was barbara eckhart had jumped from her car without her coat and was huddling against the cold sachs led her through the open door into the service lobby that shed just run the hysterical woman asked to use the restroom and when she emerged she was still shaken and pale though the crying was under control barbara had no idea what the killers motive might be her brother a bachelor worked for himself a freelance advertising copywriter he was well liked and had no enemies that she knew of he wasnt involved in any romantic trianglesno jealous husbandsand had never done drugs or anything else illegal hed moved to the city two years earlier that he had no apparent oc connection troubled sachs it moved the psycho factor into first place far more dangerous to the public than a mob pro sachs explained how the body would be processed it would be released by the medical examiner to the next of kin within twentyfour to fortyeight hours barbaras face grew stony why did he kill teddy like that what was he thinking but that was a question for which amelia sachs had no answer watching the woman return to her car sellitto helping her sachs couldnt take her eyes off the daughter who was staring back at the policewoman the look was hard to bear the girl must know by now that this man was in fact her uncle and he was dead but sachs could see what seemed to be a small bit of hope in the girls face hope about to be destroyed hungry vincent reynolds lay on his musty bed in their temporary home which was of all things a former church and felt his souls hunger silently mimicking the grumbling of his bulging belly this old catholic structure in a deserted area of manhattan near the hudson river was their base of operation for the killings gerald duncan was from out of town and vincents apartment was in new jersey vincent had said they could stay at his place but duncan had said no they could hardly do that they should have no contact whatsoever with their real residences hed sounded sort of like he was lecturing but not in a bad way it was like a father instructing his son a church vincent had asked why because its been on the market for fourteen and a half months not a hot property and nobodys going to be showing it this time of year a fast look at vincent dont worry its desanctified it is asked vincent who figured that hed committed enough sins to be guaranteed a direct route to hell if there was one trespassing in a church sanctified or de was the very least of his offenses the real estate agent kept the doors locked of course but a watchmakers skills are essentially those of a locksmith the first clock makers duncan had explained were locksmiths and the man easily picked one of the back door locks then fitted it with a padlock of his own so they could come and go unseen by anyone on the street or sidewalk he changed the lock on the front door too and left a bit of wax on it so theyd know if anybody tried to get in when they were away the place was gloomy and drafty and smelled of cheap cleansers duncans room was the former priests bedroom on the second floor in the rectory portion of the structure across the hall was vincents room where he was now lying the old office it contained a cot table hotplate microwave and refrigerator hungry vincent of course got the kitchen such as it was the church still had electricity in case brokers needed the lights and the heat was on so the pipes wouldnt burst though the thermostat was set very low when hed first seen it knowing duncans obsession with time vincent had said too bad theres no clock tower like big ben thats the name of the bell not the clock on the tower of london in the clock tower the older man had corrected again at the palace of westminster where parliament sits named after sir benjamin hall in the late eighteen fifties it was englands largest bell in early clocks the bells were the only thing that told you the time there were no faces or hands oh the word clock comes from the latin clocca which means bell this man knew everything vincent liked that he liked a lot of things about gerald duncan hed been wondering if these two misfits could become real friends vincent didnt have many hed sometimes go out for drinks with the paralegals and other wordprocessing operators but even clever vincent tended not to say too much because he was afraid hed let slip the wrong thing about a waitress or the woman sitting at a table nearby hunger made you careless just look at what had happened with sally anne vincent and duncan were opposites in many ways but they had one thing in common dark secrets in their hearts and anyone whos ever shared that knows it makes up for vast differences in lifestyle and politics oh yes vincent was definitely going to give their friendship a shot he now washed up again thinking of joanne the brunette theyd be visiting today the flower girl their next victim vincent opened the small refrigerator he took out a bagel and cut it in half with his hunting knife it had an eightinch blade and was very sharp he smeared cream cheese on the bagel and ate it while he drank two cokes his nose stung from the chill meticulous gerald duncan insisted that they wear gloves here too which was kind of a pain but today because it was so cold vincent didnt mind he lay back on the bed imagining what joannes body looked like later today feeling hungry starving to death his gut was drying up from the craving if he didnt have his little hearttoheart with joanne pretty soon hed waste away to steam now he drank a can of dr pepper ate a bag of potato chips then some pretzels starving hungry vincent reynolds would not on his own have come up with the idea that the urge to sexually assault women was a hunger that idea was courtesy of his therapist dr jenkins when he was in detention because of sally annethe only time hed been arrestedthe doctor had explained that he had to accept that the urges he felt would never go away you cant get rid of them theyre a hunger in a way now what do we know about hunger its natural we cant help feeling hungry dont you agree yessir the therapist had added that even though you couldnt stop hunger completely you could satisfy it appropriately you understand what i mean with food youd have a healthy meal when its the appropriate time you dont just snack with people you have a healthy committed relationship leading up to marriage and a family i get it good i think were making progress dont you agree and the boy had taken great heart in the mans message though it translated into something a little different from what the good doctor intended vincent reasoned that hed use the hunger analogy as a helpful guide hed only eat that is have a little hearttoheart with a girl when he really needed to that way he wouldnt become desperateand careless the way he had with sally anne brilliant dont you agree dr jenkins vincent finished the pretzels and soda and wrote another letter to his sister clever vincent drew a few cartoons in the margins pictures he thought she might like vincent wasnt a terrible artist there was a knock on his door come in gerald duncan pushed the door open the men said good morning to each other vincent glanced into duncans room which was perfectly ordered everything on the desk was arranged in a symmetrical pattern the clothes were pressed and hanging in the closet exactly two inches apart this could be one hurdle to their friendship vincent was a slob you want something to eat vincent asked no thanks thats why the watchmaker was so skinny he rarely ate he was never hungry that could be another hurdle but vincent decided hed ignore that fault after all vincents sister never ate much either and he still loved her the killer made coffee for himself while the water was heating he took the jar of beans out of the refrigerator and measured out exactly two spoons worth these clattered as he poured them into the hand grinder and turned the handle a dozen times until the noise stopped he carefully poured the grounds into a paper cone filter inside a drip funnel he tapped it to make sure the grounds were level vincent loved watching gerald duncan make coffee meticulous duncan looked at his gold pocket watch he wound the stem very carefully he finished the coffeehe drank it fast like medicineand then looked at vincent our flower girl he said joanne will you go check on her a thud in his gut so long clever vincent sure im going to the alley on cedar street the police will be there by now i want to see whom were up against whom duncan pulled his jacket on and slung his bag over his shoulder you ready vincent nodded and donned his creamcolored parka hat and sunglasses duncan was saying let me know if people are coming by the workshop to pick up orders or if shes working alone the watchmaker had learned that joanne spent a lot of time in her workshop a few blocks away from her retail flower store the workshop was quiet and dark picturing the woman her curly brown hair her long but pretty face hungry vincent couldnt get her out of his mind they walked downstairs and into the alley behind the church duncan hooked the padlock he said oh i wanted to say something the one for tomorrow shes a woman too thatd be two in a row i dont know how often you like to have yourwhat do you call it a hearttoheart thats right why do you say that duncan asked the killer vincent had learned had a tireless curiosity that phrase too came from dr jenkins his buddy the detention center doc whod tell him to come to his office anytime he wanted and talk about how he was feeling theyd have themselves a good old hearttoheart for some reason vincent liked the words the phrase also sounded a lot better than rape i dont know i just do he added that hed have no problem with two women in a row sometimes eating makes you even hungrier dr jenkins dont you agree as they stepped carefully over the icy patches on the sidewalk vincent asked um what are you going to do with joanne in killing his victims duncan had one rule their deaths could not be quick this wasnt as easy as it sounded hed explained in that precise detached voice of his duncan had a book titled extreme interrogation techniques it was about terrifying prisoners into talking by subjecting them to tortures that would eventually kill them if they didnt confess putting weights over their throats cutting their wrists and letting them bleed a dozen others duncan explained i dont want to take too long in her case ill gag her and tie her hands behind her then get her on her stomach and wrap a wire around her neck and her ankles her kneesll be bent vincent could picture it thats right it was in the book did you see the illustrations vincent shook his head she wont be able to keep her legs at that angle for very long when they start to straighten it pulls the wire around her neck taut and shell strangle herself itll take about eight ten minutes id guess he smiled im going to time it as you suggested when its over ill call you and shes all yours a good old hearttoheart they stepped out of the alley as a blast of freezing wind struck them vincents parka which was unzipped blew open he stopped alarmed on the sidewalk a few feet away was a young man he had a scrawny beard and wore a threadbare jacket a backpack was slung over a shoulder a student vincent guessed head down he kept walking briskly duncan glanced at his partner whats the matter vincent nodded at his side where the hunting knife in a scabbard was stuck into his waistband i think he saw it imim sorry i shouldve zipped my jacket but duncans lips pressed together no novincent hoped he hadnt made duncan unhappy ill go take care of him if you want ill the killer looked toward the student who was walking quickly away from them duncan turned to vincent have you ever killed anyone he couldnt hold the mans piercing blue eyes no wait here gerald duncan studied the street which was deserted except for the student he reached into his pocket and took out the box cutter hed used to slash the wrists of the man on the pier last night duncan walked quickly after the student vincent watched him catching up until the killer was only a few feet behind him they turned the corner heading east this was terriblevincent hadnt been meticulous hed put everything at risk his chance for friendship with duncan his chance for the hearttohearts all because hed been careless he wanted to scream he wanted to cry he reached into his pocket found a kitkat and wolfed it down eating some of the wrapper with the candy five agonizing minutes later duncan returned holding a wrinkled newspaper im sorry vincent said its all right its okay duncans voice was soft inside the paper was the bloody box cutter he wiped the blade with the paper and retracted the razor blade he threw away the bloody paper and gloves he put a new pair on he insisted they carry two or three pairs with them at all times duncan said the bodys in a dumpster i covered it up with trash if were lucky itll be in a landfill or out to sea before somebody notices the blood are you all right vincent thought there was a red mark on duncans cheek the man shrugged i got careless he fought back i had to slash his eyes remember that if somebody resists slash their eyes that stops them resisting right away and you can control them however you want slash their eyes vincent nodded slowly duncan asked youll be more careful oh yes promise really now go check on the flower girl and meet me at the museum at quarter past four okay sure duncan turned his light blue eyes on vincent he gave a rare smile dont be upset there was a problem its been taken care of in the great scheme of things it was nothing chapter the body of teddy adams was gone the grieving relatives too lon sellitto had just left for rhymes and the scene was officially released ron pulaski nancy simpson and frank rettig were removing the crime scene tape still stung by the look of desperate hope in the face of adamss young niece amelia sachs had gone over the scene yet again with even more diligence than usual she checked other doorways and possible entrance and escape routes the perp mightve used but she found nothing else she didnt remember the last time a complicated crime like this had yielded so little evidence after packing up her equipment she mentally shifted back to the benjamin creeley case and called the mans wife suzanne to tell her that several men had broken into their westchester house i didnt know that do have any idea what they stole sachs had met the woman several times she was very thinshe jogged dailyand had short frosted hair a pretty face it didnt look like much was missing she decided to say nothing about the neighbor boy she figured shed scared him into going straight sachs asked if anyone would have been burning something in the fireplace and suzanne replied that no one had even been to the house recently what do you think was going on i dont know but its making the suicide look more doubtful oh by the way you need a new lock on your back door ill call somebody today thank you detective it means a lot that you believe me about ben not killing himself after they hung up sachs filled out a request for analysis of the ash mud and other evidence at the creeleys house and packed these materials separately from the watchmaker evidence she then completed the chainofcustody cards and helped simpson and rettig pack up the van it took two of them to wrap the heavy metal bar in plastic and stow it she was just swinging shut the vans door when she glanced up across the street the cold had driven off most of the spectators but she noted a man standing with a post in front of an old building being renovated on cedar street near chase plaza thats not right sachs thought nobody stands on the street corner and reads a newspaper in this weather if youre worried about the stock market or curious about a recent disaster you flip through quickly find out how much money you lost or how far the church bus plummeted and then keep on walking but you dont just stand in the windy street for page six gossip she couldnt see the man clearlyhe was partially hidden behind the newspaper and a pile of debris from the construction site but one thing was obvious his boots theyd have a traction tread which could have left the distinctive impressions she found in the snow at the mouth of the alley sachs debated most of the other officers had left simpson and rettig were armed but not tactically trained and the suspect was on the other side of a threefoothigh metal barricade set up for an upcoming parade he could escape easily if she approached him from where she was now across the street shed have to handle the takedown more subtly she walked up to pulaski whispered theres somebody at your six oclock i want to talk to him guy with the paper the perp he asked dont know maybe heres what were going to do im getting into the rrv with the cs team theyre going to drop me at the corner to the east can you drive a manual sure she gave him the keys to her bright red camaro you drive west on cedar toward broadway maybe forty feet stop fast get out and vault the barricade come back this way flush him right if hes just out reading the paper well have a talk check his id and get back to work if not im guessing hell turn and run right into my arms you come up behind and cover me got it sachs made a show of taking a last look around the scene and then climbed into the big brown rrv van she leaned forward weve got a problem nancy simpson and frank rettig glanced toward her simpson unzipped her jacket and put her hand on the grip of her pistol no dont need that ill tell you whats going down she explained the situation then said to simpson who was behind the wheel head east at the light make a left just slow up ill jump out pulaski climbed into the camaro fired it up and couldnt resist pumping the gas to get a sexy whine out of the tubi exhausts rettig asked you dont want us to stop no just slow up i want the suspect to be sure im leaving okay simpson said you got it the rrv headed east in the sideview mirror sachs saw pulaski start forwardeasy she told him silently it was a monster engine and the clutch gripped like velcro but he controlled the horses and rolled forward smoothly the opposite direction from the van at the intersection of cedar and nassau the rrv turned and sachs opened the door keep going dont slow up simpson did a great job keeping the van steady good luck the crime scene officer called sachs leapt out whoa a little faster than shed planned she nearly stumbled caught herself and thanked the department of sanitation for the generous sprinkling of salt on the icy street she started along the sidewalk coming up behind the man with the newspaper he didnt see her a block away then a half block she opened her jacket and gripped the glock that rode high on her belt about fifty feet past the suspect pulaski suddenly pulled to the curb climbed out andwithout the guys noticingeasily jumped over the barricade they had him sandwiched in separated by a barrier on one side and the building being renovated on the other a good plan except for one glitch across the street from sachs were two armed guards stationed in front of the housing and urban development building theyd been helping with the crime scene and one of them glanced at sachs he waved to her calling forget something detective shit the man with the newspaper whirled around and saw her he dropped the paper jumped the barrier and sprinted as fast as he could down the middle of the street toward broadway catching pulaski on the other side of the metal fence the rookie tried to leap it caught his foot and went down hard in the street sachs paused but saw he wasnt badly hurt and she continued after the suspect pulaski rolled to his feet and together they sprinted after the man who had a thirtyfoot head start and was increasing his lead she grabbed her walkietalkie and pressed transmit detective five eight eight five she gasped in foot pursuit of a suspect in that homicide near cedar street suspect is heading west on cedar wait now south on broadway need backup roger five eight eight five directing units to your location several other rmpsradio mobile patrols squad carsresponded that they were nearby and en route to cut off the suspects escape as sachs and pulaski approached battery park the man suddenly stopped nearly stumbling he glanced to his rightat the subway no not the train she thought too many bystanders in close proximity dont do it another glance over his shoulder and he plunged down the stairs she stopped calling to pulaski go after him a deep breath if he shoots check your backdrop real carefully let him go rather than fire if theres any doubt at all his face uneasy the rookie nodded sachs knew hed never been in a firefight he called wherere you just go she shouted the rookie took a breath and started sprinting again sachs ran to the subway entrance and watched pulaski descend three steps at a time then she crossed the street and trotted a half block south she drew her gun and stepped behind a newsstand counting downfourthreetwo one she stepped out turning to the subway exit just as the suspect sprinted up the stairs she trained the gun on him dont move passersby were screaming and dropping to the ground the suspects reaction though was simply disgust presumably that his trick hadnt worked sachs had thought he might be coming this way the surprise in his eyes when he saw the subway couldve been phony shed decided it told her that maybe hed been making for the station all alongas a possible feint he raised his hands lethargically on the ground face down come on i now she snapped he glanced at her gun and then complied winded from the run her joints in pain she dropped a knee into the middle of his back to cuff him he winced sachs didnt care she was just in one of those moods they got a suspect at the scene lincoln rhyme and the man who delivered this interesting news were sitting in his lab dennis baker fortyish compact and handsome was a supervisory lieutenant in major casessellittos divisionand had been ordered by city hall to make sure the watchmaker was stopped as fast as possible hed been one of those whod insisted that sellitto get rhyme and sachs on the case rhyme lifted an eyebrow suspect criminals often did return to the scene of the crime for various reasons and rhyme wondered if sachs had actually collared the killer baker turned back to his cell phone listening and nodding the lieutenantwho bore an uncanny resemblance to the actor george clooneyhad that focused humorless quality that makes for an excellent police administrator but a tedious drinking buddy hes a good guy to have on your side sellitto had said of baker just before the man arrived from one police plaza fine but is he going to meddle rhyme had asked the rumpled detective not sos youd notice meaning he wants a big win under his belt and he thinks you can deliver it hell give you all the slackand supportyou need which was good because they were down some manpower there was another nypd detective who often worked with them roland bell a transplant from the south the detective had an easygoing manner very different from rhymes though an equally methodical nature bell was on vacation with his two sons down in north carolina visiting his girlfriend a local sheriff in the tarheel state they also often worked with an fbi agent renowned for his antiterrorism and undercover work fred dellray murders of this sort arent usually federal crimes but dellray often helped sellitto and rhyme on homicides and would make the resources of the bureau available without the typical red tape but the feds had their hands full with several massive enronstyle corporate fraud investigations that were just getting under way dellray was stuck on one of these hence bakers presencenot to mention his influence at the big buildingwas a godsend sellitto now disconnected his cell phone call and explained that sachs was interviewing the suspect at the moment though he wasnt being very cooperative sellitto was sitting next to mel cooper the slightly built ballroomdancing forensic technician that rhyme insisted on using cooper suffered for his brilliance as a crime scene lab man rhyme called him at all hours to run the technical side of his cases hed hesitated a bit when rhyme called him at the lab in queens that morning explaining that hed planned to take his girlfriend and his mother to florida for the weekend rhymes response was all the more incentive to get here as soon as possible wouldnt you say ill be there in a half hour he was now at an examination table in the lab awaiting the evidence with a latexgloved hand he fed some biscuits to jackson the dog was curled up at his feet if theres any canine hair contamination rhyme grumbled i wont be happy hes pretty cute cooper said swapping gloves the criminalist grunted cute was not a word that figured in the lincoln rhyme dictionary sellittos phone rang again and he took the call then disconnected the vic at the piercoast guard and our divers havent found any bodies yet still checking missing persons reports just then crime scene arrived and thom helped an officer cart in the evidence from the scenes sachs had just run about time baker and cooper lugged in a heavy plasticwrapped metal bar the murder weapon in the alleyway killing the cs officer handed over chainofcustody cards which cooper signed the man said goodbye but rhyme didnt acknowledge him the criminalist was looking at the evidence this was the moment that he lived for after the spinal cord accident his passionreally an addictionfor the sport of going oneonone with perps continued undiminished and the evidence from crimes was the field on which this game was played he felt eager anticipation and guilt too because he wouldnt be filled with this exhilaration if not for someone elses loss the victim on the pier and theodore adams their families and friends oh he felt sympathy for their sorrow sure but he was able to wrap up the sense of tragedy and put it somewhere some people called him cold insensitive and he supposed he was but those who excel in a field do so because a number of disparate traits happen to come together within them and rhymes sharp mind and relentless drive and impatience happened to coincide with the emotional distance that is a necessary attribute of the best criminalists he was squinting gazing at the boxes when ron pulaski arrived rhyme had first met him when the young man had been on the force only a short time although that was a year earlierand pulaski was a family man with two childrenrhyme couldnt stop thinking of him as the rookie some nicknames you just cant shake rhyme announced i know amelia has somebody in custody but in case it isnt the perp i dont want to lose time he turned to pulaski give me the lay of the land first scene the pier all right he began uneasily the pier is located approximately at twentysecond street in the hudson river it extends into the river fiftytwo feet at a height of eighteen feet above the surface of the water the murder so theyve recovered the body i dont think so then you meant apparent murder right yessir the apparent murder occurred at the far end of the pier that is the west end sometime between six last night and six this morning the dock was closed then there was very little evidence just the fingernail probably a mans the blood which mel cooper tested and found to be human and type ab positive which meant that both a and b antigensproteinswere present in the victims plasma and neither antia nor antib antigens were in addition a separate protein rh was present the combination of ab antigens and rh positive made the victims the thirdrarest blood type accounting for about percent of the population further tests confirmed that the victim was a male in addition they concluded that he was probably older and had coronary problems since he was taking an anticoagulanta blood thinner there were no traces of other drugs or indications of infection or disease in the blood there were no fingerprints trace or footprints at the scene and no tire tread marks nearby other than those left by employees vehicles sachs had collected a piece of the chain link and cooper examined the cut edges learning that the perp had used what seemed to be standard wire cutters to get through the fence the team could match these marks with those made by a tool if they found one but there was no way to trace the cutter back to its source by the impressions alone rhyme looked over the pictures of the scene particularly the pattern the blood had made as it flowed onto the pier he guessed that the victim had been hanging over the edge of the deck at chest level his fingers desperately wedged into the space between the planks the fingernail marks showed that eventually hed lost his grip rhyme wondered how long the vic had been able to hang on he nodded slowly tell me about the next scene pulaski replied all right that homicide occurred in an alley off cedar street near broadway this alley featured a dead end it was fifteen feet wide and one hundred and four feet long and was surfaced with cobblestones the body rhyme recalled was fifteen feet from the mouth of the alley whats the time of death at least eight hours before he was found the me tour doc said the body was frozen solid so itll take a while to determine with any certainty the young officer suffered from the habit of copspeak amelia told me about the service and fire doors in the alley did anybody ask what time they were locked for the night three of the buildingsre commercial two of them lock their service doors at eight thirty and one at ten the others a government administration building that doors locked at six theres a latenight garbage pickup at ten body discovered when around seven am okay the vic in the alley was dead at least eight hours last door was locked at ten and garbage picked up then so the killing took place between say ten fifteen and eleven pm parking situation i got the license plates of every car in a twoblock radius pulaski was holding up a mobydick of a notebook what the hells that oh i wrote down notes about all the cars thought it might be helpful you know where they were parked anything suspicious about them waste of time we just needed the tag numbers for names and addresses rhyme explained to crosscheck dmv with ncic and the other databases we dont care who needed bodywork or had bald tires or a crack pipe in the backseat well did you what run the tags not yet cooper went online but found no warrants on any of the registered owners of the cars at rhymes instruction he also checked to see if any parking tickets were issued in that area around the time of the killing there were none mel run the vics name warrants anything else about him there were no state warrants on theodore adams and pulaski recounted what his sister had said about himthat he apparently had no enemies or personal life issues that might result in his murder why these vics though rhyme asked are they randomi know dellrays busy but thiss important give him a call and have him run adamss name see if the feds have anything on him sellitto made a call to the federal building and got through to dellraywho was in a bad mood because of the fucking quagmire of a financial fraud case hed been assigned still he managed to look through the federal databases and active case files but the results were negative on theodore adams okay rhyme announced until we find something else lets assume theyre random victims of a crazy man he squinted at the pictures where the hellre the clocks a call to the bomb squad revealed that theyd been cleared of any bio or toxic threat and were on their way to rhymes right now the cash in the faux gold money clip appeared fresh out of an atm machine the bills were clean but cooper found some good prints on the clip unfortunately when he ran them through iafis the fbis integrated automated fingerprint identification system there were no hits the few prints on the cash in adamss pocket came back negative as well and the serial numbers revealed the bills hadnt been flagged by the treasury department for possible involvement in money laundering or other crimes the sand rhyme asked referring to the obscuring agent generic cooper called not looking up from the microscope sort used in playgrounds rather than construction ill check it for other trace and no sand at the pier rhyme recalled sachs telling him was that because as shed speculated the perp was planning to return to the alley or simply because the substance wasnt needed on the pier where the brutal wind from the hudson would sweep the scene clean what about the span rhyme asked the what the bar the vics neck was crushed with its a needleeye span rhyme had made a study of construction materials in the city since a popular way to dispose of bodies was to dump them at job sites cooper and sellitto weighed the length of metalit was eightyone poundsand got it onto the examining table the span was about six feet long an inch wide and three inches high a hole was drilled in each end theyre used mostly in shipbuilding heavy equipment cranes antennas and bridges thats gotta be the heaviest murder weapon ive ever seen cooper said heavier than a suburban asked lincoln rhyme the man for whom precision was everything he was referring to the case of the wife whod run over her philandering husband with a very large suv in the middle of third avenue several months earlier oh thathis cheatin heart cooper sang in a squeaky tenor then he tested for fingerprints and found none he filed off some shavings from the rod probably iron i see evidence of oxidation a chemical test revealed that this was the case no identifying markings nope rhyme grimaced thats a problem thereve got to be fifty sources in the metro area wait amelia said there was some construction nearby oh pulaski said she had me check there and they werent using any metal bars like that i forgot to mention it you forgot rhyme muttered well i know the citys doing some major work on the queensboro bridge lets give em a try rhyme said to pulaski call the work crew at the queensboro and find out if spansre being used there and if so are any missing the rookie nodded and pulled out his mobile phone cooper looked over the analysis of the sand okay got something here thallium sulfate whats that sellitto asked rodent poison said rhyme its banned in this country but you sometimes find it in immigrant communities or in buildings where immigrants work how concentrated veryand theres none in the control soil and residue that amelia collected which means its probably from someplace the perps been maybe hes planning to kill somebody with it pulaski suggested as he waited on hold rhyme shook his head not likely its not easy to administer and you need a high dosage for humans but it could lead us to him find out if thereve been any recent confiscations or environmental agency complaints in the city cooper made the calls lets look at the duct tape rhyme instructed the tech examined the rectangles of shiny gray tape which had been used to bind the victims hands and feet and gag him he announced that the tape was generic sold in thousands of home improvement drug and grocery stores around the country testing the adhesive on the tape revealed very little trace just a few grains of snowremoval salt which matched samples sachs had taken from the general area and the sand that the watchmaker had spread to help him clean up trace disappointed that the duct tape wasnt more helpful rhyme turned to the photos sachs had shot of adamss body then he wheeled closer to the examination table and peered at the screen look at the edges of the tape interesting cooper said glancing from the digital photos to the tape itself what had struck the men as odd was that the pieces of tape had been cut with extreme precision and applied very carefully usually it was just torn off the roll sometimes ripped by the attackers teeth which often left dnaladen saliva and wrapped sloppily around the victims hands ankles and mouth but the strips used by the watchmaker were perfectly cut with a sharp object the lengths were identical ron pulaski hung up then announced they dont use needleeye spans on the work theyre doing now on the bridge well rhyme hadnt expected easy answers and the rope he was holding on to cooper looked it over examined some databases he shook his head generic rhyme nodded at several whiteboards that stood empty in the corner of the lab start our charts you ron you have good handwriting its good enough thats all we need write when running cases rhyme kept charts of all the evidence they found they were like crystal balls to him hed stare at the words and photos and diagrams to try to understand who the perp might be where he was hiding where he was going to strike next gazing at his evidence boards was the closest lincoln rhyme ever came to meditating well use his name as the heading since he was so courteous to let us know what he wants to be called as pulaski wrote what rhyme dictated cooper picked up a tube containing a tiny sample of what seemed to be soil he looked it over through the microscope starting on x power the numberone rule with optical scopes is to start low if you go right to higher magnifications youll end up looking at artistically interesting but forensically useless abstract images looks like your basic soil ill see what elses in it he prepared a sample for the chromatographmass spectrometer a large instrument that separates and identifies substances in trace evidence when the results were ready cooper looked over the computer screen and announced okay weve got some oils nitrogen urea chlorideand protein let me run the profile a moment later his computer filled with additional information fish protein so maybe the perp works in a fish restaurant pulaski said enthusiastically or a fish stand in chinatown or wait maybe the fish counter at a grocery store rhyme asked ron you ever hear a public speaker say before i begin id like to say something uhm i think which is a little odd because if hes talking hes already begun right pulaski lifted an eyebrow my point is that in analyzing the evidence you do something before you start which is what find out where the evidence came from now where did sachs collect the fish protein dirt he looked at the tag oh where is oh inside the victims jacket so whom does the evidence tell us something about the victim not the perp exactly is it helpful to know that he has it in his jacket not on who knows maybe it will be but the important point is to not blindly send the troops to every fishmonger in the city too fast you comfortable with that theory ron real comfortable im so pleased write down the fishy soil under the victims profile and lets get on with it shall we whens the medical examiner sending us a report cooper said could be a while coming up on christmastime sellitto sang tis the season to be killing pulaski gave a frown rhyme explained to him the deadliest times of the year are hot spells and holidays remember ron stress doesnt kill people people kill peoplebut stress makes em do it got fibers here brown cooper announced he glanced at the notes attached to the bag back heel of the victims shoe and his wristwatch band what kind of fibers cooper examined them closely and ran the profile through the fbis fiber database automotive it looks like makes sense hed have a caryou cant really carry an eightyonepound iron bar around on the subway so our watchmaker parked in the front part of the alley and dragged the vic to his resting place what can we tell about the vehicle not much as it turned out the fiber was from carpet used in more than forty models of cars trucks and suvs as for tread marks the part of the alley where hed parked was covered with salt which had interfered with the tires contact with the cobblestones and prevented the transfer of tread marks a big zero in the vehicle department well lets look at his love note cooper slipped the white sheet of paper out of a plastic envelope the full cold moon is in the sky shining on the corpse of earth signifying the hour to die and end the journey begun at birth the watchmaker is it rhyme asked is it what pulaski asked as if hed missed something the full moon obviously today pulaski flipped through rhymes new york times yep full whats he mean by the cold moon in caps dennis baker asked cooper did some searching on the internet okay its a month in the lunar calendar we use the solar calendar three hundred and sixtyfive days a year based on the sun the lunar calendar marks time from new moon to new moon the names of the months describe the cycle of our lives from birth to death theyre named according to milestones in the year the strawberry moon in the spring the harvest moon and hunter moon in the fall the cold moon is in december the month of hibernation and death as rhyme had noted earlier killers referencing the moon or astrological themes tended to be serial perps there was some literature suggesting that people were actually motivated by the moon to commit crimes but rhyme believed that was simply the influence of suggestionlike the increase in alien abduction reports just after steven spielbergs film close encounters of the third kind was released run the name watchmaker through the databases along with cold moon oh and the other lunar months too after ten minutes of searching through the fbis violent criminal apprehension program and the national crime information center as well as state databases they had no hits rhyme asked cooper to find out where the poem itself had come from but he found nothing even close in dozens of poetry websites the tech also called a professor of literature at new york university a man who helped them on occasion hed never heard of it and the poem was either too obscure to turn up in a search engine or more likely it was the watchmakers own creation cooper said as for the note itself its generic paper from a computer printer hewlettpackard laserjet ink nothing distinctive rhyme shook his head frustrated at the absence of leads if the watchmaker was in fact a cyclical killer he could be somewhere right now checking outor even murderinghis next victim a moment later amelia sachs arrived pulled off her jacket she was introduced to dennis baker who told her he was glad she was on the case her reputation preceded her the weddingringfree cop added smiling a bit of flirt her way sachs responded with a brisk professional handshake all in a days work for a woman on the force rhyme briefed her on what theyd learned from the evidence so far not much she muttered hes good whats the story on the suspect baker asked sachs nodded toward the door hell be here in a minute he took off when we tried to get him but i dont think hes our boy i checked him out married been a broker with the same firm for five years no warrants i dont even think he could carry it she nodded at the iron span there was a knock on the door behind her two uniformed officers brought in an unhappylooking man in handcuffs ari cobb was in his midthirties goodlooking in a dimeadozen businessman way the slightly built man was wearing a nice coat probably cashmere though it was stained with what looked like street sludge presumably from his arrest whats the story sellitto asked him gruffly as i told hera cool nod toward sachsi was just walking to the subway on cedar street last night and i dropped some money thats it right there he nodded toward the bills and money clip this morning i realized what happened and came back to look for it i saw the police there i dont know i just didnt want to get involved im a broker i have clients whore real sensitive about publicity it could hurt my business it was only then that the man seemed to realize that rhyme was in a wheelchair he blinked once got over it and resumed his indignant visage once more a search of his clothing found none of the finegrained sand blood or other trace to link him to the killings like sachs rhyme doubted this was the watchmaker but given the gravity of the crimes he wasnt going to be careless print him rhyme ordered cooper did so and found that the friction ridges on the money clip were his a check of dmv revealed that cobb didnt own a car and a call to his credit card companies showed that he hadnt rented one recently using his plastic when did you drop the money sellitto asked he explained that hed left work about seven thirty the previous night hed had some drinks with friends then left about nine and walked to the subway he remembered pulling a subway pass out of his pocket when he was walking along cedar which was probably when he lost the clip he continued on to the station and returned home the upper east side about his wife was on a business trip so he went to a bar near his apartment for dinner by himself he got home about eleven sellitto made some calls to check out his story the night guard at his office confirmed hed left at seven thirty a credit card receipt showed he was at a bar down on water street around nine and the doorman in his building and a neighbor confirmed that he had returned to his apartment at the time that he said it seemed impossible for him to have abducted two victims killed one at the pier and then arranged the death of theodore adams in the alley all between nine fifteen and eleven sellitto said were investigating a very serious crime here it happened near where you were last night did you notice anything that could help us no nothing at all i swear id help if i could the killer could be going to strike again you know im sorry about that he said not sounding very sorry at all but i panicked thats not a crime sellitto glanced at his guards take him outside for a minute after he was gone baker muttered waste of time sachs shook her head he knows something ive got a hunch rhyme deferred to sachs when it came to what he calledwith some condescensionthe people side of being a cop witnesses psychology and god forbid hunches okay he said but what do we do with your hunch it wasnt sachs who responded though but lon sellitto he said got an idea he opened his jacket revealing an impossibly wrinkled shirt and fished out his cell phone chapter vincent reynolds was walking down the chilly streets of soho in the blue light of this deserted part of the neighborhood east of broadway some blocks from the areas chic restaurants and boutiques he was fifty feet behind his flower girljoanne the woman who would soon be his his eyes were on her and he felt a hunger keen and electric as intense as the one hed felt the night he met gerald duncan for the first time which had proved to be a very important moment for vincent reynolds after the sally anne incidentwhen vincent got arrested because he lost controlhe told himself that hed have to be smarter hed wear a ski mask hed take the women from behind so they couldnt see him hed use a condom which helped him slow down anyway hed never hunt close to home hed vary the techniques and the neighborhoods of the attacks hed plan the rapes carefully and be prepared to walk away if there was a risk hed get caught well that was his theory but in the past year itd been getting harder and harder to control the hunger impulse would take over and hed see a woman by herself on the street and think i have to have her now i dont care if anybody sees me the hunger does that to you two weeks earlier hed been having a piece of chocolate cake and a coke at a diner up the street from the office where he regularly temped he glanced at the waitress a new one she had a round face and a slim figure curls of golden hair he noticed her tight blue blouse that was two buttons open and in his soul the hunger erupted she smiled at him as she brought his check and he decided he had to have her right away he heard her say to her boss she was going into the alley for a cigarette vincent paid and stepped outside he walked to the alley and then glanced into it there she was in her coat leaning against the wall looking away from him it was latehe preferred the to pm shiftand though there were some passersby on the sidewalk the alley was completely empty the air was cold the cobblestones would be colder but he didnt care her body would keep him warm it was then that he heard a voice whisper in his ear wait five minutes vincent jumped and swiveled around to look at a man with a round face and lean body in his fifties with a calm way about him he was gazing past vincent into the alley what wait whore you vincent wasnt afraid exactlyhe was two inches taller fifty pounds heavierbut the odd look in the mans shockingly blue eyes spooked him that doesnt matter pretend were just friends talking fuck that heart pounding hands shaking vincent started to walk away wait the man said softly once more his voice was almost hypnotic the rapist waited a minute later he saw a door open in a building across the alley from the back of the restaurant the waitress walked to the doorway and spoke to two men one was in a suit the other was in a police uniform jesus vincent whispered its a sting the man said shes a cop the owners running numbers out of the restaurant i think theyre setting him up vincent recovered fast so that doesnt matter to me if youd done what you had in mind youd be in cuffs now or shot dead had in mind vincent asked trying to sound innocent i dont know what youre talking about the stranger only smiled motioning vincent up the street do you live here a pause then vincent answered new jersey you work in the city yeah you know manhattan well pretty good the man nodded looking vincent up and down he identified himself as gerald duncan and suggested they go someplace warm to talk they walked three blocks to a diner and duncan had coffee and vincent had another piece of cake and a soda they talked about the weather the city budget downtown manhattan at midnight then duncan said just a thought vincent if youre interested in a little work i could use somebody who isnt overly concerned with the law and it might let you practice yourhobby he nodded back in the direction of the alley collecting sitcoms from the seventies asked clever vincent duncan smiled again and vincent decided he liked the man what do you want me to do ive only been to new york a few times i need a man who knows the streets the subways traffic patterns neighborhoodswho knows something about the way police work the details ill save for later hmm what line are you in vincent had asked businessman well let it go at that hmm vincent told himself to leave but he felt the lure of the mans commentabout practicing his hobby anything that might help him feed the hunger was worth considering even if it was risky they continued to talk for a half hour sharing some information withholding some duncan explained that his hobby was collecting antique watches which he repaired himself hed even built a few from scratch as hed finished his fourth dessert of the day vincent asked how did you know she was a cop duncan seemed to debate for a moment then he said ive been checking out somebody at the diner the man at the end of the counter remember him he was in the dark suit vincent nodded ive been following him for the past month im going to kill him vincent smiled youre kidding i dont really kid and vincent had learned that was true there was no clever gerald or hungry gerald there was just one calm and meticulous gerald who expressed his intention that night to kill the man in the dinerwalter somebodyin the same matteroffact way that hed made good on that promise by cutting the son of a bitchs wrists and watching him struggle until he fell from a pier into the freezing brown water of the hudson river the watchmaker had gone on to tell vincent that he was in town to kill other people too among them were some women as long as vincent was careful and didnt spend more than twenty or thirty minutes he could have their bodies after they were deadto do what he wished in exchange vincent would help himas a guide to the city and its roads and transportation system and to stand guard and sometimes drive the getaway car so you interested i guess vincent said though his private response was a lot more enthusiastic than that and vincent was now hard at work on this job following the third victim joanne harper their flower girl clever vincent had dubbed her he watched her take out a key and disappear through the service door to her workshop he eased to a stop ate a candy bar and leaned against a lamp pole looking through the shops grimy window his hand touched the bulge at his waistband where the buck knife rested staring at the vague form of joanne turning on lights taking her coat off moving around the workshop she was alone gripping the knife he wondered if she had freckles he wondered what her perfume smelled like he wondered if she whimpered when she was in pain did she but no he shouldnt think like this he was here only to get information he couldnt break the rules couldnt disappoint gerald duncan vincent inhaled the painfully cold air he should wait but then joanne walked near the window he got a good look at her oh shes pretty vincents palms began to sweat of course he could simply take her now and leave her tied up for duncan to kill later that would be something that a friend would understand theyd both get what they wanted after all sometimes you just cant wait the hunger does that to you next time pack warm what were you thinking riding in a pungent cab thirtysomething kathryn dance held her hands out in front of a backseat heater exhaling air that wasnt hot wasnt even warm at best she decided it was uncold she rubbed together her fingers tipped in dark red nails and then gave her blackstockinged knees a chance at the air dance came from a locale where the temperature was seventyfive give or take all yearround and you had to drive up carmel valley road a long long way to find enough sledding snow to keep your son and daughter happy in her lastminute packing for the seminar here in new york somehow shed forgotten that the northeast plus december equals the himalayas she was reflecting here i cant drop the last five pounds of what i gained in mexico last month where shed done nothing but sit in a smoky room interrogating a suspected kidnapper if i cant lose it at least the extra weight ought to do its duty as insulation aint fairshe pulled her thin coat more tightly around her kathryn dance was a special agent with the california bureau of investigation based in monterey she was one of the nations preeminent experts in interrogation and kinesicsthe science of observing and analyzing the body language and verbal behavior of witnesses and suspects shed been in new york for the past three days presenting her kinesics seminar to local law enforcement agencies kinesics is a rare specialty in police work but to kathryn dance there was nothing like it she was a people addict they fascinated her they electrified her confounded and challenged her too these billions of odd creatures moving through the world saying the strangest and most wonderful and terrible thingsshe felt what they felt she feared what scared them she got pleasure from their joy dance had been a reporter after college journalism that profession tailormade for the aimless with insatiable curiosities she ended up on the crime beat and spent hours in courtrooms observing lawyers and suspects and jurors she realized something about herself she could look at a witness listen to his words and get an immediate sense of when he was telling the truth and when he wasnt she could look at jurors and see when they were bored or lost or angry or shocked when they believed the suspect when they didnt she could tell which lawyers were illsuited to the bar and which were going to shine she could spot the cops whose whole heart was in their jobs and the ones who were only biding their time one of the former in particular caught her eye a prematurely silverhaired fbi agent out of the san jose field office testifying with humor and panache in a gang trial she was covering she finagled an exclusive interview with him after the guilty verdicts and he finagled a date eight months later she and william swenson were married eventually bored with the reporters life kathryn dance decided on a career change life turned crazy for a time as she juggled her roles as mother of two small children and wife and grad student but she managed to graduate from ucsanta cruz with a joint masters in psych and communications she opened a jury consulting business advising attorneys which jurors to choose and which to avoid during voir dire jury selection she was talented and made very good money but six years ago she decided to change course once again with the help of a supportive tireless husband and her mother and father who lived in nearby carmel she headed back to school once more the california state bureau of investigation training academy in sacramento kathryn dance became a cop the cbi doesnt break out kinesics as a specialty so dance was technically just another investigative agent working homicides kidnappings narcotics terrorism and the like still in law enforcement talents are spotted early and news of her talent quickly spread she found herself the resident expert in interview and interrogation fine with her since it gave her some bargaining power to trade off undercover and forensic work which she had little interest in she now glanced at her watch wondering how long this volunteer mission would take her flight wasnt until the afternoon but shed have to give herself plenty of time to get to jfk traffic in the city was horrendous even worse than the freeway around san jose she couldnt miss the plane she was eager to get back to her children andfunny about caseloadsthe files on your desk never seem to disappear when youre out of the office they only multiply the cab squealed to a stop dance squinted out the window is this the right address its the one you gave me it doesnt look like a police station he glanced up at the ornate building sure dont thatll be six seventyfive yes and no dance thought to herself it was a police station and yet it wasnt lon sellitto greeted her in the front hallway the detective had taken her course in kinesics the day before at one police plaza and had just called asking if she could come by now to give them a hand on a multiple homicide when hed telephoned hed given her the address and shed assumed it was a precinct house it happened to be filled with nearly as much forensic equipment as the lab at the monterey cbi headquarters but was nonetheless a private home and it was owned by lincoln rhyme no less another fact sellitto had neglected to mention dance had heard of rhyme of coursemany law enforcers knew of the brilliant quadriplegic forensic detectivebut wasnt aware of the details of his life or his role in the nypd the fact he was disabled soon failed to register unless she was studying body language intentionally kathryn dance tended to pay most attention to peoples eyes besides one of her colleagues in the cbi was a paraplegic and she was accustomed to people in wheelchairs sellitto now introduced her to rhyme and a tall intense police detective named amelia sachs dance noted at once that they were more than professional partners no great kinesic deductions were necessary to make this connection when she walked in sachs had her fingers entwined with rhymes and was whispering something to him with a smile sachs greeted her warmly and sellitto introduced her to several other officers dance was aware of a tinny sound coming from over her shoulderearbuds dangling behind her she laughed and shut off her ipod which she carried with her like a lifesupport system sellitto and sachs told her about the homicide case they needed some help ona case that rhyme seemed to be in charge of though he was a civilian rhyme didnt participate much in the discussion his eyes continually returned to a large whiteboard on which were notations of the evidence the other officers were giving her details of the case though she couldnt help but observe rhymethe way he squinted at the board would mutter something under his breath and shake his head as if chastising himself for missing something occasionally his eyes would close once or twice he offered a comment about the case but he largely ignored dance she was amused the agent was used to skepticism most often it arose because she simply didnt look like a typical cop this fivefootfive woman with dark blond hair worn usually as now in a tight french braid light purple lipstick ipod earbuds dangling the gold and abalone jewelry her mother had made not to mention her passionquirky shoes chasing perps didnt usually figure in dances daily life as a cop now though she suspected she understood lincoln rhymes lack of interest like many forensic scientists he wouldnt put much stock in kinesics and interviewing hed probably voted against calling her as for dance herself well she recognized the value of physical evidence but it had no appeal to her it was the human side of crime and crime solving that made her own heart race kinesics versus forensics fair enough detective rhyme while the handsome sardonic and impatient criminalist continued to gaze at the evidence charts dance absorbed the details of the case which was a strange one the murders by the selfanointed watchmaker were horrific sure but dance wasnt shocked shed worked cases that were just as gruesome and after all she lived in california where charles manson had set the standard for evil another detective from the nypd dennis baker now told her specifically what they needed theyd found a witness who might have some helpful information but he wasnt forthcoming with details he claims he didnt see anything sachs added but i have a feeling he did dance was disappointed that it wasnt a suspect but a witness shed be interviewing she preferred the challenge of confronting criminals and the more deceitful the better still interviewing witnesses took much less time than breaking suspects and she couldnt miss her flight ill see what i can do she told them she fished in her coach purse and put on round glasses with pale pink frames sachs gave her the details about ari cobb the reluctant witness laying out the chronology of the mans evening as theyd been able to piece it together and his behavior that morning dance listened carefully as she sipped coffee that rhymes caregiver had poured for her and indulged in half a danish when shed gotten all the background dance organized her thoughts then she said to them okay let me tell you what ive got in mind first a crash course lon heard this yesterday at the seminar but ill let the rest of you know how i handle interviewing kinesics traditionally was studying somebodys physical behaviorbody languageto understand their emotional state and whether they were being deceptive or not most people including me use the term now to mean all forms of communicationnot just body language but spoken comments and written statements too first ill take a baseline reading of the witnesssee how he acts when hes answering things that we know are truthfulname address job things like that ill note his gesturing posture word choice and the substance of what he says once i have the baseline ill start asking questions and find out where he exhibits stress reactions which means hes either lying or has some important issues with the topic im asking him about up until then what ive been doing is interviewing him once i suspect hes lying then the session will become an interrogation i start to whittle away at him using a lot of different techniques until we get to the truth perfect said baker although rhyme was apparently in charge dennis baker dance deduced was from headquarters he had the belabored look of a man on whose shoulders an investigation like this ultimatelyand politicallyrested you have a map of the area were talking about dance said id like to know the geography of the area involved you cant be an effective interrogator without it i like to say i need to know the subjects terrarium lon sellitto gave a fast laugh dance smiled in curiosity he explained lincoln says exactly the same about forensics if you dont know the geography youre working in a vacuum right linc sorry the criminalist asked terrarium you like that ah his polite smile was the equivalent of dances son saying whatever dance examined the map of lower manhattan memorizing the details of the crime scene and of ari cobbs afterwork schedule the previous day as sachs and a young patrol officer named pulaski pointed them out finally she felt comfortable with the facts okay lets get to work where is he a room across the hall bring him in chapter a moment later an nypd patrol officer brought in a short trim businessman wearing an expensive suit dance didnt know if theyd actually arrested him but the way he touched his wrists told her that hed been in cuffs recently dance greeted the man who was uneasy and angry and nodded him to a chair she sat across from himnothing between themand scooted forward until she was in a neutral proxemic zone the term referring to the physical space between a subject and an interviewer this zone can be adjusted to make the subject more or less comfortable she was not too close to be invasive but not so far away as to give him a sense of security you push the edge of edgy shed say in her lectures mr cobb my names kathryn dance im a law enforcement agent and id like to talk to you about what you saw last night this is ridiculous i already told thema nod at rhymeeverything i saw well i just arrived i dont have the benefit of your previous answers jotting responses she asked a number of simple questionswhere he lived and worked marital status and the likewhich gave her cobbs baseline reaction to stress she listened carefully to his answers watching and listening are the two most important parts of the interview speaking comes last one of the first jobs of an interviewer is to determine the personality type of the subjectwhether hes an introvert or extrovert these types arent what most people think theyre not about being boisterous or retiring the distinction is about how people make decisions an introvert is governed by intuition and emotion more than logic and reason an extrovert the opposite assigning personalities helps the interviewer in framing the questions and picking the right tone and physical demeanor to adopt when asking them for instance taking a gruff clipped approach with an introvert will make him withdraw into his shell ari cobb though was a classic extrovert and an arrogant one at thatno kid gloves were needed this was kathryn dances favorite kind of subject she got to kick serious butt when interviewing them cobb cut off a question youve held me way too long i have to get to work what happened to that man isnt my fault respectful but firm dance said oh its not a question of fault now ari lets talk about last night you dont believe me youre calling me a liar i wasnt there when the crime happened im not suggesting youre lying but there still mightve been something you saw that could help us something you think isnt important see part of my job is helping people remember things ill walk you through the events of last night and maybe somethingll occur to you well theres nothing i saw i just dropped some money thats all i handled the whole thing badly and now its a federal case this is such bullshit lets just go back to yesterday one step at a time you were working in your office stenfeld brothers investments in the hartsfield building yeah all day right you got off work at what time seven thirty a little before and what did you do after that i went to hanovers for drinks thats on water street she said always keep your subjects guessing exactly how much you know yeah it was a martini and karaoke thing they call it martuney night like tunes clever ive got a group i meet there we go a lot some friends close friends she noticed that his body language meant he was about to add somethingprobably he was anticipating her asking for their names being too ready with an alibi is an indicator of deceptionthe subject tends to think that offering it is good enough and the police wont bother to check it out or wont be smart enough to figure out that having a drink at pm doesnt exculpate you from a robbery that happened at seven thirty you left when at nine or so and went home yes to the upper east side a nod did you take a limo limo right he said sarcastically no the subway from which station wall street did you walk yes how carefully he said grinning it was icy dance smiled the route i walked down water street cut over on cedar to broadway then south and thats where you lost your money clip on cedar how did that happen her tone and the questions were completely nonthreatening he was relaxing now his attitude was less aggressive her smiles and low calm voice were putting him at ease as near as i can figure it fell out when i was getting my subway pass how much money was it again over three hundred ouch yeah ouch she nodded at the plastic bag containing the money and clip looks like you just hit the atm too worst time to lose money right after a withdrawal yep he offered a grimacing smile when did you get to the subway ninethirty it wasnt later you sure im positive i checked my watch when i was on the platform it was nine thirtyfive to be exact he glanced down at his big gold rolex meaning she supposed that a watch this expensive was sure to tell accurate time and then i went back home and had dinner in a bar near my building my wife was out of town shes a lawyer does corporate financing work shes a partner lets go back to cedar street were there any lights on people home in their apartments no its all offices and stores there not residential no restaurants a few but theyre only open for lunch any construction theyre renovating a building on the south side of the street was anybody on the sidewalks no cars driving slowly suspiciously no cobb said dance was vaguely aware of the other officers watching her and cobb they were undoubtedly impatient waiting like most people for the big confession moment she ignored them nobody really existed except the agent and her subject kathryn dance was in her own worlda zone her son wes would say he was the athlete of the family she looked over the notes shed taken then she closed the notebook and replaced one pair of glasses with another as if she were exchanging reading for distance glasses the prescriptions were the same but instead of the larger round lenses and pastel frames these were small and rectangular with black metal frames making her look predatory she called them her terminator specs dance eased closer to cobb he crossed his legs in a voice much edgier she asked ari where did that money really come from the money you didnt get it at an atm it was during his comments about the cash that she noticed an increased stress levelhis eyes stayed locked on to hers but the lids lowered slightly and his breathing altered both major deviations from his nondeceptive baseline yes i did he countered what bank a pause you cant make me tell you that but we can subpoena your bank records and well detain you until we get them which could take a day or two i went to the fucking atm thats not what i asked i asked where the cash in your money clip came from he looked down you havent been honest with me ari which means youre in serious trouble now the money i dont know probably some of it was from petty cash at my firm which you got yesterday i guess how much i well subpoena your employers books too he looked shocked at this he said quickly a thousand dollars wheres the rest of it three hundred forty in the money clip wheres the rest i spent some at hanovers its a business expense its legitimate as part of my job i was asking where the rest of it is a pause i left some at home at home is your wife back now could she confirm that shes still away then well send an officer to look for the money where is it exactly i dont remember over six hundred dollars how could you forget where six hundred dollars is i dont know youre confusing me she leaned closer still into a more threatening proxemic zone what were you really doing on cedar street walking to the fucking subway dance grabbed the map of manhattan hanovers is here the subways here her finger made a loud sound with every tap on the heavy paper it makes no sense to walk down cedar to get from hanovers to the wall street subway station why would you walk that way i wanted some exercise walk off the cosmopolitans and chicken wings with ice on the sidewalks and the temperature in the teens you do that often no i just happened to last night if you dont walk it often then how do you know so much about cedar street the fact therere no residences the closing time of the restaurants and the construction work i just do what the hells this all about sweat was dotting his forehead when you dropped the money did you take your gloves off to get your subway pass out of your pocket i dont know i assume you did you cant reach into a pocket with winter gloves on okay he snapped you know so much then i did with the temperature as cold as it was why would you do that ten minutes before you got to the subway station you cant talk to me this way she said in a firm low voice and you didnt check the time on the subway platform did you yes i did it was nine thirtyfive no you didnt youre not going to be flashing a fivethousanddollar watch on the subway platform at night okay thats it im not saying anything else when an interrogator confronts a deceptive subject that person experiences intense stress and responds in various ways to try to escape from that stressbarriers to the truth dance called them the most destructive and difficult response state to break through is anger followed by depression then denial and finally bargaining the interrogators role is to decide what stress state the suspect is in and neutralize itand any subsequent onesuntil finally the subject reaches the acceptance state that is confession in which he finally will be honest dance had assessed that though cobb displayed some anger he was primarily in the denial statesuch subjects are very quick to plead memory problems and to blame the interrogator for misunderstandings the best way to break down a subject in denial is to do what dance had just doneits known as attacking on the facts with an extrovert you slam home weaknesses and contradictions in their stories one after another until their defenses are shattered ari you got off work at seventhirty and went to hanovers we know that you were there for about an hour and a half after that you walked two blocks out of your way to cedar street you know cedar real well because you go there to pick up hookers last night between nine and nine thirty one of them stopped her car near the alley you negotiated a price and paid her you got into the car with her you got out of the car around ten fifteen or so thats when you dropped the money by the curb probably checking your cell phone to see if your wife had called or getting a little extra cash for a tip meanwhile the killer had pulled into the alley and you noticed it and saw something what what did you see no yes dance said evenly she stared at him and said nothing more finally his head lowered and his legs uncrossed his lip was trembling he wasnt confessing but shed moved him up a step in the chain of stress response statesfrom denial to bargaining now dance had to change tack she had both to offer sympathy and to give him a way to save face even the most cooperative subjects in the bargaining state will continue to lie or stonewall if you dont leave them some dignity and a way to escape the worst consequences of what theyve done she pulled her glasses off and sat back look ari we dont want to ruin your life you got scared its understandable but this is a very dangerous man were trying to stop hes killed two people and he may be going to kill some more if you can help us find him what weve learned about you here today doesnt have to come out in public no subpoenas no calls to your wife or boss dance glanced at detective baker who said thats absolutely right cobb sighed eyes on the floor he muttered fuck it was three hundred goddamn dollars why the hell did i go back there this morning greed and stupidity though kathryn dance but she said kindly we all make mistakes a hesitation then he sighed again see thiss the crazy thing it wasnt muchwhat i saw i mean youre probably not going to believe me i hardly saw anything i didnt even see a person if youre honest with us well believe you go on it was about tenthirty a little after after i got out of thegirls car i started to walk to the subway youre right i stopped and pulled my cell phone out of my pocket i turned it on to check messages thats when the money fell out i guess it was at the alley i glanced down it and saw some taillights at the end what kind of car sachs asked i didnt see the car just taillights i swear dance believed this she nodded to sachs wait rhyme said abruptly the end of the alley so the criminalist had been listening after all right all the way at the end then the reverse lights came on and it started backing toward me the driver was moving pretty fast so i kept walking then i heard the squeal of brakes and he stopped and shut the engine off he was still in the alley i kept on walking i heard the door slam and this noise like a big piece of metal falling to the ground that was it i didnt see anybody i was past the alley at that point really rhyme glanced at dance who nodded that he was telling the truth describe the girl you were with dennis baker said i want to talk to her too cobb said quickly thirties africanamerican short curly hair her car was a honda i think i didnt see the license plate she was pretty he added this as some pathetic justification name cobb sighed tiffanee with two es not a y rhyme gave a faint laugh call vice ask about girls working regularly on cedar he ordered his slim balding assistant dance asked a few more questions then nodded glanced at lon sellitto and said i think mr cobb here has told us as much as he knows she looked at the businessman and said sincerely thanks for your cooperation he blinked unsure what to make of her comment but kathryn dance wasnt being sarcastic she never took personally the words or glares occasionally even spittle or flung objects from the subjects a kinesic interviewer has to remember that the enemy is never the subject himself but simply the barriers to truth that he raises sometimes not even intentionally sellitto baker and sachs debated for a few minutes and decided to release the businessman without charging him the skittish man left with a look at dance that she was very familiar with part awe part disgust part pure hatred after hed left rhyme who was looking at a diagram of the scene of the killing in the alley said thiss curious for some reason the perp decided he didnt want the vic at the end of the alley so he backed up and picked the spot about fifteen feet from the sidewalk interesting fact but is it useful sachs nodded you know it might be the far end of the alley didnt get any snow it looked like they might notve used salt there we could lift some footprints or tire treads rhyme made a callwith an impressive voice recognition programand sent some officers back to the scene they called back a short time later and reported that they had found fresh tire treads at the end of the alley along with a brown fiber which seemed to match the ones on the victims shoe and wristwatch they uploaded the digital pictures of the fiber and treads and gave the wheelbase dimensions despite her lack of interest in forensics dance found herself intrigued by this choreography rhyme and sachs were a particularly insightful team she couldnt help but be impressed when ten minutes later the technical man mel cooper looked up from a computer screen and said with the wheelbase and those particular brown fibers its probably a ford explorer either two or three years old odds are its the older one rhyme said why did he say that dance wondered sachs saw the frown on her face and answered the brakes squealed ah sellitto turned to dance that was good kathryn you nailed him sachs asked howd you do it she explained the process shed used i went fishing i reviewed everything hed told usthe afterwork bar the subway the cash and money clip the alleyway the chronology of events and the geography i checked out his kinesic reaction to each response the cash was a particularly sensitive subject what was he doing with the money that he shouldntve been an extroverted narcissistic businessman like him i figured it was either drugs or sex but a wall street brokers not buying street drugs hed have a connection that left hookers simple thats slick dont you think lincoln cooper asked dance was surprised to see that the criminalist could shrug he then said noncommitally worked out well we got some evidence it mightve taken us a while to find his eyes went back to the board linc come on we got his vehicle make we wouldnt have if it hadnt been for her sellitto said to dance dont take it personal he doesnt trust witnesses rhyme frowned at the detective its not a contest lon our goal is the truth and my experience has been that the reliability of witnesses is somewhat less than that of physical evidence thats all nothing personal about it dance nodded funny you say that i tell people in my lectures the same thing that our main job as cops isnt throwing bad guys in jail its getting to the truth she too shrugged we just had a case in californiadeath row prisoner exonerated the day before his scheduled execution a private eye friend of mine spent three years working for his lawyer to get to the bottom of what happened he just wouldnt accept that everything was what it seemed to be the prisoner was thirteen hours away from dying and it turned out he was innocent if that pi hadnt kept looking for the truth all those years hed be dead now rhyme said and i know what happened the defendant was convicted because of a witnesss perjured testimony and dna analysis freed him right dance turned no actually there were no witnesses to the killing the real killer planted fake physical evidence implicating him how bout that said sellitto and he and amelia sachs shared a smile rhyme glanced at them both coolly well he said to dance its fortunate that things worked out for the best now i better get back to work his eyes returned to the whiteboard dance said goodbye to them all and pulled on her coat as lon sellitto showed her out on the street dance walked to the curb where she plugged the ipod earbuds back in and clicked the unit on this particular playlist contained folk rock irish and some kickass rolling stones once at a concert shed done a kinesic analysis of mick jagger and keith richards for her friends benefit she was waving down a cab when she realized there was an odd unsettled feeling within her a moment passed before she recognized it she was feeling a nagging sense of regret that her brief involvement in the watchmaker case was now over joanne harper was feeling good the trim thirtytwoyearold was in the workshop a few blocks east of her retail flower store in soho she was among her friends that is to say roses cymbidium orchids birdsofparadise lilies heliconia anthurium and red ginger the workshop was a large groundfloor area in what had been a warehouse it was drafty and cold and she kept most of the rooms dark to protect the flowers still she loved it here the coolness the dim light the smells of lilac and fertilizer she was in the middle of manhattan yes but it seemed more like a quiet forest the woman added some more florists foam to the huge ceramic vase in front of her feeling good for a couple of reasons because she was working on a lucrative project that she had complete discretion to design and because of the buzz from her date the previous night with kevin who knew that angel trumpets needed exceptionally good drainage to thrive and that creeping red sedum flowered in brilliant crimson all the way through september and that donn clendenon whacked three over the wall to help the mets beat baltimore in her father had captured two of the homers with his kodak kevin the cute guy kevin with the dimple and grin sans present or past wives did it get any better than that a shadow crossed the front window she glanced up but saw no one this was a deserted stretch of east spring street and pedestrians were rare she scanned the windows really ought to have ramon clean them well shed wait till warmer weather she continued assembling the vase thinking again about kevin would something work out between them maybe maybe not didnt really matter okay sure it did but a thirtytwoyearold suwsingle urban womanhad to take the didntreallymatter approach but the important thing was she had fun with him having played the postdivorce dating game in manhattan for a few years she felt entitled to have some fun with another man joanne harper who bore a resemblance to the redhead on sex and the city had come here ten years earlier to become a famous artist live in a storefront studio in the east village and sell her paintings out of a tribeca gallery but the art world had other ideas it was too harsh too petty too well un artistic it was about being shocking or troubled or fuckable or rich joanne gave up on fine arts and tried graphic design for a while but was dissatisfied with that too on a whim she took a job in an interior landscaping company in tribeca and fell in love with the business she decided that if she was going to starve at least shed be hungry doing what she was passionate about the joke though was that she became a success she managed to open her own company a few years ago it now included both the broadway retail store and thisthe spring street commercial operation which serviced companies and organizations providing daily flowers for offices and large arrangements for meetings ceremonies and special events she continued to add foam greens eucalyptus and marbles to the vasesthe flowers would be added at the last minute joanne shivered slightly from the chill air she glanced at the clock on the dim wall of the workshop not too long to wait she reflected kevin had to make a couple of deliveries in the city today hed called this morning and told her hed be at the retail shop in the afternoon and hey if youre not doing anything maybe we could go for some cappuccino or something coffee the day after a date now that another shadow fell on the window she looked up again quickly no one but she felt uneasy her eyes strayed to the front door which she never used boxes were stacked up in front of it it was lockedor was it joanne squinted but with the glare from the bright sun she couldnt tell she walked around the worktable to check she tested the latch yes it was locked joanne looked up and gasped a few feet from her on the sidewalk outside was a huge man staring at her tall and fat he was leaning forward and staring through the window of the workshop shielding his eyes he was wearing oldfashioned aviator sunglasses with mirrored lenses a baseball cap and a creamcolored parka because of the glare and the grime on the windows he couldnt see that she was right in front of him joanne froze people sometimes peeked in curious about the place but there was an intensity about his posture the way he hovered that bothered her a lot the front door wasnt special glass anyone with a hammer or brick could break in and with the sparse foot traffic in this part of soho an assault here might go completely unnoticed she backed up perhaps his eyes grew accustomed to the light or he found a bit of clean window and noticed her he jerked back surprised he seemed to debate something then he turned and disappeared stepping forward joanne pressed her face against the window but she couldnt see where hed gone there was something way creepy about himthe way hed just stood there hunched over head cocked hands stuffed into his pockets staring through those weird sunglasses joanne wheeled the vases to the side and glanced outside again no sign of the man still she gave in to the temptation to leave and go to the retail store check the mornings receipts and chat with her clerks until kevin arrived she put on her coat hesitated and left via the service door she looked up the street no sign of him she started toward broadway west the direction the big man had gone she stepped into a thick beam of perfectly clear sunlight which seemed nearly hot the brilliance blinded her and she squinted alarmed that she couldnt see clearly joanne paused not wanting to walk past the alley up the street had the man gone in there was he hiding waiting for her she decided to walk east the opposite direction and loop around to broadway on prince street it was more deserted that way but at least she wouldnt have to walk past any alleys she pulled her coat tighter around her and hurried up the street head down soon the image of the fat man had slipped from her mind and she was thinking once again about kevin dennis baker went downtown to report on their progress and the rest of the team continued to examine the evidence the fax phone rang and rhyme looked at the unit eagerly in hopes it was something helpful but the pages were for amelia sachs rhyme was watching her face closely as she read them he knew the look like a dog after a fox what sachs she shook her head the analysis of the evidence from ben creeleys place in westchester no iafis hits on the prints but there were leather texture marks on some of the fireplace tools and on creeleys desk who opens desk drawers wearing gloves there was of course no database of glove marks but if sachs could find a pair in a suspects possession that matched this pattern that would be solid circumstantial evidence placing him at the scene nearly as good as a clear frictionridge print she continued to read and the mud i found in front of the fireplace it doesnt match the soil in creeleys yard higher acid content and some pollutants like from an industrial site sachs continued there were also some traces of burned cocaine in the fireplace she looked at rhyme and gave a wry smile a bummer if my first murder vic turns out to be not so innocent rhyme shrugged nun or dope dealer sachs murders still murder what else do you have the ash i found in the fireplacethe lab couldnt recover much but they found these she held up a photo of financial records like a spreadsheet or ledger which seemed to show entries totaling millions of dollars they found part of a logo or something on it the techsre still checking it out and theyll send the entries to a forensic accountant see if he can make any sense of it and they also found part of his calendar stuff about getting his car oil changed a haircut appointmenthardly the agenda for the week youre going to kill yourself by the way then the day before he died he went to the st james tavern she tapped a sheetthe recovered page from his calendar a note from nancy simpson explained about the place bar on east ninth street sleazy neighborhood whyd a rich accountant go there seems funny not necessarily she glanced rhymes way then walked to the corner of the room he got the message and followed in the red storm arrow wheelchair sachs crouched down beside him he wondered if shed take his hand since some sensation had returned to his right fingers and wrist holding hands had taken on great importance to them both but there was a very thin line between their personal and their business lives and she now remained purely professional rhyme she whispered i know what let me finish he grunted i have to follow up on this priorities your case is colder than the watchmaker sachs whatever happened to creeley even if he was murdered the perps probably not a multiple doer the watchmaker is he has to be our priority whatever evidence there is about creeleyll still be there after we nail our boy she was shaking her head i dont think so rhyme ive pushed the button ive started asking questions you know how that works words starting to spread about the case evidence and suspects could be disappearing right now and the watchmakers probably targeting somebody else right now too he could be killing somebody else right now and believe me if theres another murder and we drop the ball therell be hell to pay baker told me the request for us came from the top floor insisted i wont drop the ball you get another scene ill run it if bo haumann stages a tactical op ill be there rhyme gave an exaggerated frown tactical you dont get dessert until you finish your vegetables she laughed and now he felt the pressure of her hand come on rhyme were in cop land nobody runs just one case at a time most major cases desksre littered with a dozen files i can handle two troubled by a foreboding he couldnt articulate rhyme hesitated then said lets hope sachs lets hope it was the best blessing he could give chapter he came here amelia sachs standing beside a planter that smelled of urine and sported a dead yellow stalk glanced through the grimy window she suspected the place would be bad knowing the address but not this bad sachs was standing outside the st james tavern on a wedge of broken concrete rising from the sidewalk the bar was on east ninth street in alphabet city the nickname referring to the northsouth avenues that ran through it a b c and d the place had been a terror some years ago a remnant of the gang wastelands on the lower east side it had improved somewhat crack houses were morphing into expensive fixemuppers w vu but it was still a roughandtumble hood sitting in the snow at sachss feet was a discarded hypodermic needle and a spent millimeter shell casing rested on the window ledge six inches from her face what the hell had accountantventure capitalist twohomeowning beemerdriving benjamin creeley been doing in a place like this the day before he died at the moment the large shabby tavern wasnt too crowded through the greasy window she spotted aging locals at the bar or tables spongy women and scrawny men whod get a lot or most of their daily calories from the bottle in a small room in the back were some white men in jeans dungarees work shirts four of them all loudeven through the window she could hear their crude voices and laughter she thought immediately of the punks whod spend hour after hour in the mafia social clubs some slow some lazybut all of them dangerous one glance told her these were men whod hurt people entering the place sachs found a stool at the small end of the bars l where she was less visible the bartender was a woman of around fifty with a narrow face red fingers hair teased up like a countrywestern singers there was a weariness about her sachs thought its not that shes seen it all its that everything she has seen has been in places just like this the detective ordered a diet coke hey sonja called a voice from the back room in the filthy mirror behind the bar sachs could see it belonged to a blond man in extremely tight blue jeans and a leather jacket he had a weasely face and appeared to have been drinking for some time dickey here wants you hes a shy boy come on over here come on and visit the shy boy fuck you somebody else shouted presumably dickey come ere sonja sweetheart sit on shy boys lap itll be comfy real smooth no bumps some guffaws sonja knew that she too was the butt of their mean humor but she called back gamely dickey hes youngern my son thats okayeverybody knows hes a motherfucker huge laughter sonjas eyes met sachss and then looked away quickly as if shed been caught aiding and abetting the enemy but one advantage of drunks is that they cant sustain anythingcruelty or euphoriafor very long and soon they were on to sports and rude jokes sachs sipped her soda asked sonja so hows it going the woman offered an unbreakable smile just fine she had no interest in sympathy especially from a woman who was younger and prettier and didnt tend bar in a place like this fair enough sachs got down to business she flashed her badge subtly and then showed her a picture of benjamin creeley do you remember seeing him in here him yeah a few times whats this about did you know him not really just sold him some drinks wine i remember he wanted red wine we got shitty wine but he drank it he was pretty decent not like some people no need to glance into the back room to indicate whom she meant but i havent seen him for a while maybe a month last time he came in he got into a big argument so i figured he wouldnt be coming back what happened i dont know just heard some shouting and then he was storming out the door who was he arguing with i didnt see it i just heard he ever do drugs that you saw no were you aware that he killed himself sonja blinked no shit were following up on his death id appreciate keeping it to yourself my asking you about it yeah sure can you tell me anything about him god i dont even know his name i guess he was in here maybe three times he have a family yes he did oh thats tough thats harsh wife and a teenage boy sonja shook her head then she said gerte mightve known him better shes the other bartender she works moren me is she here now naw should be here in a while you want i should have her call you give me her number the woman jotted it down sachs leaned forward and nodded toward the picture of creeley and said did he meet anybody in particular here that you can remember all i know is it was in there where they usually hang she nodded at the back room a millionaire businessman and that crowd had two of them been the ones whod broken into the creeleys westchester house and had the marshmallow roast in his fireplace sachs looked into the mirror studying the mens table littered with beer bottles ashtrays and gnawed chicken wing bones these guys had to be in a crew maybe young capos in an organized crime outfit there were a lot of sopranos franchises around the city they were usually petty criminals but often it was the smaller crews who were more dangerous than the traditional mafia which avoided hurting civilians and steered clear of crack and meth and the seamier side of the underworld she tried to get her head around a benjamin creeley gang connection it was tough you see them with pot cokeany drugs sonja shook her head nope sachs leaned forward and whispered to sonja you know what crewre they connected with crew a gang whos their boss who they report to anything sonja didnt speak for a moment she glanced at sachs to see if she was serious and then gave a laugh theyre not in a gang i thought you knew theyre cops at last the clocksthe watchmakers calling cardsarrived from the bomb squad with a clean bill of health oh you mean they didnt find any really tiny weapons of mass destruction inside rhyme asked caustically he was irritated that theyd been out of his possessionmore risk of contaminationand at the delay in their arrival pulaski signed the chainofcustody cards and the patrolman whod delivered the clocks left lets see what weve got rhyme moved his wheelchair to the examination table as cooper unpacked the clocks from plastic bags they were identical the only difference being the blood crusted on the base of the clock that had been left on the pier they seemed oldthey werent electric you wound them by hand but the components were modern the works inside were in a sealed box which had been opened by the bomb squad but both clocks were still running and showed the correct time the housing was wood painted black and the face was antiqued white metal the numbers were roman numerals and the hour and minute hands also black ended in sharp arrows there was no second hand but the clocks clicked loudly every second the most unusual feature was a large window in the top half of the face that displayed a disk on which were painted the phases of the moon centered in the window now was the full moon depicted with an eerie human face staring outward with ominous eyes and thin lips the full cold moon is in the sky cooper went over the clocks with his usual precision and reported that there were no friction ridge prints and only minimal trace evidence all of which matched samples that sachs had collected around both scenes meaning that none of it had been picked up in the watchmakers car or residence who makes them arnold products framingham massachusetts cooper did a google search and read from the website they sell clocks leather goods office decorations gifts upscale the stuffs not cheap a dozen different models of clocks this is the victorian genuine brass mechanism oak modeled after a british clock sold in the eighteen hundreds costs fiftyfour dollars wholesale they dont sell to the public have to go through the dealer serial numbers only on the mechanisms not the clocks themselves okay rhyme ordered make the call me pulaski asked blinking yup you im supposed to call the manufacturer and give them the serial numbers of the mechanism pulaski nodded then see if they can tell us which store it was shipped to one hundred percent rhyme said the rookie took out his phone got the number from cooper and dialed of course the killer might not have been the purchaser he couldve stolen them from a store he couldve stolen them from a residence he couldve bought them used at a garage sale but couldve is a word that goes with the territory of crime scene work rhyme reflected you

politicos to civil servants to business associates to labor bosses to workers its endless new york city is no exception of course but the goodoldboy network amelia sachs found herself enmeshed in at the moment had one difference a prime player was a good old girl the woman was in her midfifties wearing a blue uniform with plenty of gingerbread on the frontcommendations ribbons buttons bars an american flag pin of course like politicians nypd brass who appear in public have to wear the red white and blue she had a pageboy cut of dull saltandpepper hair framing a long somber face marilyn flaherty was an inspector one of the few women at this level in the department the rank of inspector trumps captain she was a senior officer in the operations division this was a command that reported directly to the chief of departmentthe nypd designation for police chief op div had many functions among them liaising with other organizations and agencies about major events in the cityplanned ones like dignitaries visits and unexpected like terrorist attacks flahertys most important role was being the police departments contact with city hall flaherty had come up through the ranks like sachs coincidentally both women had also grown up in adjacent brooklyn neighborhoods the inspector had worked in patrol serviceswalking a beatthen the detective bureau then shed run a precinct stern and brittle thick and broad she was a formidable woman in all ways with the wherewithalokay the ballsto maneuver through the minefield a woman in the upper ranks of law enforcement faces to observe that shed succeeded you had only to glance at the wall and take note of the framed pictures of friends city officials union bosses and wealthy real estate developers and businessmen one depicted her and a stately bald man sitting on the porch of a big beach house another showed her at the metropolitan opera on the arm of a man sachs recognizeda businessman as rich as donald trump another indicator of her success was the size of the one police plaza office in which they now sat flaherty somehow had landed a massive corner model with a view of the harbor while all the command inspectors sachs knew didnt have such nice digs sachs was sitting opposite flaherty the inspectors expansive and polished desk between them the other person present in the room was robert wallace a deputy mayor he sported a jowly selfconfident face and a head of silver hair sprayed into a politicians perfect coif youre herman sachss daughter flaherty said without waiting for a response she looked at wallace patrolman good man i was at the ceremony where they gave him that commendation sachss father had been given a number of commendations over the years she wondered which one this had been for the time he talked a drunken husband into giving up the knife he was holding to his wifes throat the time he went through a plateglass window disarming a robber in a convenience store while he was off duty the time he delivered a baby in the rialto theater with steve mcqueen fighting bad guys up on the silver screen while the latina mother lay on the popcornlittered floor grunting in her rigorous labor wallace asked whats this all about we understand there might be some crimes police officersre involved in flaherty turned her steel gray eyes to sachs and nodded go its possible we have a drug situation and a suspicious death okay wallace said stretching the syllables out with a sigh and wincing the former long island businessman now on the mayors senior staff served as special commissioner to root out corruption in city government hed been ruthlessly efficient at the job in the past year alone hed closed up major fraud schemes among building inspectors and teachers union officials he was clearly troubled at the thought of crooked cops flahertys creased face though unlike wallaces gave nothing away under the inspectors gaze sachs explained about the suicide of benjamin creeley suspicious because of the broken thumb as well as the burned evidence at his house traces of cocaine and the possible connection to some cops who frequented the st james the officersre from the one one eight meaning the th precinct located in the east village the st james shed learned was the watering hole for the station house there were four of them in the bar when i was there but others hang out there too from time to time i have no idea who creeley met with whether it was one or two or a half dozen wallace asked you get their names no i didnt want to ask too many questions at this point and i didnt even get a confirmation that creeley actually met with anyone from the house its likely though flaherty touched a diamond ring on her right middle finger it was huge other than this and a thick gold bracelet she wore no jewelry the inspector remained emotionless but sachs knew this particular news would trouble her a great deal even the hint of dirty cops sent a chill throughout city government but a problem at the would be especially awkward it was a showcase house with a higher share of collars as well as a higher rate of casualties among its officers than other precincts more senior cops moved from the to positions in the big building than from anywhere else after i found out there might be a connection between them and creeley sachs said i hit an atm and took out a couple of hundred bucks i exchanged that for all the cash in the till at the st james some of the bills had to come from the officers there good and you ran the serial numbers flaherty rolled a mont blanc pen absently along the desk blotter thats right negative on the numbers from treasury and justice but nearly all the bills tested positive for cocaine one for heroin oh jesus wallace said dont jump to conclusions flaherty said sachs nodded and explained to the dep mayor what the inspector was referring to many twentydollar bills in general circulation contained some drugs but the fact that nearly every bill the cops in the st james had paid with showed trace was a cause for concern same composition as the coke that was found in creeleys fireplace flaherty asked no and the bartender said shed never seen them with drugs wallace asked do you have any evidence that police officers were directly involved in the death oh no im not even suggesting that the scenario im thinking of is that if any copsre involved at all it was just hooking creeley up with some crew looking the other way and taking some points if he was laundering money or a percentage of the profit from the drugs then burying any complaints or stepping on investigations from other houses any arrests in the past creeley no and i called his wife she said she never saw him doing any drugs but a lot of users can keep a secret pretty well dealers definitely can if theyre not using the product themselves the inspector shrugged of course it could be completely innocent maybe creeley just met a business acquaintance at the st james you mentioned he was arguing with somebody there just before he died seems that way and so one of his business deals went bad real estate or something might have nothing to do with the one one eight sachs nodded emphatically absolutely it could be a pure coincidence that the st jamess a hangout for cops creeley couldve been killed because he borrowed money from the wrong people or was a witness to something wallace looked out the window at the bright cold sky with the death i think weve got to jump on this fast lets get iad involved internal affairs would be the logical outfit to investigate any crimes involving police but sachs didnt want that at least not at this point shed turn the case over to them later but not until shed nailed the perps herself flaherty touched the marbled pen once more then seemed to think better men can get away with all kinds of careless mannerisms women cant afford to not at this level with fingers tipped in perfectly manicured nails the polish clear flaherty placed the pen in her top drawer no not iad why not wallace asked the inspector shook her head its too close to the one one eight word could get back wallace nodded slowly if you think its best i do but sachss elation that internal affairs wasnt going to take over her case didnt last long flaherty added ill find somebody here to give it to somebody senior sachs hesitated only a moment id like to follow up on it inspector flaherty said youre new youve never handled anything internal so the inspectord been doing her homework too thesere different sorts of cases i understand that but i can handle it sachs was thinking im the one who broke the case ive taken it this far and its my first homicide goddamn it dont take it away from me this isnt just crime scene work calmly she said im lead investigator on the creeley homicide im not doing tech work still i think its best so if you could get me all the case files everything you have sachs was sitting forward her index fingernail digging into her thumb what could she do to keep the case it was then that the deputy mayor frowned wait arent you the one who works with that excop in the wheelchair lincoln rhyme thats right he considered this for a moment then looked at flaherty i say let her run with it marilyn why shes got a solidgold reputation we dont need a reputation we need somebody with experience no offense none taken sachs replied evenly these are very sensitive issues inflammatory but wallace liked his idea the mayord love it shes associated with rhyme and hes good press and hes civilian peoplell look at it like shes an independent investigator peoplemeaning reporters sachs understood i dont want a big messy investigation flaherty said sachs said quickly it wont be ive got only one officer working with me who out of patrol ronald pulaski hes a good man young but good after a pause flaherty asked how would you proceed find out more about creeleys connection with the one one eight and the st james and about his lifesee if there mightve been another reason to murder him i want to talk to his business partner maybe there was a problem with clients or some work he was doing and we need to find out more about the connection between creeley and the drugs flaherty wasnt completely convinced but she said okay well try it your way but you keep me informed me and nobody else a huge sense of relief flooded through sachs of course informed by phone or in person no emails or memos flaherty frowned one thing you have any other cases on your plate inspectors dont rise to this level without a sixth sense the woman had asked the one question sachs was hoping she wouldnt im assisting on the homicidethe watchmaker flaherty frowned oh youre on that one i didnt know that compared with a serial doer this st james situation isnt as important rhymes words echoing your case is colder than the watchmaker wallace was lost in thought for a moment then he glanced at flaherty i think we have to be adults here whats going to look worse for the city a man who kills a few people or a scandal in the police department that the press breaks before we control it reporters go for crooked cops like sharks after blood no i want to move on this big sachs bridled at wallaces commentkills a few peoplebut she couldnt deny that their goals were the same she wanted to see the creeley case through to the end for the second time in one day she found herself saying i can handle both cases i promise you it wont be a problem in her mind she heard a skeptical voice saying lets hope sachs chapter amelia sachs collected ron pulaski from rhymes a kidnapping she gathered the criminalist wasnt too pleased about though the rookie didnt seem very busy at the moment how fastve you had her up to pulaski touched the dashboard of her camaro ss then he said quickly i mean it not her you dont need to be so politically correct ron ive been clocked at one eightyseven whoa you like cars more i like cycles you know my brother and i had two of em when we were in high school matching what the cycles oh because were twins you mean naw we never did that dress alike and stuff mom wanted us to but we were dorky enough as it was she laughs now of coursecause of our uniforms anyway when we were riding it wasnt like we could just go out and buy whatever we wanted two matching hondas s or whatever we got whatever we could secondor thirdhand he gave a sly grin one night tony was asleep i snuck into the garage and swapped out the engines he never caught on you still ride god gives you a choice children or motorcycles the week after jenny got pregnant some lucky dude in queens got himself a real fine moto guzzi at a good price he grinned with a particularly sweet engine sachs laughed then she explained their mission there were several leads she wanted to follow up on the other bartender at the st jamesgerte was her namewould be arriving at work soon and sachs needed to talk to her she also wanted to talk to creeleys partner jordan kessler who was returning from his pittsburgh business trip but first there was one other task howd you like to go undercover she asked well okay i guess some of the crew from the one one eight mightve gotten a look at me at the st james so this ones up to you but you wont be wearing any wires anything like that were not getting evidence just information what do i do in my briefcase on the backseat she downshifted hard skidded through a turn straightened the powerful car pulaski picked up the briefcase from the floor got it the papers on top he nodded looking them over the heading on an officiallooking form was hazardous evidence inventory control accompanying it was a memo that explained about a new procedure for doing periodic spot checks of dangerous evidence like firearms and chemicals to make sure they were properly accounted for never heard about that no because i made it up she explained that the point was to give them a credible excuse to go into the bowels of the th precinct and compare the evidence logs with the evidence actually present you tell them youre checking all the evidence but what i want you to look at is the logs of the narcotics thatve been seized in the past year write down the perp date quantity and the arrests well compare it with the district attorneys disposition report on the same cases pulaski was nodding so well know if any drugs disappeared between the time they were logged in and when the perp went to trial or got pled out okay thats good i hope so we wont necessarily know who took them but its a start now go play spy she stopped a block away from the th on a shabby street of tenements in the east village you comfortable with this never done anything quite like it gotta say but sure ill give it a shot he hesitated looking over the form then took a deep breath and climbed out of the car when he was gone sachs made some calls to trusted and discreet colleagues in the nypd the fbi and the dea to see if any organized crime homicide or narcotics cases at the th had been dropped or were stalled under circumstances that might be suspicious no one had heard of anything like that but the statistics revealed that despite its shining conviction record thered been very few organized crime investigations out of the house which suggested that detectives might be protecting local gangs one fbi agent told her that some of the traditional mob had been making forays into the east village once again now that it was becoming gentrified sachs then called a friend of hers running a gang task force in midtown he told her that there were two main posses in the east villageone jamaican one anglo both dealt in meth and coke and wouldnt hesitate to kill a witness or take out somebody whod tried to cheat them or wasnt paying on time still the detective said staging a death to look like a suicide by hanging just wasnt the style of either gang theyd cap him on the spot with a mac or an uzi and head off for a red stripe or a jameson a short time later pulaski returned with his typical voluminous notes this boy writes down everything sachs reflected so howd it go pulaski was struggling to keep from grinning okay i guess you nailed it hm a shrug well the desk sergeant wasnt going to let me in but i gave him this look like what the hellre you doing stopping me you want to call police plaza and tell em theyre not getting the form thanks to you he backed right down surprised me good job she tapped her fist to his and she could see how pleased the young man was at his performance sachs pulled away from the curb and they headed out of the east village when she thought they were far enough away from the house she pulled over and they started comparing the two sets of figures after ten minutes they had the results the quantities noted in the precinct log and the das report were very close only about six or seven ounces of pot and four of cocaine were unaccounted for over the entire year pulaski said and none of the evidence logs looked doctored i figured that might be something to look for too so one motivethat the st james crew and creeley were selling drugs boosted from the ths evidence lockerwasnt in play this small amount missing couldve been lost because of crime scene testing or spillage or inaccurate logging at the scene but even if the cops werent stealing from the locker they might still have been dealing of course maybe the cops scored the drugs directly from a source or they were perped at a bust before they were logged into evidence or creeley himself mightve been the supplier pulaskis first undercover operation answered one question but others remained okay onward and upward ron now tell me you want a bartender or a businessman i dont really care how bout we flip a coin the watchmaker probably bought the clocks at hallersteins timepieces mel cooper announced to rhyme and sellitto hanging up the phone the flatiron district before hed been dragged off by sachs on the creeley case pulaski had tracked down the northeast wholesaler for arnold products the head of the distribution company had just returned the rookies call cooper reported that the distributor didnt keep records by serial number but that if the clocks had been sold in the new york area it would have been at hallersteins the only outlet there the store was located south of midtown in the neighborhood named after the historic triangular building on fifth avenue and twentythird street which resembled an oldtime flatiron check out the store rhyme instructed cooper searched online hallersteins didnt have its own website but was listed in several sites that sold antique clocks and watches it had been in operation for years the owner was a man named victor hallerstein a check on him revealed no record sellitto punched in caller id block and called not identifying himself just to check on the store hours he pretended hed been in before and asked if he was speaking to hallerstein himself the man said he was sellitto thanked him and hung up ill go talk to him see what he has to say sellitto pulled on his coat it was always better to drop in on witnesses unexpectedly phoning ahead gave them a chance to think up lies whether or not they had anything to hide wait lon rhyme said the big detective glanced his way what if he didnt sell the clock to the watchmaker sellitto nodded yeah i thought of thatwhat if he is the watchmaker or a partner or buddy of his or maybe hes behind the whole thing and the watchmakers working for him thought of that too but hey not to worry ive got it covered with a sound track of irish harp music pulsing in her ears california bureau of investigation agent kathryn dance was absently watching the streets of lower manhattan stream past en route to kennedy airport christmas decorations tiny lights and tacky cardboard lovers too arm in arm gloved hands in gloved hands out shopping on vacation she was thinking of bill wondered if he wouldve liked it here funny the small things you remember so perfectlyeven after two and a half years which is such a huge gulf of time under other circumstances mrs swenson this is kathryn dance my husbands name is swenson oh well this is sergeant wilkins chp why would the highway patrol call her at home and not refer to her as agent dance forever challenged in the kitchen dance had been making dinner singing a roberta flack song sotto voce and trying to figure out a food processor attachment she was making split pea soup im afraid i have to tell you something mrs dance its about your husband holding the phone in one hand the cookbook in the other shed stopped moving and stared at the recipe as she took in his words dance could still picture the page in the cookbook perfectly though shed read it only that one time she even remembered the caption under the picture a hearty tasty soup that you can whip up in no time and its nutritious too she could make the soup from memory though she never had kathryn dance knew it would still be some time before she healedwell heal was the word her grief counselor used but that wasnt right because you never did heal shed come to realize a scar that replaces slashed skin is still a scar in time a numbness replaces the pain but the flesh is forever changed dance smiled to herself now in the cab as she noted that shed crossed her arms and curled up her feet a kinesics expert knows what those gestures are all about the streets seemed identical to herdark canyons gray and dim brown punctuated with bright neon atm salad bar nails such a contrast to the monterey peninsula with the pine and oak and eucalyptus and sandy patches dotted with succulent groundcover the passage of the smelly chevy taxi was slow the town she lived in pacific grove was a victorian village miles south of san francisco populated with eighteen thousand souls and nestled between chic carmel and hardworking monterey of steinbecks cannery row fame pacific grove could be traversed in the time it had taken the cab to drive four blocks gazing at the city streets she was thinking dark and congested chaotic utterly frantic yesstill she loved new york city she was after all a people addict and shed never seen so many of them in one place dance wondered how the children would respond to the city maggie would go for it dance knew without doubt she could easily picture the tenyearold her pigtail sweeping back and forth as she stood in the middle of times square and glanced from billboards to passersby to hawkers to traffic to broadway theaters enthralled wes hed be different he was twelve and had had a tough time since his father died but finally his humor and confidence seemed to be returning at last dance had been comfortable enough to leave him with his grandparents while she went to mexico on the kidnapper extradition her first international trip since bills death according to dances mother hed seemed fine when she was away and so shed scheduled a seminar here the nypd and state police had been after her for a year to present one in the area still though she knew shed have to keep an eye on the lean handsome boy with curly hair and dances green eyes he continued to grow sullen at times detached and angry some of it typical male adolescence some of it the residue of losing his father at a young age typical behavior her counselor had explained nothing to worry about but dance felt that it might take a little time before hed be ready for the chaos of new york and shed never push him when she got home shed ask him whether he wanted to visit dance couldnt understand parents who seemed to believe they needed magic incantations or psychotherapy to find out what their children wanted all you really needed to do was ask and listen carefully to their answers yep dance decided that if he was comfortable shed bring them here on vacation next year before christmas a boston girl born and bred dances main objection to the central california coast was the lack of seasons the weather was lovelybut for the holidays you longed for the bite of the cold in your nose and mouth the snowstorms the glowing logs in the fireplace the frost spiderwebbing the windows dance was now pulled from her reverie by her cell phones musical chirp which changed frequentlya joke by the children though the numberone rulenever program a cops phone to silentwas adhered to she looked at caller id hm interesting yes or no kathryn dance gave in to impulse and hit the answer button chapter as he drove the big detective fidgeted he touched his belly he tugged at his collar kathryn dance took in the body language of lon sellitto as he drove the unmarked crown victhe same official vehicle she had in californiafast through the streets of new york grille lights flashing no siren the call shed taken in the cab was from him once again asking if shed help them in the case i know youve got a flight i know youve got to get home but he explained that theyd discovered a possible source for the clocks left at the watchmakers crime scenes and wanted her to interview the man who mightve sold them there was a possibility though slight that he had some connection with the watchmaker and they wanted her opinion about him dance had debated only a brief moment before agreeing shed regretted her abrupt departure from lincoln rhymes town house earlier kathryn dance hated leaving a case unfinished even if it wasnt hers shed had the cab turn around and return to rhymes where lon sellitto was waiting for her now in the detectives car dance asked it was your idea to call me wasnt it hows that sellitto asked not lincolns hes not sure what to make of me his onesecond pause was a flashing sign sellitto said you did a good job with that witness cobb dance smiled i know i did but hes not sure what to make of me another pause he likes his evidence everybody has their weaknesses the detective laughed he hit the siren button and they sped through a red light as he drove dance glanced at him watched his hands and eyes listened to his voice she assessed hes truly obsessed with getting the watchmaker and the other cases undoubtedly sitting on his desk now are as insubstantial as steam and as shed observed when he was in her class yesterday he was dogged and savvy with no problem taking as much time as he needed to understand a problem or to get an interrogation technique right if anybody grew impatient with him well that was their problem his energys nervous but very different from that of amelia sachs who has harm issues he grumbles out of habit but hes essentially a very content man this was something dance did automically the analysis a gesture a glance an offhand statement became to her another piece of that miraculous puzzle that was a human being she was usually able to shut it off when she wishedits no fun to be out for a pinot grigio or anchor steam beer and finding yourself analyzing your drinking buddies and its a lot less fun for them but sometimes the thoughts just flowed this habit went with the territory of being kathryn dance the people addict you have a family he asked two children yes and whats your husband do im a widow dances job was recognizing the effect of different tones of voice and she now delivered these words in a particular way both offhand and grave which he would take to mean i dont want to talk about it a woman might grip her arm in sympathy sellitto did what most of his sex would muttered a genuine but awkward sorry and moved on he began talking about the evidence theyd found in the case and the leadswhich were primarily nonleads he was funny and gruff ah billknow what i think youdve liked this guy dance knew that she did he told her about the store where it was likely the clocks came from i was saying we dont think this hallersteins the doer but that doesnt mean hes not involved theres a chance this could get a little you know hairy im not armed dance pointed out the laws about carrying guns from one jurisdiction to another are very strict and most cops are prohibited from bringing weapons from their home state to another not that it mattered dance had never fired her glock except on the range and hoped to be able to say the same at her retirement party ill stay close sellitto reassured hallersteins timepieces sat by itself in the middle of a gloomy block next to some wholesaler storefronts and warehouses she eyed the place the facade of the building was covered with scabby paint and grime but inside hallersteins shop window protected by thick steel bars the displayed clocks and watches were immaculate as they walked to the door dance said if you dont mind detective you establish the credentials then let me handle things that okay some cops on their local turf wouldve had a problem with her taking over shed sensed though that sellitto would not he had selfconfidence to burn but she needed to ask the question he replied its your you know ball game thats why we called you im going to say some things that sound a little odd but its part of the plan now if i sense hes the perp ill lean forward and intertwine my fingers a gesture that would make her more vulnerable and put the killer subconsciously at easeless likely to go for a weapon if i think hes innocent ill take my purse off my shoulder and put it on the counter got it ready after you dance pushed a button and they were buzzed into the shop it was a small place filled with every kind of clock imaginable tall grandfather clocks similar but smaller tabletop clocks ornate sculptures containing timepieces sleek modernstyle clocks a hundred others as well as fifty or sixty pristine watches they walked to the back where a stocky man balding around sixty was watching them cautiously from behind a counter he was sitting in front of a dismantled clock mechanism that he was working on afternoon sellitto said the man nodded hello im detective sellitto with the police department and this is agent dance sellitto showed his id youre victor hallerstein thats right he pulled off a pair of glasses with an extra magnifying lens on a stalk at the side and glanced at sellittos badge he smiled with his mouth though not his eyes and he shook their hands youre the owner dance asked owner right chief cook and bottle washer ive had the store for ten years same location almost eleven unnecessary information often a sign of deception but it also could simply have been offered because he was uneasy at the unexpected appearance of two cops one of the most important rules in kinesics is that a single gesture or behavior means very little you cant accurately judge a response in isolation but only by looking at clustersfor instance the body language of crossing ones arms has to be considered in light of the subjects eye contact hand movement tone of voice and the substance of what hes saying as well as his choice of words and to be meaningful the behavior has to be consistent when the same stimuli are repeated kinesic analysis kathryn dance would lecture isnt about home runs its about a consistently wellplayed game how can i help you police huh another robbery around the neighborhood sellitto glanced at dance who didnt respond but gave a laugh and looked around i have never seen so many clocks in one place in my life been selling them for a long time are these all for sale make me an offer i cant refuse a laugh then seriously some i wouldnt sell but most sure hey its a store right that one is beautiful he glanced at the one she was indicating an art nouveau style in gold metal with a simple face seth thomas made in nineteen oh five stylish dependable expensive three hundred its only gold plate mass produced now you want expensive hallerstein pointed to a ceramic clock in pink blue and purple painted with flowers dance found it irritatingly gaudy five times as much ah i see that reaction but in the clock collecting world one mans tacky is another mans art he smiled the caution and concern werent gone but hallerstein was slightly less defensive she frowned at noon what do you do wear earplugs a laugh most of them you can shut the chimes off the cuckoosre the ones that drive me crazy so to speak she asked a few more questions about his business filing away a library of gestures and glances and tones and wordsestablishing the baseline for his behavior finally keeping her tone conversational she asked sir wed like to know did someone recently buy two clocks like this one she showed him the picture of one of the arnold products clocks left at the crime scenes her eyes scanned him as he stared at the photo his face neutral she decided he was studying it for too long an indication that his mind was engaged in a debate cant say i recall i sell a lot of clocks believe me faulty memorya flag for the stress state of denial in a deceptive person just like ari cobb earlier his eyes scanned the photo again carefully as if trying to be helpful but his shoulder turned toward her slightly his head dipped and his voice rose in pitch no i really dont think so sorry i cant help she sensed he was deceptive not only from the kinesics but his recognition response in his case the neutral visage which deviated from his expressive baseline most likely he knew the clock but was he deceptive because he simply didnt want to get involved or because he sold clocks to someone he thought might be a criminal or because he was involved in the killings himself hands clasped in front of her or purse on the counter in determining personality type dance had categorized the reluctant witness earlier cobb as an extrovert hallerstein was the opposite an introvert someone who makes decisions based on intuition and emotion she drew this conclusion about the dealer because of his clear passion for his clocks and the fact he was only a moderately successful businessman hed rather sell what he loved than run a massmarket operation and make more profit to get an introvert to tell the truth shed have to bond with him make him feel comfortable an attack like the one on cobb would make hallerstein freeze up instantly dance sighed her shoulders slumping you were our last hope she sighed glancing at sellitto who bless him gave a good portrayal of a disappointed cop shaking his head with a grimace hope hallerstein asked the man who bought these clocks committed a very serious crime theyre the only real leads we have the concern that blossomed in hallersteins face seemed genuine but kathryn dance had met a lot of good actors she put the paper back into her purse those clocks were found next to his murder victims eyes frozen for a moment this is one stressedout shopkeeper weve got ourselves here murder thats right two people were killed last night the clocks mightve been left as messages of some kind were not sure dance frowned the whole thing is pretty confusing if i were going to murder someone and leave a message i wouldnt hide it thirty feet away from the victim id leave it a lot closer and out in the open so we just dont know dance watched his reaction carefully to her calculated misstatement hallerstein gave the same response as would anyone unfamiliar with the situation a shake of the head at the tragedy but no other reaction had he been the killer he would most likely have given a recognition responseusually centering around the eyes and nosethat her words didnt coincide with his knowledge of the facts he wouldve thought but the killer did leave it by the body why would somebody move it and that thought would have been accompanied by very specific gestures and body language a good deceiver can minimize a recognition response so that most people arent aware of it but dances radar was operating at full strength and she believed the dealer passed the test she was convinced he hadnt been at the crime scenes or knew the watchmaker she put her purse on the counter lon sellitto moved his hand away from his hip where it had been resting but her job had just begun theyd established that the dealer wasnt the killer and didnt know him but he definitely had information mr hallerstein the people who were killed died in very unpleasant ways wait they were on the news right a man was crushed and then somebody was thrown into the river right andthat clock was there almost my clock but not quite play the fish carefully she told herself she nodded we think hes going to hurt somebody again and like i said you were our last hope if we have to track down other dealers who mightve sold the killer the clocks it could take weeks hallersteins face clouded dismay is easily recognized in a persons face but it can arise in response to many different emotionssympathy pain disappointment sorrow embarrassmentand only kinesics can reveal the source if the subject doesnt volunteer the information kathryn dance now examined the mans eyes his fingers caressing the clock in front of him his tongue touching the corner of his lips suddenly she understood hallerstein was displaying the flightorfight response he was afraidfor his own safety got it mr hallerstein if you could remember anything to help us wed guarantee you were safe a glance at sellitto who nodded oh you bet well put an officer outside your shop if we need to the unhappy man toyed with a tiny screwdriver dance took the picture out of her purse again could you just take another look see if you can remember anything but he didnt need to look his posture caved in slightly chest receding head forward hallerstein sprinted into the acceptance response state im sorry i lied which you hardly ever heard shed given him the chance to claim that hed looked at the picture too fast or was confused but he didnt care about that do not pass goit was confession time pure and simple i knew the clock right away the thing is though he said if i told anybody hed come back hed hurt me hed destroy all my watches and clocks my whole collection but i didnt know anything about any murder i swear i thought he was a crank his jaw was trembling and he put his hand back on the casing of the clock hed been working on a gesture that dance interpreted to mean he was desperately seeking comfort she sensed something else as well kinesic experts have to judge if the subjects responses are appropriate to the questions theyve been asked or the facts theyve been told hallerstein was troubled by the murders yes and afraid for himself and his treasures but his reaction was out of proportion to what theyd been discussing she was about to explore this when the clock dealer explained exactly why he was so upset hes leaving these clocks at the places where he kills his victims hallerstein asked sellitto nodded well i have to tell you his voice clutched and he continued in a whisper he didnt just buy two clocks he bought ten chapter how many rhyme said shaking his head as he repeated what sellitto had just told him hes planning ten victims looks that way sitting on either side of rhyme in the lab kathryn dance and sellitto showed him the composite picture of the watchmaker that the detective had made at the clock store using efitelectronic facial identification technology a computerized version of the old identikit which reconstructed a suspects features from witness prompts the image was of a white man in his late forties or early fifties with a round face double chin thick nose and unusually light blue eyes the dealer had added that the killer was a little over six feet tall his body was lean and his hair black and medium length he wore no jewelry hallerstein recalled dark clothes but couldnt remember exactly what he was wearing dance then recounted hallersteins story a man had called the shop a month earlier asking for a particular kind of clocknot a specific brand but any one that was compact had a moonphase feature and a loud tick those were the most important she said the moon and a loud tick presumably so that the victims could hear the sound as they died the dealer ordered ten clocks when theyd arrived the man came in and paid cash he didnt give his name or where he was from or why he wanted the clocks but he knew a great deal about timepieces they talked about collectibles whod recently bought certain wellknown timepieces at auctions and what horologic exhibits were presently in the city the watchmaker wouldnt let hallerstein help him out to the car with the clocks hed made several trips carrying them himself as for evidence at the shop there was very little hallerstein didnt do much cash business so most of the nine hundred dollars and change that the watchmaker had paid him was still in the till but the dealer had told sellitto wont do you much good if you want fingerprints he wore gloves cooper scanned the money for prints anyway and found only the dealers which sellitto had taken as controls the serial numbers on the bills werent registered anywhere brushing the cash for trace revealed nothing but dust with no distinguishing characteristics theyd tried to determine exactly when the watchmaker had contacted the dealer and reviewing the telephone logs they found the likely calls but it turned out that theyd been made from pay phones located in downtown manhattan nothing else at hallersteins was of any help a call came in from vice reporting that the officers had no luck finding the prostitute tiffanee with e or y in the wall street area the detective said hed keep on it but since thered been a murder most of the girls had vanished from the neighborhood it was then that rhymes eyes settled on one entry on the evidence chart soil with fish protein dragged from vehicle to alley he then looked at the crime scene photos again thom what the aide called from the kitchen i need you the young man appeared instantly whats wrong lie down on the floor you want me to do what lie down on the floor and mel drag him over to that table i thought something was wrong thom said it is i need you to lie down on the floor now the aide looked at him with an expression of wry disbelief youre kidding now hurry not on this floor i tell you to wear jeans to work youre the one who insists on overpriced slacks put that jacket onthe one on the hook then hurry up on your back a sigh this is going to cost you bigtime the aide pulled the jacket on and lay down on the floor wait get the dog out of there rhyme called jackson the havanese had jumped out of his box apparently thinking it was playtime cooper scooped the dog up and handed him to dance can we get on with it no zip up the jacket its supposed to be winter it is winter cooper replied its just not winter inside thom zipped the jacket up to the neck and lay back mel put some aluminum dust on your fingers and then drag him across the room the tech didnt even bother to ask the purpose of the exercise he dipped his fingers in the dark gray fingerprint powder and stood over thom how do i drag him thats what i want to figure out rhyme said he squinted whats the most efficient way he told cooper to grab the bottom of the jacket and pull it up over thoms face and drag him that way headfirst cooper pulled off his glasses and gripped the jacket sorry he muttered to the aide i know youre just following orders cooper did as rhyme told him the tech was breathing heavily from the effort but the aide moved smoothly along the floor sellitto watched impassively and kathryn dance was trying to keep from smiling thats far enough take the jacket off and hold it open for me sitting thom disrobed can i get up off the floor now yes yes yes rhyme was staring at the jacket the aide climbed to his feet and dusted himself off whats this all about sellitto asked rhyme grimaced damnit the rookie was right and he didnt even know it pulaski yep he assumed the fish trace was from the watchmaker i assumed it was the victims but look at the jacket coopers fingers had left traces of the aluminum fingerprint powder inside the garment in exactly the places where the soil had been found on theodore adamss jacket the watchmaker himself had left the substance on the victim when he was dragging him in the alley stupid rhyme repeated careless thinking infuriated himespecially his own now next step i want to know everything there is to know about fish protein cooper turned back to the computer rhyme then noticed kathryn dance glancing at her watch missed your plane he asked ive got an hour doesnt look good though not with security and christmas crowds sorry the rumpled detective offered if i helped it was worth it sellitto pulled his phone off his belt ill have a squad car sent round i can get you to the airport in a half hour lights and sirens thatd be great i might make it dance pulled on her coat and started for the door wait ive got an offer for you both sellitto and dance turned their heads to the man whod spoken rhyme looked at the california agent howd you like an allexpensespaid night in beautiful new york city she cocked an eyebrow the criminalist continued im wondering if you could stay for another day sellitto was laughing linc i dont believe it youre always complaining that witnesses are useless changing your ways rhyme frowned no lon what i complain about is how most people handle witnessesvisceral gut feel all that woowoo crap pointless but kathryn does it rightshe applies a methodology based on repeatable and observable responses to stimuli and draws verifiable conclusions obviously its not as good as friction ridges or reagent aten in drug analysis but what she does is he looked for a word helpful thom laughed thats the best compliment you could get helpful no need to fill in thom rhyme snapped he turned to dance so how bout it the womans eyes scanned the evidence board and rhyme noticed she wasnt focused on the cold notations of the clues but on the pictures particularly the photographs of theodore adamss corpse his frosted eyes staring upward ill stay she said vincent reynolds walked slowly up the steps of the metropolitan museum on fifth avenue out of breath by the time he got to the top his hands and arms were very stronghelpful for when he had his hearttohearts with the ladiesbut he got zero aerobic exercise joanne his flower girl floated into his thought yes hed followed and come close to raping her but at the last minute another of his incarnations had taken charge smart vincent who was the rarest of the brood the temptation had been great but he couldnt disappoint his friend vincent also didnt think it was a wise idea to give any grief to a man whose advice for dealing with conflict was to slash the eyes so hed merely checked up on her again eaten a huge lunch and taken the train here he now paid and entered the museum noticing a familythe wife resembled his sister hed just written the previous week asking her to come to new york for christmas but hadnt heard back hed like to show her the sights she could hardly come at the moment of course not while he and duncan were busy he hoped shed visit soon though vincent was convinced that having her more in his life would make a difference it would provide a stability that would make him less hungry he believed he wouldnt need hearttohearts quite so often i really wouldnt mind changing a little bit dr jenkins dont you agree maybe shed get here for new years they could go to times square and watch the ball drop vincent headed into the museum proper there wasnt any doubt about where to find gerald duncan hed be in the area that held the important touring exhibitsthe treasures of the nile for instance or jewels from the british empire now the exhibit was horology in ancient times horology duncan had explained was the study of time and timepieces the killer had come here several times recently it drew the older man the way porn shops drew vincent normally distant and unemotional duncan always lit up when he was staring at the displays it made vincent happy to see his friend actually enjoying something duncan was looking over some old pottery things called incense clocks vincent eased up next to him whatd you find asked duncan who didnt turn his head hed seen vincents reflection in the glass of the display case he was like thatalways aware always seeing what he needed to see she was alone in the workshop all the time i was there nobody came in she went to her store on broadway and met this delivery guy there they left i called and asked for her from a pay phone sure meticulous and the clerk said shed gone out for coffee shed be back in about an hour but she wouldnt be in the store meaning i guess shed go back to the workshop good duncan nodded and whatd you find the pier was roped off but nobody was there i saw police boats in the river so they havent found the body yet at cedar street i couldnt get very close but theyre taking the case real seriously a lot of cops there were two that seemed in charge one of them was pretty a girl really hungry vincent perked up the thought of having a hearttoheart with a policewoman had never occurred to him but he suddenly liked the idea a lot young in her thirties red hair you like red hair hed never forget sally annes red hair how it cascaded on the old stinky blanket when he was lying on top of her the hunger soared he was actually salivating vincent dug into his pocket pulled out a candy bar and ate it fast he wondered where duncan was going with his comments about red hair and the pretty policewoman but the killer said nothing more he stepped to another display containing oldtime pendulum clocks do you know what we have to thank for precise timetelling the professor is at the lectern thought clever mr v having replaced hungry mr v for the moment now that hed had his chocolate no trains how come when peoples entire lives were limited to a single town they could start the day whenever they decided six am in london might be six eighteen in oxford who cared and if you did have to go to oxford you rode your horse and it didnt matter if the time was off but with a railroad if one train doesnt leave the station on time and the next one comes barreling through well the results are going to be unpleasant that makes sense duncan turned away from the display vincent was hoping theyd leave now go downtown and get joanne but duncan walked across the room to a large case of thick glass it was behind a velvet rope a big guard stood next to it duncan stared at the object inside a goldandsilver box about two feet square eight inches deep the front was filled with a dozen dials that were stamped with spheres and pictures of what looked like the planets and stars and comets along with numbers and weird letters and symbols like in astrology the box itself was carved with images too and was covered with jewels what is it vincent asked the delphic mechanism duncan explained its from greece more than fifteen hundred years old its on tour around the world what does it do many things see those dials there they calculate the movement of the sun and moon and planets he glanced at vincent it actually shows the earth and planets moving around the sun which was revolutionary and heretical for the timea thousand years before copernicuss model of the solar system amazing vincent remembered something about copernicus from high school sciencethough what he remembered most was a girl in the class rita johansson the recollection he enjoyed most was of the pudgy brunette late one autumn afternoon lying on her tummy in a field near the school a burlap bag over her head and saying in a polite voice please no please dont and look at that dial duncan said interrupting vincents very pleasant memory the silver one its platinum pure platinum thats more valuable than gold right duncan didnt answer it shows the lunar calendar but a very special one the gregorian calendarthe one we usehas three hundred and sixtyfive days and irregular months the lunar calendars more consistent than the gregorianthe months are always the same length but they dont correspond to the sun which means that the lunar month that starts on say april fifth of this year will fall on a different day next year but the delphic mechanism shows a lunisolar calendar which combines the two i hate the gregorian and the pure lunar there was passion in his voice theyre sloppy he hates them vincent was thinking but the lunisolarits elegant harmonious beautiful duncan nodded at the face of the delphic mechanism a lot of people dont believe its authentic because scientists cant duplicate its calculations without computers they cant believe that somebody built such a sophisticated calculator that long ago but im convinced its real is it worth a lot its priceless after a moment he added thereve been dozens of rumors about itthat it contained answers to the secrets of life and the universe you think that duncan continued to stare at the light glistening off the metal in a way does it do anything supernatural of course not but it does something important it unifies time it helps us understand that its an endless river the mechanism doesnt treat a second any differently than it does a millennium and somehow it was able to measure all of those intervals with nearly one hundred percent accuracy he pointed at the box the ancients thought of time as a separate force sort of a god itself with powers of its own the mechanism is an emblem of that view you could say i think wed all be better off looking at time that way how a single second can be as powerful as a bullet or knife or bomb it can affect events a thousand years in the future can change them completely the great scheme of things thats something though vincents tone must have revealed that he didnt share duncans enthusiasm but this was apparently all right the killer looked at his pocket watch he gave a rare laugh youve had enough of my crazy rambling lets go visit our flower girl patrolman ron pulaskis life was this his wife and children his parents and twin brother his threebedroom detached house in queens and the small pleasures of cookouts with buddies and their wives he made his own barbecue sauce and salad dressings jogging scraping together babysitter money and sneaking off with his wife to the movies working in a backyard so small that his twin brother called it a grass throw rug simple stuff so pulaski was pretty uneasy meeting jordan kessler benjamin creeleys partner when the coin toss in sachss camaro earned him the businessman rather than the bartender hed called and arranged to see kessler whod just returned from a business trip his jet meaning really his not a jet had just landed and his driver was bringing him into the city he now wished hed picked the bartender big money made him uneasy kessler was at a clients office in lower manhattan and wanted to postpone seeing pulaski but sachs had told him to be insistent and he had been kessler agreed to meet him in the starbucks on the ground floor of his clients building the rookie walked into the lobby of penn energy transfer quite a placeglass and chrome and filled with marble sculptures on the wall were huge photographs of the companys pipelines painted different colors for factory accessories they were pretty artistic pulaski really liked those pictures in the starbucks a man squinted the cops way and waved him over pulaski bought himself a coffeethe businessman already had someand they shook hands kessler was a solid man whose thin hair was distractingly combed over a shiny crown of scalp he wore a dark blue shirt starched smooth as balsa wood the collar and cuffs were white and the cuff links rich gold knots thanks for meeting down here kessler said not sure what a client would think about a policeman visiting me on the executive floor what do you do for them ah the life of an accountant never rests kessler sipped his coffee crossed his legs and said in a low voice its terrible bens death just terrible i couldnt believe it when i heard howre his wife and son taking it then he shook his head and answered his own question how would they be taking it theyre devastated im sure well what can i do for you officer like i explained were just following up on his death sure whatever i can do to help kessler didnt seem nervous to be talking to a police officer and there was nothing condescending in the way he talked to a man who made a thousand times less money than he did did mr creeley have a drug problem drugs not that i ever saw i know he took pain pills for his back at one time but that was a while ago and i dont think i ever saw him what would you say i never saw him impaired but one thing we didnt socialize much kind of had different personalities we ran our business together and weve known each other for six years but we kept our private lives well private unless it was with clients wed have dinner maybe once twice a year pulaski steered the conversation back on track what about illegal drugs ben no kessler laughed pulaski thought back to his questions sachs had told him to memorize them if you kept looking at your notes she said it made you seem unprofessional did he ever meet with anybody who youd describe as dangerous maybe someone who gave you the impression they were criminals never you told detective sachs that he was depressed thats right you know what he was depressed about nope again we didnt talk much about personal things the man rested his arm on the table and the massive cuff link tapped loudly its cost was probably equal to pulaskis monthly salary in pulaskis mind he heard his wife telling him relax honey youre doing fine his brother chimed in with he may have gold links but youve got a big fucking gun apart from the depression did you notice anything out of the ordinary about him lately i did actually he was drinking more than usual and hed taken up gambling went to vegas or atlantic city a couple times never used to do that could you identify this pulaski handed the businessman a copy of the images lifted from the ash that amelia sachs had recovered at creeleys house in westchester its a financial spreadsheet or balance sheet the patrolman said understand that a little condescending now but it seemed unintentional they were in mr creeleys possession do they mean anything to you nope theyre hard to read what happened to them thats how we found them dont say anything about them being burned up sachs had told him play it close to the chest you mean pulaski offered then decided he shouldnt be using those words with a woman hed blushed his twin brother wouldnt have they shared every gene except the one that made you shy they seem to show a lot of money kessler looked at them again not so much just a few million not so much getting back to the depression how did you know he was depressed if he didnt talk about it just moping around irritated a lot distracted something was definitely eating at him did he ever say anything about the st james tavern the a bar in manhattan no i know hed leave work early from time to time meet friends for drinks i think but he never said who was he ever investigated for what anything illegal no i wouldve heard did mr creeley have any problems with his clients no we had a great relationship with all of them their average return was three four times the s and p five hundred who wouldnt be happy s and ppulaski didnt get this one he wrote it down anyway then the word happy could you send me a client list kessler hesitated frankly id rather you didnt contact them he lowered his head slightly and stared into the rookies eyes pulaski looked right back he asked why awkward bad for business like i said before well sir when you think about it theres nothing embarrassing about the police asking a few questions after someones death is there it is pretty much our job i suppose so and all your clients know what happened to mr creeley dont they yes so us following upyour clientsd expect us to some might others wouldnt in any case you have done something to control the situation havent you hired a pr firm or maybe met with your clients yourself to reassure them kessler hesitated then he said ill have a list put together and sent to you yes pulaski thought threepointer and forced himself not to smile amelia sachs had said to save the big question till the end whatll happen to mr creeleys half of the company which contained the tiny suggestion that kessler had murdered his partner to take over the business but kessler either didnt catch this or didnt take any offense if he did ill buy it out our partnership agreement provides for that suzannehis wifeshell get fair market value of his share itll be a good chunk of change pulaski wrote that down he gestured at the photo of the pipelines visible though the glass door your clientsre big companies like this one mostly we work for individuals executives and board members kessler added a packet of sugar to his coffee and stirred it you ever involved in business officer me pulaski grinned nope i mean worked summers for an uncle one time but he went belly up well not him his printshop its exciting to create a business and grow it into something big kessler sipped the coffee stirred it again and then leaned forward its pretty clear you think theres something more to his death than just a suicide we like to cover all bases pulaski had no clue what he meant by that it just came out he thought back to the questions the well was dry i think thatll be it sir appreciate your help kessler finished his coffee if i can think of anything else ill give you a call you have a card pulaski handed one to the businessman who asked that woman detective i talked to what was her name again detective sachs right if i cant get through to you should i call her is she still working on the case yessir as pulaski dictated kessler wrote sachss name and mobile number on the back of the card pulaski also gave him the phone number at rhymes kessler nodded better get back to work pulaski thanked him again finished his coffee and left one last look at the biggest of the pipeline photographs that was really something he wouldnt mind getting a little one to hang up in his rec room but he supposed a company like penn energy hardly had a gift shop like disney world chapter a heavyset woman walked into the small coffee shop black coat short hair jeans thats how shed described herself amelia sachs waved from a booth in the back this was gerte the other bartender at the st james she was on her way to work and had agreed to meet sachs before her shift there was a nosmoking sign on the wall but the woman continued to strangle a live cigarette between her ruddy index and middle fingers nobody on the staff here said anything about it professional courtesy in the restaurant world sachs guessed the womans dark eyes narrowed as she read the detectives id sonja said you had some questions but she didnt say what her voice was low and rough sachs sensed that sonja had probably told her everything but the detective played along and gave the woman the relevant detailsthe ones that she could share at leastand then showed her the picture of ben creeley he committed suicide no surprise in gertes eyes and were looking into his death i seen him i guess a couple three times she looked at the menu blackboard i can eat for free at the st james but im going to miss dinner since im here with you how bout i buy you some food gerte waved at the waitress and ordered you want anything the waitress asked sachs you have herbal tea if liptons an herb we got it ill have that anything to eat no thanks gerte looked at the detectives slim figure and gave a cynical laugh she then asked so that guy who killed himselfdid he leave a family thats right tough whats his name a question that didnt instill confidence that gerte would be a source of good info and sure enough it turned out that she really wasnt any more helpful than sonja all she recalled was that shed seen him in the bar about once a month for the past three months she too had the impression that hed been hanging out with the cops in their back room but wasnt positive the place is pretty busy you know depends on how you define busy sachs reflected you know any of the officers there personally from the precinct yeah some of them as the beverages arrived gerte recited a few first names some descriptions she didnt know anybodys last name most of em who come inre okay somere shits but aint that the whole worldabout him a nod at creeleys picture i remember he didnt laugh much he was always looking around over his shoulder out the windows nervous like the woman poured cream and equal into her coffee sonja said he had an argument the last time he came in do you remember any other fights nope sipping coffee loudly not while i was there you ever see him with any drugs nope useless sachs was thinking this seemed like a dead end the bartender drew deeply on her cigarette and shot the smoke toward the ceiling she squinted at sachs and gave a meaningless smile with her bright red lips so why you so interested in this guy just routine gerte gave a knowing look and finally said two guys come into the st james and not long after that theyre both dead and thats routine huh two you didnt know no figured you didnt otherwise you woulda said something up front tell me gerte fell silent and looked off sachs wondered if the woman was spooked but she was merely staring at the hamburger and fries coming in for a landing on the table thanks honey she growled then looked back at sachs sarkowski frank sarkowski what happened killed in a robbery i heard when early november something like that whod he see at the st james he was in the back room some is all i know did they know each other a nod toward creeleys picture the woman shrugged and eyed her hamburger she pulled the bun off spread a little mayonnaise on it and struggled with the ketchup lid sachs opened it for her who was he the policewoman asked businessman looked like a bridgeandtunnel guy but i heard he lived in manhattan and had money they were gucci jeans he wore i never talked to him except to take his order howd you find out about his death overheard something them talking the officers from the precinct she nodded any other deaths that you heard of nope any other crimes shakedowns assaults bribes she shook her head pouring ketchup on the burger and making a pool for dunking the fries nothing thats all i know thanks sachs put ten down on the table to cover the womans meal gerte glanced at the money the dessertsre pretty good the pie you ever eat here have the pie the detective added another five gerte looked up and gave an astute smile whym i telling you all this stuff youre wondering right sachs nodded with a smile shed been wondering exactly that you wouldnt understand those guys in the back room the cops the way they look at us sonja and me the things they say the things they dont say the way they joke about us when they think we cant hear em she gave a bitter smile yeah i pour drinks for a living okay thats all i do but that dont give em the right to make fun of me everybodys got the right to some dignity dont they joanne harper vincents dream girl had not returned to the workshop yet the men were in the bandaidmobile parked on east spring street across from the darkened workshop where duncan was about to kill his third victim and vincent was about to have his first hearttoheart in a long long time the suv wasnt anything great but it was safe the watchmaker had stolen it from someplace where he said it wouldnt be missed for a while it also sported new york plates thatd been stolen from another tan explorerto pass an initial callin by the cops if they happened to get spotted they rarely checked the vin number only plates the watchmaker lectured vincent that was smart vincent allowed though hed asked what theyd do if some cop did check the vin it wouldnt match the tag and hed know the explorer was stolen duncan had replied oh id kill him as if it was obvious moving right along duncan looked at his pocket watch and replaced it zipped up the pocket he opened his shoulder bag which contained the clock and other tools of the trade all carefully organized he wound the clock set the time and zipped the cover of the bag closed through the nylon vincent could hear the ticking they hooked up handsfree headsets to their mobile phones and vincent set a police scanner on the seat next to him duncans idea of course he clicked it on and heard a mundane clatter of transmissions about traffic accidents the progress of street closings for some event on thursday an apparent heart attack on broadway a chain snatching life in da big city duncan looked himself over carefully made sure all his pockets were sealed he rolled a doghair remover over his body to pick up trace evidence and reminded vincent to do the same before he came inside for his hearttoheart with joanne meticulous ready vincent nodded duncan climbed out of the bandaidmobile looked up and down the street then walked to the service door he picked the lock in about ten seconds amazing vincent smiled admiring his friends skill he ate two candy bars chewed them down with fierce bites a moment later the phone vibrated and he answered duncan said im inside hows the street look a few cars from time to time nobody on the sidewalks its clear vincent heard a few metallic clicks then the mans voice in a whisper ill call you when shes ready ten minutes later vincent saw someone in a dark coat walking toward the workshop the stance and motion suggested it was a woman yep it was his flower girl joanne a burst of hunger filled him he ducked low so she wouldnt see him he pushed the transmit button on the phone he heard the click of duncans phone no hello or yes vincent lifted his head slightly and saw her walk up to the door he said into the phone its her shes alone she should be inside any minute the killer said nothing vincent heard the click of the phone hanging up okay he was a keeper joanne harper and kevin had had three coffees at kosmos diner otherwise just another functional boring eatery in soho but as of today a very special place she was now walking to the back door of the workshop reflecting that she wished she could have lingered for another half hour or so kevin had wanted tothere were more jokes to tell more stories to sharebut her job loomed it wasnt due till tomorrow night but this was an important client and she needed to make sure the arrangements were perfect shed reluctantly told him she had to get back she glanced up and down the street still a bit uneasy about the pudgy man in the parka and the weird sunglasses but the area was deserted stepping inside the workshop she slammed the door and doublelocked it hanging up her coat joanne inhaled deeply the way she always did when she first walked inside enjoying the myriad scents inside the shop jasmine rose lilac lily gardenia fertilizer loam mulch it was intoxicating she flicked on the lights and started toward the arrangements shed been working on earlier then she froze and gave a scream her foot had struck something it scurried away from her she leapt back thinking rat but then she looked down and laughed what shed kicked was a large spool of florist wire in the center of the aisle how had it gotten there all of the spools hung from hooks on the wall nearby she squinted through the dimness and saw that somehow this one had slipped off and rolled across the floor odd must be ghosts of florists past she said to herself then regretted the joke the place was eerie enough and an image of the fat man in the sunglasses came back immediately dont go spooking yourself she picked up the spool and saw why it had fallen the hook had slipped out of the wood thats all but then she noticed something else curious this spool was one of the new ones she hadnt used any wire from it yet she thought but she must have some was missing she laughed nothing like love to make a girl forgetful then she paused cocking her head she was listening to a sound she was unaccustomed to what was it very odddripping water no it was mechanical metal weird it sounded like a ticking clock where was it coming from the workshop had a large wall clock in the back but it was electric and didnt tick joanne looked around the noise she decided was coming from a small windowless work area just beyond the refrigerated room shed check it out in a minute joanne bent down to repair the hook chapter amelia sachs skidded to a stop in front of ron pulaski after he jumped in she pointed the car north and gunned the engine the rookie gave her the details of the meeting with jordan kessler he added he seemed legit nice guy but i just thought i ought to check with mrs creeley myself to confirm everythingabout what kessler gets because of creeleys death she said she trusts him and everythings on the upandup but i still wasnt sure so i called creeleys lawyer hope that was okay why wouldnt it be okay dont know just thought id ask its always okay to do too much work in this business sachs told him the problemsre when somebody doesnt do enough pulaski shook his head hard to imagine somebody working for lincoln and being lazy she gave a cryptic laugh and whatd the lawyer say basically the same thing kessler and the wife said he buys out creeleys share at fair market value its all legit kessler said his partner had been drinking more and had taken up gambling his wife told me she was surprised he did that never was an atlantic city kind of guy sachs nodded gamblingmaybe some mob connections there dealing to them or just taking along recreational drugs money laundering maybe he win or lose you know dropped some big money seems like i was wondering if he hit a loan shark to cover the loss but his wife said the losses were no big deal what with his income and everything a couple hundred thousand didnt hurt much she wasnt real happy about it you can imagine kessler said he had a good relationship with all his clients but i asked for a list i think we ought to talk to them ourselves good sachs told him then she added thingsre getting gluier there was another death murderrobbery maybe she explained about her meeting with gerte and told him about frank sarkowski i need you to track down the file you bet i she stopped speaking shed glanced into the rearview mirror and felt a tug in her gut hm what pulaski asked she didnt answer but made a leisurely turn to the right went several blocks more and then made a sharp left okay we may have a tail saw it a few minutes ago merc made those turns with us just now no dont look it was a black mercedes with darkened windows she turned again abruptly and braked to a stop the rookie grunted at the tug from the belt the merc kept going sachs glanced back missed the tag but saw that the car was an amg the expensive soupedup version of the german car she spun the camaro in a uturn but just then a delivery truck doubleparked in front of her by the time she got around it the merc was gone who do you think it was sachs shifted hard probably a coincidence real rare to get tailed and believe me it never happens by some dude in a hundredandfortythousanddollar car touching the cold body the florist lying on the concrete her face as pale as white roses scattered on the floor the cold body cold as the cold moon but still soft the hardness of death had not yet set in cutting the cloth off the blouse the bra touching tasting these were the images cascading through vincent reynoldss thoughts as he sat in the drivers seat of the bandaidmobile staring into the dark workshop across the street breathing fast anticipating what he was about to do to joanne consumed with hunger noise intruded traffic fortytwo can youthey want to add some barriers at nassau and pine by the reviewing stand sure we can do that over the words represented no threat to him or gerald duncan and so vincent continued his fantasy tasting touching vincent imagined that the killer would probably be pulling joanne down on the floor trussing her up right now then he frowned would duncan be touching her in certain places her chest between her legs vincent was jealous joanne was his girlfriend not duncans goddamn it if he wanted to fuck something let him go find a nice girl on his own but then he told himself to calm down the hunger did that to you it made you crazy possessed you like the people in those gory zombie films vincent watched duncans your friend if he wants to play around with her let him they could share her vincent looked at his watch impatiently it was taking soooo long duncan had told him that time wasnt absolute some scientists once did an experiment where they put one clock way high in the air on a tower and one at sea level the higher one ran more quickly than the one on the ground some law of physics psychologically duncan had added time is relative too if youre doing something you love it goes by fast if youre waiting for something it moves slowly just like now come on come on the radio sitting on the dashboard crackled again more traffic info he assumed but vincent was wrong central to any available unit in lower manhattan proceed to spring street east of broadway be advised looking for florist shops in the vicinity in connection with the homicides on the pier at two two street and the alley off cedar street last night proceed with caution jesus lord vincent muttered aloud staring at the scanner hitting redial on the phone he glanced up the streetno sign of any police yet one ring two pick up click duncan didnt say anythingthis was according to their plans but vincent knew he was on the line get out now move the copsre coming vincent heard a faint gasp the phone disconnected this is rmp three three seven were three minutes from scene roger that three three sevenfurther to that callwe have a report a tenthreefour assault in progress at fouroneeight spring all available units respond roger rmp four six one were on the way too come on for christ sake vincent muttered he put the explorer in gear then a huge crash as a ceramic urn slammed through the glass front door of the florists workshop duncan came charging outside he sprinted over the shattered glass shards nearly fell on the ice and then raced to the explorer leaping into the passenger seat vincent sped away slow down the killer commanded turn at the next street vincent eased off the gas it was just as well he brought the speed down because just as he did a squad car skidded around the corner in front of them two more converged on the street the officers leaping out stop at the light duncan said calmly dont panic vincent felt a quiver run through his body he wanted to punch it just take the chance duncan sensed this no just behave like everybody else here youre curious look at the police cars thats okay to do vincent looked the light changed slow he eased away from the light more cop cars streaked past responding to the call the scanner reported several other cars were en route an officer radioed that there was no id of the suspected perp no one said anything about the bandaidmobile vincents hands were shaking but he kept the big suv steady square in the middle of his lane speed never wavering finally after theyd put some distance between them and the florist shop vincent said softly they knew it was us duncan turned to him they what the police they were sending cars to look for florists around here like it had something to do with the murders last night gerald duncan considered this he didnt seem shaken or mad he frowned they knew we were there thats curious how could they possibly know where should i go vincent asked his friend didnt answer he continued to look out at the streets finally he said in a calm voice for now just drive i have to think he got away rhymes voice snapped through the speaker of the motorola what happened standing beside sachs at the scene in front of the florist shop lon sellitto replied timing luck who the fuck knows luck rhyme snapped harshly as if it were a foreign word he didnt understand then he paused waitare you using a scrambled frequency sellitto said we are for tactical but central isnt not for nineoneone calls he mustve heard the initial call shit okay well make sure theyre all scrambled on the watchmaker case rhyme then asked what does the scene say sachs i just got here well search it click brothersellitto and sachs glanced at each other as soon as shed gotten the call about the on spring shed dropped pulaski off to find the sarkowski homicide file and sped here to search the scene i can do both lets hope sachs she tossed her purse onto the backseat of the camaro locked the door and headed to the florist shop she saw kathryn dance walking up the street from the main retail shop where shed interviewed the owner joanne harper whod narrowly escaped being the watchmakers third victim an unmarked car pulled up to the curb the emergency lights in the grille flashing dennis baker shut them off and climbed out he hurried toward sachs it was him baker asked yep sellitto told him respondings found another clock inside same kind three down sachs thought grimly seven to go another love note not this time but we were real close im guessing he didnt have a chance to leave one i heard the call baker said howd you figure out it was him thered been an environmental agency bust a block from herea spill at an exterminating company stockpiling illegal thallium sulfate rat poison then lincoln learned the main use of the fish protein found at the adams killing was fertilizer for orchids lon had dispatch send out cars to florists and landscaping companies near the extermination operation rat poison baker gave a laugh that rhyme he thinks of everything doesnt he and then some sellitto added dance joined them she explained what shed learned from the interview joanne harper had returned from coffee and found some wire misplaced in the store that didnt bother her too much but she heard this ticking and then thought she heard somebody in a back room she called nineoneone sellitto continued and since we had squad cars headed to the area anyway we got there before he killed her but just before dance added that the florist had no clue why anyone would want to hurt her shed been through a divorce a long time ago but hadnt heard from her ex in years she had no enemies that she could think of joanne also told dance that shed seen someone watching her through the window earlier that day a heavyset white man in a creamcolored parka oldstyle sunglasses and baseball cap she hadnt seen much else because of the dirty windows dance wondered if there was a connection with adams the first victim but joanne had never heard of him sachs asked hows she doing shook up but going back to work not in the workshop though at her store on broadway sellitto said until we get this guy or figure out a motive ill order a car outside the store he pulled out his radio and arranged for it nancy simpson and frank rettig the cs officers walked up to sachs between them was a young man in a stocking cap and baggy jacket he was skinny and looked freezing cold gentleman here wants to help simpson said came up to us at the rrv with a glance at sachs who nodded dance turned to him and asked what hed seen there was no need for a kinesics expert though the kid was happy to play good citizen he explained that hed been walking down the street and saw somebody jump out the florists workshop he was a middleaged man in a dark jacket glancing at the efit composite sellitto and dance had made at the clock store he said yeah could be him hed run to a tan suv driven by a white guy with a round face and wearing sunglasses but he hadnt seen anything more specific about the driver therere two of them baker sighed hes got a partner probably the one joanne had seen at her workshop earlier was it an explorer i dont know an explorer from aany other kind of suv sellitto asked about the license number the witness hadnt seen it well weve got the color at least sellitto put out an emergency vehicle locator an evl would alert all radio mobile patrol cars as well as most other law enforcers and traffic cops in the area to look for a tan explorer with two white men inside okay lets move on this sellitto called simpson and rettig helped sachs assemble equipment to run the scenes there were several of them the store itself the alley the sidewalk area where hed escaped as well as where the explorer had been parked kathryn dance and sellitto returned to rhymes while baker kept canvassing for witnesses showing pictures of the watchmakers composite to people on the street and workers in the warehouses and businesses along spring sachs collected what evidence she could locate since the first clock hadnt been an explosive device there was no need to get the bomb squad involved a simple field test for nitrates was sufficient to make sure she packed it up along with the remaining evidence then stripped off the tyvek and pulled on her leather jacket she hurried up the street and dropped into the front seat of the camaro fired the car up and turned on the heater full blast she reached behind the passenger seat for her purse to get her gloves but when she picked up the leather bag the contents spilled out sachs frowned she was very careful always to keep the purse latched she couldnt afford to lose the contents which included two extra ammunition clips for her glock as well as a can of tear gas she clearly remembered twisting the latch when shed arrived she looked at the passengerside window smears on the glass made by gloves were consistent with somebody using a slimjim to pop the door lock and some of the insulating fuzz around the window was pushed aside burglarized while doing a crime scene thiss a first she looked through the bag item by item nothing was gone the money and charge cards were all therethough shed have to call the credit card companies in case the thief had jotted down the numbers the ammunition and cs teargas spray were intact hand straying to her glock she looked around there was a small crowd gathered nearby curious about the police activity she climbed out and approached them asking if anybody had seen the breakin nobody had returning to the chevy sachs got her barebones crime scene kit from the trunk and ran the car just like any other crime scenechecking for footprints fingerprints and trace inside and out she found nothing she replaced the equipment and dropped into the front seat once again then she saw a half block away a big black car edge out of an alleyway she thought of the mercedes shed seen earlier when shed picked up pulaski she couldnt see the make though and the car disappeared in traffic before she could turn her vehicle around and head after it coincidence or not she wondered the big chevy engine began to push heat into the car and she strapped in she pushed the transmission into first easing forward she thought to herself well no harm done she was halfway up the block shoving the shifter into third though when the thought hit her what was he looking for the fact that her money and plastic were still there suggested that the perp was after something else amelia sachs knew that its the people with motives you cant figure out who are always the most dangerous chapter at rhymes sachs delivered the evidence to mel cooper before she put on her latex gloves she walked to a canister and pulled out a few dog biscuits fed them to jackson he ate them down fast you ever think about getting a helper dog kathryn dance asked rhyme he is a helper dog jackson sachs frowned yep he helps plenty he distracts people so i dont have to entertain them the women laughed i mean a real one one of his therapists had suggested a dog many paraplegics and quadriplegics had helper animals not long after the accident when the counselor had first brought it up hed resisted the idea he couldnt explain why exactly but believed it had to do with his reluctance to depend on something or someone else now the idea didnt seem so bad he frowned can you train them to pour whiskey the criminalist looked from the dog to sachs oh you got a call when you were at the scene someone named jordan kessler who he said youd know oh waitsure creeleys partner he wanted to talk to you i told him you werent here so he left a message he said that he talked to the rest of the company employees and that creeley definitely had been depressed lately and kesslers still putting together a client list but itll take a day or two a couple of days what he said rhymes eyes were on the evidence she was assembling on an examination table next to cooper his mind drifted away from the st james situationwhat he was calling the other case as opposed to his case the watchmaker lets get to the evidence he announced sachs pulled on latex gloves and began unpacking the boxes and bag the clock was the same as the first two ticking and showing the correct time the moon face just slightly past full together cooper and sachs dismantled it but found no trace of any significance no footprints friction ridge prints weapons or anything else had been left behind in the florists shop rhyme wondered if there was some special tool the killer had used to cut the florists wire or some technique that might reveal a past or present career or training but no hed used joannes own clippers like the duct tape though the wire had been cut in precise lengths each one was exactly six feet long rhyme wondered whether he was going to bind her with the wire or whether it was the intended murder weapon joanne harper had locked the door when she left the shop to meet a friend for coffee it was clear that the killer had picked the lock to get inside this didnt surprise rhyme a man who knows the mechanics of timepieces could easily learn the skills of lockpicking a search of dmv records revealed owners of tan explorers in the metropolitan area they crossreferenced the list against warrants and found only two a man in his sixties wanted as a scofflaw for dozens of parking tickets and a younger man busted for selling coke he wondered if this was the watchmakers assistant but it turned out he was still in jail for the offense the watchmaker might well be among the remaining names on the list but there was no way to talk to every one though sellitto was going to have someone check those whose addresses were in lower manhattan thered also been a few hits on the emergency vehicle locator but none of the drivers descriptions fit those of the watchmaker or his partner sachs had collected samples of trace from the shop itself and found that yes the soil and fish protein in the form of fertilizer had indeed come from joannes there was some inside the building but sachs had also found considerable amounts outside in and around discarded bags of the fertilizer rhyme was shaking his head whats the problem sellitto asked its not the protein itself its the fact it was on the second victim adams because it means the perp was checking out the workshop earlierpresumably the victim and looking for alarms or security cameras hes been staking out his locations which means theres a reason hes picking these particular victims but what the hell is it the man crushed to death in the alley wasnt apparently involved in any criminal activities and had no enemies the same was true with joanne harper and shed never heard of adamsno link between them yet theyd both been targeted by the watchmaker why them rhyme wondered an unknown victim at the pier a young businessman a floristand seven others to go what is there about them thats driving him to kill whats the connection what else did you find black flakes cooper said holding up a plastic envelope inside were dots like dried black ink sachs said they were from where he got the wire spool and where he was probably hiding also i found a few of them outside the front door where hed stepped on the glass running to the explorer well run them through the gc cooper fired up the gas chromatographmass spectrometer and loaded a sample of the flakes in a few minutes the results came up on the screen so what do we have mel the tech shoved his glasses higher on his nose he leaned forward organiclooks like about seventythree percent nalkanes then polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and thiaarenes ah roofing tar rhyme squinted kathryn dance gave a laugh you know that sellitto said oh lincoln used to wander around the city collecting everything he could find for his evidence databases mustve been fun going out to dinner with you linc you bring test tubes and bags with you my ex could tell you all about it rhyme replied with an amused grunt his attention was on the black spots of tar ill bet hes been checking out another victim from a place thats getting a new roof or maybe theyre reroofing his place cooper offered doubt hes spending time enjoying cocktails and the sunset on his own roof in this weather rhyme replied lets assume its somebody elses i want to find out how many buildings are being reroofed right now there could be hundreds of them thousands sellitto said probably not in this weather and how the hell do we find them anyway the rumpled detective asked aster whats that dance asked rhyme recited absently advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer its an instrument and data package on the terra satellitea joint venture between nasa and the japanese government it captures thermal images from space orbits everywhat mel about ninetyeight minutes but it takes sixteen days to cover the entire earth find out when it was over new york most recently i want thermal images and see if they can delineate heat over two hundred degreesi imagine tars at least that temperature when its applied should narrow down where hes been the whole city cooper asked hes hunting in manhattan looks like lets go with that first cooper had a lengthy conversation then hung up theyre on it theyll do their best thom showed dennis baker into the town house no other witnesses around the florists workshop the lieutenant reported pulling off his coat and gratefully accepting a cup of coffee we searched for an hour either nobody saw anything or has the guts to admit they did this guys got everybody spooked we need more rhyme looked at the diagram that sachs had sketched of the scene where was the suv parked he asked across the street from the workshop sachs replied and you searched the spot where it was parked it wasnt a question rhyme knew she would have any cars in front or behind it no okay he runs to the car his partner drives to the closest intersection and turns hoping to get lost in the traffic he wont break any laws so hell make a nice carefuland sharpturn staying in his lane like speed bumps and sudden braking sharp slow turns often dislodge important trace from treads of tires if the streets still sealed off i want a team from crime scene to sweep up everything at the intersection its a long shot but i think we have to try he turned to baker you just left the scene right about ten fifteen minutes ago about that baker replied sitting and stretching as he downed his coffee he looked exhausted was the street still sealed wasnt paying much attention i think it was find out rhyme said to sellitto and if so send a team but the detectives call revealed that the street was now open to traffic any trace left by the killers explorer would have been obliterated by the first or second vehicle making the same turn damn rhyme muttered his eyes returning once again to the evidence chart thinking it had been a long time since a case had presented so much difficulty thom rapped on the doorjamb and led someone else into the room a middleaged woman in an expensive black coat she was familiar to rhyme but he couldnt recall the name hello lincoln then he remembered inspector marilyn flaherty was older than rhyme but theyd both been captains at the same time and had worked together on a few special commissions he remembered her as being smart and ambitiousand out of necessity just a little bit flintier and more driven than her male counterparts they spoke for a few minutes about mutual acquaintances and colleagues past and present she asked about the watchmaker case and he gave her a synopsis the inspector then pulled sachs aside and asked about the status of the investigation meaning of course the other case rhyme couldnt help overhearing sachs tell her that shed found nothing conclusive thered been no major drug thefts from the evidence room of the th precinct creeleys partner and his employees confirmed the businessmans depression and reported that hed been drinking more lately it turned out that hed been going to vegas andor atlantic city recently possible organized crime connection flaherty pointed out thats what i was thinking sachs said then she added that there seemed to be no clients with grudges against creeley but that she and pulaski were awaiting the client list from jordan kessler to check it out themselves suzanne creeley though remained convinced that hed had nothing to do with drugs or criminal activity and that he hadnt killed himself and sachs said weve got another death another one a man who came to the st james a few times maybe met with the same people that creeley did another death rhyme reflected he had to admit that the other case was developing some very interesting angles who flaherty asked another businessman frank sarkowski lived in manhattan flaherty was looking over the lab the evidence charts the equipment frowning any clue who killed him i think it was during a robbery but i wont know until i read the file rhyme could see the frustration in flahertys face sachs too was tense he soon realized why as soon as flaherty said im going to hold off on internal affairs for the time being sachs relaxed they werent going to take the case away from her well lincoln rhyme was happy for sachs though in his heart he would have preferred that she hand off the other case to internal affairs and get back to working on his case flaherty asked that young officer ron pulaski hes working out okay hes doing a good job im going to report to wallace detective the inspector nodded at rhyme lincoln it was good seeing you again take care so long inspector flaherty walked to the door and let herself out walking just like a general on a parade ground amelia sachs was about to call pulaski and find out what hed learned about sarkowski when she heard a voice near her ear the grand inquisitor sachs turned to look at sellitto dumping sugar in his coffee he said hey step into my office and gestured toward the front hallway of rhymes town house leaving the others the two detectives walked into the lowlit entryway inquisitor thats what they call flaherty sachs asked yup not that she isnt good i know i checked her out uhm the big detective sipped coffee and finished a danish look im up to my ass in psycho clockmakers so i dont know whats up with this st james thing but if you got cops maybere on the take how come its you and not internal affairs running the case flaherty didnt want to bring them in yet wallace agreed wallace robert wallace the deputy mayor yeah i know him standup guy and its the right call bringing in iad why didnt she want to she wanted to give it to somebody in her command she said the one one eights too close to the big building somebodyd find out internal affairs was involved and theyd cut and run sellitto jutted his lower lip out in concession that could be then his voice lowered even further and you didnt argue too much cause you wanted the case she looked him in the eye thats right so you asked and you got he gave a cool laugh what now youre walking point whats wrong with that just you gotta know the score now anything goes bad anything at allgood people get burned bad guys get awaythe fuckups on your shoulders even if you do everything right flahertys protected and iads smelling like roses on the other hand you get righteous collars they take over and suddenly everybody forgets your name youre saying i got set up sachs shook her head but flaherty didnt want me to take the case she was going to hand it off amelia come on end of a date a guy says hey had a great time but its probably better if i dont ask you upstairs whats the first thing the girl says lets go upstairs what he had in mind all along youre saying flaherty was playing me all im saying is she didnt take the case away from you right which she couldve done in like five seconds sachss nail dug absently into her scalp her gut twisted at the idea of department politics at this high levellargely uncharted territory for her now my point is i wish you werent lead on a case like this not now in your career but you are so you have to rememberkeep your head down i mean stay fucking invisible i lemme finish invisible for two reasons one people find out youre after bad cops rumorsre going startabout this shield taking cash or that shield losing evidence whatever fact theyre not doesnt mean shit rumorsre like the flu you cant wish em away they run their course and they take peoples careers with em she nodded whats the second reason just because you got a shield dont think youre immune a bad uniform in the one one eight yeah hes not going to clip you that doesnt happen but the civilians hes dealing with wont want to hear his opinion they wont think twice about tossing your body into the trunk of a car at jfk longterm parking god bless you kid go get em but be careful i dont want to have to go breaking any bad news to lincoln hed never forgive me ron pulaski returned to rhymes and sachs met him in the front hallway as she stood looking into the kitchen and thinking about what sellitto had told her she briefed him about the latest in the watchmaker case then asked whats the sarkowski situation he flipped through his notes i located his spouse and proceeded to interview her now the decedent was a fiftysevenyearold white male who owned a business in manhattan he had no criminal record he was murdered on november four of this year and was survived by said wife and two teenage children one male one female death occurred by gunshot he ron she asked in a certain tone he winced oh sorry streamline sure his copspeak was a habit sachs was determined to break relaxing the rookie continued he was the owner of a building on the west side manhattan lived there too he also owned a company that did maintenance and trash disposal work for big companies and utilities around the city his business had a clean recordfederal city and state no organized crime connections no investigations ongoing he himself had no warrants or arrests except a speeding ticket last year any suspects in his death no what house ran the case the one three one he was in queens when he died not manhattan thats right what happened the perp got his wallet and cash then shot him three times in the chest the st james did she ever hear him say anything about it nope did he know creeley the wife wasnt sure didnt think so i showed her the picture and she didnt recognize him he grew quiet for a moment and then added one thing i think i saw it again the mercedes you did after you dropped me off i crossed the street fast to beat a light and i looked behind me to see if there was traffic i couldnt get a good look but i thought i saw the merc couldnt see the tag just thought id mention it sachs shook her head i had a visitor too she told him about the breakin to her car and added that she believed shed seen the mercedes as well that drivers been a busy boy she then looked at his hands which held only his thick notebook wheres the sarkowski file okay thats the problem no file no evidence i went through the entire evidence locker in the one three one nothing okay thiss getting funky no evidence missing the file was checked out mightve been but its not in the computer log it shouldve been there if somebody took it or it got sent somewhere but i got the name of the case detective he lives in queens just retired art snyder pulaski handed her a sheet of paper with the mans name and address on it you want me to talk to him no ill go see him i want you to stay here and write up our notes on a whiteboard i want to see the big picture but dont do it in the lab theres too much traffic crime scene and other officers routinely made deliveries to rhymes with a case involving crooked cops she didnt want anyone to see what theyd learned she nodded toward rhymes exercise room where his ergometer and treadmill were located well keep it in there sure but that wont take long when im done you want me to meet you at snyders sachs thought again about the mercedes and she heard sellittos words looping through her head the trunk of a car at jfk

queens just over the east river from manhattan and roosevelt island christmas decorationsplenty of themwere perfectly arranged in the yard the sidewalk perfectly cleared of ice and snow the camry in the driveway perfectly clean despite the recent snow window frames were being scraped for a new coat of paint and a stack of bricks sat destined for a new path or patio this was the house of a man with newly acquired free time amelia sachs hit the doorbell the front door opened a few seconds later and a solid man in his late fifties squinted up at her he was in a green velour running suit detective snyder sachs was careful to use his former title being polite gets you further than a gun her father used to say yeah come on in youre amelia right last name versus first name you always choose which battles you want to fight she smiled shook his hand and followed him inside cold streetlight bled inside and the living room was unfriendly and chill sachs smelled damp smoke from the fireplace as well as the scent of cat she pulled off her jacket and sat on a wheezing sofa it was clear that the barcalounger beside which were three remote controls was the kings throne the wifes out he announced a squint you herman sachss girl girl thats right did you work with him some yeah bk and a couple assignments in manhattan good guy heard the retirement party was a blast went on all night you want a soda or water or anything no booze sorry he said this with a certain tone in his voice whichalong with the cluster of veins in his nosetold her that like a lot of cops of a certain age hed had a problem with the bottle and was now in recovery good for him nothing for me thanksjust have a few questions you were case detective on a robberyhomicide just before you retired name was frank sarkowski eyes sweeping the carpet yeah remember him some businessman got shot in a mugging or something i wanted to see the file but its gone the evidence too no file snyder shrugged a little surprised not too much records room at the housealways a mess i need to find out what happened geez i dont remember much snyder scratched the back of his muscular hand flaking with eczema you know one of those cases no leads at alli mean zip after a week you kind of forget about em you musta run some of those the question was almost a taunt a comment on the fact that she obviously hadnt been a detective for long and probably hadnt run many of those sorts of cases or any other for that matter she didnt respond tell me what you remember found him in this vacant lot lying by his car no money no wallet the piece was nearby what was it a cold smittie knockoff was wiped cleanno prints interesting cold meant no serial numbers the bad guys bought them on the street when they wanted an untraceable weapon you could never completely obliterate the numbers of a stamped gunwhich was a requirement for all us manufacturersbut some foreign weapon companies didnt put serial numbers on their products they were what professional killers used and often left behind at crime scenes snitches hear anything afterward many homicides were solved because the killer made the mistake of bragging about his prowess at a robbery and exaggerating what hed stolen word often got back to snitches whod dime the guy out for a favor from the cops nothing where was the vacant lot by the canal you know those big tanks the natural gas tanks yeah what was he doing there snyder shrugged no idea he had this maintenance company i think one of his clients was out there and he was checking on them or something crime scene find anything solid trace fingerprints footprints nothing jumped out at us his rheumy eyes kept examining her he seemed a little bewildered he might be thinking so this is the new generation nypd glad i got out when i did were you convinced everything was what it seemed to be a robbery that went bad he hesitated pretty convinced but not totally convinced i guess it coulda been a clip pro snyder shrugged i mean theres nobody around youve gotta walk a half mile just to get to a residential street its all factories and things kids just dont hang there theres no reason to i was thinking the shooter took the wallet and money to make it look like a mugging and leaving the gun behindthat smelled like a hit to me but no connection to the mob not that i found but one of his employees told me hed just had some business deal fall through lost a lot of money i followed up but it didnt lead anywhere so sarkowskimaybe creeley toomightve been working with some oc crew drugs or money laundering it went south and they killed him that would explain the mercedes tailsome capos or soldiers were checking up on her investigationand the cops at the were running interference for the crew the name benjamin creeley come up in your investigation he shook his head did you know that the vicsarkowskiused to hang at the st james the st jameswait that bar in alphabet city around the corner from his voice faded thats right the one one eight snyder was troubled i didnt know that no well he did funny that a guy who lived on the west side and worked in midtown would hang out in a dive way over there you know anything about that naw not a single thing he looked around the room sullenly but if youre asking me if anybody at the one one eight came to me and said bury the sarkowski case they didnt we ran it by the book and got on to other shit she looked him in the eye what do you know about the one one eight he picked up one of the remotes played with it put it back down did i mention something sachs said what he asked glumly she noticed his eyes flick to an empty break front she could see rings on the wood where the bottles had been ive got a shitty memory she told him memory i can hardly remember my name snyder was confused a kid like you oh you bet she said with a laugh the minute i walk out your front door ill forget i was even here forget your name your face gone completely funny how that works he got the message still he shook his head whyre you doing this he asked in a whisper youre young you gotta learnabout some things its better just to let sleeping dogs lie but what if theyre not sleeping she asked leaning forward i got two widows and i got kids without their dads two creeley that guy i mentioned went to the same bar as sarkowski looks like they knew people from the one one eight and theyre both dead snyder stared at the flatscreen tv it was impressive she asked so what do you hear he was studying the floor seemed to notice some stains maybe hed add replacing the carpet to his list of household projects finally rumors but thats it im being straight with you i dont know names i dont know anything specific sachs nodded reassuringly rumorsll do some scratch was floating around thats all money how much could be tall paper i mean serious or could be walkingaround change go on i dont know any details its like youre on the street doing your job and somebody says something to a guy youre standing next to and it doesnt quite you know register but then you get the idea you remember names no no this was a while ago just there might be some money i dont know how it got paid or how much or to who alls i heard was the person putting it together they had something to do with maryland thats where all the money goes anywhere specific baltimore the shore nope sachs considered this wondering what the scenario mightve been did creeley or sarkowski have a house in maryland maybe on the waterocean city or rehobeth did some of the cops at the one one eight or was it the baltimore syndicate that made sense it explained why they couldnt find any leads to a manhattan brooklyn or jersey crew she asked i want to see the sarkowski file can you point me in any direction snyder hesitated ill make some calls thanks sachs rose wait snyder said lemme say one thing i called you a kid okay shouldntve said that you got balls you dont back down youre smart anybody can see that but you aint been around long in this business you gotta understand that what youre thinking about the one one eight theyre not going to be clipping anybody and even if something is going down its not going to be blackandwhite you gotta ask yourself what the fuck difference does it make a few dollars here or there sometimes a bad cop saves a babys life and sometimes a good cop takes something he shouldnt thats life on the streets he gave her a perplexed frown i mean christ you of all people oughta know that me well sure he looked her up and down the sixteenth avenue club i dont know what that is oh ill bet you do and he told her all about it dennis baker was saying to rhyme i hear shes a great shot the lab was male only at the moment kathryn dance had returned to the hotel to check in once again and amelia was out on the other case pulaski cooper and sellitto were here along with jackson the dog rhyme explained about sachss pistol club and the competitions she was in proudly he told baker that she was very close to being the top handgun shot in the metro league shed be competing soon and was hoping to make the numberone slot baker nodded looks like shes in as good shape as most of the rookies just out of the academy he patted his belly i should be working out more myself ironically wheelchairbound rhyme was himself doing more exercising now than before the accident he used a powered bicyclean ergometerand a computerized treadmill daily he also did aqua therapy several times a week this regimen served two purposes it was intended to keep his muscle mass solid for the day when as he believed he would walk again the exercises were also moving him further toward that goal by improving the nerve function in the damaged parts of his body in the past few years hed regained functions that doctors had told him hed never again have but rhyme sensed that baker wasnt particularly interested in sachss bowflex routinesa deduction confirmed when the man asked his next question i heard that you guysregoing out amelia sachs was a lantern that attracted many moths and rhyme wasnt surprised that the detective was checking out the availability of the flame he laughed at the detectives quaint term going out he said you could put it that way must be tough then baker blinked wait i didnt mean what you think rhyme though had a pretty good idea what the detective was saying he wasnt referring to a relationship between a crip and somebody who was mobilebaker seemed hardly to notice rhymes condition no he was referring to a very different potential conflict two cops you meant the other case versus his case baker nodded dated an fbi agent once she and i had jurisdictional issues rhyme laughed thats a good way to put it of course my ex wasnt a cop and we had a pretty rough time too blaine had a great fastball i lost some nice lamps and a bausch amp lomb microscope probably shouldntve brought it home well having it at home was okay i shouldntve had it on the nightstand in the bedroom im not gonna make jokes about microscopes in the bedroom sellitto called from across the room sounds like you just did if you ask me rhyme replied deflecting bakers small talk rhyme wheeled over to pulaski and cooper who were trying to lift prints from the spool from the florist shop on rhymes hope that the watchmaker couldnt undo the green metallic wire with gloves on and had used his bare hands but they were having no success rhyme heard the door open and a moment later sachs walked into the lab pulled off her leather jacket and tossed it distractedly on a chair she wasnt smiling she nodded a greeting to the team and then asked rhyme any breaks nothing yet no some more strikes on the evl but they didnt play out no aster information either sachs stared at the chart but it seemed to rhyme that she was seeing none of the words turning to the rookie she said ron the detective on the sarkowski case told me he heard rumors about money going to our one one eight friends at the st james he thinks theres a maryland connection we find it we find the money and probably the names of some people involved im thinking its a baltimore oc hook organized crime unless you went to a different academy than me thats what oc means sorry make some calls find out if anybody from a baltimore crews been operating in new york and find out if creeley sarkowski or anybody from the one one eight has a place there or does a lot of business in maryland ill stop by the precinct and no just call make it anonymous wouldnt it be better to do it in person i could the better thing sachs said harshly is to do what im telling you okay he raised his hands in surrender sellitto said hey some of your good humors rubbing off on the troops linc sachss mouth tightened then she relented itll be safer that way ron it was a lincoln rhyme apology that is to say not much of one at all but pulaski accepted it sure she looked away from the whiteboards need to talk to you rhyme alone a glance at baker you mind he shook his head not at all ive got some other cases to check on he pulled on his coat ill be downtown if you need me so rhyme asked her in a soft voice upstairs alone rhyme nodded all right what was going on here sachs and rhyme took the tiny elevator to the second floor and he wheeled into the bedroom sachs behind him upstairs she sat down at a computer terminal began typing furiously whats up rhyme asked give me a minute she was scrolling through documents rhyme observed two things about her her hand had been digging into her scalp and her thumb was bloody from the wounding the other was that he believed shed been crying which had happened only two or three times in all the time theyd known each other she typed harder pages rolled past almost too fast to read he was impatient he was concerned finally he had to say firmly tell me sachs she was staring at the screen shaking her head then turned to him my fatherhe was crooked her voice choked rhyme wheeled closer as her eyes returned to the documents on the screen they were newspaper stories he could see her legs bounced with tension he was on the take she whispered impossible rhyme hadnt known herman sachs who had died of cancer before he and sachs met hed been a portable a beat cop all his life a fact that had given sachs her nickname when she was working in patrolthe portables daughter herman had cop blood in his veinshis father heinrich sachs had come over from germany in immigrating with his fiancães father a berlin police detective after becoming a citizen heinrich joined the nypd the thought that anyone in the sachs line could be corrupt was unthinkable to rhyme i just talked to a detective on the st james case he worked with dad there was a scandal in the late seventies extortion bribes even some assaults a dozen or so uniforms and detectives got collared they were known as the sixteenth avenue club sure i read about it i was a baby then her voice quaked i never heard about it even after i joined the force mother and pop never mentioned it but he was with them sachs i just cant believe it you ask your mother the detective nodded she said it was nothing some of the uniforms who got busted just started to name names to cut deals with the prosecutor that happens in iad situations all the time everybody dimes out everybody else even innocents then it gets sorted out thats all there was to it no rhyme that isnt all i stopped at the internal affairs records room and tracked down the file pop was guilty two of the cops who were part of the scam swore out affidavits about seeing him put the finger on shopkeepers and protecting numbers runners even losing files and evidence in some big cases against the brooklyn crews hearsay evidence she snapped they had evidence his prints on the buy money and on some unregistered guns he was hiding in his garage she whispered ballistics traced one to an attempted hit a year before my dad was stashing a hot weapon rhyme its all in the file i saw the print examiners report i saw the prints rhyme fell silent finally he asked then howd he get off she gave a bitter laugh heres the joke rhyme crime scene fucked up the search the chainofcustody cards werent filled out right and his lawyer at the hearing excluded the evidence chainofcustody cards exist so that evidence cant be doctored or unintentionally altered to increase the chances a suspect will be convicted but there was no way that tampering had occurred in herman sachss case its virtually impossible to get fingerprints on evidence unless the suspect himself actually touches it still the rules have to be applied evenly and if the coc cards arent filled out or are wrong the evidence will almost always be excluded thenthere were pictures of him with tony gallante a senior organized crime capo from bay ridge your father and gallante they were having dinner together rhyme i called a cop that pop used to work with joe knoxhe was in the sixteenth avenue club too got busted i asked him about dad pointblank he didnt want to say anything at first he was pretty shaken up id called but finally he admitted it was true dad and knox and a couple others put the finger on store owners and contractors for over a year they ditched evidence they even threatened to beat up people who complained they thought pop was going down bigtime but with the screwup he got off they called him the fish that got away wiping tears she continued to scroll through the computer files she was reviewing official documents tooarchives in the nypd that rhyme had access to because of the work he did for the department he wheeled close so close he could smell her scented soap she said twelve officers in the sixteenth avenue club were indicted internal affairs knew about three others but they couldnt make the case because of evidence problems he was one of those three sachs said jesus the fish that got away she slumped in a chair her finger disappearing into her hair and scraping she realized she was doing it and dropped her hand into her lap there was fresh blood on the nail when that thing with nick happened sachs began another deep breath when that happened all i could think was theres nothing worse than a crooked cop nothing and now i find out my father was one sachsrhyme felt painful frustration at not being able to lift his arm and place his hand on hers to try to take some of the terrible sting away he felt a burst of anger at this impotence they took bribes to destroy evidence rhyme you know what that means how many perps ended up going free because of what they did she turned back to the computer how many shooters got off how many innocent peoplere dead because of my father how many chapter vincents hunger was returning as thick and heavy as a tide and he couldnt stop staring at the women on the street his mental violations made him even hungrier here was a blonde with short hair carrying a shopping bag vincent could imagine his hands cupping her head as he lay on top of her and here was a brunette her hair long like sally annes dangling from underneath her stocking cap he could almost feel the quivering of her muscles as his hand pressed into the small of her back here another blonde in a suit carrying a briefcase he wondered if shed scream or cry he bet she was a screamer gerald duncan was now driving the bandaidmobile maneuvering it down an alley and then back to a main street heading north no more transmissions the killer nodded at the police scanner from which was clattering only routine calls and more traffic information theyve changed the frequency should i try to find the new one theyll be scrambling it im surprised they werent from the beginning vincent saw another brunetteoh shes nicewalking out of a starbucks she was wearing boots vincent liked boots how long could he wait he wondered not very long maybe until tonight maybe until tomorrow when hed met duncan the killer told him hed have to give up having his hearttohearts until they started on their project vincent had agreedwhy not the watchmaker told him there would be five women among his victims two were older middleaged but he could have them too if he was interested its a chore but somebodys got to do it clever vincent quipped to himself so hed been abstaining duncan shook his head ive been trying to figure out how they knew it was we we he did talk funny sometimes you have any idea nope vincent offered duncan still wasnt angry which surprised vincent vincents stepfather had screamed and shouted when he was mad like after the sally anne incident and vincent himself would grow enraged when one of his ladies fought back and hurt him but not duncan he said anger was inefficient you had to look at the great scheme of things hed say there was always a grand plan and little setbacks were insignificant not worth wasting your energy on its like time the centuries and millennia are what matter with humans its the same thing a single life is nothing its the generations that count vincent supposed he agreed though as far as he was concerned every hearttoheart was important he didnt want to miss a chance for a single one and so he asked are we going to try again with joanne not now the killer replied they might have a guard with her and even if were able to get to her theyd realize i wanted her dead for a reason its important that they think these are just random victims what well do now is he stopped talking he was looking in the rearview mirror what cops a police car came out of a side street it started to turn one way but then turned toward us vincent looked over his shoulder he could see the white car with a light bar on top about a block behind them it seemed to be accelerating quickly i think hes after us duncan turned quickly down a narrow street and sped up at the next intersection he turned south what do you see i dont think wait there he is hes after us definitely that street thereup a block on the right you know it does it go through to the west side highway yeah take it vincent felt his palms sweating duncan turned and sped down the oneway street then turned left onto the highway heading south in front of us whats that flashing lights yep vincent could clearly see them heading their way his voice rose whatre we going to do whatever we have to duncan said calmly turning the wheel precisely and making an impossible turn seem effortless lincoln rhyme struggled to tune out the droning of sellitto on his cell phone he also tuned out the rookie ron pulaski making calls about baltimore mobsters tuning it all out so he could let something else into his thoughts he wasnt sure what a vague memory kept nagging a persons name an incident a place he couldnt say but it was something he knew was important vital what he closed his eyes and swerved close to the thought but it got away ephemeral like the puff balls he would chase when he was a boy in the midwest outside of chicago running through fields running running lincoln rhyme had loved to run loved to catch puff balls and the whirlygig seeds that spiraled from trees like descending helicopters loved to chase dragonflies and moths and bees to study them to learn about them lincoln rhyme was born with a fierce curiosity a scientist even then runningbreathless and now the immobilized man was also running trying to grasp a different sort of elusive seed and even though the pursuit was in his mind only it was no less strenuous and intense than the footraces of his youth therethere almost have it no not quite hell dont think dont force let it in his mind sped through memories whole and memories fragmented the way his feet would pound over fragrant grass and hot earth through rustling reeds and cornfields under massive thunderheads boiling up miles high and white in the blue sky a thousand images from homicides and kidnappings and larcenies crime scene photos department memos and reports evidence inventories the art captured in microscope eyepieces the mountain peaks and valleys on the screen of a gas chromatograph like so many whirlygigs and puff balls and grasshoppers and katydids and robin feathers okay closeclose then his eyes opened luponte he whispered satisfaction filled the body that could feel no sensation rhyme wasnt sure but he believed there was something significant about the name luponte i need a file rhyme glanced at sellitto who was now sitting at a computer monitor examining the screen a file the big detective looked over at him are you talking to me yes im talking to you sellitto chuckled a file do i have it no i need you to find it about what a case i think so i dont know when all i know is the name luponte figures he spelled it was a while ago the perp maybe or maybe a witness maybe an arresting or a supervisor or even brass i dont know luponte sellitto said youre looking like the cat that got the cream rhyme frowned is that an expression i dont know i just like the sound of it okay the luponte file ill make some calls is it important with a psychotic killer out there lon do you think im going to have you waste time finding me something thats not important a fax arrived our aster thermal images rhyme asked eagerly no its for amelia cooper said where is she upstairs rhyme was about to call her but just then she walked into the lab her face was dry and no longer red her eyes clear she rarely wore makeup but he wondered if shed made an exception to hide the fact shed been crying for you cooper told her looking over the fax secondary analysis of the ash from whatshisnames place creeley the tech said the lab finally imaged the logo that was on the spreadsheet its from software thats used in corporate accounting nothing unusual its sold to thousands of cpas around the country she shrugged taking the sheet and reading and queens had a forensic accountant look over the recovered entries its just standard payroll and compensation figures for executives in some company nothing unusual about it she shook her head doesnt seem important im guessing whoever broke in just burned whatever they could find to make sure they destroyed everything connecting them to creeley rhyme looked at her troubled eyes he said its also common practice to burn materials that have nothing to do with the case just to lead investigators off sachs nodded yeah sure good point rhyme thanks her phone rang the policewoman listened frowning where she asked okay she jotted some notes ill be right there she said to pulaski may have a lead to the sarkowski file ill check it out uneasily he asked you want me to go with you calmer now she smiled though rhyme could see it was forced no you stay here ron thanks she grabbed her jacket and without saying anything else hurried out as the front door clicked shut behind her sellittos phone rang he tensed as he listened then he looked up announced get this there was a hit on the evl tan explorer two white males inside evading an rmp theyre in pursuit he listened some more got it he hung up they followed it to that big garage on the river at houston by the west side highway exitsre sealed this could be it rhyme ordered his radio to pick up the scrambled transmissions and everyone in the lab stared at the small black plastic speakers two patrol officers reported that the explorer had been spotted on the second floor but was abandoned there was no sign of the men whod been inside i know the garage sellitto said its a sieve they couldve gotten out anywhere bo haumann and a lieutenant reported that they had squads combing the streets around the garage but there was no sign yet of the watchmaker or his partner sellitto shook his head in frustration at least weve got their wheels itll tell us plenty we should get amelia back to run the scene rhyme debated hed been anticipating that the conflict between the two cases might come to a head though hed never thought it would happen this fast sure they should get her back but the criminalist decided not to he knew her perhaps even better than he knew himself and he understood that she needed to run with the st james case theres nothing worse than a crooked cop hed do this for her no let her go but linc well find somebody else the tense silence which seemed to go on forever was broken with ill do it sir rhyme glanced to his right you ron yessir i can handle it i dont think so the rookie looked him in the eye and recited its important to note that the location where the victims corpse is actually found is often the least important of the many crime scenes created when a homicide occurssince it is there that conscientious perpetrators will cleanse the scene of trace and plant false evidence to lead off investigators the more important thats your textbook sir ive read it a couple of times actually you memorized it just the important parts whats not important i meant i memorized the specific rules rhyme debated he was young inexperienced but he at least knew the players and he had a sharp eye all right ron but you dont take a single step into the scene unless were online with each other thats fine sir oh its fine rhyme asked wryly thanks for your approval rookie now get going they were out of breath from the run duncan and vincent both carrying large canvas bags containing the contents of the bandaidmobile slowed to a walk at a park near the hudson river they were two blocks from the garage where theyd abandoned the suv in their flight from the cops so wearing the gloveswhich vincent had first thought of as way too paranoidhad paid off after all vincent looked back theyre not following they didnt see us duncan leaned against a sapling hawked and spit into the grass vincent pressed his chest which ached from the run steam flowed from their mouths and noses the killer still wasnt angry but was even more curious than before the explorer too they knew about the car i dont understand it how did they know and whos after usthat redhaired policewoman i saw on cedar streetmaybe its she she then duncan looked down at his side and frowned the canvas bag was open oh no he whispered what the killer dropped to his knees and began to rummage through it some thingsre missing the book and ammunition are still in the car nothing with our names on it or fingerprints right no they wont identify us he glanced at vincent all your food wrappers and the cans you wore gloves right vincent lived in terror of disappointing his friend and was always careful he nodded duncan looked back at the garage but stillevery bit of evidence they get is like finding another gear from a watch with enough of them if youre smart you can understand how it works you can even figure out who made it he pulled his jacket off handed it to vincent he wore a gray sweatshirt underneath he took a baseball cap out of the bag and pulled it on meet me back at the church go straight there dont stop for anything vincent whispered whatre you going to do the garages dark and its big they wont have enough cops to cover it all and that side door we used its almost impossible to see from outside they might not have anybody stationed there if were lucky they might notve found the explorer yet ill get the things we left he took out the box cutter and slipped it into his sock then he reached into his pocket pulled out his small pistol and checked to make sure it was loaded he replaced it vincent asked but what if they have found it i mean in his calm voice duncan answered depending i may try to get them anyway chapter ron pulaski didnt believe hed ever felt pressure like this standing in the freezingcold garage staring at the tan explorer brilliantly lit by spotlights he was alone lon sellitto and bo haumanntwo legends in the nypdwere at the command post downstairs from this level two crime scene techs had set up the lights thrust suitcases into his hands and left wishing him good luck in what seemed like a pretty ominous tone of voice he was dressed in a tyvek suit without a jacket and he was shivering come on jenny he said silently to his wife as he often did in moments of stress think good thoughts for me he added though speaking only to himself let me not fuck this up which is what hed share with his brother headsets sat on his ears and he was told he was being patched into a secure frequency directly to lincoln rhyme though so far hed heard nothing but static then abruptly so whatve you got lincoln rhymes voice snapped through the headsets pulaski jumped he turned the volume down well sir theres the suv in front of me approximately twenty feet away its parked in a pretty deserted part of the pretty deserted thats like being fairly unique or kind of pregnant are there cars nearby or not yes how many six sir they range from ten to twenty feet away from the subject vehicle dont need the sir save your breath for the important things right are the cars empty anybody hiding in them esu cleared them are the hoods hot uhm i dont know ill check shouldve thought of that he touched them allwith the back of his hand in case fingerprints might become an issue no theyre all cold been here for a while okay so no witnesses any sign of recent tread marks heading toward the exit nothing looks fresh no other than the explorers rhyme said so they probably didnt have backup wheels which means they took off on foot thats better for us now ron take in the totality of the scene chapter three i wrote the fucking book i dont need to hear it again okay the totalitythe cars parked carelessly across two lines they bailed out fast of course rhyme said they knew they were being followed any obvious footprints no the floors dry wheres the closest door a stairwell exit twentyfive feet away whichs been cleared by esu thats right what else about the totality pulaski stared looking around him threesixty its a garage thats all it is he squinted willing himself to see something helpful but there was nothing reluctantly he said i dont know we never know in this business rhyme said in an even voice momentarily a gentle professor its all about the odds what strikes you impressions just throw some out pulaski could think of nothing for a moment but then something occurred to him whyd they park here what you asked what struck me well its weird they parked here this far from the exit why not drive right to it and why not try to hide the explorer better good point ron i shouldve asked the question myself what do you think why would they park there maybe he panicked could be good for usnothing like fear to make somebody careless well think about it okay now walk the grid to and from the exit and then around the car look underneath and on the roof you know the grid yes swallowing the sir for the next twenty minutes pulaski walked back and forth examining the garage floor and ceiling around the car he didnt miss a millimeter he smelled the airand drew no conclusion from the exhaustoildisinfectant aroma of the garage troubled again he told rhyme that he hadnt found anything the criminalist gave no reaction and told pulaski to search the explorer itself theyd run the vin and the tag numbers on the suv and found that it actually had belonged to one of the men sellitto had identified earlier but whod been dismissed as a suspect because he was serving a year on rikers island for possession of cocaine the explorer had been confiscated because of the drugs which meant that the watchmaker had stolen it from a lot where it was awaiting sheriffs auctiona clever idea rhyme reflected since it often took weeks to log seizures into dmv and several months before vehicles actually went up for sale the license plates themselves had been stolen from another tan explorer parked at newark airport now with a curious low tone in his voice rhyme said i love cars ron they tell us so much theyre like books pulaski remembered the pages of rhymes text that echoed his comments he didnt quote them but said sure the vin the tags bumper stickers dealer stickers inspection a laugh if the owners the perp but ours was stolen so the jiffy lube location where he changed the oil or the fact he has an honor student at john adams middle school arent really helpful now are they guess not guess not rhyme repeated what information can a stolen car tell us well fingerprints very good therere so many things to touch in a carthe steering wheel gearshift heater radio hand grips hundreds of them and theyre such shiny surfaces thank you detroit well tokyo or hamburg or wherever and another point most people consider cars their attachã cases and utility drawersyou know those kitchen drawers that you throw everything into effluvia of personal effects almost like a diary where no one thinks to lie search for that first the pe physical evidence pulaski recalled as the young cop bent forward he heard a scrape of metal from somewhere behind him he jumped back and looked around into the gloom of the garage he knew rhymes rule about searching crime scenes alone and so hed sent all the backup away the noise was just from a rat maybe ice melting and falling then he heard a click it reminded him of a ticking clock get on with it pulaski told himself probably just the hot spotlights dont be such a wuss you wanted the job remember he studied the front seats weve got crumbs lots of them crumbs junk food mostly id guess look like cookie crumbs corn chips potato chips bits of chocolate some sticky stains soda id say oh wait heres something under the backseat thiss good a box of bullets what kind remington thirtytwo caliber whats inside the box uhm well bullets you sure i didnt open it should i the silence said yes yep bullets thirtytwos but its not full how manyre missing seven ah thats helpful why later and get this get what rhyme snapped sorry something else a book on interrogation but it looks more like its about torture torture thats right purchased library no sticker on it no receipt inside no library marks and whosever it is hes been reading it a lot well said ron youre not assuming its the perps keep an open mind always keep an open mind it wasnt much praise but the young man enjoyed it pulaski then rolled up trace from the floor and vacuumed it out from the space between and underneath the seats i think ive got everything glove compartment checked it empty pedals scraped them not much trace rhyme asked headrests oh didnt get those could be hair or lotion transfer people wear hats pulaski pointed out rhyme shot back on the remote chance that the watchmaker isnt a sikh nun astronaut sponge diver or somebody else with a head completely covered humor me and check the headrests will do a moment later pulaski found himself looking at a strand of grayandblack hair he confessed this to rhyme the criminalist didnt play itoldyouso good he said seal it in plastic now fingerprints im dying to find out who our watchmaker really is pulaski sweating even in the freezing damp air labored for ten minutes with a magna brush powders and sprays alternative light sources and goggles when rhyme asked impatiently hows it going the rookie had to admit actually there are none you mean no whole prints thats okay partialsll do no i mean therere none sir anywhere in the entire car impossible from rhymes book pulaski remembered that there were three types of printsplastic which are threedimensional impressions such as those in mud or clay visible which you can see with the naked eye and latent visible only with special equipment you rarely find plastic prints and visible are rare but latents are common everywhere except in the watchmakers explorer smears no this is crazy they wouldntve had time to cleanwipe an entire car in five minutes do the outside everything especially near the doors and the gas tank lid with unsteady hands pulaski kept searching had he handled the magna brush clumsily had he sprayed the chemicals on the wrong way was he wearing the wrong goggles the terrible head injury hed suffered not long ago was having lingering effects including posttraumatic stress and panic attacks he also suffered from a condition hed explained to jenny as this real complicated technical medical thingfuzzy thinking it haunted him that after the accident he just wasnt the same that he was somehow damaged goods no longer as smart as his brother though theyd once had the same iq he particularly worried that he wasnt as smart as the perps he was going up against in his jobs for lincoln rhyme but then he thought to himself timeout youre thinking its your screwup goddamn you were top percent at the academy you know what youre doing you work twice as hard as most cops he said im positive detective somehow theyve managed not to leave any prints wait hold on im not going anywhere ron pulaski put on magnifying goggles okay got something im looking at cotton fibers beige ones sort of fleshcolored sort of rhyme chided fleshcolored from gloves im betting so he and his assistant are careful and smart there was an uneasiness in rhymes voice that troubled pulaski he didnt like the idea that lincoln rhyme was uncomfortable a chill trickled down his spine he remembered the scraping sound the clicking tick tock anything in the tire treads and the grille on the sideview mirror he searched there mostly slush and soil take samples after hed done this pulaski said finished snapshots and videoyou know how he did pulaski had been the photographer at his brothers wedding then process the probable escape routes pulaski looked around him again was that another scraping a footstep water was dripping it too sounded like the ticking of a clock which set him even more on edge he started on the grid again back and forth as he made his way toward the exit looking up as well as down the way rhyme had written in his book a crime scene is threedimensional nothing so far another grunt from rhyme pulaski heard what sounded like a footstep his hand strayed to his hip it was then that he realized his glock was inside his tyvek overalls out of reach stupid should he unzip and strap it around the outside of the suit but if he did that it could contaminate the scene ron pulaski decided to leave the gun where it was its just an old garage of course therere going to be noises relax the inscrutable moon faces on the front of the watchmakers calling cards stared at lincoln rhyme the eerie eyes giving nothing away the ticking was all that he heard from the radio there was only silence then some curious sounds scrapes a clatter or was it just static ron you copy nothing but the tickticktick ron then a crash loud metal rhymes head tilted ron whats going on still no response he was about to order the unit to change frequency to tell haumann to check on the rookie when the radio finally crackled to life he heard ron pulaskis panicked voice needs assistance tenthirteen teni a was the most urgent of all radio codes an officer in distress call rhyme shouting answer me ron are you there i cant a grunt the radio went dead jesus mel call haumann for me the tech hit some buttons youre on cooper shouted pointed to rhymes headset bo rhyme pulaskis in trouble called in a tenthirteen on my line did you hear negative but well move on it he was going to run the stairwell closest to the explorer roger now that he was on the main frequency rhyme could hear all the transmissions haumann was directing several tactical support teams and calling for a medical unit he ordered his men to spread out in the garage and cover the exits rhyme pressed his head back into the headrest of his chair furious he was mad at sachs for abandoning his case for the other case and forcing pulaski to take the assignment he was mad at himself for letting an inexperienced rookie search a potentially hot scene alone linc were on the way we cant see him it was sellittos voice well dont goddamn tell me what you havent found more voices nothing on this level theres the suv where is he somebody over there our nine oclock negative thats a friendly more lights we need more lights moment of silence passed hours it felt what was going on goddamn it somebody let me know but there was no response to this tacit demand he went back to pulaskis frequency ron all he heard was a series of clicks as if somebody whose throat had been cut was trying to communicate though he no longer had a voice chapter hey amie gotta talk sure sachs was driving to hells kitchen in midtown manhattan on her quest for the frank sarkowski homicide file but she wasnt thinking about that she was thinking of the clocks at the crime scenes thinking of time moving forward and time standing still thinking of the periods when we want time to race ahead and save us from the pain were experiencing but it never does its at these moments that time slows interminably sometimes even stops like the heart of a deathrow prisoner at the moment of execution gotta talk amelia sachs was recalling a conversation from years earlier nick says its pretty serious the two lovers are in sachss brooklyn apartment shes a rookie in her uniform her shoes polished to black mirrors her fathers advice shined shoes get you more respect than an ironed uniform honey remember that and she had darkhaired handsome bulgingmuscle nick he too couldve been a model is also a cop more senior even more of a cowboy than sachs is now she sits on the coffee table a nice one teak bought a year ago with the last of the fashion modeling money nick was on an undercover assignment tonight hes in a sleeveless tshirt and jeans and wearing his little guna revolveron his hip he needs a shave though sachs likes him scruffy the plans for this evening were hed come home and theyd have a late supper shes got wine candles salad and salmon all laid out all homey on the other hand nick hasnt been home nights for a while so maybe theyll eat dinner later maybe they wont eat at all but now somethings wrong something pretty serious well hes standing in front of her hes not dead or wounded shot down on an undercover setthe most dangerous assignment in copdom he was going after crews jacking trucks a lot of money was involved and that meant a lot of guns three of nicks close buddies have been with him tonight she wonders her heart sinking if one of them was killed she knows them all or is it something else is he breaking up with me lousy lousybut at least its better than somebody getting capped in a shootout with a crew from east new york go on she says look amie its her fathers nickname for her they are the only two men in the world she lets call her by the name the thing is just tell me she says amelia sachs delivers news straight she expects the same youre going to hear it soon i wanted to tell you first im in trouble she believes she understands nicks a cowboy always ready to pull out his mp machine gun and exchange lead with a perp sachs a better shot at least with a pistol is slow to squeeze the trigger her father again you cant take back bullets she supposes that theres been a firefight and that nick has killed someonemaybe even an innocent okay hell be suspended until the shooting review board meets to decide if it was justifiable her heart goes out to him and shes about to say that shed be there for him no matter what well get through it when he adds i got busted you sammy and mefrank r toothe heiststhe truckjackings we got nailed in a big way his voice is shaking shes never known him to cry but it sounds like hes a few seconds away from bawling his eyes out youre on the bag she gasps he stares at her green carpet finally a whisper yeah though now hes started the confession he doesnt need to pull back but its worse worse what could possibly be worse we were the doers we jacked the trucks ourselves you mean tonight you her voice has stopped working oh amie not just tonight for a year the whole fucking year we had guys in warehouses tell us about shipments wed pull the trucks over andwell you get it you dont need to know the details he rubs his haggard face we just heardtheyve issued warrants for us somebody dimed us out they got us cold oh man did they get us shes thinking back to the nights he was out on a set working undercover to collar hijackers at least once a week i got sucked in i didnt have any choice she doesnt need to respond to this to say yes yes yes my god we always have choices amelia sachs doesnt offer excuses herself and shes deaf to them from others he understands this about her of course its part of their love it was part of their love and he stops trying i fucked up amie i fucked up i just came by to tell you you going to surrender i guess i dont know what im going to do fuck numb theres nothing she can think of to say not a single thing shes thinking of their times togetherthe hours on the range wasting pounds of ammo in bars on broadway slogging down frozen daiquiris lying in front of the old fireplace in her brooklyn apartment theyll look into my life with a microscope amie ill tell em youre clean ill try to keep you out of it but theyll ask you a lot of questions she wants to ask why he did it what reason could he possibly have nickd grown up in brooklyn a typical goodlooking streetsmart neighborhood kid hed run with a bad crowd for a while but had some sense smacked into him by his father and gave that up why had he slipped back was it the thrill was it the money that was something else hed hidden from her she realized now whered he been socking it away why but she doesnt have the chance ive got to go now ill call you later i love you he kissed the top of her motionless head then out the door thinking back to those endless moments the endless night time stopped as she sat staring at the candles burning down to pools of maroon wax ill call you later but no call ever came the double hithis crime and the death of their relationshiptook its toll she decided to quit patrol completely give it up for a desk job it was only the chance meeting with lincoln rhyme that pulled her back from that decision and kept her in uniform but the incident sealed within her an abiding repulsion for crooked police it was something that was more horrific to her than lying politicians and cheating spouses and ruthless perps this was why nothing would stop her from finding out if the st james crew was in fact a circle of bad cops from the th precinct and if so nothing would stop her from bringing down the crooked officers and the oc crews working with them her camaro now skidded to the curb sachs tossed the nypd parking identification card onto the chevys dash and climbed out slamming the door fiercely as if she were trying to close a hole that had opened between the present and this hard hard past hell thats gross in the upper floor of the parking garage where the watchmakers suv was found the patrol officer who made this comment to his colleagues was looking down at the figure lying on his belly man you got that one right one of his buddies replied jesus another offered the uncoplike declaration yuck sellitto and bo haumann jogged up to the scene are you all right are you all right sellitto shouted he was speaking to ron pulaski who stood over the man on the ground who was covered with pungent trash the rookie decorated with garbage himself was gasping pulaski nodded scared the hell out of me but im fine man he was pretty strong for a homeless guy a medic ran up and rolled the attacker over on his back pulaskid cuffed him and the metal bracelets jingled on his wrists his eyes danced madly and his clothing was torn and filthy the body stench was overwhelming hed recently urinated in his pants hence gross and yuck what happened haumann asked pulaski i was searching the scene he pointed out the stairwell landing it appeared that the perpetrators made their exit through this locale stop it he reminded himself he tried again the perps ran up those stairs im pretty sure and i was searching up here looking for footprints then i heard something and turned around this guy was coming for me he pointed to a pipe the homeless guy had been carrying i couldnt get my weapon out in time but i threw that trash can at him we fought for a minute or two and i finally got him in a chokehold we dont use those haumann reminded i meant to say i was successfully able to restrain him through selfdefense methods the tactical chief nodded right pulaski found the headset and plugged it back in he winced as a voice blasted into his ears for christs sake are you alive or dead whats going on sorry detective rhyme pulaski explained what had happened youre all right yes im fine good the criminalist said now tell me why the fuck your weapon was inside your overalls an oversight sir wont happen again sir oh it better not whats the numberone rule on a hot scene a hot a hot scenewhere the perp might still be around the rule is search well but watch your back got it yessir so the escape routes contaminated rhyme grumbled well its just covered with garbage garbage was rhymes exasperated response then i guess you better start cleaning it up i want all the evidence here in twenty minutes every bit you think you can do that yes sir ill rhyme disconnected abruptly as two esu officers pulled on latex gloves and carted off the homeless guy pulaski bent down and started to remove the trash he was trying to recall what there was about rhymes tone that sounded familiar finally it occurred to him it was the very same mix of anger and relief when pulaskis father had a discussion with his twin sons after hed caught them having a footrace on the elevated train tracks near their home like a spy standing on a street corner in hells kitchen retired detective art snyder was in a trench coat and old alpine hat with a small feather in it looking like a hasbeen foreign agent from a john le carrã novel amelia sachs walked up to him snyder acknowledged her with only a brief glance and after looking around the streets turned and started walking west away from bustling times square thanks for the call snyder shrugged wherere we going she asked im meeting a buddy of mine we play pool up the street here every week i didnt want to talk on the phone spies an emaciated man with slickedback yellow hairnot blond but yellowhit them up for some change snyder looked at him closely and then handed over a dollar the man walked on saying thanks but grudgingly as if hed been expecting a five they were walking through a dim part of the street when sachs felt something brush her thigh twice and she wondered for a moment if the retiree was coming on to her glancing down though she saw a folded piece of paper that he was subtly passing to her she took it and when they were under a streetlight she looked it over the sheet was a photocopy of a page from a binder or book snyder leaned close whispered thiss a page from the file log at the one three one she looked it over in the middle was an entry file number sarkowski frank subject homicide sent to precinct requested by date sent november date returned the patrolman im working with sachs said said there was no reference in the log to its being checked out he mustve only looked in the computer i looked there too it probably was entered but then it got erased this is the manual backup whyd it go to the one five eight dont know theres no reason for it tove whered you get this a friend found it cop i worked with standup guy already forgot i asked where would itve gone in the one five eight the file room snyder shrugged no idea ill check it out he clapped his hands together fucking cold he looked behind them sachs did too was that a black car pausing at the intersection snyder stopped walking he nodded toward a rundown storefront flannagans pool and billiards est where im going thanks again she told him snyder looked inside then glanced at his watch he said to sachs not many of these old places left in times square i used to work the deuce you know fortysecond street i walked it too she looked back again toward eighth avenue the black car was gone he was staring into the pool hall speaking softly i remember the summers most some of those august days even the gangbangers and chain snatchers were home it was so hot i remember the restaurants and bars and movie theaters some of em had these signs up i guess from the forties or fifties saying they were air conditioned funny a place that advertised they had airconditioning to get people inside pretty different nowadays huhtimes sure change snyder pulled open the door and stepped into the smoky room times sure as hell change chapter their new car was a buick lesabre whered you get it vincent asked duncan as he climbed into the passenger seat the car sat idling at the curb in front of the church the lower east side duncan glanced at him nobody saw you the owner did briefly but hes not going to be saying anything he tapped his pocket where the pistol rested duncan nodded toward the corner where hed slashed the student to death earlier any police around no i mean i didnt see any good sanitation probably picked up the dumpster and the bodys halfway out to sea on a barge slash their eyes what happened at the garage vincent asked duncan gave a slight grimace i couldnt get close to the explorer there werent that many cops but some homeless man was there he was making a lot of noise and then i heard shouting and cops started running into the place i had to leave they pulled away from the curb vincent had no idea where they were going the buick was old and smelled of cigarette smoke he didnt know what to call it it was dark blue but bluemobile wasnt funny clever vincent wasnt feeling very witty at the moment after a few minutes of silence he asked whats your favorite food my food what do you like to eat duncan squinted slightly he did this a lot considered questions seriously and then recited the answers hed planned out but this one flummoxed him he gave a faint laugh you know i dont eat that much but you must have some favorite ive never thought about it whyre you asking oh just i was thinking i could make us dinner sometime i can cook a lot of different things pastayou know spaghetti do you like spaghetti i make it with meatballs i can make a cream sauce they call that alfredo or with tomato the man said well i guess tomato thats what id order in a restaurant then ill make that for you maybe if my sisters in town ill have a dinner party well not a party just the three of us thats duncan shook his head he seemed moved nobodys made me dinner sincewell nobodys made me dinner for a long time next month maybe next month could work whats your sister like shes a couple years younger than me works in a bank shes skinny too i dont mean youre skinny just you know in good shape she married have kids oh no shes really busy at her job shes good at it duncan nodded next month sure ill come back to town we could have dinner i couldnt help you i dont cook oh id do the cooking i like to cook i watch the food channel but i could bring some dessert something already made i know you like your sweets thatd be great said an excited vincent he looked around the cold dark streets wherere we going duncan was silent for a moment he eased the car to a stoplight the front wheels precisely on the dirty white stop line he said let me tell you a story vincent looked over at his friend in seventeen fourteen the british parliament offered twenty thousand pounds to anyone who could invent a portable clock accurate enough to be used at sea that was a lot of money then right huge amount of money they needed a clock for their ships because every year thousands of sailors died from navigational errors see to plot a course you need both longitude and latitude you can determine latitude astronomically but longitude needs accurate time a british clockmaker named john harrison decided to go for the prize he started working on the project in seventeen thirtyfive and finally created a small clock that you could use on a ship and that lost only a few seconds over the course of an entire transatlantic voyage when did he finish in seventeen sixtyone took him that long he had to cope with politics competition conniving businessmen and members of parliament and of course the mechanical difficultiesalmost impossibilitiesof creating the clock but he never stopped twentysix years the light changed to green and duncan accelerated slowly in answer to your question were going to see about the next girl on our list we had a setback but nothings going to stop us its not a big deal in the great scheme of things a brief smile crossed the killers face first of all they have security cameras in the garage rhyme asked sellittos laugh meant in your dreams he pulaski and baker were back in rhymes town house going over what the rookie had collected in the garage the homeless man whod attacked pulaski was in bellevue he had no connection to the case and was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic off his meds wrong time wrong place pulaski had muttered you or him rhymed responded he now asked security cameras at the impound where he boosted the suv another laugh a sigh lets see what ron found first the bullets cooper brought the box to rhyme and opened it for him acaliber acp bullet is an uncommon round the semiautomatic pistol bullet has more range than the smaller but not much stopping power like the more powerful or millimeter thirtytwos have traditionally been called ladies guns the market is somewhat limited but is still quite large finding a compatible in the possession of a suspect could be circumstantial evidence that he was the watchmaker but cooper couldnt just ring up local gun stores and get a short list of whod been buying these rounds lately since seven were missing from the box and the autauga mkii pistol holds seven in a full clip that was rhymes best guess for the weapon but the beretta tomcat the north american guardian and the lws were also chambered for those slugs the killer could be carrying any of them if he was armed at all bullets rhyme pointed out suggest but dont guarantee that the suspect carried or owned a gun rhyme noted that the slug was a grain big enough to do very serious damage if it was fired at close range on the board rookie rhyme commanded pulaski wrote as dictated the book hed found in the explorer was entitled extreme interrogation techniques and had been published by a small company in utah the paper printing job and typographynot to mention the style of writingwere thirdrate written by an anonymous author who claimed hed been a special forces soldier the book described using torture techniques that would ultimately result in death if the subject didnt confessdrowning strangulation suffocation freezing in cold water and others one involved suspending a weight above a subjects throat another cutting his wrists and letting him bleed until he confessed christ dennis baker said wincing its his blueprint hes going to kill ten victims like that sick trace rhyme asked concerned more about the forensic implications of the book than the psychological makeup of its purchaser holding the book over a large sheet of clean newsprint cooper opened every page and dusted each one to dislodge trace nothing fell out no fingerprints either of course cooper learned that the book wasnt sold through the major webbased or retail bookstore chainsthey refused to carry it but it was readily available through online auction companies and a number of rightwing paramilitary organizations which sold everything you needed to protect yourself from the scourge of minorities the foreignborn and the us government itself in recent years rhyme had consulted on a number of terrorist investigations many had been linked to alqaeda and other fundamentalist islamic groups but just as many had involved domestic terrorisma threat he himself felt was being largely ignored by authorities in this country a call to the publisher resulted in no cooperation which didnt surprise rhyme he was told they didnt sell the book directly to readers and if rhyme wanted to find out what retail outlets bought the book in quantity a court order would be necessary it would take weeks to get one do you understand dennis baker snapped into the speakerphone that somebodys using this as a guidebook to torture and kill people well thats sort of what its for you know the head of the company hung up goddamn continuing to look over the evidence they learned that the grit and leaves and cinders that pulaski had extracted from the grille the tire treads and sideview mirrors were not distinctive the trace in the back bed of the suv revealed sand that matched what the prep had used as the obscuring agent in the cedar street alleyway the crumbs were from corn chips potato chips pretzels and chocolate candy bits of peanut butter crackers too as well as stains from sodasugared not diet none of this would lead them to a suspect of course but it could be another plank in the bridge connecting a perp to the explorer if they found one the short cotton fibersfleshcoloredwere as pulaski suggested similar to those shed by a generic brand of work gloves sold in thousands of drugstores garden shops and grocery stores apparently theyd meticulously wiped the explorer after theyd stolen it and worn gloves every time they were inside the vehicle this was a first and a reminder of the watchmakers deadly brilliance the hair from the headrest was nine inches long and was black with some gray in it hair is good evidence since its always falling out or is being pulled out in struggles generally it offers only class characteristics though meaning that a hair found at a scene will provide a circumstantial connection to a suspect who has similar hair based on the color texture length or presence of dye or other chemicals but hair generally cant be individuated that is it cant be linked conclusively to the suspect unless the follicles attached allowing for a dna profile the hair that pulaski found though had no follicle rhyme knew it was too long to be the watchmakersthe efit picture according to hallerstein depicted medium length it might have been from a wigthe watchmaker could be using disguisesbut cooper could find no adhesive on the end his assistant had worn a cap and it could have come from him rhyme decided though that the hair had probably come from someone elsea passenger riding in the suv before the watchmaker stole it a nineinch hair could be a mans or a womans of course but rhyme felt that it was probably a womans the gray suggested middle age and nine inches was an odd length for a man of that age to wear his hairshoulder length or much shorter would be more likely the watchmaker or his assistant may have a girlfriend or another partner but that doesnt seem likely well put it on the board anyway rhymeordered because pulaski said as if reciting something hed heard you just never know right rhyme lifted an eyebrow then he asked shoes the only footprint pulaski had found was from a smoothsoled sizethirteen shoe it was just past a pool of water the wearer had stepped in hed left a half dozen prints on the way to the exit before they faded pulaski was pretty sure it was the watchmakers or his partners since it was on the most logical route from the explorer to the nearest exit hed also noted that there was some distance between the prints and only a few of them displayed the heel means he was running pulaski said that wasnt in your book but it made sense it was hard to dislike this kid rhyme reflected but the print was only marginally helpful there was no way to determine the brand because the leather had no distinctive tread marks nor were there any unusual wear patterns which might indicate podiatric or orthopedic characteristics at least we know hes got big feet pulaski said rhyme muttered i missed that statute where it says someone with sizeeight feet is prohibited from wearing sizethirteen shoes the rookie nodded oops live and learn thought rhyme he looked over the evidence again thats it pulaski nodded i did the best i could rhyme grunted you did fine probably not very enthusiastic he wondered if the results wouldve been different if sachs had been walking the grid he couldnt help but think they would be the criminalist turned to sellitto what about the luponte file nothing yet if you knew more itd be easier to find if i knew more i could find it myself the rookie was staring at the evidence boards all thisand it comes down to we hardly know anything about him not exactly true rhyme thought we know hes one goddamn smart perp

precinct in lower manhattan not far from the th she gave the nightduty file clerk at the gray desk the number of the sarkowski file the woman typed on a computer keyboard a staccato sound a glance at the screen dont have it you sure dont have it hm sachs gave a laugh where do we think its run off to run off to it came here on the twentyeighth or twentyninth of november from the one three one house it looked like it was requested from somebody here snap well its like not logged in you sure it came here no not one thousand percent but one thousand the woman asked chewing away a pack of cigarettes sat next to her ready to be scooped up in a hurry when she fled downstairs on her break or left for the night is there any scenario where it wouldntve been logged scenario would a file always be logged in if its for a specific detective itd go directly to his office and hed log it youve gotta log it its a rule if there was no recipient name on the request then itd come here she nodded at a large basket holding a card that said pending and whoever wanted itd have to come down and pick it up then hed log it in has to be logged in but it wasnt has to be because otherwise how do we know where it is she pointed to another sign log it sachs prowled through the large basket like youre not supposed to do that but see my problem a blink the gum snapped it came here but you cant find it so what do i do about that submit a request somebodyll look for it is that really going to happen because im not sure it would sachs looked toward the file room ill just take a look you dont mind really you cant just take a few minutes you cant sachs walked past her and plunged into the stacks of files the clerk muttered something sachs couldnt hear all the files were organized by number and colorcoded to indicate that they were open or closed or trial pending major cases files had a special border on them red sachs found the recent files and going through the numbers one by one sure enoughthe sarkowski file wasnt there she paused looking up the stacks hands on her hips hi a mans voice said she turned and found herself looking at a tall grayhaired man in a white shirt and navy slacks he had a military bearing about him and he was smiling youre detective sachs im di jefferies a deputy inspector generally ran the precinct shed heard the name but knew nothing about him except that he was obviously a hard worker since he was here still on the job at this late hour what can we do you for detective there was a file delivered here from the one three one about two weeks ago i need it as part of an investigation he glanced at the file clerk whod just dimed her out she was standing in the hallway we dont have it sir i told her that are you sure it was sent here sachs said the log at the transferring house said it was was it logged jefferies asked the clerk no well is it in the pending basket no come on into my office detective ill see what we can do sachs ignored the clerk she didnt want to give her the satisfaction through the nondescript halls turning corners here and there not saying a word sachs struggling on her arthritic legs to keep up with the mans energetic pace inspector jefferies strode into his corner office nodded at the chair across from his desk and closed the door which had a large brass plaque on it halston p jefferies sachs sat jefferies suddenly leaned down his face inches from hers he slammed his fist onto the desk what the fuck do you think youre doing sachs reared back feeling his hot garlicky breath wash over her face iwhat do you mean she swallowed the sir shed nearly appended to the sentence where are you out of where you fucking rookie whats your house sachs couldnt speak for a moment she was so shocked by the mans fury technically im working major cases what the hell does technically mean whore you working for im lead detective on this case im supervised by lon sellitto in mc i you havent been a detective i dont you ever interrupt a superior officer ever you understand me sachs bristled she said nothing do you understand me he shouted perfectly you havent been a detective very long have you no i know that because a real detective wouldve followed protocol she wouldve come to the dep inspector and introduced herself and asked if it was all right to review a file what you didwere you about to interrupt me again she had been she said no what you did was a personal insult to me a fleck of spittle arced between them like a mortar round he paused would it be an interruption to talk now she didnt care i had no intention of insulting you im just running an investigation i needed a file thats turned up missing turned up missing what kind of thing is that to say either its turned up or its missing if youre as sloppy with your investigating as you are with your language im wondering if you didnt lose the file yourself andre trying to cover your ass by blaming us the file was checked out of the one three one and routed here by who he snapped thats the problem that part of the log was blank were there any other files checked out that came here he sat on the edge of his desk and stared down at her sachs frowned he continued any files from anywhere else i dont know what you mean do you know what i do here im sorry whats my job at the one five eight well youre in charge of the precinct i assume you assume he mocked ive known officers dead in the streets because they assumed shot down dead this was getting tedious sachss eyes went cold and locked onto his she had no trouble maintaining the gaze jefferies hardly noticed he snapped in addition to running the precinctyour brilliant deductionim in charge of the manpower allocation committee for the entire department i review thousands of files a year i see what the trends are determine what shifts we need to make in personnel to cover work load i work hand in glove with the city and state to make sure we get what we need you probably think thats a waste of time dont you i dont well its not young lady those files are reviewed by me and theyre returned now whats this particular report youre so goddamn interested in suddenly she didnt want him to know this whole scene was off logically if he had something to hide it was unlikely that hed behave like such a prick but on the other hand he might be acting this way to divert suspicion she thought back shed given the clerk only the file number not the name sarkowski most likely the scatterbrain wouldnt remember the lengthy digit sachs said calmly id prefer not to say he blinked you im not going to tell you jefferies nodded he seemed calm then he leaned forward and slammed his hand down on the desk again you fucking have to tell me i want the case name and i want it now no ill see youre suspended for insubordination you do what you have to inspector you will tell me the name of the file and you will tell me now no i wont ill call your supervisor his voice was cracking he was getting hysterical sachs actually wondered if hed physically hurt her he doesnt know about it youre all the same jefferies said a searing voice you think you get a gold shield you know everything there is to know about being a cop youre a kid youre just a kidand a wiseass one you come to my precinct accuse me of stealing files i didnt insubordinationyou insult me you interrupt me you dont have any idea what its like to be a cop sachs gazed at him placidly shed slipped into a different placeher personal cyclone cellar she knew that there might be disastrous implications from this confrontation but at the moment he couldnt touch her im leaving now youre in deep trouble young lady i remember your shield five eight eight five think i didnt ill see you busted down to warrants howd you like to shuffle paper all day long you do not come into a mans precinct and insult him sachs strode past him flung the door open and hurried up the hall her hands started shaking her breath was coming fast his voice nearly a scream followed her down the hall ill remember your shield ill make some calls if you ever come back to my precinct again you will regret it young lady did you hear me us army sergeant lucy richter locked the door of her old greenwich village coop and headed into the bedroom where she stripped off her dark green uniform bristling with perfectly aligned bars and campaign ribbons she wanted to toss the garment on the bed but of course she hung it carefully in the closet the blouse too and tucked her id and security badges carefully in the breast pocket where she always kept them she then cleaned and polished her shoes before setting them carefully in a rack on the closet door a fast shower then wrapped in an old pink robe she curled up on the shag rug on the bedroom floor and gazed out the window her eyes took in the buildings across barrow street the lights flickering between the windblown trees and the moon white in the black sky above lower manhattan this was a familiar sight to her comforting she used to sit here just like this when she was a little girl lucy had been out of the country for some time and was back home on leave shed finally gotten over the jet lag and the grogginess from a marathon sleepfest now with her husband still at work she was content to sit look out the window and to think about the distant past and the recent the future too of course the hours we have yet to spend seem to obsess us far more than those weve already experienced lucy reflected she grew up in this very coop here in the most congenial of manhattan neighborhoods she loved the village and when her parents moved across town and became snowbirds they transferred the place to their twentytwoyearold daughter three years later the night her boyfriend had proposed to her shed said yes but with a qualification they had to live here he of course agreed she enjoyed her life in the neighborhood hanging out with friends working food service and office jobs a college dropout she was nonetheless always the sharpest and hardest worker among her peers she liked the culture and the quirkiness of the city lucy would sit right here looking out the window south at the imposing landscape of this imposing city think about what she wanted to do with her life or think about nothing at all but then came that september day and she watched it all the flames the smoke then the horrible absence lucy continued her routine more or less content and waited for the anger and hurt to go away the emptiness to fill but they never did and so the skinny girl who was a democrat and liked seinfeld and baked her own bread with organic flour walked out the front door of this coop took the broadway train uptown to times square and enlisted in the army something shed explained to her husband bob she had to do hed kissed her forehead held her hard and didnt try to talk her out of it for two reasons first a former navy seal he thought the military experience was important for everyone and second he believed lucy had an unerring sense of doing the right thing basic training in dusty texas then she shipped out and went overseasbob went with her for some of the time his boss at the delivery company being particularly patrioticwhile they rented out the coop for a year she learned german how to drive every type of truck that existed and a fact about herself that she had an innate gift for organization she was given the job of managing fuelers the men and women who got petroleum products and other vital supplies where they were needed gasoline and diesel fuel win wars empty tanks lose them thats been the rule of warfare for one hundred years then one day her lieutenant came to her and told her two things one she was being promoted from corporal to sergeant two she was being sent to school to learn arabic bob returned to the states and lucy lugged her gear to a c and flew off to the land of bitter fog be careful what you ask for lucy richter had gone from americaa country with a changed landscapeto a place with none her life became desert vistas searing heat from a hovering sun and a dozen different kinds of sandsome of it abrasive grit that scarred your skin some fine as talcum that worked its way into every square inch of existence her job took on a new gravity if a truck runs out of fuel on a trip from berlin to cologne you ring up a supply vehicle if it happens in a combat zone people die and she made sure it never happened hours and hours of juggling tankers and ammunition trucks and the occasional odditylike playing cowgirl to wrangle sheep into transport trucks part of an impromptu voluntary mission to get food to a small village that had been without supplies for weeks sheepwhat a hoot and now she was back in a land with a skyline no livestock outside of delis or food emporium counters no sand no burning sunno bitter fog very different from her life overseas lucy richter though was hardly a woman at peace which is why she was now staring south looking for answers in the great emptiness of the changed landscape yes or no the phone rang she jumped at the sound shed been doing this a lot latelyat every sudden noise phone slamming door backfire chillshe picked up the handset hello hey girl it was a good friend of hers from the neighborhood claire whats happening just chilling hey what time zonere you in god only knows bob home nope working late good meet me for cheesecake only cheesecake lucy asked pointedly white russians youre in the ballpark lets do it they picked a latenight restaurant nearby and hung up with a last look at the black empty southern sky lucy rose pulled on sweats a ski jacket and hat and left the coop she clopped down the dim stairway to the first floor she stopped blinking in surprise as a figure startled her hey lucy the man said smelling of camphor and cigarettes the superintendenthed been old when she grew up herewas carrying bound newspapers out to the sidewalk outweighing him by thirty pounds and six inches taller lucy grabbed two of the bundles from him no he protested mr giradello i have to stay in shape ah in shape youre stronger than my son outside the cold stung her nose and mouth she loved the sensation i saw you in your uniform tonight you get that award this thursday it was just the rehearsal today and its not an award a commendation s the difference good question i dont really know i think you win an award a commendation they give you instead of a pay hike she piled the trash at the curb your parentsre proud a statement not a question they sure are say hi for me i will okay im freezing mr giradello gotta go you take care night lucy started up the sidewalk she noticed a dark blue buick parked across the street two men were inside the one in the passenger seat glanced at her and then down he lifted and drank a soda thirstily lucy thought whod be having a cold drink in weather like this she herself was looking forward to an irish coffee boiling hot and with a double dose of bushmills whipped cream too of course she then glanced down at the sidewalk stopped suddenly and changed course amused lucy richter reflected that patches of slick ice were probably the only danger she hadnt been exposed to in the past eighteen months chapter kathryn dance was alone with rhyme in his town house well jackson the havanese was present too dance was holding the dog that was wonderful she told thom the three of them had just finished a dinner of the aides beef bourguignon rice salad and a caymus cabernet id ask for the recipe but id never do it justice ah an appreciative audience he said glancing at rhyme im appreciative just not excessively thom nodded at the bowl that had held the main course to him its stew he doesnt even try the french tell her what you think of food lincoln the criminalist shrugged im not fussy about what i eat thats all he calls it fuel the aide said and carted the dishes to the kitchen you have dogs at home rhyme asked dance nodding at jackson two theyre a lot bigger than this guy the kids and i take em to the beach a couple times a week they chase seagulls and we chase them exercise all around and if that sounds too healthy dont worry afterward we go for waffles at first watch in monterey and replace any calories weve lost rhyme glanced into the kitchen where thom was washing dishes and pans he lowered his voice and asked if shed engage in bit of subterfuge she frowned i wouldnt mind if a bit of thathe nodded toward a bottle of old glenmorangie scotchended up in there the nod shifted toward his tumbler you might want to keep it quiet though thom a nod he enacts prohibition from time to time its rather irritating kathryn dance knew the value of indulging okay maybe shed gained six pounds in tijuana that had been a long long week she set the dog down and poured him a good healthy dose she fit the cup into the holder of his wheelchair arranging the straw near his mouth thanks he took a long sip whatever youre billing the city for your time ill authorize double pay and help yourself thom wont give you any grief maybe some caffeine she poured a black coffee and allowed herself one of the oatmeal cookies that the aide had set out hed baked them himself dance glanced at her watch three hours earlier in california excuse me for a minute check in at home go right ahead she made a call on her mobile maggie answered hey sweets mommy the girl was a talker and dance got a tenminute account of a christmas shopping trip with her nana maggie concluded with and then we came back here and i read harry potter the new one uhhuh how many times is that six wouldnt you like to read something different expand your horizons maggie replied gee mom like how many timesve you listened to bob dylan that blonde on blonde album or u unassailable logic you got me there sweets only dont say like mom whenre you coming home tomorrow probably love you put your brother on wes came on the phone and they too chatted for a while the conversation more halting and more serious in tone hed been dropping hints about taking karate lessons and now he asked her pointblank if he could dance though preferred he take up something less combative if he wanted a sport other than soccer and baseball his muscular body would be perfect for tennis or gymnastics she thought but those didnt have much appeal to him as an interrogator kathryn dance knew a great deal about the subject of anger she saw it in the suspects as well as the victims she interviewed following crimes she believed that wess recent interest in martial arts came from the occasional anger that settled like a cloud over him after his fathers death competition was fine but she didnt think it would be healthy for him to engage in a fighting sport not at this point in his life sanctioned fury can be a very dangerous thing especially with youngsters she talked to him about the decision for some time working on the watchmaker case with rhyme and sachs had made kathryn dance very aware of time she realized how much she used it in her workand with her children the passage of time for instance diffuses anger quickly outbursts can rarely be sustained longer than three minutes and weakens resistance to opposing positionsbetter than strident argument in most cases dance didnt now say no to karate but got him to agree to try a few tennis lessons shed once overheard him say to a friend yeah it sucks when your moms a cop dance had laughed hard to herself at that then his mood changed abruptly and he was talking happily about a movie hed seen on hbo then his phone was beeping with a text message from a friend he had to go bye mom love you see you soon click the millisecond of spontaneous love you made the whole negotiation worth it she hung up and glanced at rhyme kids me no i dont know that theyd be my strong suit theyre nobodys strong suit until you have them he was looking at her ubiquitous ipod earphones which dangled around her neck like a stethoscope on a doctor you like music i gather hows that for a clever deduction dance said its my hobby really you play i sing some i used to be a folkie but now if i take time off i throw the kids and the dogs into the back of a camper and go track down songs rhyme frowned ive heard of that its called song catching is the popular phrase sure thats it this was a passion for kathryn dance she was part of a long tradition of folklorists people who would travel to outoftheway places to fieldrecord traditional music alan lomax was perhaps the most famous of these hiking throughout the us and europe to capture oldtime songs dance went to the east coast from time to time but those tunes had been well documented so most of her recent trips were to inner cities nova scotia western canada the bayou and places with large latino populations like southern and central california shed record and catalog the songs she told this to rhyme and explained too about a website she and a friend maintained with information on the musicians the songs and the music itself they helped the musicians copyright their original songs and distributed to them any fees listeners paid for downloads of the music several musicians had been contacted by record companies which had bought their music for sound tracks of independent films kathryn dance didnt tell rhyme though that there was more to her relationship with music dance often found herself overloaded to do her job well she needed to hardwire herself to the witnesses and criminals she interviewed sitting three feet from a psychotic killer jousting with him for hours or days or weeks was an exhilarating process but exhausting and debilitating too dance was so empathic and so closely connected to her subjects that she felt their emotions long after the sessions ended she heard their voices in her mind endlessly looping through her thoughts sã sã okay sã i kill her i cut her throat well her son too that boy he there he see me i have to kill him i mean who wouldnt but she deserve it the way she look at me it no my fault can i have that cigarette you talking about the music was a miracle cure if kathryn dance was listening to sonny terry and brownie mcghee or u or dylan or david byrne she wasnt replaying the memory of an indignant carlos allende complaining that the victims engagement ring cut his palm while he was slitting her throat it hurt what im saying bad that bitch lincoln rhyme asked you ever perform professionally she had some but those years in boston and then berkeley and north beach in san francisco had left her empty performance seems personal but shed found that its really about you and the music not you and the listener kathryn dance was much more curious about what other people had to sayand to singabout themselves about life and love she realized that with music as with her job she preferred the role of professional audience she told rhyme tried it but in the end i just thought it was better to keep music as a friend so you became a cop instead about a hundredandeightydegree change go figure howd that happen dance debated normally reluctant to talk about herself listen first talk last she nonetheless felt a connection to rhyme they were rivals in a wayforensics versus kinesicsyet ones who shared a common purpose also his drive and his stubbornness reminded her of herself his clear love of the hunt as well so she said jonny ray hansonjonny without an h a perp she nodded and told him the story six years ago dance had been hired by prosecutors as a consultant to help pick jurors in the case of the state of california v hanson a thirtyfiveyearold insurance agent hanson lived in contra costa county north of oakland a half hour from the home of his exwife who had a restraining order against him one night someone had tried to break into her house the woman wasnt home and some county sheriffs deputies who regularly patrolled past her house spotted and chased him though the perp got away doesnt seem all that seriousbut there was more to it the sheriffs department was concerned because hanson kept up the threats and had assaulted her twice so they picked him up and talked to him for a while he denied it and they let him go but finally they thought they could make a case and arrested him because of the prior offenses dance explained a bande charge would put him away for at least five yearsand give his exwife and collegeage daughter a respite from his harassment i spent some time with them at the prosecutors office i felt so bad for them theyd been living in absolute terror hanson would mail them blank sheets of paper hed leave weird messages on their phone hed stand exactly one block awaythat was okay under the restraining orderand stare at them hed have food delivered to their house nothing illegal but the message was clear ill always be watching you to go shopping mother and daughter had been forced to sneak out of their neighborhood in disguise and go to malls ten or fifteen miles from where they lived dance had picked what she thought was a good jury stacking it with single women and professional men liberal but not too liberal whod be sympathetic to the victims situation as she often did dance stayed through trial to give the prosecution team adviceand to critique her choices as well i watched hanson in court carefully and i was convinced he was guilty but something went wrong dance nodded witnesses couldnt be located or their testimony fell apart physical evidence either disappeared or was contaminated hanson had a series of alibis that the prosecution couldnt shake every key point in the das case was countered by the defense it was as if theyd bugged the prosecutors office he was acquitted thats tough rhyme looked her over but theres more to the story i sense im afraid there is two days after the trial hanson tracked down his wife and daughter in a shopping center parking garage and knifed them to death the daughters boyfriend was with them hanson killed him too he fled the area and was finally caughta year later dance sipped her coffee after the murders the prosecutor was trying to figure out what went wrong at trial he asked me to look over the transcript of the initial interview at the sheriffs office she gave a bitter laugh when i reviewed it i was floored hanson was brilliantand the sheriffs department deputy who interviewed him was either totally inexperienced or lazy hanson played him like a fish he ended up learning enough about the prosecutions case to completely undermine itwhich witnesses to intimidate what evidence he should dispose of what kind of alibis he should come up with and im assuming he got one other bit of information rhyme said shaking his head oh yes the deputy asked if hed ever been to mill valley and later he asked if he ever frequented shopping centers in marin county that gave hanson enough information to know where his ex and their daughter sometimes shopped he basically just camped out around the mill valley mall until they showed up thats where he killed themand they didnt have any police protection there since it was a different county that night i drove back home along route onethe pacific coast highwayinstead of taking the one oh one the big freeway i was thinking here i am being paid a hundred and fifty bucks an hour to anybody who needs a jury consultant thats all fine nothing immoral about thatits the way the system works but i couldnt help but think that if id conducted that interview myself hanson wouldve gone to jail and three people wouldnt have died two days later i signed up for the academy and the rest as they say is history now whats the scoop with you howd i decide to become a cop he shrugged nothing quite so dramatic boring actuallyjust kind of fell into it really rhyme laughed dance frowned you dont believe me sorry was i studying you i try not to my daughter says i look at her like shes a lab rat sometimes rhyme sipped more scotch and said with a coy smile so she lifted an eyebrow so im a tough nut for a kinesics expert somebody like me you cant really read me can you she laughed oh i can read you just fine body language seeks its own level you give just as much away with your face and eyes and head as somebody whos got the use of his whole body really thats the way it works its actually easierthe messages are more concentrated im an open book hm nobodys an open book but some books are easier to read than others i remember you were talking about the response states when you interrogate somebody anger depression denial bargainingafter the accident i had plenty of therapy didnt want to but when youre flat on your back what can you do the shrinks told me about the stages of grief theyre pretty much the same kathryn dance knew the stages of grief very well but once again this was not a subject for today fascinating how the mind deals with adversitywhether its physical trauma or emotional stress rhyme looked off i fight with the anger a lot dance kept her deep green eyes on rhyme and shook her head oh youre not nearly as angry as you make out you are im a crip he said stridently of course im angry and im a woman cop so we both have a right to get pissed off sometimes and depressed for all sorts of reasons and we deny things but anger no not you youve moved on youre in acceptance when im not tracking down killersa nod at the evidence boardim doing physical therapy a lot more than i ought to be doing thom tells me ad nauseam by the way thats hardly accepting things thats not what acceptance is you accept the condition and you fight back youre not sitting around all day oh sorry i guess you are the sorry was not an apology rhyme couldnt help but laugh hard and dance saw that she scored big points with the joke shed assessed that rhyme was a man with no respect for delicacy and political correctness you accept reality youre trying to change it but youre not lying to yourself its a challenge its tough but it doesnt anger you i think youre wrong ah you just blinked twice kinesic stress response you dont believe what youre saying youre a tough woman to argue with he drained the glass ah lincoln ive got your baseline down you cant fool me but dont worry your secrets safe the front door opened amelia sachs walked into the room she tossed off her jacket and the women greeted each other it was obvious from her posture and her eyes that something was troubling her she went to the front window and looked out then pulled the shade down whats the matter rhyme asked i just got a call from a neighbor she said that somebody was at my building today asking about me he gave the name joey treffano i used to work with joey in patrol he wanted to know what i was up to asked a lot of questions looked over the building my neighbor thought it seemed funny and gave me a call and you think somebody was pretending to be joey it wasnt him positive he left the force last year and moved to montana maybe he came back to visit wanted to look you up if he did it was his ghost he was killed in a motorcycle accident last spring and both ron and ive been tailed and earlier today somebody went through my purse it was in my car locked up they broke in where at the scene on spring street near the florists shop it was then that something in the back of kathryn dances mind began to nag she finally seized the memory theres one thing i ought to say might be nothing but its worth mentioning the hour was late but rhyme had called everyone together sellitto cooper pulaski and baker amelia sachs was now looking them over she said we have a problem i want you to know about somebodys been tailing me and ron and kathryn just told me that she thought shed seen someone too the kinesics expert nodded sachs then glanced at pulaski you told me you thought youd seen that mercedes have you seen it again nope not since this afternoon how about you mel anything unusual i dont think so the slim man pushed his glasses higher on his nose but i never pay attention lab techs arent used to being tailed sellitto said he thought he mightve seen someone but wasnt sure when you were in brooklyn today dennis sachs asked baker you get the feeling that somebody was watching you he paused me i wasnt in brooklyn she frowned butyou werent baker shook his head no sachs turned to dance whod been studying baker the california agent nodded sachss hand strayed to her glock and she turned toward baker dennis keep your hands where we can see them his eyes went wide what we need to have a little talk none of the others in the roomwhod been briefed beforehandgave any reaction though pulaski kept his hand near his own piece lon sellitto stepped behind baker hey hey hey the man said frowning and looking over his shoulder at the heavyset detective what is this rhyme said we want to ask you a few questions dennis what kathryn dance had felt worth mentioning was something very subtle and it wasnt that somebodyd been following her sachs had simply said that to keep dennis baker at ease dance recalled that earlier when baker had mentioned that hed been at the scene in front of the florists workshop shed observed him crossing his legs avoiding eye contact and sitting in a position that suggested possible deception his exact comment at that moment was that hed just left the scene and couldnt recall if spring street had been reopened or not since hed have no reason to lie about where he was she didnt think anything of it at the time but when sachs mentioned that somebody had broken into her car at the scenewhere baker had beenshe remembered the lieutenants possibly deceptive behavior sachs had called nancy simpson whod been at the scene and asked her what time baker had left right after you detective the officer had said but baker had said hed stayed for almost an hour simpson added that she believed baker had gone to brooklyn sachs had asked him about being in the borough now to see if dance could pick up signs of possible deception you broke into my car and went through my purse she said her voice was harsh and you asked a neighbor about mepretending to be a cop id worked with would he deny it this could blow up in their faces if dance and sachs were wrong but baker looked down at the floor look thiss all a misunderstanding you talked to my neighbor she asked angrily yes she eased closer to him they were about the same height but sachs in her anger seemed to tower over him you drive a black mercedes he frowned on a cops salary this answer seemed genuine rhyme glanced at cooper who went to the dmv database the tech shook his head not his wheels well they got one wrong but bakerd clearly been nabbed at something so whats the story rhyme asked baker looked at sachs amelia i really wanted you on the case you and lincoln together youre an a team and frankly you guys get good press and i wanted to be associated with you but after i convinced the top floor to bring you on board i heard there was a problem what she asked firmly in my briefcase theres a sheet of paper he nodded to pulaski who was standing beside the battered attachã case its folded up in the top righthand side the rookie opened the case and found it its an email baker continued sachs took it from pulaski she read it once frowning she was motionless for a moment then she stepped closer to rhyme and set it on the wide arm of his wheelchair he read the brief confidential note it was from a senior inspector at police plaza it said that a few years earlier sachs had been involved with an nypd detective nicholas carelli whod been convicted of various charges including hijackings bribes and assault sachs had not been implicated in the incidents but carelli had been released not long ago and the brass were concerned that she might have had some contact with him they didnt think shed done anything illegal but if she was seen with him now it could be the email said embarrassing sachs cleared her throat and said nothing rhyme had known all about nick and sachshow theyd talked about getting married how close theyd been how shattered shed been by his secret life as a criminal baker shook his head im sorry i didnt know how else to handle it i was told to give them a complete report details of where id observed you things i learned about you on the job and off any connection with this carelli or any of his friends thats why you were pumping me for information about her rhyme said angrily thiss bullshit all respect lincoln im putting myself on the line here they wanted to pull her anyway they didnt want her on a highprofile case not with that history but i said no i havent seen nick in years i didnt even know he was out and thats what im going to tell them he nodded toward his briefcase again my notesre in there pulaski found some more sheets of paper he gave them to sachs and she read through then laid them out for rhyme to read they were jottings about the times hed observed her and questions hed asked what hed seen in her calendar and address book what people had said about her you broke and entered sellitto said conceded over the line sorry why the fuck didnt you come to me rhyme snapped or any of us sellitto said this came from high up i was told to keep it quiet baker turned to sachs youre upset im sorry about that but i really wanted you on the case it was the only way i could think of ive already told them my conclusions the whole things gone away look please can we put this behind us and get on with our job rhyme glanced at sachs and what hurt him the most was to see her reaction to the incident she wasnt angry any longer she seemed embarrassed to have been the cause of this controversy and trouble to her fellow officers distracting them from their mission it was so unusualand therefore so hardto see amelia sachs pained and vulnerable she handed the email back to baker without a word to anyone she grabbed her jacket and walked calmly out the doorway pulling her car keys from her pocket chapter vincent reynolds was studying the woman in the restaurant a slim brunette about thirty in sweats her short hair was pulled back and stuck in place with bobby pins theyd followed her from her old apartment in greenwich village first to a local tavern and now here a coffeehouse a few blocks away she and her friend a blonde in her twenties were having a great time laughing and talking nonstop lucy richter was enjoying her last brief moments on earth duncan was listening to classical music on the buicks sound system he was his typically thoughtful calm self sometimes you just couldnt tell what was going on in his mind vincent on the other hand felt the hunger unraveling within him he ate a candy bar then another fuck the great scheme of things i need a girl duncan took out his gold pocket watch and looked at it gently wound the stem vincent had seen the watch a few times but he was always impressed with the piece duncan had explained that it was made by breguet a french watchmaker who lived a long time ago in my opinion the finest who ever lived the watch was simple it had a white face roman numerals and some small dials that showed the phases of the moon and was a perpetual calendar it also had a parachute an antishock system in it duncan explained breguets own invention vincent now asked him how old is it your watch it was made in the year twelve twelve like in roman times duncan smiled no sorry thats the date on the original bill of sale so thats what i think of as the year of manufacture i mean the year twelve in the french revolutionary calendar after the monarchy fell the republic declared a new calendar starting in seventeen ninetytwo it was a curious concept the weeks had ten days and each month had thirty every six years was a leap year devoted exclusively to sports for some reason the government thought the calendar would be more egalitarian than the traditional one but it was too unwieldy it only lasted fourteen years like a lot of revolutionary ideasthey seem good on paper but theyre not very practical duncan studied the golden disk with affection i like watches from that era back then a watch was power not many people could afford one the owner of a watch was a man who controlled time you came to him and you waited until the time hed set for the meeting chains and fobs were invented so that even when a man carried a watch in his pocket you still could see he owned one watchmakers were gods in those days duncan paused i was speaking figuratively but in a way its true vincent cocked an eyebrow there was a philosophical movement in the eighteenth century that used the watch as a metaphor it held that god created the mechanism of the universe then wound it up and started it running sort of a perpetual clock god was called the great watchmaker whether you believe it or not the philosophy had a lot of followers it gave watchmakers an almost priestlike status another glance at the breguet he put it away we should go duncan said nodding at the women theyll be leaving soon he put the car in gear signaled and pulled into the street leaving behind their victim about to lose her life to one man and soon after her dignity to another they couldnt take her tonight though because duncan had learned that she had a husband who worked odd hours and could be home at any moment vincent was breathing deeply trying to keep the hunger at bay he ate a pack of chips he asked how are you going to do it kill her i mean duncan was silent for a few moments you asked me a question earlier about how long it took the first two victims to die vincent nodded well its going to take lucy a long time although theyd lost the book on torture duncan had apparently memorized much of it he now described the technique hed use to murder her it was called water boarding you suspend the victim on her back with her feet up then you tape her mouth shut and pour water up her nose you can take as long as you like to kill the person if you give her air from time to time im going to try to keep her going for a half hour or forty minutes if i can she deserves it hm vincent asked duncan paused the question youre really asking is why am i killing these particular people well it was true ive never told you no you havent trust is nearly as precious as time duncan glanced at vincent then back to the street you know were all on earth for a certain period of time maybe only days or months many years we hope right its as if godor whatever you believe inhas a huge list of everybody on earth when the hands of his clock hit a certain time thats it theyre gone well i have my own list ten people ten people the difference is that god doesnt have any good reason for killing them i do vincent was quiet for a moment he wasnt clever and he wasnt hungry he was just regular vincent listening to a friend sharing something that was important im finally comfortable enough telling you what that reason is and he proceeded to do just that the moon was a band of white light on the hood of the car reflecting into her eyes amelia sachs was now speeding along the east river the emergency flasher sitting cockeyed on the dash she felt a weight crushing her the consequences from all the events of the past few days the likelihood that corrupt officers were involved with killers whod murdered ben creeley and frank sarkowski the risk that inspector flaherty might take the case away from her at any minute dennis bakers espionage and the vote of no confidence from the brass about nick deputy inspector jefferiess tantrum and most of all the terrible news about her father thinking what hope is there in doing your job working hard giving up your peace of mind risking your life if the business of being a cop ultimately spoils the decent core within you she slammed the shifter into fourth nudging the car to seventy the engine howled like a wolf at midnight no cop was better than her father more solid more conscientious and yet look at what had happened to him but then she realized that no no she couldnt think of it that way nothing had happened to him turning bad was his own decision she remembered herman sachs as a calm humorous man who enjoyed his afternoons with friends watching car races roaming with his daughter through nassau county junkyards in treasure hunts for elusive carburetors or gaskets or tailpipes but now she knew that that persona was merely the facade beneath which was a much darker person someone she hadnt known at all within amelia sachss soul was an edgy force something that made her doubt and made her question and compelled her to take risks however great she suffered for this but the reward was the exhilaration when an innocent life was saved or a dangerous perp collared that fire drove her in one direction it had apparently pushed her father in another the chevy fishtailed she easily brought the skid under control over the brooklyn bridge a skidding turn off the highway a dozen more turns this way that way heading south finally she found the pier she was looking for and hit the brakes coming to a stop at the end of tenfoot skid marks she got out of the car slamming the door hard making her way through a small park over a concrete barricade sachs ignored the warning sign and walked out onto the pier through a steady hissing wind man it was cold she stopped at a low wooden railing gripped it in her gloved hands memories assaulted her at age ten a warm summer night her father boosting her up onto the pylon halfway out on the pierit was still thereholding her tight she wasnt afraid because hed taught her to swim at the community pool and even if a gust of wind had blown them off the pier into the east river theyd simply swim back to the ladder laughing and racing climb back upand maybe theyd even jump off again together holding hands as they plummeted ten feet into the murky warm water at age fourteen her father with his coffee and she with a soda looking at the water as he spoke about rose your mother she has her moods amie it doesnt mean she doesnt love you remember that shes just that way but shes proud of you know what she just told me the other day and later after shed become a cop standing here beside the very same camaro shed driven tonight though painted yellow at the time a beautiful shade for a muscle car sachs in her uniform herman in his tweed jacket and cords ive got a problem amie problem sort of a physical thing shed waited feeling her fingernail dig into her thumb its a bit of cancer nothing serious ill be going through the treatment he gave her the detailshed always talked straight to his daughterand then he grew uncharacteristically grave shaking his head but the big problemi just paid five bucks for a haircut and now im going to lose it all rubbing his scalp wish id saved the money the tears now rolled down her cheeks goddamn it sachs muttered to herself stop but she couldnt the tears continued and the icy moisture stung her face returning to the car she fired up the big engine and returned to rhymes when she got home he was upstairs in bed asleep sachs stepped into the exercise room where pulaski had written up the evidence charts on the creeleysarkowski cases she couldnt help but smile the diligent rookie had not only stashed the whiteboard here but hed covered it with a sheet she pulled the cloth off and looked over his careful writing then added a few notations of her own benjamin creeley homicide yearold creeley apparently suicide by

she returned upstairs stripped stepped into the shower and let the hot water pulse down on her hard stinging for a long time she dried off pulled on a tshirt and silk boxers and returned to the bedroom she climbed into bed beside rhyme and rested her head on his chest you all right he asked groggily she said nothing but reached up and kissed his cheek then she lay back and stared at the bedside clock as the digital numbers flipped forward the minutes passed slowly slowly each one an entire long day passing until finally close to am she slept ii am wednesday time is the fire in which we burn delmore schwartz chapter lincoln rhyme had been awake for more than an hour a young officer from the coast guard had delivered a jacket found floating in new york harbor a mans size it was the captain of the boat deduced probably the missing victims both sleeves were covered in blood the cuffs slashed the jacket was a macys house brand and contained no other trace or evidence that could lead back to the owner he was now alone in the bedroom with thom whod just finished rhymes morning routinehis physical therapy exercises and what the aide delicately called hygienic duties rhyme referred to them as the piss n shit detail though usually only when easytoshock visitors were present amelia sachs now walked up the stairs and joined him she dropped her jacket in a chair walked past him opened the curtains she looked out the window into central park the slim young man sensed immediately that something was up ill go make coffee or toast or something he vanished closing the door behind him so what was this rhyme wondered unhappily hed had more than enough personal issues recently than he wanted to deal with her eyes were still looking over the painful brightness of the park he asked so what was this errand that was so important i stopped by argyle security rhyme blinked and looked at her face closely theyre the ones that called after you got written up in the times when we closed that case about the illusionist right argyle was an international company that specialized in safeguarding corporate executives and negotiating the release of kidnapped employeesa popular crime in some foreign countries theyd offered sachs a job making twice what she did as a cop and promised her a carry permita license for a concealed weaponin most jurisdictions unusual for security companies that and the promise to send her to exotic and dangerous locations caught her interest though shed turned them down immediately whats this all about im quitting rhyme quitting the force are you serious she nodded ive pretty much decided i want to go in a different direction i can do good things there too protecting families guarding kids they do a lot of antiterrorist work now he too stared out the window at the stark bald trees of central park he thought about his conversation with kathryn dance the previous day about his early days of therapy one doctor a sharp young man with the nypd terry dobyns had told him nothing lasts forever hed meant this about the depression hed been experiencing now the sentence meant something very different and he couldnt get the words out of his mind nothing lasts forever ah i think i have to rhyme i have to because of your father she nodded dug her finger into her hair scratched winced at that pain or at some other thiss crazy sachs i dont think i can do it anymore be a cop its pretty fast dont you think ive thought about it all night ive never thought about anything so much in my life well keep thinking you cant make decisions like this after you get some bad news bad news everything i thought about dad was a lie not everything rhyme countered one part of his life but the most important part thats who he was first rhyme a cop it was a long time ago the sixteenth avenue club was closed up when you were a baby that makes him less corrupt rhyme said nothing you want me to explain it rhyme like evidence add a few drops of reagent and look at the results i cant all i know is i have a really bad taste in my mouth thiss affected how i look at the whole job he said kindly its gotta be tough but whatever happened to him doesnt touch you all that matters is youre a good cop and a lot fewer casesll be closed if you leave ill only close cases if my hearts in it and its not somethings gone she added pulaskis coming along great hes better now than i was when i started working with you hes better because youve been training him dont do that what butter me up drop those little comments thats what my mother used to do with my father you dont want me to leave i understand but dont play that kind of card but he had to play the card and any other he could think of after the accident rhyme had wrestled with suicide on a number of occasions and though hed come close he always rejected the choice what amelia sachs was now considering was psychic suicide if she quit the force he knew that shed be killing her soul but argyle its not for you he shook his head nobody takes corporate security seriously evenespeciallythe clients no their assignmentsre good and they send you back to school you learn foreign languages they even have a forensics department and the moneys good he laughed since when has this ever been about moneygive it some time sachs whats the hurry she shook her head im going to close the st james case and ill do whatever you need to nail the watchmaker but after that you know if you quit a lot of buttons get pushed itll affect you for a long time if you ever wanted to come back he looked away blood pounding in his temple rhyme she pulled a chair up sat and closed her hand around histhe right one the fingers of which had some sensation and movement she squeezed whatever i do it wont affect us our life she smiled you and me rhyme you and me sachs he looked off lincoln rhyme was a scientist a man of the brain not the heart some years ago rhyme and sachs had met on a hard casea series of kidnappings by a killer obsessed with human bones no one could stop him except these two misfitsrhyme the quadriplegic in retirement and sachs the disillusioned rookie betrayed by her cop lover yet somehow together they had forged a wholeness filling the ragged gaps within each of them and theyd stopped the killer deny it as much as he wanted to those words you and me had been his compass in the precarious world theyd created together he wasnt at all convinced that she was right that they wouldnt be altered by her decision would removing their common purpose change them was he witnessing the transition from before to after have you already quit no she pulled a white envelope from her jacket pocket i wrote the resignation letter but i wanted to tell you first give it a couple of days before you decide you dont owe it to me but im asking a couple of days she stared at the envelope for a long moment finally she said okay rhyme was thinking here we are working on a case involving a man obsessed with clocks and watches and the most important thing to me at this moment is buying a little time from sachs thanks then now lets get to work i want you to understand theres nothing to understand he said with what he felt was miraculous detachment theres a killer to catch thats all we should be thinking about he left her alone in the bedroom and took the tiny elevator downstairs to the lab where mel cooper was at work blood on the jackets ab positive matches what was on the pier rhyme nodded then he had the tech call the nasa jet propulsion lab about the aster informationthe thermal scans to find possible locations of roof tarring it was early in california but the tech managed to track down somebody and put some pressure on him to find and upload the images the pictures arrived soon after they were striking but not particularly helpful there were as sellitto had suggested hundreds possibly thousands of buildings that showed indications of elevated heat and the system couldnt discriminate between locations that were being reroofed under construction being heated with consolidated edison steam or simply had particularly hot chimneys all rhyme could think to do was tell central that any assaults or breakins in or near a building having roofing work done should be patched through to them immediately the dispatcher hesitated and said shed put the notice on the main computer the tone of her voice suggested that he was grasping at straws what could he say she was right lucy richter closed the door to her coop and flipped the locks she hung up her coat and hooded sweatshirt printed on the front with th infantry division fort hood and on the back the divisions slogan steadfast and loyal her muscles ached at the gym shed done five miles at a good pace and percent incline on the treadmill then a half hour of pushups and crunches that was something else military service had done taught her to appreciate muscle you can put down physical fitness if you want make fun of it as vanity and a waste of time but fact is its empowering she filled the kettle for tea and pulled a sugared doughnut out of the fridge thinking about today there were plenty of things that needed to be done phone calls to return emails baking cookies and making her signature cheesecake for the reception on thursday or maybe shed just go shopping with friends and buy dessert at a bakery or have lunch with her mother or lie in bed and watch the soaps pamper herself it was the start of heavenher two weeks away from the land of the bitter fogand she was going to enjoy every minute of it bitter fog this was an expression shed heard from a local policeman outside baghdad referring to fumes and smoke following the detonation of an iedimprovised explosive device explosions in movies were just big flares of flaming gasoline and then were gone nothing left except the reaction shot on the characters faces in reality what remained after an ied was a thick bluish haze that stank and stung your eyes and burned your lungs part dust part chemical smoke part vaporized hair and skin it remained at the scene for hours the bitter fog was a symbol of the horror of this new type of war there were no trusted allies except your fellow soldiers there were no battle lines there were no fronts and you had no clue who the enemy was it might be your interpreter a cook a passerby a local businessman a teenager an old man or somebody five klicks away and the weapons not howitzers and tanks but the tiny parcels that produced the bitter fog the packet of tnt or c or c or the shaped charge stolen from your own armory hidden so inconspicuously that you never saw it untilwell the fact was you never saw it lucy now rummaged in a cabinet for the tea bitter fog then she paused what was that sound lucy cocked her head and listened what was that a ticking she felt her stomach twist at the sound she and bob had no windup clocks but thats what it sounded like what the hell is it she stepped into the small bedroom which they used mostly as a closet the light was out she flicked it on no the sound wasnt coming from there her palms sweating breath coming fast heart pounding im imagining the sound im going crazy ieds dont tick even timed devices have electronic detonators besides was she actually thinking that somebody had left a bomb in her coop in new york city girl you need some serious help lucy walked to the master bedroom doorway the closet door was open blocking her view of the dresser maybe it wasshe stepped forward but then paused the ticking was coming from someplace else not in here she went up the hall to the dining room and looked inside nothing she then continued on to the bathroom she gave a laugh sitting on the vanity next to the tub was a clock it looked like an old one it was black and on the face was a window with a full moon staring at her where had it come from had her aunt been cleaning out her basement again had bob bought it when she was away and set it out this morning after shed left for the health club but why the bathroom the freaky moon face looked at her with its curious gaze almost malevolent it reminded her of the faces of the children along the roadside their mouths curved into an expression that wasnt quite a smile you had no idea what was going on in their heads when they looked at you were they seeing their saviors their enemy or creatures from another planet lucy decided shed call bob or her mother and ask about the clock she went into the kitchen she made the tea and carried the mug into the bathroom the phone too and ran water into the tub wondering if her first bubble bath in months would do anything to wash away the bitter fog on the street in front of lucys apartment vincent reynolds watched two schoolgirls walk past he glanced at them but felt no deepening of the hunger already ravaging his body they were high school kids and too young for him sally anne had been a teenager true but so had he which made it okay through his cell phone vincent heard duncans whispered voice im in her bedroom shes in the bathroom running a bath thats helpful water boarding because the building had a lot of tenants and he could easily be spotted picking the lock duncan had climbed to the top of a building several doors down and made his way over the roofs to lucys then down the fire escape and into her bedroom he was real athletic another difference between the friends okay im going to do it now thank you but then he heard hold on what vincent asked is something wrong shes on the phone well have to wait hungry vincent was sitting forward waiting was not something he did well a minute passed two five whats going on vincent whispered shes still on the phone vincent was furious goddamn herhe wished he could be there with duncan to help kill her what the hell was she doing making phone calls now he wolfed down some food finally the watchmaker said im going to try to get her off the phone ill go back up to the roof and come down the stairs into the hallway ill get her to open the door vincent heard some rare emotion in the mans next comment i cant wait any longer you dont know the half of it thought clever vincent who surfaced momentarily before being sent away by his starving other half stripping for her bath lucy richter heard another sound not the ticking of the moon clock from somewhere nearby inside the hallway the alley a click metallic what was it the life of the soldier is the sound of metal on metal slipping the long rounds of rifle ammo fragrant with oil into the clips loading and locking the colts vehicle door latches fuelers belt buckles and vests clinking the ring of a slug from an ak dancing off a bradley or humvee the noise again click click then silence she felt chill air as if a window was open where the bedroom she decided half naked she walked to the bedroom doorway and glanced in yes the window was open but when shed glanced in earlier hearing the ticking hadnt it been closed she wasnt sure the lucy commanded dont be so damn paranoid soldier getting pretty tired of this therere no ieds no suicide bombers here no bitter fog get a grip one arm covering her breaststhere were apartments across the alleyshe closed and locked the window looked down into the alley saw nothing it was then that somebody began pounding on the front door lucy spun around gasping she pulled on a bathrobe and hurried to the dark foyer whos there there was a pause then a mans voice called im a police officer are you all right she called whats wrong its an emergency please open the door are you okay alarmed she pulled the robe belt tight and undid the deadbolts thinking of the bedroom window and wondering if somebodyd been trying to break it she unhooked the chain lucy twisted the lock reflecting only after the door began to push open toward her that she probably shouldve asked to see an id or a badge before she unhooked the chain shed been caught up in a very different world for so long that shed forgotten there were still plenty of bad people stateside amelia sachs and lon sellitto arrived at the old apartment building in greenwich village nestled on quaint barrow street thats it uhhuh sellitto said his fingers were blue his ears red they looked into the alley beside the building sachs surveyed it carefully whats her name she asked richter lucy i thinks her first name which windows hers third floor she glanced up at the fire escape they continued on to the front stairs of the apartment building a crowd of people were watching sachs scanned their faces still convinced that the watchmaker had swept up at the first scene because he intended to return which meant he might have remained here too but she saw no one that resembled him or his partner were sure it was the watchmaker sachs asked frank rettig and nancy simpson cold and huddling next to the crime scene rapid response van parked cockeyed in the middle of barrow yep he left one of those clocks rettig explained with the moon faces sachs and sellitto started up the stairs one thing nancy simpson said the detectives stopped and turned the officer nodded at the building grimacing it wont be pretty chapter sachs and sellitto ascended the stairs slowly the air in the dim stairwell smelled of pine cleanser and oil furnace heat howd he get in sachs mused this guys a ghost he gets in however he fucking wants to she looked up the stairwell they paused outside the door a nameplate said richterdobbs it wont be pretty lets do it sachs opened the door and walked into lucy richters apartment where they were met by a muscular young woman in sweats hair pinned up she turned away from the uniformed officer shed been talking to her face darkened as she glanced at sachs and sellitto and noticed the gold badges around their necks youre in charge asked lucy richter angrily stepping forward right in lon sellittos face im one of the detectives on the case he identified himself sachs did too lucy richter put her hands on her hips what the hell do you people think youre doing the soldier barked you know theres some psycho leaving these goddamn clocks when he kills people and you dont tell anybody i didnt survive all these months of combat in the goddamn desert just to come home and get killed by some motherfucker because you dont bother to share that information with the public it took some time to calm her down maam sachs explained his mo isnt that hes delivering these clocks ahead of time to let people know hes on his way he was here in your apartment you were lucky lucy richter was indeed fortunate about a half hour ago a passerby happened to see a man climb onto her fire escape and head for the roof hed called to report it the watchmaker had apparently glanced down realized hed been spotted and fled a search of the neighborhood could find no trace of him and no witnesses had seen anyone matching the watchmakers image on the computer composite sachs glanced toward sellitto who said were very sorry for the incident ms richter sorry she scoffed you need to go public with it the detectives glanced at each other sellitto nodded we will ill have public affairs make an announcement on the local news sachs said id like to search your apartment for evidence he mightve left and ask you a few questions about what happened in a minute i have to make some calls my familyll hear about this on the news i dont want them to worry this is pretty important sellitto said the soldier opened her cell phone in a firm voice she added like i said in a minute rhyme you there go ahead sachs the criminalist was in his laboratory connected to sachs via radio he recalled that in the next month or so theyd planned to try a highdefinition video camera mounted to her head or shoulder broadcasting to rhymes lab which would let him see everything that she saw theyd joked and called it a james bond toy he felt a pang that it would not be sachs inaugurating this device with him then he forced the sentiment away what he often told those working for him he now told himself theres a perp out there nothing matters but catching him and you cant do that if youre not concentrating percent we showed lucy the composite of the watchmaker she didnt recognize him howd he get inside today not sure if hes sticking to his mo he picked the front door lock but then i think he went up to the roof and climbed down the fire escape to the vics window he got inside left the clock and was waiting for her but for some reason he climbed back outside thats when the wit outside saw him and the watchmaker booked on out of here went back up the fire escape where was he inside her apartment he left the clock in the bathroom the fire escape is off the master bedroom so he was in there too she paused then came on a moment later theyve been canvassing for witnesses but nobody saw him or his car maybe he and his partner are on foot since weve got his suv a half dozen different subway lines serve greenwich village and they could easily have escaped via any of them i dont think so rhyme explained that he felt the watchmaker and his assistant would prefer wheels the choice of using vehicles or not when committing a crime is a consistent pattern in a criminals mo it rarely changes sachs searched the bedroom the fire escape the bathroom and the routes he wouldve taken to get to those places she checked the roof too it had not been recently tarred she reported nothing rhyme its like hes wearing a tyvek suit of his own hes just not leaving anything behind edmond locard the famed french criminalist developed what he called the exchange principle which stated that whenever a physical crime occurs there is some transfer of evidence between the criminal and the location he leaves something of himself at the scene and he takes some of the scene with him when he departs the principle is deceptively optimistic though because sometimes the trace is so minuscule its missed and sometimes its easily located but provides no helpful leads for investigators still locards principle holds that there would be some transfer of materials rhyme often wondered though if there existed the rare criminal who was as smart as or smarter than rhyme himself and if such a person could learn enough about forensic science to commit a crime and yet flaunt locards principleleave behind no evidence and pick up none himself was the watchmaker such a person think sachs theres got to be more something were missing what does the vic say shes pretty shaken up not really concentrating after a pause rhyme said im sending down our secret weapon kathryn dance sat across from lucy richter in the living room of her apartment the soldier was beneath a jimi hendrix poster and a wedding photo of lucy and her husband a roundfaced cheerful man in a dress military uniform dance noted the woman was pretty calm considering the circumstances though as amelia sachs had said something was clearly troubling her dance had the impression that it was partly something other than the attack she didnt exhibit the posttraumatic stress reactions of a near miss she was troubled in a more fundamental way if you dont mind could you go through the details again if itll help catch that son of a bitch anything lucy explained that shed gone to the gym to work out that morning when she returned she found the clock i was upset the ticking her face now revealed a subtle fear reaction fightorflight at dances prompting she explained about the bombs overseas i guessed it was a present or something but it kind of freaked me out then i felt a breeze and went to look i found the bedroom window open thats when the police showed up nothing else unusual no not that i can remember danced asked her a number of other questions lucy richter didnt know theodore adams or joanne harper she couldnt think of anyone whod want to hurt her shed been trying to recall something else that could help the police but was drawing a blank the woman was outwardly brave that son of a bitch but dance believed that something in lucys mind was preventing her subconsciously from focusing on what had just happened the classic defensive crossing of her arms and legs was a sign indicating not deception but a barrier against whatever was threatening her the agent needed a different approach she put her notebook down what are you doing in town she asked conversationally lucy explained that she was here on leave from her duty in the middle east normally shed have met her husband bob in germany where they had friends but she was getting a commendation on thursday oh part of that parade supporting the troops right afterward congratulations her smile fluttered dance noticed the minuscule reaction and she noted one in herself as well kathryn dances husband had been recognized for bravery under fire by the bureau four days before hed died but that was a crackle of static that dance immediately tuned out shaking her head the agent continued you come back to the states and look what happensyou run into this guy thats pretty shitty especially after being overseas its not that bad over there sounds worse on the news stillbut it looks like youre coping pretty well her body was telling a very different story oh yeah you do what you have to no big deal her fingers wereentwined what do you do there i manage fuelers basically its running supply trucks important job a shrug i guess good to be here on leave ill bet you ever in the service no dance answered well in the army remember rule number one never pass up r and r even if its just drinking punch with the brass and collecting a wall decoration dance kept drawing her out how many other soldiersll be at the ceremony eighteen lucy wasnt comfortable at all dance wondered if her underlying uneasiness was because she might have to say a few words in front of the crowd public speaking was higher on the fear scale than skydiving and how bigs the event going to be i dont know a hundred maybe two is your family going oh yeah everybody were going to have a reception here afterward as my daughter says dance offered parties rock whats on the menu forgeddabout it lucy joked were in the village itll be italian baked ziti scampi sausage my mother and auntre cooking im making dessert my downfall dance said sweetsim getting hungry then she said sorry i got distracted leaving the notebook closed she looked into the womans eyes back to your visitor you were saying you made your tea running the bath you feel a breeze you go into the bedroom the windows open what was i asking oh was there anything else you saw that was out of the ordinary not really she said this quickly as before but then she squinted wait you knowthere was one thing really dance had done whats known as flooding shed decided that it wasnt only the watchmaker that was bothering lucy but rather her duty overseas as well as the upcoming awards ceremony for some reason dance had gone back to the topics and kept bombarding her with questions in hopes of numbing her and letting the other memories break through lucy rose and walked to the bedroom saying nothing dance followed her amelia sachs joined them the soldier looked around the room careful dance told herself lucy was onto something dance kept silent too many interviewers ruin a session by pouncing the rule with vague memories is that you can let them surface but you can rarely reel them in watching and listening are the two most important parts of the interview talking comes last there was something that bothered me something other than the window being open oh you know what ive got it when i walked to the bedroom earlier to see about the ticking something was differenti couldnt see the dresser why was that unusual because when i left to go to the health club i glanced at it to see if my sunglasses were there they were and i picked them up but then when i looked into the room later when i heard the ticking i couldnt see the dresserbecause the closet door was partly open dance said so after the man left the clock he was probably hiding in the closet or behind the door makes sense lucy said dance turned to sachs who nodded with a smile and said good i better get to work and she pulled open the closet door with her latexgloved hand a second time theyd failed duncan was driving even more carefully meticulously than he usually did he was silent and completely calm which bothered vincent even more if duncan slammed down his fist and screamed like his stepfather vincent would have felt better you did what the man had raged referring to the rape of sally anne you fat pervert he was worried that duncan had had enough and was going to give up the whole thing vincent didnt want his friend to go away duncan merely drove slowly stayed in his lane didnt speed didnt try to beat yellow lights and didnt say a word for a long time finally he explained to vincent what had happened as hed started to climb to the roofplanning to get into the building knock on lucys door and get her to hang up the phone hed glanced down and seen a man in the alley staring at him pulling his cell phone from his pocket shouting for duncan to stop the killer had hurried to the roof run west several buildings then rapelled into the alley hed then sprinted to the buick duncan was driving meticulously yes but without any obvious destination at first vincent wondered if this was to lose the police but there didnt seem to be any risk of pursuit then he decided that duncan was on automatic pilot driving in large circles like the hands of a clock once again the shock of a narrow escape faded and vincent felt the hunger growing again hurting his jaw hurting his head hurting his groin if we dont eat we die he wanted to be back in michigan hanging out with his sister having dinner with her watching tv but his sister wasnt here she was miles and miles away maybe thinking of him right nowbut that didnt give him any comfort the hunger was too intense nothing was working out he felt like screaming vincent had better luck cruising strip malls in new jersey or waiting for a college coed or receptionist jogging through a deserted park what was the point of in his quiet voice duncan said im sorry you im sorry vincent was disarmed his anger diminished and he wasnt sure what to say youve been helping me working hard and look whats happened ive let you down here was vincents mother explaining to him when he was ten that shed let him down with gus then with her second husband then with bart then with rachel the experiment then with her third husband and every time young vincent had said just what he said now its okay no its noti talk about the great scheme of things but that doesnt minimize our disappointments i owe you and ill make it up to you which is something his mother never said much less did leaving vincent to find what comfort he could in food tv shows spying on girls and having his hearttohearts no it was clear that his friend duncan meant what he was saying he was genuinely remorseful that vincent hadnt been able to have lucy vincent still felt the urge to cry but now for a different reason not from the hunger not from frustration he felt filled with an odd sensation people hardly ever said nice things to him like this people hardly ever worried about him look duncan said the one im going to do next youre not going to want her is she ugly not really its just the way shes going to dieim going to burn her oh in the book remember the alcohol torture not really the pictures in the book were of men being tortured they hadnt interested vincent you pour alcohol on the lower half of someones body and set fire to it you can put out an alcohol fire quickly if they confess of course im not going to be putting it out true vincent agreed he wouldnt want her after that but i have another idea duncan then explained what he had in mind vincents spirits improving with every word duncan asked dont you think itll work out for everybody well not quite everybody thought clever vincent who was back and in a pretty good mood all things considered sitting in front of the evidence charts rhyme heard sachs come back on the line okay rhyme weve found he was hiding in the closet which one in lucys bedroom rhyme closed his eyes describe it to me sachs gave him the whole scenethe hallway leading to the bedroom the layout of the bedroom itself then the furniture pictures on the wall the watchmakers entrance and exit route and other details everything was described in precise objective detail her training and experience shone as sharply as her red hair if she left the force he wondered how long it would take another cop to walk the grid as well as she did forever he thought cynically anger flared for a moment then he forced the emotion away and concentrated again on her words sachs described the closet six feet four inches wide filled with clothes mens on the left womens on the right half and half shoes on the floor fourteen pair four mens ten womens a typical ratio rhyme reflected for a married couple thinking of his own closet from years ago when he was hiding was he lying on the floor no too many boxes he heard her ask a question then she came back on the line the clothesre ordered now but he mustve moved them i can see some boxes moved on the floor and a few bits of that roofing tar we found earlier what were the clothes he was hiding between a suit and lucys army uniform good certain garments like uniforms are particularly good at collecting evidence thanks to their prominent epaulettes buttons and decorations was he against the front or back front perfect go over every button medal bar decoration okay give me a few minutes then silence his impatience laced with anger was back he stared at the whiteboards finally she said i found two hairs and some fibers he was about to tell her to check the hairs against samples in the apartment but of course he didnt need to do this i compared the hairs to hers they dont match he began to tell her to find a sample of the womans husbands hair when sachs said but i found her husbands brush im ninetynine percent sure theyre his good sachs good but the fibersthey dont seem to match anything else here sachs paused they look like wool lightcolored maybe a sweaterbut they were caught on a pocket button at about shoulder level for a man of the watchmakers height could be a shearling collar a reasonable deduction though theyd have to examine the fibers more carefully in the lab after a few minutes she said thats about it rhyme not much but its something okay bring everything in well go over it here he disconnected the line thom wrote down the information sachs gave them after the aide left the room lincoln rhyme stared again at the charts he wondered if the notes he was looking at werent simply clues in a homicide case but evidence of a different sort of murder the corpse of the last crime scene he and amelia sachs would ever work together lon sellitto was gone and inside lucy richters apartment sachs was just finishing packing up the evidence she turned to kathryn dance and thanked her hope its helpful thats the thing about crime scene work only a couple of fibers but they could be enough for a conviction well just have to see sachs added im heading back to rhymes listen i dont know if youd be willing but could you do some canvassing in the neighborhood youve sure got the touch when it comes to wits you bet sachs gave her some printouts with the watchmakers composite picture and left to head back to rhymes dance nodded at lucy richter youre doing okay fine the solider replied and offered a stoic smile she walked into the kitchen and put the kettle on the stove you want some tea or coffee no im going to be outside looking for witnesses lucy was staring down at the floor a good semaphore signal to a kinesics expert dance said nothing the soldier said you said you were from california you going back soon tomorrow probably just wondering if youd have time for coffee or something lucy played with a potholder on it were the words th infantry division steadfast and loyal sure well work it out dance found a card in her purse and wrote her hotel name on it then circled her mobile on the front lucy took it call me dance said i will everything okay oh sure just fine dance shook the womans hand then left the apartment reminding herself of an important rule in kinesic analysis sometimes you dont need to uncover the truth behind every deception youre told chapter amelia sachs returned to rhymes with a small carton of evidence what do we have he asked sachs went over again what shed found at the scene then added details on the boards according to the nypd crime scene database on fibers what sachs had discovered on lucys uniform was from a shearling coat the sort of collar found on leather jackets that used to be worn by pilotsbomber jackets sachs had fieldtested the clock for nitratesthis one wasnt explosive eitherand it was identical to the other three yielding no trace except a recent stain of what turned out to be wood alcohol the sort used as an antiseptic and for cleaning as with the florist the watchmaker hadnt had time to leave another poem or had chosen not to rhyme agreed to go public with the announcement about the calling card of the clock though he predicted that all the announcement would do would be to guarantee that the killer didnt leave a clock until he was sure the victim was unable to call for help the trace that sachs had found along the route where the killer had most likely escaped revealed nothing helpful there wasnt anything else she explained nothing rhyme asked he shook his head locards principle ron pulaski arrived pulling off his coat and hanging it up rhyme noticed that sachss eyes turned at once to the rookie the other case sachs asked any luck with the maryland connection the rookie replied three ongoing federal investigations into corruption at the baltimore waterfront one of them has a link to the new york metro area but it was only the jersey docks and its not about drugs theyre looking into kickbacks and falsified shipping documents im waiting to hear back from baltimore pd about state investigations neither creeley or sarkowski had any property in maryland and neither of them ever went there on business that i could find the closest creeley got was regular business meetings in pennsylvania to meet some client and sarkowski didnt travel at all oh and still no client list from jordan kessler i left a message again but he hasnt returned the call he continued i found a couple of people assigned to the one one eight who were born in maryland but they dont have any connection there now i ran a roster of names of everybody whos assigned to the house against property tax databases in maryland wait sachs said you did that was that wrong uhm no ron it was right good thinking sachs shared a smile with rhyme he lifted an eyebrow impressed maybe but nothing panned out well keep digging sure thing sachs then walked over to sellitto and asked got a question you know halston jefferies dep inspector at the one five eight right whats with him got a real short fuse sellitto laughed yeah yeah hes a rageaholic so im not the only one he acts that way with nup reams you out for no reason howd you cross paths he glanced at rhyme nope the criminalist replied cheerfully thatd have to be her case not my case her exasperated look didnt faze him pettiness could in some circumstances be quite exhilarating rhyme reflected i needed a file and i went to the source he thought i shouldve gotten his okay but you needed to keep the brass in the dark about whats going on at the one one eight exactly its just the way he is had some problems in the past his wife was a socialite thats a great word pulaski interrupted socialite like socialist only theyre opposites in a way when sellitto shot him a cool look the rookie fell silent the detective continued i heard they lost some serious money jefferies and his wife i mean big money money you and me we cant even find where the decimal point goes some business thing his wife was into he was hoping to run for officealbany i think but you cant go there without big bucks and she left him after the business fell through though with a temper like that he had tove had issues beforehand she was nodding at this information when her phone rang she answered thats right thats me oh no whereill be there in ten minutes her face pale and grave she hurried out the door saying problem ill be back in a halfhour sachs rhyme began but he heard only the slamming front door in response the camaro eased up over the curb on west fortyfourth street not far from the west side highway a big man in an overcoat and a fur hat squinted at sachs as she climbed out of the car she didnt know him or he her but the allbusiness parking job and the nypd placard on the dash made it clear she was the one he was waiting for the young mans ears and nose were bright red and steam curled from his nose he stamped his feet to keep the circulation going whoa thiss cold im sicka winter already you detective sachs yeah youre coyle they shook hands he had a powerful grip whats the story she asked come on ill show you where the van in the lot up the street as they walked briskly in the cold sachs asked what house you from coyle had identified himself as a cop when he called the traffic was loud he didnt hear she repeated her question what house you from midtown south he blinked at her yeah then blew his nose i was there for a while sachs told him hmm coyle said nothing else he directed her through the large parking lot at the far end coyle stopped next to a windstar van the windows dark the motor running he glanced around then opened the door canvassing apartments and stores in greenwich village near lucy richters kathryn dance was reflecting on the symbiotic relationship between kinesic and forensic sciences a practitioner of kinesics requires a human beinga witness a suspectthe same way a forensic scientist requires evidence yet this case was distinguished by a surprising absence of both people and physical clues it frustrated her shed never been involved in an investigation quite like this one excuse me sir madam hey there young man there was some police activity near here earlier today did you hear about it ah good i wonder if you happened to see anyone in that area leaving quickly or did you see anything suspicious anything out of the ordinary take a look at this picture but nothing dance didnt even recognize chronic witnessitis the malady where people clearly know something but claim they dont out of fear for themselves or their families no after forty freezing minutes on the street shed found the problem was simply that nobodyd seen squat excuse me sir yes its a california id but im working with the new york police department you can call this number to verify that now have you seen zero dance was taken aback once shocked actually when she approached a man coming out of an apartment shed blinked and her thoughts froze as she stared up at himhe was identical to her late husband shed controlled herself and run through her litany hed sensed something was up though and frowned asking if she was all right how unprofessional can we be dance thought angrily fine shed said with a fake smile like his neighbors though the businessman hadnt seen anything unusual and headed up the street with a long look back at him dance continued her search she wanted a lead wanted to help nail this perp like any cop of course she wanted to take a sick dangerous man off the streets but she also wanted to spend time interviewing him after hed been collared the watchmaker was different from any other perp shed ever come up against kathryn dance wanted badly to find out what made him tickand laughed to herself at the unintended choice of words she continued stopping people for another block but found no one who could help until she met the shopper on the sidewalk a block from lucys apartment she stopped a man wheeling a handcart filled with groceries he glanced at the composite picture of the watchmaker and said impulsively oh yeah i think i saw somebody who looked like him then he hesitated but i didnt really pay any attention he started to leave kathryn dance though knew instantly hed seen more witnessitis thiss really important all i saw was somebody running up the street thats it listen got an idea anything perishable in there she nodded at the grocery cart he hesitated again trying to anticipate her not really how bout if we get some coffee and i ask you a few more questions you mind she could tell he did mind but just then a blast of icy wind rocked them and he looked like he wouldnt mind getting out of the cold i guess but i really cant tell you anything else oh well see about that amelia sachs sat in the back of the van with coyles help she was struggling to get retired detective art snyder into a sitting position on the backseat of the van he was half conscious muttering words she couldnt hear when coyle had first opened the door snyder had been sprawled out head back unconscious and she thoughtto her horrorthat hed killed himself she soon learned that he was simply drunk though extremely so shed shaken him gently art hed opened his eyes frowning and disoriented now the two officers got him on a seat no just wanna sleep leave me alone wanna sleep thiss his van yeah coyle answered what happened howd he get here he was up the street at harrys they wouldnt serve himhe was drunk alreadyand he wandered outside i came in to buy some ciggies just after the bartender knew i was a cop and told me about him didnt want him to drive off and kill himself or somebody else i found him here halfway inside your card was in his pocket art snyder shifted groggily leave me alone his eyes closed she glanced at coyle ill take over from here you sure yeah only could you flag down a cab send it over here sure the cop climbed out of the van and walked away sachs crouched down touched his arm art he opened his eyes squinting as he recognized her you art were going to get you home leave me alone leave me the fuck alone there was a cut on his forehead and his sleeve was torn from a fall hed vomited not long ago he snapped havent you done enough havent you fucking done enough to me his eyes bulged go away i want to be alone leave me alone he rolled to his knees tried crawling to the drivers seat goaway sachs pulled him back he wasnt a small man but the alcohol had weakened him he tried to stand but fell back on the seat you were doing great she nodded at a pint bottle on the floor it was empty whats it to you what the fuck is it to you what happened she persisted dont you get it you happened you me why did i think itd keep quiet therere no fucking secrets in the department i ask a few questions for you wheres the fucking file what happened to

him and me and our wives were going on a cruise guess who cant fucking make itall because i was asking questions a retired cop asking questionsi shouldve told you to go fuck yourself the minute you walked through the door art i oh dont worry lady i didnt mention your name didnt mention anything he groped for the bottle he saw it was empty and flung it to the floor look i know a good counselor you can counselor whats he gonna counsel me on how i fucked up my life she glanced toward the bottle you stumbled everybody stumbles not what im talking about thiss because i fucked everything up what do you mean art because i was a cop i wasted everything i wasted my life she felt a chill his words echoed her feelings he was expressing exactly the reason she wanted to leave the force she said art how bout we get you home i couldve done a hundred other things my brothers a plumber my sister went to grad school and works for an ad agency now she did that butterfly commercial for those feminine things shes famous i couldve done something youre just feeling dont he snapped pointing a finger at her you dont know me good enough to talk to me that way you got no right sachs fell silent true she didnt have the right whatever happens causa what youre looking into im fucked good or bad im fucked her heart chilled to see his anger and pain she put her arm around him art listen get your hands off me his head lolled against the window coyle walked up a moment later directing a yellow cab toward the van together coyle and sachs helped snyder to the cab and got him inside she gave the driver snyders address then emptied her wallet handing him close to fifty dollars and the detectives car keys ill call his wife let her know hes coming she told the cabbie the taxi eased into thick midtown traffic thanks she said to coyle who nodded and walked off she was grateful he didnt ask any questions after he was gone sachs reached into her pocket and extracted snyders pistol which shed lifted from his rear belt holster when shed put her arm around him maybe he had another piece at home but at least he wouldnt be using this one to kill himself she unloaded it kept the bullets and hid the weapon in the springs under the front passenger seat she then locked the door and returned to her car her index finger dug into her thumb her skin itched her anger steamed as she realized that apart from the extortion and the stolen evidence there was a broader crime that her fatherand all crooked copscommitted her simple effort to get to the truth had turned into something flinty and dangerous affecting even the innocent snyders future life as a retiree which hed looked forward to for years was dissolving all because of whatever happened at the th precinct just like the families of the convicted cops in the sixteenth avenue club had their lives changed forever by what her father and his buddies had done wives and children had been forced to give up their homes to banks and quit school to get jobs theyd been ostracized forever tainted by the scandal she still had time to get outleave police work and get out get into argyle get away from the bullshit and the politics make a new life for herself she still had time but for art snyder it was too late why dad whyd you do it amelia sachs would never know time had passed on and taken with it any chance she might find answers to that question all she could do was speculate which does nothing but leave a wound in the soul that feels like it will never heal turning back the clock was the only answer and that of course was no answer at all tony parsons was sitting across from kathryn dance in a coffee shop his shopping cart of groceries beside them he squinted and shook his head ive been trying to remember but i really cant think of anything else he grinned think you wasted your money he lifted his coffee cup well well give it a shot dance knew he had more information her guess was that hed spoken without thinkingoh how interrogators love impulsive subjectsand then realized that the man hed seen might be a killer maybe even the one whod committed those horrible murders at the pier and in the alleyway the previous day dance knew that people who are happy to give statements about cheating neighbors and shoplifting teens grow forgetful when the crimes turn capital maybe a tough nut dance reflected but that didnt bother her she loved challenges the exhilaration she often felt when a subject finally confessed was always dulled by the thought that the signature on his statement marked the end of another verbal battle she poured milk into her coffee and looked longingly at a piece of apple pie sitting in a display case at the counter four hundred and fifty calories oh well she turned back to parsons he poured some extra sugar into his coffee and stirred it you know maybe if we just talked about it for a bit i could remember something else thats a great idea he nodded now then lets have us a good old hearttoheart and gave her a big smile chapter she was his consolation prize she was his present from gerald duncan she was the killers way of saying he was sorry and meaning it not like vincents mother it was also a good way to slow down the policeraping and killing one of their own duncan had mentioned the redheaded policewoman working at the site of the second murder and suggested vincent take her oh yes pleasered hair like sally annes but watching the police at lucy richters apartment in greenwich village from the buick he and duncan had realized there was no way to get to the redhead she was never by herself yet the other woman a plainclothed detective or something started up the street by herself looking for witnesses it seemed duncan and vincent had gone into a discount store and bought the handcart a new winter jacket and fifty dollars worth of soap junk food and soda to fill the cart with somebody wheeling around groceries isnt suspicioushis friend always always thinking the plan was for vincent to start trolling the streets of greenwich village until he found the second cop or she found him then hed lead her to an abandoned building a block from lucy richters place vincent would take her to the basement and he could have her for as long as he wanted while duncan would take care of the next victim duncan had then studied vincents face would you have a problem killing her the policewoman afraid hed disappoint his friend who was doing him such a wonderful favor vincent had said no but duncan obviously knew it wasnt true tell you whatjust leave her in the basement tie her up after im through in midtown ill drive down there and take care of her myself vincent had felt a lot better hearing that the hunger raged through him now as he looked over kathryn dance sitting only a few feet from him her braid her smooth throat her long fingers she wasnt heavy but she had a good figure not like those skinny model sorts you saw a lot of in the city whod want somebody like that her figure made him hungry her green eyes made him hungry even her name kathryn made him hungry for some reason it seemed to fall into the same category of name as sally anne he couldnt say why maybe it was oldfashioned also he liked the way she looked hungrily at the desserts shes just like me he could hardly wait to get her facedown in the building up the street he sipped the coffee so you were saying youre from california vincentwell helpful tony parsonsasked thats right pretty ill bet is yes parts of it now think back to what you saw exactly that man running tell me about him vincent knew hed have to stay focusedat least until they were alone at the abandoned building be careful the killer had said briefing him be coy pretend that you know something about me but you dont want to talk be hesitant thats how a real witness would be now he told hercoyly and hesitantlya few more things about the man running up the street and added to the vague description of gerald duncan though it was pretty much what the police knew anyway since they had that computer picture of him hed have to tell duncan about that she jotted some notes any unusual characteristics hmm dont remember any like i said i wasnt very close any weapons dont think so what exactly did he do there was an attempted assault oh no anybody hurt no fortunately or un thought clever vincenttony was he carrying anything agent dance asked keep it simple he reminded himself dont let her trip you up he frowned thoughtfully and hesitated then he said you know he mightve been carrying something i mean a bag i think i couldnt really see he was going pretty fast he stopped speaking kathryn cocked her head you were going to say something else im sorry im not more help i know its important thats okay the woman said reassuringly and for a moment vincent had a pang of guilt about what was going to happen to her in a few minutes then the hunger told him not to feel guilty it was normal to have the urge if we dont eat we die dont you agree agent dance they sipped coffee vincent told her a few other tidbits about the suspect she was chatting like a friend finally he decided the time was right he said look there is something else i was kind of scared before you know im around here every day what if he comes back he might figure out i said something about him we can keep it anonymous and well protect you i promise a clever hesitation really you bet well have a policeman guarding you now theres an interesting idea can i have the redhead he said to dance okay i saw where he ran to it was the back door of a building up the street he ran inside the door was unlocked or did he have a key unlocked i think ill show you if you want thatd be very helpful are you through she nodded at the cup he drained the coffee am now she flipped closed her notebook which hed have to remember to get from her after he was finished thanks agent dance youre very welcome as he wheeled the groceries outside the agent paid the check she joined him and they started up the sidewalk where he directed is it always this cold in new york in december a lot of times yep im freezing really you look plenty hot to me where are we going she asked slowing down and looking at the street signs she squinted against the glare she paused and jotted in her notebook reciting as she wrote the perp was recently in this location sherman street in greenwich village she looked around went up alley between sherman and barrow a glance at vincent what side of the streets the alley on north south i need to be accurate ah shes meticulous too he thought for a moment disoriented by the hunger more than the bitter cold thatd be southeast she looked at her notebook laughing can hardly read itthe shivering this cold is too much i cant wait to get back to california and youll be waiting a purty long time missy they resumed walking you have a family she asked yep a wife and two kids i have two children son and daughter vincent nodded wondering how old is the daughter so thiss the alley she asked yep theres where he ran to pulling the grocery cart behind him he started into the alley that would lead to their love nest the abandoned building he felt a painful erection vincent reached into his pocket and gripped the handle of his knife no he couldnt kill her but if she fought back hed have to protect himself slash the eyes itd be gross but her bloody face wouldnt be a problem for vincent he preferred them on their bellies anyway they were walking deeper into the passageway now vincent looked around and saw the building forty or fifty feet away dance paused again opened the notebook she recited what she wrote the alley runs behind six no seven residential buildings there are four dumpsters here the surface of the alley is asphalt the perpetrator ran this way going south gloves back on over her quivering fingers which ended in deliciously red nails the hunger was consuming vincent he felt himself withering away he gripped the knife in a tense hand breathing quickly she paused once more now take her he started to pull the knife from his pocket but the bark of a siren cut through the air coming from the other end of the alley he glanced at it in shock and then he felt the gun muzzle touch the back of his head agent dance was shouting raise your hands now gripping his shoulder but now she shoved the gun harder into his skull no no no he let go of the knife and lifted his arms what was going on the police car skidded to a stop in front of them another right behind it four huge cops jumped out nooh no on your face one of them ordered do it but he couldnt move he was so shocked then dance was stepping back as police officers surrounded him pulling him to the ground i didnt do anything i didnt you one of the men cried on your bellynow but its cold its dirty and i havent done anything they flung him to the hard ground he grunted as the breath was knocked from his body it was just like with sally anne all over again you fat boy dont fucking move pervert no no no hands were all over him grappling he felt the pain as his arms were pulled taut behind him and cuffs were ratcheted on he was searched pockets turned inside out got an id got a knife it was now it was thirteen years ago vincent could hardly tell i didnt do anything whats this all about one of the officers said to agent dance we heard you loud and clear you didnt need to go into the alley with him i was afraid hed bolt i wanted to stay with him as long as i could what was going on vincent wondered what did she mean agent dance glanced at the officer and nodded toward vincent he was doing a good job until we got into the diner once we sat down i knew he was faking no youre crazy i she turned to vincent your accent and expressions were inconsistent and your body language told me you werent really having a conversation with me at all you had another agenda trying to manipulate me for some reason which turned out to be getting me alone in the alley she explained that when shed paid the check shed slipped her phone out of her pocket and hit redial calling an nypd detective shed been working with shed whispered briefly what shed concluded and had him send officers to the area shed kept the phone line open hidden under her notebook thats why she was reciting the names of the streets out loud she was giving them directions vincent then looked at her hands she caught his eye and held up the pen shed been writing with yep thats my gun he looked back at the other cops i dont know whats going on here this is bullshit one of them said listen why dont you save your breath just before she called we got a report that the getaway driver in the attack earlier was back in the neighborhood with a cart of groceries he was a fat white guy her names sally anne fat boy she escaped and called the police and told us all about you thats not me i havent done anything youre wrong youre so wrong yeah one of the uniformed cops said with an amused expression we hear that a lot lets go they gripped him by the upper arms and hauled him roughly to the squad car he heard gerald duncans voice in his mind im sorry ive let you down ill make it up to you and something hardened within pudgy vincent reynolds he decided that nothing they could do to him would ever make him betray his friend the large pearshaped man sat next to the front window of lincoln rhymes laboratory hands cuffed behind him his drivers license and dmv records revealed that he wasnt tony parsons but vincent reynolds a twentyeightyearold wordprocessing operator who lived in new jersey and worked for a half dozen temp agencies none of which knew much about him other than what the basic employment checks and rãsumã verification had revealed he was a model if unmemorable employee with a mix of anger and uneasiness vincent alternated glances between the floor and the officers around himrhyme sachs dance baker and sellitto there were no priors or warrants out on him and a search of his shabby apartment in new jersey revealed no obvious connection to the watchmaker nor evidence of a lover close friends or parents the officers found a letter he was writing to his sister in detroit sellitto got her number from michigan state police and called he left a message for her to call them he was working monday night at the time of the pier and cedar street killings but hed taken time off since then mel cooper had emailed a digital picture of him to joanne harper at the florist shop the woman reported that he did resemble the man staring in her window but she couldnt be certain because of the glare the dirty glass in the front windows of her workshop and his sunglasses though they suspected him of being the watchmakers accomplice the evidence linking him to the scenes was sketchy the shoe print from the garage where the suv had been abandoned was the same size as his shoes thirteen but there were no distinguishing marks to make a clear match among the grocerieswhich rhyme suspected hed bought as a cover to get close to dance or another investigatorwere chips cookies and other junk food but these packages were unopened and a search of his clothes revealed no crumbs that might specifically match what had been recovered in the suv they were holding him only for possession of an illegal knife and interfering with a police operationthe usual charge when a phony witness comes forward still a good portion of city hall and police plaza wanted to pull an abu ghraib on vincent and browbeat or threaten him until he squealed this was dennis bakers preference the lieutenant had been getting pressure from city hall to find the perp but kathryn dance said doesnt work they curl up like rolly bugs and give you garbage she added for the record tortures very inefficient at getting accurate information and so rhyme and baker had asked her to handle vincents interview they needed to find the watchmaker as fast as possible and if rubber hoses were out they wanted an expert the california special agent now drew the curtains closed and sat down across from vincent nothing between them she scooted the chair forward until she was about three feet away rhyme supposed this was to get into his space and help break down his resistance but he also realized that if vincent flipped out he could lunge forward and injure her severely with his head or teeth she was undoubtedly aware of this too but gave no indication of feeling in danger she offered a reserved smile and said calmly hello vincent i know youve been informed of your rights and youve agreed to talk to us we appreciate that absolutely anything i can do this is a big he shruggedmisunderstanding you know then well get everything straightened out i just need some basic information first she asked his full name address age where he worked if hed ever been arrested he frowned i already told him this a look at sellitto im sorry left hand right hand you know if you wouldnt mind going over it again oh all right rhyme figured that since he was giving her verified facts shed be creating a baseline kinesic reading now that kathryn dance had altered the criminalists opinion about interviewing and witnesses he was intrigued by the process dance nodded pleasantly as she jotted down vincents responses and thanked him from time to time for his cooperation her politeness confused rhyme he himself would be a hell of a lot tougher vincent grimaced look i can you know talk to you for as long as you want but i hope you sent somebody to look for that man i saw you dont want him to get away im worried about that i try to help and look what happensthiss the story of my life though what hed told dance and the officers on the scene about the suspect wasnt helpful the building he claimed the killer disappeared into showed no signs that anyone had been inside recently now if you could go through the facts once more tell me what happened only if you wouldnt mind id like you to tell it to me in reverse order what reverse chronological order its a good way to jumpstart memories start with the last event first and go back in time from there the suspecthes going through the doorway of that old building in the alley lets begin with some specifics the color of the door vincent shifted in his chair frowned after a moment he gave his account starting with the man pushing through the doorway he couldnt remember the color vincent then explained what happened just before thatthe man running down the alley then entering it and before that he was running down the street finally vincent told them about spotting a man on barrow looking around uneasily then breaking into a run okay dance said jotting notes thank you vincent she gave a faint frown but why did you tell me your name was tony parsons because i was scared i did a good deed i told you what i saw but i was afraid the killer would murder me if he found out my name his jaw trembled i wished i hadnt said anything about what id seen but i did and got scared i told you i was afraid the mans whining irritated rhyme grill him he silently urged kathryn dance but she asked pleasantly tell me about the knife okay i shouldntve had it but i was mugged a few years ago it was terrible im so stupid i shouldve just left it at home i usually do that i just dont think and then it gets me in trouble then she slipped her jacket off and set it on the chair next to her he continued everybody else is smart enough not to get involved i say something and look what happens gazing at the floor disgust twitching at the corners of his mouth dance asked details of how he learned about the watchmakers killings and where he was at the times of the other attacks the questions were curious to rhyme superficial she wasnt probing the way he would have demanding alibis and pulling apart his story what seemed to be some good leads she let drop dance never once asked if there was another reason hed been leading her into the alley which they all suspected was to murder herperhaps even to torture her into telling what the police might know about the watchmaker the agent gave no reaction to his answers but merely jotted notes finally the agent looked behind vincent at sachs amelia could you do me a favor sure could you show vincent the footprint we found sachs rose and got the electrostatic image she held it up for vincent to look at what about it he asked thats your size shoe isnt it about she continued to stare at him saying nothing rhyme sensed she was setting up a brilliant trap he watched them both closely thanks dance said to sachs who sat down again the agent eased forward slightly more into the suspects personal space vincent im curious whered you get the groceries a brief hesitation well at the food emporium rhyme finally understood she was going to draw him out about the groceries and then ask him why hed bought them in manhattan if he lived in new jerseysince everything in the cart would be available closer to home and probably cheaper she leaned forward pulling off her glasses nowshe was going to snare him kathryn dance smiled and said thank you vincent i think thatll be it hey you thirsty the agent added want a soda vincent nodded yeah thanks dance glanced at rhyme could we get him something rhyme blinked and shot a perplexed look at sachs who was frowning what the hell was dance thinking she hadnt gotten a single bit of information out of him the criminalist was thinking a waste of time thats all shes going to ask him and now shes playing hostess reluctantly rhyme called thom who brought dance a coke dance put a straw in and held it up for the handcuffed man to drink from he drained the glass in seconds vincent just give us a few minutes alone if you dont mind and i think well get this all straightened out okay sure the patrol officers escorted him out dance shut the door behind him dennis baker shook his head staring unhappily at the agent sellitto muttered worthless dance frowned no no were doing fine we are rhyme asked right on tracknow heres the situation i got his baseline readings and then asked him about the reverse order of eventsits a good way to catch up deceptive subjects whove been improvising people can describe an actual series of past events in any orderfrom start to finish or backwardwithout a problem but people fabricate events in only one direction start to finish when they try to reconstruct it backward they dont have the cues that they used in creating the scenario and they trip up so i learned right up front that hes the watchmakers assistant you did sellitto laughed oh that was obvious his recognition responses were off the charts and hes not afraid for his personal safety like he claimed no he knows the watchmaker and hes been involved in the crimes but in a way that i cant figure out more than just a getaway driver but you didnt ask him about any of that baker pointed out shouldnt we be picking apart where he said he was at the times of the attacks at the florist shop and the apartment in greenwich village rhymes observation too oh no worst thing to do if i did those are the subjects hed stonewall on instantly she continued hes a complicated person theres a lot of conflict going on inside him and my feeling is that hes in the second state of stress response depression thats essentially anger turned inward and its very difficult to break through given his personality type id need to create a sympathetic bond between us and it would take days maybe weeks to get to the truth with traditional interrogation methods but we dont have days our only chance is to try something radical what dance nodded at the straw vincent had used can you order a dna test she asked rhyme yes but itll take some time thats okay as long as we can say truthfully its been ordered she smiled never lie but you dont have to tell a suspect everything rhyme wheeled around to the main portion of the lab where mel cooper and pulaski were still working on the evidence he explained what they needed and cooper packaged the straw in plastic and filled out a dna analysis request there technically its been ordered the lab just doesnt know it yet he laughed dance explained theres something big hes keeping from me hes very nervous about it his response to my question about being arrested was deceptive but its also very rehearsed i think he was collared but it was a while ago therere no prints on file so he fell through the cracksmaybe a lab screwup maybe he was a juvenile but i know hes run into the law before and i finally got a sense of what it might be thats why i took my jacket off and had amelia walk around in front of him hes eating up the two of us with his eyes trying not to but he cant help it that makes me think theres a sexual assault or two in his past i want to bluff and use that against him the problem is she continued that he could call me on it then we lose our bargaining power and itll take a long time to grind him down and get anything helpful sellitto said to rhyme i know where you come down on it hell yes rhyme thought take the chance sellitto asked and you dennis i oughta call downtown but wed be kicking ourselves if they say no go ahead and do it the agent said one other thing i need to do i have to take myself out of the equation whatever he had planned with me in the alley we have to let it go if i bring it up itll move the relationship to a different place and hes going to stop talking to me well have to start over again but you know what he was going to do to you sachs asked oh i know exactly what he had in mind but we have to stay focused on our goalfinding the watchmaker sometimes you just have to let other things slide sellitto looked at baker and nodded the agent walked to the closest computer and typed some commands then a user name and pass code she squinted when the website appeared and typed in some more commands a page of some suspects dna rolled onto the screen dance opened her purse and replaced the sheep glasses with the wolf ones now its time for the fun part she walked to the door and opened it asked that vincent be brought back the big man sweat stains under his arms lumbered back into the room and sat down in the chair which groaned under his weight he was cautious dance broke the silence with im afraid weve got a problem vincent his eyes narrowed dance held up the plastic evidence bag containing the straw hed drunk from you know about dna dont you whatre you talking about rhyme wondered is it going to work will he fall for it was vincent going to end the interview clam up and insist on an attorney he had every right to do that the bluff would end in disaster and they might never get any information from him until after the watchmaker had killed his next victim calmly dance asked you ever seen your dna analysis vincent dance turned the computer monitor toward vincent i dont know if youre aware of the fbis combined dna index system we call it codis whenever theres a rape or sexual assault and the perp isnt caught his fluids skin and hair are collected even with a condom theres usually some material left on or near the victim with dna in it the profile is stored and when police get a suspect his profile is matched against whats in the forensic index take a look beneath the heading codis were dozens of lines of numbers letters grids and fuzzy bars virtually incomprehensible to anyone unfamiliar with the system the man was completely still though his breathing was heavy his eyes to rhyme seemed defiant thiss bullshit you know vincent that nobody ever beats a case built on solid dna and weve gotten convictions years after the assaults you cant i didnt say it was okay to do that he stared at the bagged straw vincent kathryn dance said softly youre in trouble technically true rhyme reflected he was in possession of a deadly weapon never lie but youve got something we want a pause then dance continued i dont know about new york procedures but in california our district attorneys have a lot of latitude to work with cooperative suspects she looked at sellitto who took over yeah vincent same thing here the dall listen to our recommendations lost in the bars on the computer screen his teeth set vincent said nothing baker continued heres the deal if you help us get the watchmaker and if you confess to the prior sexual assaults well get you immunity on the murder and assault counts for the two victims the other day well make sure you have access to a treatment center and youll be isolated from the general population dance said firmly but you have to help us right now vincent what do you say the man glanced at the screen that contained a dna analysis that had nothing whatsoever to do with him his leg was bouncing slightlya sign that a debate was raging within him he turned his defiant eyes to kathryn dance yes or no what would it be a full minute passed rhyme heard only the ticking of the watchmakers clocks vincent grimaced he looked up at them with cold eyes hes a businessman from the midwest his names gerald duncan hes staying in a church in manhattan can i have another coke chapter where is he now dennis baker barked there was somebody else he was going to vincents voice faded kill the suspect nodded where i dont know exactly he said midtown i think he didnt tell me really they glanced at kathryn dance who apparently sensed no deception and nodded i dont know whether hes there now or the church he gave the address sachs said i know it closed a while ago sellitto called esu and had haumann put together some tactical teams he was going to meet me back in the village in an hour or so near that building in the alley where rhyme reflected vincent had been going to kill and rape kathryn dance sellitto ordered unmarked cars stationed near the building whos the next victim baker asked i dont know i really dont he didnt tell me anything about her because why dance asked i wasnt going to have anything to do with her do with her rhyme understood so you were helping him out and in exchange hed let you have the victims only the women vincent said quickly shaking his head in disgust not men im not weird or anything and only after they were dead so it wasnt really rape its not gerald told me that he looked it up dance and sellitto seemed unmoved by this but baker blinked sachs was trying to control her temper baker asked why werent you going to do anything with the next one becausehe was going to burn her to death jesus baker muttered is he armed rhyme asked vincent nodded hes got a gun a pistol a thirtytwo i dont know whats he driving sellitto asked its a dark blue buiek its stolen a couple years old license plates i dont know really he just stole it put out an evl rhyme ordered sellitto called it in dance leapt in with and what else she sensed something what do you mean what about the car upsets you he looked down i think he killed the owner i didnt know he was going to i really didnt where he didnt tell me cooper sent out a request for any reports of recent carjackings homicides or missing persons and vincent swallowed his leg was bouncing faintly again what baker asked he killed somebody else too this college student i think a kid in an alley around the corner from the church near tenth avenue why he saw us coming out of the church duncan stabbed him and put the body in a dumpster cooper phoned the local precinct house to check this out lets have him call duncan sellitto said nodding at vincent we could trace his mobile his phone wont work he takes the battery and sim chip out when were not actuallyyou know working working he said you cant trace it that way is the phone in his name no its one of those prepaid ones he buys a new one every few days and throws out the old one get the number rhyme ordered run it with the service providers mel cooper called the major mobile companies in the area and had several brief conversations he hung up and reported east coast communications prepaid like he said cash purchase no way to trace it if the batterys out hell rhyme muttered sellittos phone rang bo haumanns emergency service unit teams were on their way theyd be at the church in a few minutes sounds like thats our only hope baker said he sachs and pulaski hurried out the door to join the tactical operation rhyme dance and sellitto remained in his lab to try to learn more about gerald duncan from vincent while cooper searched databases for any information on him whats his interest in clocks and time and the lunar calendar rhyme asked he collects old clocks and watches he really was a watchmakera hobby you know its not like he has a shop or anything rhyme said but he mightve worked for one at some point find out the professional organization of watchmakers collectors too cooper typed on his keyboard he asked america only dance asked vincent whats his nationality hes american i guess he doesnt have an accent or anything after browsing a number of websites cooper shook his head its a popular business the big groups seem to be the geneva association of watchmakers jewelers and goldsmiths the association interprofessionnelle de la haute horlogerie in switzerland the american watchmakers institute the swiss association of watch and jewelry retailers also in switzerland the british association of watch and clock collectors the british horological institute the employers association of the swiss watch industry and the federation of the swiss watch industriesbut therere dozens more send them emails sellitto said ask about duncan as a watchmaker or collector and interpol rhyme said then to vincent how did you meet the man gave a rambling account about a coincidental innocent meeting kathryn dance listened and in her calm voice asked a few questions and announced that he was being deceptive the deal is you play straight with us she said leaning forward her gaze was cool through her predator glasses okay i was just like summarizing you know we dont want summaries rhyme growled we want to know how the fuck you met him the rapist admitted while it was a coincidence the meeting wasnt so innocent he gave the details of their initial contact at a restaurant near where vincent worked duncan was checking out one of the men whod been killed the previous day and vincent had his eye on a waitress what a pair these two rhyme reflected mel cooper looked up from the computer screen getting some hits hereweve got sixtyeight gerald duncans in fifteen midwestern states im running warrants and vicap first then crossreferencing approximate ages and professions you cant narrow down the location any more i would if i could he never talked about himself dance nodded she believed him lon sellitto asked the question that rhyme had been about to we know hes targeting specific victims checking em out ahead of time why whats he up to the rapist answered his wife hes married was tell us his wife and him came to new york on vacation a couple years ago he was at a business dinner somewhere and his wife went to a concert by herself she was walking back to the hotel on this deserted street and she got hit by a car or truck the driver took off she screamed for help but nobody came to save her nobody even called the police or fire department the doctor said that she probably lived for ten fifteen minutes after she was hit and even somebody who wasnt a doctor couldve stopped the bleeding he said just a pressure point or something like that but nobody helped run all the hospitals for admissions under the name duncan eighteen to thirtysix months ago rhyme ordered but vincent said dont bother last year he broke into the hospital and stole her chart the police report too bribed a clerk or something hes been planning this ever since but whys he picking these victims when the police investigated they got the names of ten people who were nearby when she died whether they could have saved her or not i dont know but gerald he convinced himself they could have hes spent the past year finding out where they live and what their schedules are he needed to get them alone so they could die slowly thats the important thing to him like his wife died slowly the man on the pier tuesday is he dead hes gotta be duncan made him hold on and then cut his arms and just stood there watching him until he fell into the river he said he tried to swim for a while but then he just stopped moving and floated under the pier what was his name i dont remember walter somebody i didnt help him with the first two i didnt really he glanced at dance with fear in his eyes what else do you know about duncan she asked thats about it the only thing he really liked to talk about was time time what about it anything everything the history of time how clocks work about calendars how people sense time differently hed tell me like the term speed up comes from pendulum clocks youd move the weight up on the pendulum to make the clock run faster slow downyou moved the weight down to slow it with anybody else it wouldve been just boring but the way he talked about it well you kind of got caught up in what he was saying cooper looked up from his computer screen weve got a couple of replies from the watchmaker associations no record of a gerald duncanwait heres interpolnothing there either and i cant find anything in vicap sellittos phone rang he took the call and spoke for a few minutes he eyed the rapist coolly as he talked then he disconnected that was your sisters husband he said to vincent the man frowned who your sisters husband vincent shook his head no you mustve talked to the wrong person my sisters not married yes she is the rapists eyes were wide sally annes married with a disgusted glance at vincent sellitto said to rhyme and dance she was too upset to return the call herself her husband did thirteen years ago he locked her in the basement of their house for a week while their mother and stepfather were on their honeymoon his own sister he tied her down and sexually assaulted her repeatedly he was fifteen she was thirteen he did juvie time and was released after counseling records were sealed thats why we had no hits on iafis married vincent whispered ashenfaced shes been treated for depression and eating disorders ever since he was caught stalking her a dozen times so she got a restraining order the only contact between them in the past three years is letters hes been sending hes been threatening her dance asked sellitto muttered nope theyre love letters he wanted her to move here and live with him oh man muttered the unflappable mel cooper sometimes hed write recipes in the margins sometimes hed draw porn cartoons the brotherinlaw said if theres anything they can do to make sure he stays in jail forever theyll do it sellitto looked at the two patrol officers standing behind vincent get him out of here the officers helped the big man to his feet and they started out the door vincent reynolds could hardly walk he was so shaken how could sally anne get married how could she do this to me we were going to be together forever how could she chapter like assaulting a medieval castle sachs baker and pulaski joined bo haumann around the corner from the church in the nondescript chelsea section of town the esu troops had deployed quietly up and down the streets surrounding the place keeping a low profile the church had only enough doors to satisfy the fire code and steel bars on most of the windows this would make it difficult for gerald duncan to escape of course but it also meant that esu had few options for access that in turn increased the likelihood that the killer had boobytrapped the entrances or would wait for them with a weapon and the stone walls two feet thick also made the risk greater than it might otherwise have been because the search and surveillance teams thermaland soundsensing equipment was largely useless they simply couldnt tell if he was inside whats the plan asked amelia sachs standing next to bo haumann in the alley behind the church dennis baker was beside her his hand close to his pistol his eyes danced around the streets and sidewalk which told sachs that he hadnt been on a tactical entry for a long timeif ever she was still pissed about the spying she wasnt very sympathetic that he was sweating ron pulaski was nearby his hand resting on the grip of his glock he too rocked nervously on his feet as he gazed at the imposing sooty structure haumann explained that the teams would do a simple dynamic entry through all doors after taking them out with explosive charges there was no choicethe doors were too thick for a battering rambut charges would clearly announce their presence and give duncan a chance to prepare at least some defense within the building what would he do when he heard the explosions and the footsteps of the cops charging inside give up a lot of perps do but some dont they either panic or cling to some crazy idea that they can fight their way though a dozen armed officers rhyme had told her about duncans mission of revenge she didnt figure somebody that obsessed would be the surrendering type sachs took her position with a sidedoor entry team while baker and pulaski remained at the command post with haumann through her headset she heard the esu commander say entry devices are armed teams report k the a b and c teams called in that they were ready in his raspy voice haumann called on my countfive four three two one three sharp cracks resounded as the doors blew open simultaneously setting off car alarms and shaking nearby windows officers poured inside it turned out that their concern about fortified positions and booby traps had been unfounded the bad news though was that a search of the place made it clear that the watchmaker was either one of the luckiest men on earth or had anticipated them yet again he wasnt here check this out ron amelia sachs stood in a doorway of a small upstairs storeroom in the church freaky the young officer offered that worked they were looking at a number of moonfaced clocks stacked against a stone wall the faces stared out with their cryptic look not quite a smile not quite a leer as if they knew exactly how much time was allotted for your life and were pleased to be counting down to the final second all of them were ticking a sound that sachs found unnerving she counted five of them which meant he had one with him burn her to death pulaski was zipping up his tyvek crime scene suit and strapping his glock outside the overalls sachs told him that shed walk the grid up here where vincent had said the men had been staying the rookie would take the ground floor of the church he nodded looking uneasily at the dark corridors the shadows the blow to his skull the previous year had been severe and a supervisor had wanted to sideline him put him behind a desk hed struggled to come back from the head injury and simply would not let the brass take him off the street she knew he got spooked sometimes she could see in his eyes that he was constantly making the decision whether or not to step up to the task in front of him even though he always chose to do so there were some cops she knew who wouldnt want to work with him because of this sachs though would far rather work with somebody who confronted his ghosts every time he went out on the street that was guts shed never hesitate to have him as a partner then she realized what shed thought and qualified it if i were going to stay on the force pulaski wiped his palms which sachs could see were sweaty despite the chill and pulled on latex gloves as they divided up the evidence collection equipment she said hey heard you got jumped in the garage running the explorer scene yeah hate it when that happens he gave a laugh that meant he understood this was her way of saying its okay to be nervous he started for the door hey ron he stopped by the way rhyme said you did a great job he did not in so many words but that was rhyme sachs said he sure did now go search the shit out of that scene i want to nail this bastard he gave a grin you bet sachs said its not a christmas present its a job and nodded him downstairs she found nothing that suggested who the next victim was but at least there was a significant amount of evidence in the church from vincent reynoldss room sachs recovered samples of a dozen different junk foods and sodas as well as proof of his darker appetites condoms duct tape and rags presumably to use as gags the place was a mess it smelled of unwashed clothes in duncans room sachs found horological magazines without subscription labels watchmakers and other tools including the wire cutters that were probably used to cut the chain link fence at the first scene and clothes unlike vincents this room was eerily pristine and ordered the bed was so tautly made that a drill instructor would have approved the clothes hung perfectly in the closet all the labels removed she noticed the space between the hangers exactly the same items on the desk were aligned at exact angles to one another he was careful to leave next to nothing about himself personally two museum programs from boston and tampa were hidden up under a trash container but while they suggested hed been to those cities they werent of course where vincent said he lived the midwest there was also a pet hair roller its like hes wearing a tyvek suit of his own she also found some clues that were possibly from the prior crime scenesa roll of duct tape that would probably match the tape at the alley and that presumably was used to gag the victim on the pier she found an old broom with dirt fine sand and bits of salt on it she guessed it was what hed used to sweep the scene around where teddy adams had been killed there was also evidence that she hoped might reveal his present location or that related in some way to the next victims in a small plastic tupperware container were some coins three bic pens receipts from a parking garage downtown and a drugstore on the upper west side and a book of matches missing three of them from a restaurant on the upper east side there were no fingerprints on any of these items she also found a pair of shoes whose treads were dotted with gaudy green paint and an empty gallon jug that had contained wood alcohol there were no fingerprints but she did find plenty of cotton fibers the same color of those in the explorer she then found a plastic bag containing a dozen pairs of the gloves themselves no store labels or receipts the bag had no prints on it in his search downstairs ron pulaski didnt find much but he made a curious discovery a coating of white powder in a toilet tests would tell for certain but he believed it was from a fire extinguisher since he also found a trash bag near the back door inside of which was the empty carton an extinguisher had been sold in the rookie had looked over the box carefully but there were no store labels to indicate where it had been purchased why the extinguisher had been discharged was unclear there was no evidence that anything in the bathroom had been burning she had a call patched through to vincent reynolds in the lockup and he told her that duncan had recently bought a fire extinguisher he didnt know why it had been discharged after chainofcustody cards were filled out sachs and pulaski joined baker haumann and the others just inside the front door of the church where theyd been waiting while the two officers walked the grid sachs called rhyme on the radio and told him and sellitto what theyd found as she recited the evidence she could hear rhyme instructing thom to include it on the charts boston and tampa the criminalist asked referring to the museum programs vincent might be wrong hold on he had cooper check with vital statistics and dmv for any gerald duncans in those cities but while there were residents with that name their ages didnt match the perps the criminalist was silent for a moment then he said the fire extinguisherim betting he made an incendiary device out of it he used alcohol as the accelerant there was some on the clock at lucy richters apartment too thats how hes going to burn the next victim to death and whats the one thing about fire extinguishers give up sachs replied theyre invisible one could be sitting right next to somebody and theyd never think twice about it baker said i say we take whatever clues weve found here and divide them up hope one of them leads us to the next victim weve got receipts those matches the shoes rhymes voice crackled over the radio whatever you do make it fast according to vincent if hes not at the church hes on his way to the next victim he might already be there by now the

stanton walked quickly over the frozen sidewalk back to the midtown office building where she worked clutching her starbucks latte and a chocolate chip cookiea guilty pleasure but a reward for what would be a long day at the office not that she needed a tasty incentive to get back to her workstation she loved her job sarah was an estimator for a large flooring and interior design company the mother of an eightyearold shed gone back to work a few years earlier than planned thanks to a tough divorce shed started as a receptionist and moved her way up quickly to become the head estimator for the company the work was demanding a lot of numbersbut the company was good and she liked the people she worked with well most of them and she had flexibility with her hours since she was in the field a lot meeting with clients this was important because she had to get her son dressed and ready for school then escort him all the way to ninetyfifth street by am and then head back to midtown for her job the timetable subject always to the whims of the metropolitan transit authority today she would work more than ten hours tomorrow she was taking off entirely to go christmas shopping with her boy sarah swiped her entry card and pushed through the back door of the building then performed her afternoon workout routinewalking up the stairs to her office rather than use the elevator the company took up all of the third floor but her workstation was in a smaller office which occupied only a portion of the second floor this office was quiet housing only four employees but sarah preferred that the bosses rarely came down here and she could get her work done without interruption she climbed to the landing and paused she reached for the door handle thinking as she nearly always did why did these doors open without any kind of lock from the stairwell side itd be pretty easy for somebody she jumped hearing a faint tap of metal spinning around sarah saw no one andwas that the sound of breathing was somebody hurt should she go see or call security is anyone there hello only silence probably nothing she thought and stepped into the corridor that led to the back door of her office sarah unlocked the door and walked down the long corridor of the company shedding her coat and setting the coffee and cookie on her desk she sat down at her workstation glancing at her computer odd she thought on the screen was the window that read date and time properties this was the utility in the windows xp operating system that you used to set the date and time and time zone of your computer it showed a calendar with the days date indicated and to the right both an analog clock with sweep hands and below it a digital clock both ticking off the seconds the screen hadnt been there before shed made the run to starbucks had it popped up by itself she wondered why maybe somebodyd used her computer while she was away though she had no idea who it might be or why no matter she closed the window on the screen and scooted forward she glanced down what was that sarah saw a fire extinguisher under her desk it hadnt been there earlier either the company was always doing weird things like this putting in new lighting coming up with evacuation plans rearranging furniture for no apparent reason now fire extinguishers probably something else we have the terrorists to thank for taking a fast look at her sons picture feeling comfort in seeing his smile she set her purse under her desk and unwrapped her cookie lieutenant dennis baker walked slowly down the deserted street he was south of hells kitchen in a largely industrial area on the west side as hed suggested the officers had divided up the clues found at the church in their hunt for the watchmaker hed told sachs and haumann that hed remembered a warehouse that was being painted with that same shade of sickly green paint found on the shoes in the watchmakers room while the rest of the team were tracking down other leads hed come here the massive building stretched along the street dark abandoned bleak even in the sharp sunlight the lower six or seven feet of the grimy brick walls were covered with graffiti and half the windows were brokensome even shot out it seemed on the roof was a faded sign preston moving and storage in an oldstyle typeface the front doors painted that green color were locked and chained shut but baker found a side entrance half hidden behind a dumpster it was open he looked up and down the street then pulled the door open and stepped inside baker started through the dim place lit only by slanting shafts of light the smell was of rotting cardboard and mildew and heating oil he drew his pistol it felt awkward in his hand hed never fired a single shot in the line of duty walking silently along the corridor baker approached the facilitys main storage area a massive open space whose floor was dotted with pools of greasy standing water and trash plenty of condoms too he noticed in disgust this was probably the least romantic site for a liaison you could imagine a flash of light from the offices lining the wall caught his attention his eyes were growing accustomed to the dimness and as he walked closer he noticed a burning desk lamp inside a small room there was one other thing he could see as well one of the black moonfaced clocksthe watchmakers calling cards baker started forward which is when he stepped on a large patch of grease he hadnt been able to see in the darkness and went down hard on his side gasping he dropped his pistol which slid away across the filthy concrete floor he winced in pain it was at this moment that a man jogged up fast behind him from one of the side corridors baker glanced up into the eyes of gerald duncan the watchmaker the killer bent down and he offered his hand helping baker up you all right just got the wind knocked out of me careless thanks gerry duncan stepped away retrieved bakers pistol and handed it to him you didnt really need that he laughed baker put the gun back in his holster wasnt sure who else i might run into other than you spooky place the watchmaker gestured toward the office come on inside ill tell you exactly whats going to happen to her what was going to happen meant how the men were going to commit murder and the her he was referring to was an nypd detective named amelia sachs chapter sitting on one of the chairs in the warehouse office dennis baker brushed at his slacks now stained from the fall italian expensive shit he said to duncan weve got vincent reynolds in custody and we took the church duncan would know this of course since he himself had made the call alerting the police that the watchmakers partner was wheeling a grocery cart around the west village baker had been surprised and impressed that kathryn dance had tipped to vincent even before duncan dimed out his supposed partner and duncan had known too that the rapist would give up the church under pressure took a little longer than i thought said baker but he caved of course he did duncan said hes a worm duncan had planned the sick fucks capture all long it was necessary to feed the cops the information to make them believe that the watchmaker was a vengeful psychopath not the hired murderer he actually was and vincent was key to pointing the police in the right direction for the completion of duncans plan and that plan was as elaborate and elegant as the finest timepiece its purpose was to halt amelia sachss investigation threatening to unearth an extortion ring that baker had been running from the th precinct dennis baker came from a family of law enforcers his father had been a transit cop who retired early after he took a spill down a subway station stairwell an older brother worked for the department of corrections and bakers uncle was a cop in a small town in suffolk county where the family was from initially hed had no interest in the professionthe handsome wellbuilt young man wanted big bucks but after losing every penny in a failed recycling business baker decided to join up he moved from long island to new york city and tried to reinvent himself as a policeman but coming to the job later in lifeand the cocky tvcop style he adoptedworked against him alienating brass and fellow officers even his family history in law enforcement didnt help his relatives fell low in the blue hierarchy baker could make a living as a cop but he wasnt destined for a corner office in the big building so he decided to go for the bucks after all but not via business hed use his badge when he first started shaking down businessmen he wondered if hed feel guilty about it uhuh not a bit the only problem was that to support his lifestylewhich included a taste for wine food and beautiful womenhe needed more than just a thousand or so a week from korean wholesalers and fat men who owned pizza parlors in queens so baker a former partner and some cops from the th came up with a plan for a lucrative extortion ring bakers cohorts would steal a small amount of drugs from the evidence lockers or would score some coke or smack on the street theyd target the children of rich businessmen in manhattan clubs and plant the drugs on them baker would talk to the parents whod be told that for a sixfigure payment the arrest reports would disappear if they didnt pay the kidsd go to jail hed also occasionally plant drugs on businessmen themselves rather than just taking the money though theyd arrange for the victims to lose it in sham business deals like with frank sarkowski or in fake poker games in vegas or atlantic citythe approach they took with ben creeley this would provide the marks with a reasonable explanation as to why they were suddenly two or three hundred thousand dollars poorer but then dennis baker made a mistake he got lazy it wasnt easy finding the right marks for the scam and he decided to go back to some of the earlier targets for a second installment of extortion money some paid the second time but two of themsarkowski and creeleywere businessmen with pretty tough hides and while they were willing to pay once to get baker out of their hair they drew the line at a second payment one threatened to go to the police and one to the press in early november baker and a cop from the th had kidnapped sarkowski and driven him to an industrial section of queens near where a client of his company had a factory hed been shot the crime staged to look like a mugging several weeks later baker and the same cop had broken into creeleys highrise strung a rope around the businessmans neck and tossed him off the balcony theyd stolen or destroyed the mens personal files books and diariesanything that mightve led back to baker and his scam as for the police reports there was virtually nothing in creeleys that was incriminating but the sarkowski file contained references to evidence that a sharp investigator might draw some troubling conclusions from so one of the people involved in the plan had engineered its disappearance baker thought the deaths would go unnoticed and they continued with their scamuntil a young policewoman showed up detective thirdgrade amelia sachs didnt believe that benjamin creeley had committed suicide and started looking into the death there was no stopping the woman they had no choice but to kill her with sachs dead or incapacitated baker doubted that anyone else would follow up on the cases as fervently as she was the problem of course was that if she wereto die lincoln rhyme would deduce immediately that her death was related to the st james investigation and then nothingwould stop him and sellitto from pursuing the killers so baker needed sachs to die for a reason unrelated to the th precinct crimes baker put some feelers out to a few organized crime wise guys he knew and soon he heard from gerald duncan a professional killer who could manipulate crime scenes and set up fake motives to steer suspicion completely away from the man or woman hiring him to kill motive is the one sure way to get yourself caught duncan had explained eliminate the motive you eliminate suspicion theyd agreed on a pricebrother the man wasnt cheapand duncan had gone to work planning the job duncan tracked down some loser he could use to feed information about the watchmaker to the police vincent reynolds turned out to be a perfect patsy soaking up the story duncan fed himabout going psycho because of a dead wife and killing apathetic citizens then the previous day duncan had put the plan into operation the watchmaker killed the first two of the victims picked at randomsome guy hed kidnapped from west street in the village and murdered on the pier and the one in the alley a few hours later baker had made sure sachs was assigned to the case there were two more attempted murders by the killerthe fact they didnt succeed was irrelevant the watchmaker was still one spooky doer who needed to be stopped fast then duncan made his next moves sending vincent to attack kathryn dance so that the police would believe that the watchmaker was willing to kill police officers and setting up vincent to be captured and dime the watchmaker out to the police it was now time for the final step the watchmaker would kill yet another cop amelia sachs her death entirely the work of a vengeful killer unrelated to the th precinct investigation duncan now asked she found out you were spying on her baker nodded you called that right shes one smart bitch but i did what you suggested duncan anticipated that shed be suspicious of everyone except people she knew personally hed explained that when people suspect you you have to give them anotherharmlessreason for your behavior you simply confess to the lesser crime act contrite and theyre satisfied youre off the suspect list at duncans suggestion baker asked some officers about sachs he heard rumors that shed been involved with a crooked cop and hed ginned up an email from someone in the big building and used that as a reason to be spying on her she wasnt happy but she didnt suspect him of anything worse heres the plan duncan now explained showing him a diagram of an office building in midtown thiss where the last victim works her names sarah stanton shes got a cubicle on the second floor i picked the place because of the layout itll be perfect i couldnt put one of the clocks there because the police announced the killer was using thembut i pulled up the time and date window on her computer good touch duncan smiled i thought so the killers voice was soft his words precise but the tone was filled with the modest pleasure of an artisan showing off a finished piece of furniture or a musical instrumentor a watch baker reflected duncan explained that hed dressed like a workman waited until sarah went out then planted a fire extinguisher filled with flammable alcohol in a few minutes baker was to call rhyme or sellitto and report that hed found evidence of where the extinguisher bomb was planted the esu and bomb squad would then speed to the office amelia sachs too i set the device up so that if she moves the extinguisher a certain way itll spray her with alcohol and ignite alcohol burns really fast itll kill or injure her but wont set fire to the whole office the police he continued might even disarm the device and save the woman it wouldnt matter all that duncan cared about was getting amelia sachs into the office to search the scene sarahs cubicle was at the end of a narrow corridor sachs would be searching it alone as she always did when she turned her back baker waiting nearby would shoot her and anybody else present the weapon hed use was duncans automatic loaded with bullets from the same box hed intentionally left in the suv for the police to find after shooting sachs baker would break a nearby window which was fifteen feet above an alleyway hed throw the gun out making it seem as if the watchmaker had leapt out the window and escaped dropping the gun the unusual murder weapon linked to the rounds found in the explorer would leave no doubt that the watchmaker was the killer sachs would be dead and the investigation into the corruption at the th precinct would grind to a halt duncan said let some other officers get to her body first but itd be a nice touch if you pushed them aside and tried to resuscitate her baker said you think of everything dont you whats so miraculous about timepieces duncan said gazing at the moonfaced clock is that none of them ever has more or fewer parts than is needed to do what the watchmaker intends nothing missing but nothing superfluous he added in a soft voice its pure perfection wouldnt you say amelia sachs and ron pulaski were slogging through the cold streets of lower manhattan and she was reflecting that sometimes the biggest hurdles in a case werent from the perps but from bystanders witnesses and victims they were following up on one of the clues that had been uncovered in the church receipts from a parking garage not far from the pier where the first victim had died but the attendant was unhelpful lady no he no familiar nobody look like him i remember ahmedmaybe he saw him oh but he not here today no i dont know his phone number and so it went frustrated sachs nodded toward a restaurant adjacent to the parking garage she said maybe he stopped in there lets give it a try just then her radio crackled she recognized sellittos voice amelia you copy she grabbed pulaskis arm and turned up the volume so they both could hear go ahead k where are you downtown the parking garage didnt pan out were going to canvass a couple of restaurants forget it get up to three two street and seven avenue fast dennis bakers found a lead looks like the next vics in an office building there who is she were not sure exactly well probably have to sweep the whole place weve got arson and the bomb squad on the wayshes the one hes going to burn to death man i hope were in time anyway get up there now well be there in fifteen minutes the fire department was sending two dozen men and women into the twentysevenstory midtown building and bo haumann was assembling five esu entry teamsexpanded ones six cops each rather than the typical fourto do a floorbyfloor search sachss drive here had taken closer to a half hour thanks to holiday traffic not a huge delay but the extra fifteen minutes made a big difference shed missed a spot on an entry team amelia sachs was officially a crime scene detective but her heart was also with tactical teams the ones who went through the perps doors first if they found the watchmaker here it wouldve been her last chance for a takedown before she quit the force she supposed shed see some excitement in her new job as security specialist at argyle but the local law enforcers would surely get most of the tactical fun sachs and pulaski now ran from the car to the command post at the back door of the office building any sign of him she asked haumann the grizzled man shook his head not yet we had a sequence on a video camera in the lobby of somebody kind of looked like the composite carrying a bag but we dont know if he left or not therere two back and two side door exits that arent alarmed and arent scanned by cameras you evacuating a mans voice asked sachs turned around it was detective dennis baker just started haumann explained howd you find him sachs asked baker said that warehouse with the green painthe used it as a staging area i found some notes and a map of this building the policewoman was still angry about bakers spying on her but solid police work deserves credit and she nodded to him and said good job nothing inspired he replied with a smile just pounding the pavement and a little bit of luck bakers eyes rose to the building as he pulled his gloves on chapter sitting in her cubicle sarah stanton heard another squawk over the buildings public address system above her head it was a running joke in the office that the company put some kind of filter on the speakers that made the transmissions completely unintelligible she turned back to her computer calling whatre they saying i cant make heads or tails of it some announcement one of her coworkers called duh they keep doingthat pisses me off is it a fire drill no idea a moment later she heard the whoop of the fire alarm guess it is after the alarm had gone off every month or so the first couple times shed played along and trooped downstairs like everybody else but today the temperature was in the low twenties and she had way too much work to do besides if it really was a fire and the exits were blocked she could just jump out the window her office was only on the second floor she returned to her screen but then sarah heard voices at the far end of the corridor that led to her cubicle there was an urgency about the sound and something elsethe jangling of metal firemens equipment she wondered maybe something really was happening heavy footsteps behind her approaching she turned around and saw policemen in dark outfits with guns police oh god was it a terrorist attack all she thought about was getting to her sons school picking him up were evacuating the building the cop announced is it terrorists somebody called has there been another attack no he didnt explain further everybody move out in an orderly fashion take your coats leave everything else sarah relaxed she wouldnt have to worry about her son another of the officers called were looking for fire extinguishers are there any in this area dont touch them just let us know i repeat do not touch them so there is a fire she thought pulling on her coat then she reflected that it was curious that the fire department would use the companys extinguishers on a fire didnt they have their own and why should they be so concerned that wed use one not like you need special training i repeat do not touch them the policeman looked into an office near sarahs workstation oh officer you want an extinguisher she asked ive got one right here and she pulled the heavy red cylinder off the floor no cried the man and he leaped toward her sachs winced as the transmission crackled loudly through her earpiece fire and containment team second floor southeast corner office k lanam flooring and interiors now move move move a dozen firefighters and officers from the bomb squad shouldered their equipment and sprinted fast toward the rear door status haumann shouted into his microphone all they could hear were harried voices over the raw howl of the fire alarm do you have detonation the head of esu repeated urgently i dont see smoke pulaski said dennis baker stared up at the second floor he shook his head if its alcohol one of the fire chiefs said there wont be smoke until the secondary materials ignite he added evenly or her hair and skin sachs continued to scan the windows clenching her fists was the woman dying in agony now with police officers or firemen alongside her come on baker whispered then a voice clattered through the radio weve got the device weveyeah weve got it it didnt detonate sachs closed her eyes thank god baker said people were streaming out of the office building now under the gaze of esu and patrol officers who were looking for duncan comparing the composite pictures with the faces of the workers an officer led a woman up to sachs baker and pulaski just as sellitto joined them the potential victim sarah stanton explained that shed found a fire extinguisher under her desk it hadnt been there earlier and she hadnt seen whod left it somebody in the office remembered seeing a workman in a uniform nearby but couldnt remember details and didnt recognize the composite or recall where hed gone status of the device haumann called an officer radioed didnt see a timer but the pressure gauge on the top was blank that could be the detonator and i can smell alcohol bomb squads got it in a containment vessel theyre taking it up to rodmans neck were still sweeping for the perp any sign of him baker asked negative therere two fire stairwells and the elevators he couldve gotten out that way and weve got four or five other companies on that floor he mightve gotten into one of them well search em in a minute or two as soon as we get an allclear for devices ten minutes later officers reported that there were no other bombs in the building sachs interviewed sarah then called rhyme and told him the status of the case so far the woman didnt know the other victims and had never heard of gerald duncan she was very upset that the mans wife mightve been killed outside her apartment though she remembered nothing of any fatal accidents in the area finally haumann told them that all of his officers had finished the sweep the watchmaker had escaped hell dennis baker muttered we were so close discouraged rhyme said well walk the grid and tell me what you find they signed off haumann sent two teams to stake out the warehouse that duncan had used as a staging site in case the killer returned there and sachs dressed in the white tyvek bodysuit and grabbed a metal suitcase containing basic evidence collection and preservation equipment ill help pulaski said also dressing in the white overalls she handed him the suitcase and she picked up another one on the second floor she paused and surveyed the hallway after photographing it sachs entered lanam flooring and proceeded to sarah stantons workstation she and pulaski set up the suitcases and extracted the basic evidence collection equipment bags tubes swabs adhesive rollers for trace electrostatic footprint sheets and latentprint chemicals and equipment what can i do pulaski asked you want me to search the stairwells she debated theyd have to be searched eventually but she decided that it would be better to run them herself they were the most logical entry and exit routes for the watchmaker and she wanted to make certain that no evidence was missed sachs surveyed the layout of sarahs cubicle and then noticed an empty workstation next to it it was possible that the watchmaker had waited there until he had a chance to plant the bomb sachs told the rookie run that cubicle you got it he stepped into the cubicle pulled out his flashlight and began walking a perfect grid she caught him sniffing the air too another of lincoln rhymes dictates for crime scene officers searching this boy was going to go places she reflected sachs stepped into the cubicle where theyd found the device she heard a noise and glanced back it was only dennis baker he came up the corridor and stopped about twenty feet from the cubicles far enough away so there was no risk of contaminating the scene she wasnt sure exactly why he was here but since they still werent sure where the watchmaker was she was grateful for his presence search well but watch your back this was the difference detective dennis bakeralong with a cop from the thhad murdered benjamin creeley and frank sarkowski it had been tough but theyd done it without hesitation and he was prepared to kill any other civilians who threatened their extortion scheme no problem at all five million dollars in cashtheir haul to dateburies a lot of guilt but baker had never killed a fellow cop frowning fidgeting he was watching amelia sachs and the kid pulaski who also presented an easy target a big difference this was killing family members fellow officers but the sad truth was that sachs and by association pulaski could destroy his life and so there was no debate he now studied the scene yes duncan had it planned perfectly there was the window he glanced out the alley fifteen feet below was deserted and next to him was the gray metal chair the killer had told him about the one hed pitch through the window after killing the officers there was the large airconditioning intake vent whose grate hed remove after the shots to make it appear that the watchmaker had been hiding inside a deep breath okay its time he had to act fast before anyone else came onto the scene amelia sachs had sent the other officers into the main hallway but someone could return here at any minute he took the and quietly pulled back the slide to make certain a bullet was in the chamber holding the gun behind his back he eased closer he was staring at sachs who moved around the crime scene almost like a dancer precise fluid lost in concentration as she searched it was beautiful to watch baker tore himself out of this reverie who first he debated pulaski was ten feet from him sachs twenty both facing away logically pulaski should be the first one being closer but baker had learned from lincoln rhyme about sachss skill as a marksman she could draw and fire in seconds the kid had probably never even fired his weapon in combat he might get his hand on his pistol after baker killed sachs but the rookie would die before he could draw a few breaths amelia sachs unwittingly cooperated she stood up from where shed been crouching her back presented a perfect target baker pointed his gun high on her spine and squeezed the trigger chapter to most people the sound would be a simple metallic click lost in the dozen other ambient noises of a bigcity office building to amelia sachs though it was clearly the springactivated firing pin of an automatic weapon striking the primer cap of a malfunctioning bullet or someone dryfiring a gun shed heard the distinctive sound a hundred timesfrom her own pistols and her fellow officers this click was followed with what usually came nextthe shooter working the slide to eject the bad round and chamber the next one in the clip in many caseslike nowthe maneuver was particularly frantic the shooter needed to clear the weapon instantly and get a new bullet ready fast it could be a matter of life and death this all registered in a fraction of a second sachs dropped the roller she was using to collect trace her right hand slammed to her hipshe always knew the exact place where her holster restedand an instant later she spun around hunched in a combat shooting position her glock in her hand facing where the sound had come from she saw in her periphery to her right ron pulaski standing up in the next office looking at her weapon alarmed wondering what she was doing twenty feet away was dennis baker his eyes wide in his gloved hand was a tiny pistol a she thought pointed her way as he worked the slide she noted that it was an autauga mkii the type of gun that rhyme speculated the watchmaker might have baker blinked couldnt speak for a moment i heard something he said quickly i thought hed come back the watchmaker you pulled the trigger no i was just chambering a round she glanced at the floor where the bum shell lay the only reason for it to be there was if hed tried to shoot then ejected the defective bullet taking the tiny in his left hand baker lowered his right it strayed to his side we have to be careful i think hes back sachs centered the sights directly on bakers chest dont do it dennis she said nodding toward his hip where his regulation pistol rested i willfire im assuming youve got armor under your suit my first slugll be on your chest but two and threell go higher it wont be nice iyou dont understand his eyes were wide panicked you have to believe me wasnt that one of the key phrases that signaled deception according to kathryn dance whats going on pulaski asked stay there ron sachs ordered dont pay attention to a thing he says draw your weapon pulaski baker said shes going nuts somethings wrong but from the corner of her eye she saw the rookie pull his weapon and aim it in bakers direction dennis set the thirtytwo on the table then with your left hand take your service piece by the gripthumb and index finger only set it down too then move back five steps lie facedown okay you clear on that you dont understand she said calmly i dont need to understand i need you to do what im telling you but and i need you to do it now youre crazy baker snapped youve had it in for me ever since you found out i was checking into you and your old boyfriend youre trying to discredit me pulaski shes going to kill me shes gone rogue dont lether bring you down too pulaski said youve been apprised of detective sachss instructions ill disarm you if its necessary now sir whats it going to be several seconds passed it seemed like hours nobody moved fuck baker set the pistols where hed been told and lowered himself to the floor youre both in deep shit cuff him sachs told pulaski she covered baker while the bewildered rookie got the mans hands behind him and ratcheted on the cuffs search him sachs grabbed her motorola detective five eight eight five to haumann respond k go ahead k weve got a new development here ive got somebody in cuffs i need escorted downstairs whats going on the esu head asked is it the perp thats a good question she replied holstering her pistol with this latest twist in the case a new person was present in front of the midtown office building where detective dennis baker had apparently just attempted to kill amelia sachs and ron pulaski using the touchpad controller lincoln rhyme maneuvered the red storm arrow wheelchair along the sidewalk to the buildings entrance baker sat in the back of a nearby squad car cuffed and shackled his face was white he stared straight ahead at first hed claimed that sachs was targeting him because of the nick carelli situation then rhyme decided to check with the brass he asked the senior nypd official whod sent the email about it it turned out that it was bakerwhod brought up a concern about sachss possible connection with a crooked cop and the brass had never sent the email at all bakerd written it himself hed created the whole thing as cover in case sachs caught him following or checking up on her using the touch pad rhyme eased closer to the building where sellitto and haumann had set up their command post he parked and sellitto explained what had happened upstairs but added i dont get it just dont get it the heavy detective rubbed his bare hands together he glanced up at the clear windy sky as if hed just realized it was one of the chilliest months on record when he was on a case hot and cold didnt really register you find anything on him rhyme asked just the thirtytwo and latex gloves pulaski said and some personal effects a moment later amelia sachs joined them holding a carton containing a dozen plastic evidence bags shed been searching bakers car its getting better by the minute rhyme check this out she showed rhyme and sellitto the bags one by one they contained cocaine fifty thousand in cash some old clothing receipts from clubs and bars in manhattan including the st james she lifted one bag that seemed to contain nothing on closer examination though he could see fine fibers carpeting he asked yep brown bet they match the explorers thats what im thinking another link to the watchmaker rhyme nodded staring at the plastic bag which rippled in the chill wind he felt that burst of satisfaction that occurred when the pieces of the puzzle started to come together he turned to the squad car where baker sat and called through the halfopen window when were you assigned to the one one eight the man stared back at the criminalist fuck you you think im saying anything to you pricks this is bullshit somebody planted all that on me rhyme said to sellitto call personnel i want to know his prior assignments sellitto did and after a brief conversation looked up and said bingo he was at the one one eight for two years narcotics and homicide promoted out to the big building three years ago how did you meet duncan baker hunkered down in the backseat and returned to his job of staring straight ahead well isnt this a tidy little confluence of our cases rhyme said in good humor a what sellitto barked confluence a coming together lon a merger dont you do crosswords sellitto grunted what cases obviously sachss case at the one one eight and the watchmaker situation they werent separate at all opposite sides of the same knife blade you could say he was pleased with the metaphor his case and the other case you want to explain did he really need to amelia sachs said baker was a player in the corruption at the one one eight he hired the watchmakerwell duncanto take me out cause i was getting close to him which pretty much proves there is indeed something rotten in denmark now it was pulaskis chance not to get it denmark the one in europe the one in shakespeare ron the criminalist said impatiently and when the young officer grinned blankly rhyme gave up sachs took over again he means its proof there was majorcorruption at the one one eight obviously theyre doing more than just sitting on investigations for some crew out of baltimore or bay ridge looking up absently at the office building rhyme nodded oblivious to the cold and the wind there were some unanswered questions of course for instance rhyme wasnt sure if vincent reynolds really was a partner or was just being set up then there was the matter of where the extortion money was and rhyme now asked whos the one in maryland whore you working with was it oc or something else are you deaf baker snapped not a fucking word take him to cb sellitto said to the patrol officers standing beside the car book him on assault with intent for the time being well add some other ornaments later as they watched the rmp drive away sellitto shook his head jesus the detective muttered were we lucky lucky rhyme grumbled recalling that hed said something similar earlier yeah that duncan didnt kill any more vics and here tooamelia was a sitting duck if that piece hadnt misfired his voice faded before he described the tragedy that had nearly occurred lincoln rhyme believed in luck about as much as he believed in ghosts and flying saucers he started to ask what the hell did luck have to do with anything but the words never came out of his mouth luck suddenly a dozen thoughts like bees escaping from a jostled hive zipped around him he was frowning thats odd his voice faded finally he whispered duncan something wrong linc you okay rhyme sachs asked shhhhh using the touchpad controller he turned slowly in a circle glanced in a nearby alleyway then at the bags and boxes of evidence sachs had collected he gave a faint laugh he ordered i want bakers gun his service piece pulaski asked of coursenot the other one the thirtytwo where is it now hurry pulaski found the weapon in a plastic bag he returned with it fieldstrip it me the rookie asked her rhyme nodded at sachs sachs spread out a piece of plastic on the sidewalk replaced her leather gloves with latex ones and in a few seconds had the gun dismantled the parts laid out on the ground hold up the pieces one by one sachs did this their eyes met she said interesting okay rookie yessir ive got to talk to the medical examiner track him down for me well sure i should call rhymes sigh was accompanied by a stream of breath flowing from his mouth you couldtry a telegram you couldgo knock knock knockin on his door but ill bet the best approach is to useyourphoneand dont take no for an answer i needhim the young man gripped his cell phone and started punching numbers into the keypad linc sellitto said whats this and i need you to do something too lon yeah what theres a man across the street watching us in the mouth of the alley sellitto turned got him the guy was lean wearing sunglasses despite the dusk a hat and jeans and a leather jacket looks familiar invite him to come over here id like to ask him a few questions sellitto laughed kathryn dances really having an effect on you linc i thought you didnt trust witnesses oh i think in this case itd be good to make an exception shrugging the big detective asked who is he i could be wrong rhyme said with the tone of a man who believed he rarely was but i have a feeling hes the watchmaker chapter gerald duncan sat on the curb beside sachs and sellitto he was handcuffed stripped of his hat sunglasses several pairs of beige gloves wallet and a bloody box cutter unlike dennis bakers his attitude was pleasant and cooperativedespite his being pulled to the ground frisked and cuffed by three officers sachs among them a woman not noted for her delicate touch on takedowns particularly when it came to perps like this one his missouri drivers license confirmed his identity and showed an address in st louis christ sellitto said how the helld you spot him rhymes conclusion about the onlookers identity wasnt as miraculous as it seemed his belief that the watchmaker might not have fled the scene arose before hed noticed the man in the alley pulaski said ive got him the me rhyme leaned toward the phone that the rookie held out in a gloved hand and had a brief conversation with the doctor the medical examiner delivered some very interesting information rhyme thanked him and nodded pulaski disconnected the criminalist maneuvered the storm arrow wheelchair closer to duncan youre lincoln rhyme the prisoner said as if he was honored to meet the criminalist thats right and youre the quotewatchmaker the man gave a knowing laugh rhyme looked him over he appeared tired but gave off a sense of satisfactioneven peace with a rare smile rhyme asked the suspect so who was he really the victim in the alleyway we can search public records for theodore adams but thatd be a waste of time wouldnt it duncan tipped his head you figured that out too what about adams sellitto asked then realized that there were broader questions that should be asked whats going on here linc im asking our suspect about the man we found in the alley yesterday morning with his neck crushed i want to know who he was and how he died this asshole murdered him sellitto said no he didnt i just talked to the medical examiner he hadnt gotten back to us with the final autopsy but he just gave me the preliminary the victim died about five or six pm on monday not at eleven and he died instantly of massive internal injuries consistent with an automobile accident or fall the crushed throat had nothing to do with it the body was frozen solid when we found it the next morning so the tour doc couldnt do an accurate field test for cause or time of death rhyme cocked his eyebrow so mr duncan who and how duncan explained just some poor guy killed in a car crash up in westchester his names james pickering rhyme urged keep going and remember were eager for answers i heard about the accident on a police scanner the ambulance took the body to the morgue in the county hospital i stole the corpse from there rhyme said to sachs call the hospital she did after a brief conversation she reported a thirtyoneyearold male ran off the bronx river parkway about five monday night lost control on a patch of ice died instantly internal injuries name of james pickering the body went to the hospital but then it disappeared they thought it mightve been transferred to another hospital by mistake but they couldnt find it the next of kin arent taking it too well as you can imagine im sorry about that duncan said and he did look troubled but i didnt have any choice i have all his personal effects and ill return them and ill pay for the funeral expenses myself the id and things in the wallet that we found on the body sachs asked forgeries duncan nodded wouldnt pass close scrutiny but i just needed people fooled for a few days you stole the body drove him to the alley and set him up with an iron bar on his neck to make it look liked hed died slowly a nod then you left the clock and note too thats right lon sellitto asked but the pier at twentysecond street what about the guy you killed there rhyme glanced at duncan is your blood type ab positive duncan laughed youre good there never was a victim on the pier lon it was his own blood looking over the suspect rhyme said you set the note and clock on the pier and poured your blood around it and on the jacketwhich you tossed into the river you made the fingernail scrapings yourself whered you get your blood you collect it yourself no i got it at a hospital in new jersey i told them i wanted to stockpile it before some surgery i was planning thats why the anticoagulants stored blood usually has a thinning agent included to prevent it from clotting duncan nodded i wondered if youd check for that rhyme asked and the fingernail duncan held up his ring finger the end of the nail was missing he himself had torn it off he added and im sure vincent told you about a young man i supposedly killed near the church i never touched him the blood on the box cutter and on some newspaper in the trash nearbyif its still thereis mine how did that happen rhyme asked it was an awkward moment vincent thought the kid saw his knife so i had to pretend that i killed him otherwise vincent might suspect me i followed him around the corner then ducked into an alley cut my own arm with the knife and smeared some of my own blood on the box cutter he showed a recent wound on his forearm you can do a dna test oh dont worry we will another thought and the carjackingyou never killed anybody to steal the buick did you theyd had no reports either of missing students in chelsea or of drivers murdered during the commission of a carjacking anywhere in the city lon sellitto was compelled to chime in again with what the hells going on hes not a serial killer rhyme said hes not any kind of killer he set this whole thing up to make it look like he was sellitto asked no wife killed in an accident never been married howd you figure it out pulaski asked rhyme because of something lon said me for one thing you mentioned his name duncan so we knew it exactly because vincent reynolds told us but mr duncan is someone who wears gloves twentyfourseven so he wont leave prints hes way too careful to give his name to a person like vincentunless he didnt care if we found out who he was then you said it was lucky he didnt kill the recent victims and amelia pissed me off at first hearing that but i got to thinking about it you were right wedidnt really save any victims at all the florist joanne i figured out he was targeting her sure but shes the one who called nineoneone after she heard a noise in the workshopa noise he probably made intentionally thats right duncan agreed and i left a spool of wire on the floor to warn her that somebodyd broken in sachs said lucy the soldier in greenwich villagewe got an anonymous phone call from a witness about a breakin but it wasnt a witness at all right it was you making that call i told vincent that somebody in the street called nineoneone but no i called from a pay phone and reported myself rhyme nodded at the office building behind them and herethe fire extinguisher was a dud i assume harmless i poured a little alcohol on the outside but its filled with water sellitto was on the phone calling the sixth precinct the nypd bomb squad headquarters a moment later he hung up tap water just like the gun you gave baker the one he was going to use to kill sachs here rhyme glanced at the dismantled i just checked it outthe firing pins been broken off duncan said to sachs i plugged the barrel too you can check and i knew he couldnt use his own gun to shoot you because that would tie him to your death okay sellitto barked thats it somebody talk to me rhyme shrugged all i can do is get us to this station lon its up to mr duncan to complete the train ride i suspect hes planned to enlighten us all along which is why he was enjoying the show from the grandstand across the street duncan nodded and said to rhyme you hit it on the head detective rhyme im decommissioned the criminalist corrected the whole point of what ive done is what just happenedand yes i was enjoying it very much watching that son of a bitch dennis baker get arrested and dragged off to jail keep going duncans face grew still a year ago i came here on businessi own a company that does lease financing of industrial equipment i was working with a friendmy best friend he saved my life when we were in the army twenty years ago we were working all day drafting documents then went back to our hotels to clean up before dinner but he never showed i found out hed been shot to death the police said it was a mugging but something didnt seem right i mean how often do muggers shoot their victims pointblank in the foreheadtwice oh shooting fatalities during the commission of robberies are extremely rare according to recent pulaskis voice trailed off under rhymes cool glance duncan continued now the last time i saw him my friend told me something odd he said that the night before hed been in a club downtown when he came out two policemen pulled him aside and said theyd seen him buying drugs which was bullshit he didnt do drugs i know that for a fact he knew he was being shaken down and demanded to see a police supervisor he was going to call somebody at headquarters and complain but just then some people came out of the club and the police let him go the next day he was shot and killed too much of a coincidence i kept going back to the club and asking questions cost me five thousand bucks but finally i found somebody willing to tell me that dennis baker and some of his fellow cops ran shakedown scams in the city duncan explained about a scheme of planting drugs on businessmen or their children and then dropping the charges for huge extortion payments the missing drugs from the one one eight pulaski said sachs nodded not enough to sell but enough to plant as evidence sure duncan added they were based out of some bar in lower manhattan i heard the st james thats it theyd all meet there after their shifts at the station house were over rhyme asked your friend the one who was killed what was his name duncan gave them the name and sellitto called homicide it was true the man had been shot during an apparent mugging and no perp was ever collared i used my connection id made at the clubpaid him a lot of moneyto get introduced to some people who knew baker i pretended i was a professional killer and offered my services i didnt hear anything for a while i thought hed gotten busted or gone straight and id never hear from him it was frustrating but finally baker called me and we met it turns out hed been checking me out to see if i was trustworthy apparently he was satisfied he wouldnt give me too many details but said he had a business arrangement that was in jeopardy he and another cop had taken care of some problems theyd been having sachs asked creeley or sarkowski did he mention them he didnt give me any names but it was obvious that he was talking about killing people sachs shook her head eyes troubled i was upset enough thinking that some of the cops from the one one eight were taking kickbacks from mobsters and all along theywere the actual killers rhyme glanced at her he knew shed be thinking of nick carelli thinking of her father too duncan continued then baker said there was a new problem he needed someone else eliminated a woman detective but they couldnt kill her themselvesif she died everyoned know it was because of her investigation and theyd follow up on the case even more intensely i came up with this idea of pretending to be a serial killer and i made up a namethe watchmaker sellitto said thats why there were no hits in the watchmaker trade associations theyd all come back negative on a gerald duncan right the character was all a creation of mine and i needed someone to feed you information and make you think there really was a psycho so i found vincent reynolds then we started the supposed attacks the first two i faked when vincent wasnt around the otherswhen he was with mei bungled them on purpose i had to make sure you found the box of bullets thatd connect the watchmaker to baker i was going to drop them somewhere so youd find them butduncan gave a laughas it turned out i didnt have to you found out about the suv and nearly got us so thats why you left the ammunition inside yep the book too another thought occurred to rhyme and the officer who searched the garage said it was curious you parked out in the open not at the doorway that was because you had to make sure we found the explorer exactly and all the other supposed crimes were just leading up to this oneso you could catch baker in the act of trying to kill her thatd give you probable cause i figured to search his car and house and find evidence to put him away what about the poem the full cold moon i wrote it myself duncan smiled im a better businessman than a poet but it seemed sufficiently scary to suit my needs whyd you pick these particular people as victims i didnt i picked the locationsbecause theyd allow us to get away quickly this last one the woman here was because i needed a good layout to flush out baker revenge for your friend sachs asked a lot of other people would justve had him killed outright duncan said sincerely id never hurt anybody i couldnt do that i might bend the law a biti admit i committed some crimes here but they were victimless i didnt even steal the cars baker got them himselffrom a police pound the woman who was the first victims supposed sister sachs asked who was she a friend i asked to help i lent her a lot of money a few years ago but there was no way she could repay it so she agreed to help me out and the girl in the car with her sachs asked her real daughter whats the womans name a rueful smile ill keep that to myself promised her i would just like the guy in the club who set me up with baker that was part of the deal and im sticking to it who else is involved in the shakedowns at the one one eight other than baker duncan shook his head regretfully i wish i could tell you i want them put away as much as baker i tried to find out he wouldnt talk about his scheme but i got the impression theres somebody involved other than the officers from the precinct somebody else thats right high up from maryland or with a place there sachs asked i never heard him mention that he trusted me but only up to a point i dont think he was worried about my turning him in it seemed like he was afraid id get greedy and go after the money myself it sounded like there was a lot of it a darkcolored city car pulled up to the police tape and a slim balding man in a thin overcoat climbed out he joined rhyme and the others he was a senior assistant district attorney rhyme had testified at several of the trials the man had prosecuted the criminalist nodded a greeting and sellitto explained the latest developments the prosecutor listened to the bizarre turn the case had taken most of the perps he put away were stupid tony soprano sorts or even more stupid crackheads and punks he seemed amused to find himself with a brilliant criminalwhose crimes as it turned out were not nearly as serious as it seemed what excited him far more than a serial killer was the careermaking prosecution of a deadly corruption scam in the police department any of this going through iad he asked sachs no ive been running it myself who cleared that flaherty the inspector running op div right he began asking questions and jotting notes after doing so in precise handwriting for five minutes he paused okay weve got b and e criminal trespassbut no burglary burglary is breaking and entering for the purpose of committing a felony like larceny or murder duncan had no purpose other than trespassing the prosecutor continued theft of human remains borrowing i never intended to keep the corpse duncan reminded him well its up to westchester to decide that one but here weve also got obstruction of justice interference with police procedures duncan frowned though you could say that since there were no murders in the first place the police procedures werent necessary so interference with them is moot rhyme chuckled the assistant district attorney however ignored the comment possession of a firearm barrel was plugged duncan countered it was inoperable what about the stolen motor vehicles whered they come from duncan explained about bakers theft from the police impound lot in queens he nodded to the pile of his personal effects which included a set of car keys the buicks parked up the street on thirtyfirst baker got it from the same place as the suv howd you take delivery of the cars anybody else involved baker and i went together to pick them up they were parked in a restaurant lot baker knew some of the people there he said you get their names no what was the restaurant some greek diner i dont remember the name we took the fourninetyfive to get out there i dont remember the exit but we were only on the freeway for about ten minutes after we got out of the midtown tunnel and turned left at the exit north sellitto said well have somebody check it out maybe bakers been dealing in confiscated wheels too the prosecutor shook his head i hope you understand the consequences of this not just the crimesyoull have civil fines for the diversion of emergency vehicles and city employees im talking tens hundreds of thousands of dollars i have no problem with that i checked the laws and sentencing guidelines before i started this i decided the risk of a prison sentence was worth exposing baker but i wouldnt have done this if there was any chance somebody innocent would get hurt you still put people at risk sellitto muttered pulaski was attacked in the parking garage where you left the suv he couldve been killed duncan laughed no no imthe one who saved him after we abandoned the explorer and were running out of the garage i spotted that homeless guy i didnt like the looks of him he had a club or tire iron or something in his hand after vincent and i split up i went back to the garage to make sure he didnt hurt anybody when he started toward youduncan glanced at pulaskii found a wheel cover in the trash and pitched it into the wall so youd turn around and see him coming the rookie nodded thats what happened i thought the guy stumbled and made the noise himself but whatever i was ready for him when he came at me and there was a wheel cover nearby and vincent duncan continued i made sure he never got close enough to any women to hurt them imthe one who turned him in i called nineoneone and reported him i can prove it he gave details about where and when the rapist was caughtwhich confirmed that hed been the one who called the police the prosecutor looked like he needed a timeout he glanced at his notes then at duncan and rubbed his shiny head his ears were bright red from the cold ive gotta talk to the district attorney about this one he turned to two detectives from police plaza whod met him here the prosecutor nodded at duncan and said take him downtown and keep somebody on him closeremember hes diming out crooked cops people could be gunning for him duncan was helped to his feet amelia sachs asked why didnt you just come to us and tell us what happened or make a tape of baker admitting what hed done you couldve avoided this whole charade duncan gave a harsh laugh and who could i trust who could i send a tape to how did i know who was honest and who was working with bakerits a fact of life you know whats that corrupt cops rhyme noticed sachs gave absolutely no reaction to this comment as two uniformed officers led their perp such as he was to a squad car they were at least temporarily once again a team you and me sachs lincoln rhymes case had become amelia sachss and if the watchmaker had turned out to be toothless there was still a lot of work left to do the corruption scandal at the th house was now frontburnered as sellitto said prompting rhymes sardonic comment now theres a verb you dont hear every day benjamin creeleys and frank sarkowskis killer or killers had yet to be identified specifically from among the cops who were suspected of complicity and the case against baker had to be cobbled together and the maryland connectionand the extortion moneyunearthed kathryn dance volunteered to interview baker but he was refusing to say a word so the team had to rely on traditional crime scene and investigative work on rhymes instruction pulaski was crossreferencing bakers phone calls and poring over his records and palm pilot trying to find out whom he spent the most time with at the th and elsewhere but wasnt coming up with anything helpful mel cooper and sachs were analyzing evidence from bakers car house on long island and office at one police plaza as well as the houses or apartments of several girlfriends hed been dating recently none of whom knew about the others it turned out sachs had searched with her typical diligence and had returned to rhymes with cartons of clothes tools checkbooks documents photos weapons and trace from his tire treads after an hour of looking over all of this cooper announced ah got something what rhyme asked sachs told him found some ash in the clothes that were in the trunk of bakers car and sellitto asked cooper added identical to the ash found in the fireplace at creeleys places him at that scene they also found a fiber from bakers garage that matched the rope used in benjamin creeleys suicide i want to link baker to sarkowskis death too rhyme said get nancy simpson and frank rettig out to queens that place where his body was found take some soil samples we might be able to place baker or one of his buddies there too the soil i found at creeleys in front of the fireplace sachs pointed out had chemicals in itlike from a factory site it might match good sellitto called crime scene in queens and ordered the collection sachs and cooper also found samples of sand and some vegetation that turned out to be seaweed these substances were found in bakers car and there were similar samples in his garage at home sand and seaweed rhyme commented could be a summer housemaryland again maybe bakers got one or a girlfriend of his but a check of the real estate databases showed that this wasnt the case sachs wheeled in the other whiteboard from rhymes exercise room and she jotted the latest evidence clearly frustrated she stood back and stared at the notations the maryland connection she said weve gotto find it if they killed two people and nearly ron and me theyre willing to kill more they know were closing them up and they wont want any witnesses and theyre probably destroying evidence right now sachs was silent she looked flustered its hard when your lover is also your professional partner but lincoln rhyme couldnt hold back evenespeciallywith amelia sachs he said in a low even voice thiss

not enough evidence theres neverenough evidence rhyme reminded but thats not an excuse thats what were here for sachs were the ones who examine a few dirty bricks and figure out what the entire castle

message beneath the words which was you can walk out that door tomorrow and throw away your career if you want but for now youre still a cop with a job to do her fingernails worried her scalp theres something more something youre missing rhyme muttered as he too gazed at the evidence charts so youre saying we have to think outside the box said ron pulaski ah clichãs rhyme snapped well okay if

friend eight or ten other officers from the th are involved not sure who someone else other than cops from the th is involved duncan no longer homicide suspect chapter amelia sachs walked into a tiny deserted grocery store in little italy south of greenwich village the windows were painted over and a single bare bulb burned inside the door to the darkened back room was ajar revealing a large heap of trash old shelves and dusty cans of tomato sauce the place resembled a former social club of a smalltime organized crime crew which in fact it had been until it was raided and closed up a year ago the landlord was temporarily the city which was trying to dump the place but so far no takers sellitto had said itd be a good secure place for a sensitive meeting of this sort seated at a rickety table were deputy mayor robert wallace and a cleancut young cop an internal affairs detective the iad officer toby henson greeted sachs with a firm handshake and a look in his eyes that suggested if she offered any positive response to an invitation to go out with him hed give her the evening of her life she nodded grimly focused only on doing the hard job that lay ahead her rethinking of the facts looking withinthe box as rhyme urged had produced results which turned out to be extremely unpleasant you said there was a situation wallace asked you didnt want to talk about it over the phone she briefed the men about gerald duncan and dennis baker wallace had heard the basics but henson laughed in surprise this duncan he was just a citizen and he wanted to bring down a crooked cop thats why he did this yep he have names only bakers therere about eight or ten others from the one one eight but theres someone else a main player someone else wallace asked yep all along we were looking for somebody with a connection to maryland did we get thatone wrong maryland the iad man asked sachs gave a grim laugh you know that game of telephone you mean at a kids party you whisper something to the person next to you and by the time it goes around its all different yep my source heard maryland i think it was marilyn a persons name when she nodded wallaces eyes narrowed wait you dont mean inspector marilyn flaherty impossible detective henson shook his head no way i wish i was wrong but weve got some evidence we found sand and saltwater trace in bakers car shes got a house in connecticut near the beach and ive been followed by somebody in a mercedes amg at first i thought it was a crew from jersey or baltimore but it turns out that thats what flaherty owns a cop owns an amg the internal affairs officer asked in disbelief dont forget flahertys a cop making a couple hundred thousand a year illegally sachs said stiffly and we found a blackandgray hair about the length of hers in the explorer that baker had stolen from the pound oh and remember she definitely didnt want iad to handle the case yeah that was strange wallace agreed because she was going to bury the whole thing give it to one of her people to handle but it wouldve disappeared holy shit an inspector whispered the iad pretty boy shes in custody wallace asked sachs shook her head the problem is we cant find the money we dont have probable cause to subpoena her bank records or get paper to search her house thats why i need you wallace said what can i do ive asked her to meet us here im going to brief her on what happenedonly a watereddown version i want you to tell her that weve discovered baker has a partner the mayors called a special commission and hes going to pull out all the stops to track them down tell her that internal affairs is totally on board youre thinking shell panic head for the money and youll nail her thats what we hope my partners going to put a tracker on her car while shes in here tonight after she leaves were going to tail her now are you okay lying to her no im not wallace looked down at the rough tabletop marred with graffiti but ill do it detective toby henson had apparently lost all interest in his romantic future with sachs he sighed and gave an assessment that she couldnt help but agree with thiss going to be bad now whatve we learned ron pulaski accustomed to thinking webecause of the twin thing asked himself this question meaning whatve ilearned in working on this case with rhyme and sachs he was determined to be the best cop he could and he spent a lot of time evaluating what hed done right and what hed done wrong on the job walking down the street now toward the old grocery store where sachs was meeting with wallace he couldnt really see that hed messed up anything too bad on the case oh sure he couldve run the explorer scene better and he was damn sure going to keep his weapon outsidethe tyvek jumpsuit from now onand not use choke holds unless he really had to but on the whole hed done pretty good still he wasnt satisfied he supposed this feeling came from working for detective sachs that woman set a high bar there was always something else to check out one more clue to find another hour to spend on the scene could drive you crazy could also teach you to be one hell of a cop hed really have to step up now with her leaving pulaskid heard that rumor of course and he wasnt very happy about it but hed do what was necessary he didnt know though that hed ever have her drive after all at the moment hurrying down the freezing street he was thinking of his family he really wanted just to head home talk to jenny about her daynot his no noand then play with the kids that was so fun just watching the look in his boys eyes it changed so fast and so completelywhen his son noticed something hed never seen before when he made connections when he laughed he and jenny would sit on the floor with brad in between them crawling back and forth his tiny fingers gripping pulaskis thumb and their newborn daughter she was round and wrinkled as an old grapefruit and shed lie nearby in the spongebob bassinet and be happy and perfect but the pleasure of his family would have to wait after what was about to happen it was going to be a long night he checked street numbers he was two blocks from the storefront where hed be meeting amelia sachs thinking what elseve i learned one thing you damn well better have learned to steer clear of alleys a year ago hed nearly been beaten to death because hed been walking too close to a wall with a perp hiding around the corner of a building the man had stepped out and walloped him in the head with a billy club careless and stupid as detective sachs had said you didnt know now you do approaching another alley now pulaski veered to the left to walk along the curbin the unlikely event that somebody a mugger or junkie was hiding in the alley he turned and looked down it saw the empty stretch of cobblestones but at least he was being smart thats the way it was being a cop learning these small lessons and making them a part of the hand got him from behind jesus he gasped as he was pulled through the open door of the van at the curb which he hadnt seen because he was staring into the alley he gasped and started to call out for help but his assailantdeputy inspector halston jefferies his eyes cold as the moon overheadslapped his hand over the rookies mouth somebody else grabbed pulaskis gun hand and in two seconds flat hed disappeared into the back of the van the door slammed shut the front door of the old grocery store opened and marilyn flaherty walked inside closed the door behind her and latched it unsmiling she looked around the bleak store nodded at the other officers and wallace sachs thought she looked even more tense than usual the deputy mayor playing it cool introduced her to the iad detective she shook his hand and sat at the battered table next to sachs top secret hm sachs said thiss turned into a hornets nest she watched the womans face carefully as she laid out the details the inspector kept up the great stone face giving nothing away sachs wondered what kathryn dance would see in her stiffbacked posture the tight lips the quick cold eyes the woman was virtually motionless the detective told her about bakers partner then added i know how you feel about internal affairs but with all respect ive decided we need to bring them in i im sorry inspector sachs turned toward wallace but the deputy mayor said nothing he simply shook his head sighed then glanced at the iad man the young officer pulled out his weapon sachs blinked whathey whatre you doing he trained the gun on the space midway between her and flaherty what is this the inspector gasped its a mess wallace said sounding almost regretful its a real mess both of you keep your hands on the table the deputy mayor looked them over while toby henson handed his own gun to wallace who covered the women henson wasnt iad at all he was a detective out of the th part of the inner circle of the extortion ring and the man whod helped dennis baker murder sarkowski and creeley he now pulled on leather gloves and took sachss glock from her holster he patted her down for a backup piece there was none he searched the inspectors purse and removed her small service revolver you called it right detective wallace said to sachs who stared at him in shock weve got a situationa situation he pulled out his cell phone and made a call to one of the officers in front also part of the extortion scheme all clear yep wallace disconnected the phone sachs said you it was you but her head swivelled toward flaherty the inspector asked whats this all about the deputy mayor nodded at the inspector and said to sachs wrong in a big way she had nothing to do with it dennis baker and i were partnersbut businesspartners on long island we grew up there had a recycling company together it went bust and he went to the academy became a cop i got another business up and running then i got involved in city politics and we stayed in touch i became police liaison and ombudsman and got a feel for what kind of scams worked and what didnt dennis and i came up with one that did robert flaherty snapped no no ah marilyn was all the silverhaired man could muster so amelia sachs said her shoulders sagging whats the scenario here she gave a grim laugh the inspector kills me and then kills herself you plant some money in her house and and dennis baker dies in jailhe messes with the wrong inmate falls down the stairs who knows too bad but he shouldve been more careful no witnesses thats the end of the case you think anybodys going to buy it somebody at the one one eightll turn theyll get you sooner or later well excuse me detective but we have to put out the fires weve got dont you think and youre the biggest fucking fire ive got at the moment listen robert flaherty said her voice brittle youre in trouble but its not too late wallace pulled on gloves check the street again tell them to get the car ready the deputy mayor picked up sachss glock the man walked to the door wallaces eyes turned cold as he looked over sachs and took a firm grip on the pistol sachs stared into his eyes wait wallace frowned she looked him over eerily calm under the circumstances he thought then she said esu one move in wallace blinked what to the deputy mayors shock a mans voice shouted from the darkened back room nobody move or i will fire what was this gasping wallace looked into the doorway where an esu officer was standing his h ampk machine guns muzzle moving from the politician to henson at the front door sachs reached down and grabbed something under the table her hand emerged with another glock she mustve clipped it there earlier she spun to the front door training the pistol on henson drop the weapon get down on the floor the esu officer shifted his gun back to the deputy mayor wallace thinking in panic oh christ its a sting all a setup now sachs shouted again henson muttered shit he did as he was told wallace continued to grip sachss glock he looked down at it her eyes on henson sachs turned slightly toward wallace that piece youre holdings unloaded youd die for no reason disgusted he dropped the gun on the table held his hands up mystified inspector flaherty was scooting back in her chair standing up sachs said into her lapel entry teams go the front door crashed open and a half dozen cops pushed insideesu officers following them were deputy inspector halston jefferies and the head of internal affairs division captain ron scott a young blond patrolman entered too the esu officers muscled wallace to the floor he felt the pain in his hip and joints henson was cuffed as well the deputy mayor looked outside and saw the two other officers from the one one eight the ones whod been standing guard in front they were lying on the cold sidewalk in restraints hell of a way to find out amelia sachs said to no one as she reloaded her own glock and slipped it back in her holster but it sure answers our question the query shed referred to wasnt about robert wallaces guilttheyd learned beforehand that he was one of bakers partners it was about whether marilyn flaherty had been involved too theyd set up the whole thing to find out as well as get a taped admission from wallace lon sellitto ron scott and halston jefferies had established a command post in a van up the street and hidden the esu sniper in the back room to make sure wallace and the cop with him didnt start shooting before sachs had a chance to tape the conversation pulaski was supposed to take the front door with one team and another one would take the back but at the last minute they learned that wallace had other officers with him cops from the who might or might not be crooked so theyd had to change plans a bit pulaski in fact nearly walked right into wallaces cops outside the storefront and ruined the whole thing the rookie said inspector jefferies pulled me into the command van just before those guys outside saw me jefferies snapped walking down the street like a boy scout on a fucking hike you want to stay alive on the streets kid keep your goddamn eyes open the inspectors rage seemed tame in comparison with yesterdays tantrum sachs noted at least he wasnt spitting yessir ill be more careful in the future sir jesus christ they let anybody into the academy these days sachs tried to repress a smile she turned to flaherty sorry inspector we just had to make sure you werent a player she explained her suspicions and the clues that had led her to believe that the inspector mightve been working with baker the mercedes flaherty asked sure it was mine and sure you were being tailed i had an officer from op div keeping an eye on you and pulaski you were both young you were inexperienced and you mightve been way out of your league i gave him my own car to use because you wouldve noticed a pool vehicle right away the expensive car had indeed thrown her off and actually started her thinking in another direction if the mob wasnt involved she was beginning to wonder that maybe pulaski had called it wrong about creeleys partner jordan kessler and that the businessman might somehow be involved in the deaths maybe shed speculated creeley and sarkowski had gotten caught up in one of the enronstyle investigations currently under way and were killed because of something theyd learned about corporate fraud at a clients company kessler seemed to be the only player in the game who could afford a vehicle like an amg merc but now she realized that the case was all about corrupt cops and the ash in creeleys fireplace wasnt from doctored accounting records but simply evidence that theyd burned to make sure they destroyed any records of the extortion money as shed originally speculated now the inspectors attention turned to robert wallace she asked sachs howd you find him tell him ron she instructed pulaski the rookie began detective sachs here ascertained he paused detective sachs found a bunch of trace in bakers vehicle and house that gave us the idea well gave detectives sachs and rhyme the idea that maybe the other person involved lived near a beach or marina sachs took it up i didnt think that di jefferies was involved because he wouldnt request a file sent to his own precinct if he wanted to destroy it somebody else had it routed there and intercepted it before it was logged in i went back to him and asked if anybody had been in the file room lately somebody who might have a connection to the case somebody had you a glance at wallace then i asked the next logical question did you have a maryland connection and you sure did just not an obvious one thinking inside the box oh jesus christ he muttered baker told me youd mentioned maryland but i never thought youd find it ron scott the iad head said to flaherty wallace has a boat docked at his place on the south shore of long island registered in new york but built in annapolis shes the maryland monroe scott looked him over and gave a cold laugh you boat people really love your puns sachs said the sand seaweed and saltwater trace in bakers car and house match those at his marina we got a warrant and searched the boat got some good evidence phone numbers documents trace over four million in cashoh and a lot of drugs too plenty of liquor probably perped but id say the boozes the least of your problems ron scott nodded to two esu officers get him downtown central booking as he was led out wallace called back im not saying anything if you think im going to name names you can forget about it im not confessing flaherty gave the first laugh sachs had ever heard from her are you mad robert sounds like theyve got enough evidence to put you away forever you dont need to say a word actually id just as soon you didnt open your goddamn mouth ever again iii am thursday time is a great teacher but unfortunately it kills all its pupils louishector berlioz chapter alone now rhyme and sachs looked over the tables containing the evidence that had been collected in both the st james corruption scandal and the watchmaker case sachs was concentrating hard but rhyme knew she was distracted theyd stayed up late and talked about what had happened the corruption was bad enough but that officers themselves had actually tried to kill other cops shook her even more sachs claimed she was still undecided about quitting the force but one look at her face told rhyme that she was going to leave he also knew shed had a couple of phone calls with argyle security there was no doubt rhyme now glanced at the small rectangle of white paper sitting in her briefcase open in his lab the envelope containing sachss letter of resignation like the glaring light of the full moon in a dark sky the whiteness of the letter was blinding it was hard to see it clearly it was hard to see anything else he forced himself not to think about it and looked back at the evidence gerald duncandubbed perp lite by witty thomwas awaiting arraignment on the infractions he had committed all minor ones the dna analysis revealed that the blood on the box cutter on the jacket fished out of the harbor and pooled on the pier was duncans own and the fingernail crescent was a perfect match the th precinct corruption case was moving slowly there was sufficient evidence to indict baker and wallace as well as toby henson soil at the sarkowski crime scene and the samples sachs had collected at creeleys westchester house matched trace found in bakers and hensons homes of course they had a rope fiber implicating baker in creeleys death but similar fibers were found on wallaces boat henson owned leather gloves whose texture patterns matched those found in westchester but this trio wasnt cooperating they were rejecting any plea bargains and no evidence implicated anyone else including the two officers whod been outside the east village social club who claimed they were innocent rhyme had tried to unleash kathryn dance on them but they were refusing to say anything eventually rhyme was confident he could find all the perps from the th and build cases against them but he didnt want eventually he wanted now as sachs had pointed out the other cops from the st james might be planning to kill more witnessesmaybe even make another attempt on her or pulaski it was also possible that one or more of them were forcing baker henson and wallace to remain silent by threatening their families besides rhyme was needed on other cases earlier hed gotten a call about another incidentfbi agent fred dellray temporarily sprung from financial crimes hell explained that thered been a breakin and arson at the federal national institute of standards and technology operation in brooklyn the damage was minor but the perp had breached a very sophisticated security system and with terrorism on everyones mind any burglary of a government facility got attention the feds wanted rhyme to assist in the forensic side of the investigation he wanted to help but he needed to get the bakerwallace extortion case wrapped up first a messenger arrived with the file on the murder of duncans businessman friend engineered by baker when the man refused to be extorted the case was still opentheres no statute of limitations on murderbut thered been no entries for a year rhyme was hoping to find some leads in the older case that might help them identify perps from the th precinct rhyme first went into the new york timesarchive and read the short account of the death of the victim andrew culbert it reported nothing other than that he was a businessman from duluth and had been killed during an apparent mugging in midtown no suspects were found there was no followup to the story rhyme had thom mount the investigation report on his pageturning frame and the criminalist read through the sheets as often in a cold case the notes were in several different handwritings since the investigation had been passed onwith progressively less energyas time passed according to the crime scene report thered been little trace no fingerprints or footprints no shell casings death was from two shots to the forehead the slugs ubiquitous specials a test of the weapons theyd collected from baker and the other cops at the th revealed no ballistics matches you have the crime scene inventory he asked sachs lets see right here she said lifting the sheet ill read it he closed his eyes so hed have a better image of the items wallet sachs read one hotel room key to the st regis one minibar key one cross pen one pda one packet of gum a small pad of paper with the words mens room on the top the second sheet said chardonnay thats it the lead detective from homicide was john repetti rhyme was looking off his mind stuck on something he looked at her what i was saying repetti he ran the case out of midtown north you want me to call him after a moment lincoln rhyme replied no i need you to do something else its possessed listening to the scratchy recording of the bluesman blind lemon jefferson singing see that my grave is kept clean through her ipod kathryn dance stared at her suitcase bulging open refusing to close all i bought was two pairs of shoes a few christmas presentsokay threepairs of shoes but one was pumps they dont count oh but then the sweater the sweater was the problem she pulled it out and tried again the clasps got to within a few inches of each other and stopped possessed ill go for the elegant look she found the plastic valet laundry bag and offloaded jeans a suit hair curlers stockings and the offending and bulky sweater she tried the suitcase again click no exorcist was necessary her hotel room phone rang and the front desk announced she had a visitor right on time send em up dance said and five minutes later lucy richter was sitting on the small couch in dances room you want something to drink no thanks i cant stay long dance nodded at a small fridge whoever thought up minibars is evil candy bars and chips my downfall well everythings pretty much my downfall and to add insult to injury the salsa costs ten dollars lucy who looked like shed never had to count a calorie or gram of fat in her life laughed then she said i heard they caught him the officer guarding my house told me but he didnt have any details the agent explained about gerald duncan how he was innocent all along and about the corruption scandal at an nypd precinct lucy shook her head at the news then she was looking around the small room she made some pointless comments about framed prints and the view out the window soot snow and an air shaft were the essential elements of the landscape i just came by to say thanks no you didnt thought dance but she said you dont need to thank me its our job she observed that lucys arms were uncrossed and the woman was sitting comfortably now slightly back shoulders relaxed but not slumped a confession of some sort was coming dance let the silence unravel lucy said are you a counselor no just a cop during her interviews though it wasnt unusual for suspects to keep right on going after the confession sharing stories of other moral lapses hated parents jealousy of siblings cheating wives and husbands anger joy hopes confiding seeking advice no she wasnt a counselor but she was a cop and a mother and a kinesics expert and all three of those roles required her to be an expert at the largely forgotten art of listening well youre real easy to talk to i thought maybe i could ask your opinion about something go on dance encouraged the soldier said i dont know what to do im getting this commendation today the one i was telling you about but theres a problem she explained more about her job overseas running fuel and supply trucks dance opened the minibar extracted two bottles of perrier lifted an eyebrow the soldier hesitated oh sure she opened them and handed one to lucy keeping hands busy frees up the mind to think and the voice to speak okay this corporal was on my team pete a reservist from south dakota funny guy very funny coached soccer back home worked in construction he was a big help when i first got there one day about a month ago he and i had to do an inventory of damaged vehicles some of them get shipped back to fort hood for repairs some we can fix ourselves some just are scrapped i was in the office and hed gone to the mess hall i was going to pick him up at thirteen hundred hours and we were going to drive to the bone lot i went to get him in a humvee i saw petey there waiting for me just then an ied went off thats a bomb dance knew this of course i was about thirty forty feet away when it blew petey was waving and then there was this flash and the whole scene changed it was like you blinked and the square became a different place she looked out the window the front of the mess hall was gone palm treesthey just vanished some soldiers and a couple of civilians whod been standing thereone instant there then they were gone her voice was eerily calm dance recognized the tone she heard it often in witnesses whod lost loved ones in crimes the hardest interviews to do worse than sitting across from the most amoral killer peteys body was shattered thats the only way to describe it her voice caught he was all red and black broken ive seen a lot over there but this was so terrible she sipped the water and then clutched the bottle like a child with a doll dance offered no words of sympathytheyd be useless she nodded for the woman to continue a deep breath lucys fingers intertwined tightly in her work dance characterized this gesturea common oneof trying to strangle the unbearable tension arising from guilt or pain or shame the thing isi was late i was in the office i looked up at the clock it was about twelve fiftyfive but i had a half cup of soda left i thought about throwing it out and leavingitd take five minutes to get to the mess hallbut i wanted to finish the soda i just wanted to sit and finish it i was late getting to the mess hall if id been on time he wouldntve died i wouldve picked him up and wed have been a half mile away when the ied blew were you injured a little she pulled up her sleeve and displayed a large leathery scar on her forearm nothing serious she stared at the scar and then drank more water her eyes were hollow even if id been just oneminute late at least hedve been in the vehicle he probably would have survived sixty secondsthat wouldve made the difference between him living and dying and all because of a soda all i wanted was to finish my goddamn soda a sad laugh escaped her dry lips and then who shows up and tries to kill me somebody calling himself the watchmaker leaving a bigass clock in my bathroom for weeks all i can think about is how a single minute one way or the other makes the difference between life and death and heres this freak throwing it in my face dance asked what else theres something more isnt there a faint laugh yep heres the problem see my tour was scheduled to be up next month but i felt so guilty about pete that i told my co id reenlist dance was nodding thats what this ceremonys about its not about getting wounded were wounded every day its about reenlisting the armys having a tough time getting new recruits theyre going to use the reenlisters as poster children for the new army we like it so much we want to go back that sort of thing and youre having second thoughts she nodded its driving me crazy i cant sleep i cant make love to my husband i cant do anything im lonely im afraid i miss my family but i also know were doing something important over there something good for a lot of people i cant decide i simply cant decide what would happen if you told them you changed your mind i dont know theyd be pissed probably but were not talking courtmartial its more myproblem id be disappointing people id be backing down from something which ive never done in my life id be breaking a promise dance thought for a moment sipping the water i cant tell you what to do but i will say one thing my job is finding the truth most everybody i deal with are perpscriminals they know the truth and theyre lying to save their butts but therere also a lot of people i come across who lie to themselves and usually they dont even know it but whether youre deceptive to the cops or your mother or husband or friends or yourself the symptomsre always the same youre stressed angry depressed lies turn people ugly the truth does the opposite of course sometimes it seems like the truth is the last thing we want but i cant tell you how many times ive gotten a suspect to confess and he gives me this look its like pure relief in his face the weirdest thing sometimes they even say thanks youre saying iknow the truth oh yeah you do its there covered up real good and you might not like it when you find it but its there how do i find it interrogate myself you know thats a great way to put it sure what you do is look for the same things i look for anger depression denial excuses rationalization when do you feel that way and why whats behind this feeling or that one and dont let yourself get away with anything keep at it youll find out what you really want lucy richter leaned forward and hugged dancesomething very few subjects ever did the soldier smiled hey got an idea lets write a selfhelp book the girls guide to selfinterrogationitll be a best seller in all our free time dance laughed they tapped the water bottles together with a ring fifteen minutes later they were halfway through the blueberry muffins and coffee that theyd ordered from room service when the agents mobile phone chirped she looked at the number on caller id kathryn dance shook her head and gave a laugh the doorbell of rhymes town house rang thom arrived in the lab a moment later accompanying kathryn dance her hair was loose not in the taut braid of earlier and the ipod headsets dangled around her neck she took off a thin overcoat and greeted sachs and mel cooper whod just arrived dance bent down and petted jackson the dog thom said hmm howd you like a goingaway present nodding at the havanese she laughed hes adorable but im about at my livestock limit at homeboth the two and fourlegged variety it had been rhyme on the phone asking her please could she help them out once more i promise its the last time he now said as she sat beside him she asked so whats up theres a glitch in the case and i need your help what can i do i remember you told me about the hanson case in californialooking over the transcript of his statement gave you some insights into what he was up to she nodded id like you to do the same thing for us rhyme now explained to her about the murder of gerald duncans friend andrew culbert which set duncan on the path of bringing down baker and wallace but we found some curious things in the file culbert had a pda but no cell phone that was odd everybody in business nowadays has a cell phone and he had a pad of paper with two notes on it one was chardonnay which might mean that hed written it to remind himself to buy some wine but the other was mens room why would somebody write that i thought about it for a bit and it occurred to me that it was the sort of thing that somebodyd write if they had a speech or hearing problem ordering wine in a restaurant then asking where the rest rooms were and no cell phone either i wondered if maybe he was deaf so dance said duncans friend was killed because the mugger lost his temper when the victim couldnt understand him or didnt hand over the wallet fast enough he thoughtthat baker killed his friend but it was just a coincidence sachs said it gets trickier rhyme said i tracked down culberts widow in duluth she told me hed been deaf and mute since birth sachs added but duncan said that culbert had saved his life in the army if he was deaf he wouldntve been in the service rhyme said i think duncan just read about a mugging victim and claimed he was his friendto give some credibility to his plan to implicate baker the criminalist shrugged it might not be a problem after all we collared a corrupt cop but it leaves a few questions can you look at duncans interview tape and tell us what you think of course cooper typed on his keyboard a moment later a wideangle video of gerald duncan came on the monitor he was sitting comfortably in an interview room downtown as lon sellittos voice was giving the details who he was the date and the case then the statement proper began duncan recited essentially the same facts that hed told rhyme while sitting on the curb outside the last serial killer scene dance watched nodding slowly as she listened to the details of his plan when it was finished cooper hit pause freezeframing duncans face dance turned to rhyme thats all of it yes he noticed her face had gone still the criminalist asked what do you think she hesitated and then said i have to saymy feeling is that its not just the story about his friend getting killed thats a problem i think virtually everything hes telling you on that tape is a complete lie silence in rhymes town house total silence finally rhyme looked up from the image of gerald duncan motionless on the screen and said go on i got his baseline when he was mentioning the details of his plan to get baker arrested we know certain aspects of that are true so when the stress levels change i assume hes being deceptive i saw major deviations when hes talking about the supposed friend and i dont think his names duncan or he lives in the midwest oh and he couldnt care less about dennis baker he has no emotional interest in the mans arrest and theres something else she glanced at the screen can you cue to the middle theres a place where he touches his cheek cooper ran the video in reverse there play that id never hurt anybody i couldnt do that i might bend the law a bit dance shook her head frowning what sachs asked his eyes dance whispered oh thiss a problem why im thinking hes dangerous very dangerous i spent months studying the interview tapes of ted bundy the serial killer he was a pure sociopath meaning he could deceive with virtually no outward signs whatsoever but the one thing i could detect in bundy was a faint reaction in his eyes when he claimed hed never killed anyone the reaction wasnt a typical deception response it revealed disappointment and betrayal he was denying something central to his being she nodded to the screen exactly what duncan just did are you sure sachs asked not positive no but i think weve got to ask him some more questions whatever hes up to we better have him moved to levelthree detention until we can figure it out since hed been arrested for only minor nonviolent crimes gerald duncan would be in a lowsecurity holding tank down on centre street escape from there was unlikely but not impossible rhyme ordered his phone to call the supervisor of detention in downtown manhattan he identified himself and gave instructions to move duncan to a more secure cell the jailer said nothing rhyme assumed this was because he didnt want to take orders from a civilian the tedium of politics he grimaced then glanced at sachs meaning that she should authorize the transfer it was then that the real reason for the supervisors silence became clear well detective rhyme the man said uneasily he was only here for a few minutes we never even booked him what the prosecutor he cut some deal or another and released duncan last night i thought you knew chapter lon sellitto was back in rhymes lab pacing angrily duncans lawyer it seemed had met with the assistant district attorney and in exchange for an affidavit admitting guilt the payment of for misuse of police and fire resources and a written guarantee to testify against baker all the criminal charges were dropped subject to being reinstated if he reneged on the appearance in court as a witness against baker hed never even been printed or booked the big rumpled detective stared at the speakerphone glowering hands on his hips as if the unit itself were the incompetent fool whod released a potential killer the defensiveness in the prosecutors voice was clear it was the only way hed cooperate the man said he was represented by a lawyer from reed prince he surrendered his passport it was all legit hes agreed not to leave the jurisdiction until bakers trial ive got him in a hotel in the city with an officer guarding him hes not going anywhere whats the big deal ive done this a hundred times what about westchester rhyme called into the speakerphone the stolen corpse they agreed not to prosecute i said wed help them out on a few other cases they needed our cooperation for the prosecutor would see this as a gold ring in his career bringing down a gang of corrupt cops would catapult him to stardom rhyme shook his head livid incompetence and selfish ambition infuriated him its hard enough to do this job without interference from politicians why the hell hadnt anybody called him first before releasing duncan even before kathryn dances opinion about the interview tape there were too many unanswered questions to release the man sellitto barked where is he anyway what proof where the fuck is he sellitto raged the prosecutor hesitated and gave them the name of a hotel in midtown and the mobile number of the officer guarding him im on it cooper dialed the number sellitto continued and who was his lawyer the assistant district attorney gave them this name too the nervous voice said i really dont see what all the fuss sellitto hung up he looked at dance im about to push some serious buttons you know what im saying she nodded weve got fanhitting shit out in california too but im comfortable with my opinion do whatever you can to find him i mean everything ill give that same opinion to whoever you want me to chief of department mayor governor rhyme said to sachs see what the lawyer knows about him she took the name flipped open her phone rhyme knew of reed prince of course it was a large respected firm on lower broadway the attorneys there were known for handling highprofile whitecollar criminal defense in a grim voice cooper said weve got a problem that was the officer at the hotel suite guarding duncan he just checked his room hes gone lincoln what the officer said he went to bed early last night saying he wasnt feeling well and he wanted to sleep in today looks like he picked the lock to the adjacent room the officer has no idea when it happened couldve been last night sachs pinched her phone closed reed prince doesnt have a lawyer on staff with the name he gave the prosecutor and duncan isnt a client oh goddamn rhyme snapped all right sellitto said time for the cavalry he called bo haumann at esu and told them they needed to arrest their suspect yet again only we arent exactly sure where he is he gave the tactical officer the few details they had haumanns reaction which rhyme didnt hear could nonetheless be inferred from sellittos expression you dont need to tell mebo sellitto left a message with the district attorney himself and then called the big building to inform the brass about the problem i want more on him rhyme said to cooper we were too fucking complacent we didnt ask enough questions he glanced at dance kathryn i really hate to ask this she was putting away her cell phone ive already canceled my flight im sorry its not really your case its been my case since i interviewed cobb on tuesday dance said her green eyes cold her lips drawn cooper was scrolling through the information theyd learned about gerald duncan he made a list of phone numbers and started calling after several conversations he said listen to this hes not duncan the missouri state police sent a car out to the address on the license its owned by a gerald duncan yeah but not our gerald duncan the guy who lived there was transferred to anchorage for his job for six months the houses empty and up for rent heres his picture the image was a drivers license shot of a man very different from the one theyd arrested yesterday rhyme nodded brilliant he checked the paper for rental listings found one thatd been on the market for a while and figured it wasnt going to rent for the next few weeks because of christmas same as the church and he forged the drivers license we saw passport too weve been underestimating this guy from the beginning cooper staring at his computer called out the ownerthe real duncanhad some credit card problems identity theft lincoln rhyme felt a chill in the center of his being a place where in theory he could feel nothing he had a sense that an unseen disaster was unfolding quickly dance was staring at the still image of duncans face as intently as rhyme stared at his evidence charts she mused whats he really up to a question they couldnt begin to answer riding the subway charles vespasian hale the man whod been masquerading as gerald duncan the watchmaker checked his wristwatch his breguet pocket watch which hed grown fond of wouldnt fit the role he was about to assume everything was right on schedule he was taking the train from the brooklyn neighborhood where he had his primary safe house feeling anticipation and an edginess too but nonetheless he was as close to harmony as hed ever been in his life very little of what hed told vincent reynolds about his personal past had been true of course it couldnt be he planned a long career at his profession and he knew that the mealy rapist would spill everything to the cops at the first threat born in chicago hale was the son of a high school latin teacher hence the middle name after a noble roman emperor and a woman who was the manager of the petites department at a suburban sears store the couple never talked much didnt do much every night after a quiet supper his father would gravitate to his books his mother to her sewing machine for familial activity they might settle in two separate chairs in front of the small television set and watch bad sitcoms and predictable cop dramas which allowed them a unique medium of communicationby commenting on the shows they expressed to each other the desires and resentments that theyd never have the courage to say directly quiet the boy had been a loner for much of his life he was a surprise child and his parents treated him with formal manners and apathy and a quizzical air as if he were a species of plant whose watering and fertilizing schedule they were unsure of the hours of boredom and solitude grew to be an open sore and charles felt a desperation to occupy his time for fear the excruciating stillness in the household would strangle him he spent hours and hours outsidehiking and climbing trees for some reason it was better to be alone when you were outside there was always something to distract you something you might find over the next hill on the next branch up in the maple tree he was in the field biology club at school he went on outward bound expeditions and was always the first to cross the rope bridge dive off the cliff rappel down a mountainside if he was condemned to be inside charles developed a habit of filling his time by putting things in order arranging office supplies and books and toys could endlessly fill the painful hours he wasnt lonely when he did that he didnt ache with boredom he wasnt afraid of the silence did you know vincent that the word meticulous comes from the latinmeticulosus meaning fearful when things werent precise and ordered hed grow frantic even when the glitch was something as silly as a misaligned train track or a bent bicycle spoke anything not running smoothly would set him on edge the way a fingernail screech on a blackboard caused other people to cringe like his parents marriage for instance after the divorce he never spoke to either of them again life should be tidy and perfect when it wasnt you should be free to eliminate the disorderly elements altogether he didnt pray no empirical evidence that you could put your life in order or achieve your goals via divine communication but if he had charles would have prayed for them to die hale went into the army for two years where he flourished in the atmosphere of order he went to officer candidate school and caught the attention of his professors who after he was commissioned tapped him to teach military history and tactical and strategic planning at which he excelled after he was discharged he spent a year hiking and mountain climbing in europe then he returned to america and went into business as an investment banker and venture capitalist studying law at night he worked as an attorney for a time and was brilliant at structuring business deals he made very good money but there was an underlying loneliness about his life he shunned relationships because they required improvisation and were full of illogical behavior more and more his passion for planning and order took on the role of lover and like anyone who substitutes an obsession for a real relationship hale found himself looking for more intense ways to satisfy himself he found a perfect solution six years ago he killed his first man living in san diego hale learned that a business associate had been badly injured some drunk driver had plowed into the mans car the accident shattered the businessmans hip and snapped both legsone of which had to be amputated the driver expressed no remorse whatsoever and continued to deny hed done anything wrong even blaming the accident on the victim himself the punk was convicted but a firsttime offender he got off with a light sentence then he began harassing hales associate for money hale decided that enough was enough he came up with an elaborate plan to terrify the kid into stopping but as he looked over the scheme he realized it made him feel uncomfortable edgy there was something clumsy about it the plan wasnt as precisely ordered as he wanted finally he realized what the trouble was his scheme left the victim scared but alive if the kid died then it would work perfectly and thered be nothing to trace back to hale or his injured associate but could he actually kill a human being the idea sounded preposterous yes or no on a rainy october night he made his decision the murder went perfectly and the police never suspected the mans death was anything but an unfortunate home electrocution accident hale was prepared to feel remorse but there was none instead he was ecstatic the plan had been so perfectly executed the fact that hed killed someone was irrelevant the addict wanted more of his drug a short time later hale was involved in a joint venture in mexico citybuilding a development of upscale haciendas but a corrupt politician managed to throw up enough stumbling blocks so the deal was going to collapse hales mexican counterpart explained that the petty politician had done this a number of times its a shame he cant be removed hale had said coyly oh he can never be removed the mexican said he is you would say invulnerable this caught hales attention why the crooked distrito federal commissioner the mexican explained was obsessed with security he drove in a huge armored suv a cadillac custommade for him and was always with armed guards his security company constantly planned different routes for him to get to and from his homes and offices and meetings he moved his family from house to house randomly and often didnt even stay in houses that he owned but in friends or rentals and he often traveled with his young sonthe rumors were that he kept the boy near as a shield the commissioner also had the protection of a senior federal interior minister so you could say hes invulnerable the mexican explained pouring two glasses of very expensive patrãn tequila invulnerable mused charles hale in a whisper he nodded not long after this meeting five apparently unrelated articles appeared in the october edition of el heraldo de mãxico a fire in the office of mexicana seguridad privado a security services company resulted in the evacuation of all employees no injuries were reported and the damage was minor a hacker shut down the main computer of a mobile phone provider resulting in a disruption of service in a portion of mexico city and its southern suburbs for about two hours a truck caught fire in the middle of highway south of mexico city near chalco completely blocking northbound traffic henri porfirio the head of the distrito federal commercial real estate licensing commission died when his suv crashed through a onelane bridge and plunged forty feet struck a propane truck parked there and exploded the incident occurred when drivers were following directions from a flagman to pull off the highway and take a side road to avoid a major traffic jam other vehicles had made it successfully over the bridge earlier but the commissioners vehicle being armor plated was too heavy for the old structure despite a sign that stated it could support the suvs weight porfirios security chief knew about the traffic jam and had been trying to contact him about a safer route but was unable to because the commissioners mobile phone was not working his was the only vehicle that fell porfirios son was not in the suv which he otherwise would have been because the child came down with a minor case of food poisoning the day before and remained at home with his mother erasmo saleno a senior interior official in the mexican federal government was arrested after a tip led police to his summer home where they found a stash of weapons and cocaine curiously reporters had been alerted too including a photographer connected with the los angeles times all in a days news a month later hales real estate project broke ground and he received from his fellow investors in mexico a bonus of us in cash he was pleased with the money he was more pleased though with the connections hed made through the mexican businessman it wasnt long before the man put him in touch with someone in america who needed similar services now several times a year between his business projects he would take on an assignment like this usually it was murder though hed also engaged in financial scams insurance fraud and elaborate thefts hale would work for anyone whatever the motive which was irrelevant to him he had no interest in why somebody wanted a crime committed twice hed murdered abusive husbands he killed a child molester one week before hed murdered a businesswoman who was a major contributor to the united way good and bad were words whose definitions were different for charles vespasian hale good was mental stimulation bad was boredom good was an elegant plan well executed bad was either a sloppy plan or one carelessly carried out but his current plotcertainly his most elaborate and farreachingwas humming along perfectly god created the complex mechanism of the universe then wound it up and started it running hale got off the subway and climbed to the street his nose stinging from the cold his eyes watering and started along the sidewalk he was about to push the button that would set the hands of his real chronograph in motion lon sellittos phone rang and he took the call frowning he had a brief conversation ill look into it rhyme glanced up expectantly that was haumann he just got a call from the manager of a delivery service on the same floor as the company that the watchmaker broke into in midtown he said a customer just called a package they were supposed to deliver yesterday never showed up looks like somebody broke in and stole it around the time that we were sweeping the offices looking for the perp the manager asked if we knew anything about it rhymes eyes slipped to the photographs that sachs had taken of the hallway bless her shed taken pictures of the entire floor below the name of the delivery service were the words high securityvaluable deliveries guaranteed licensed and bonded rhyme heard the white noise of people talking around him but he didnt hear the words themselves he stared at the photograph and then at the other evidence access he whispered what sellitto asked frowning we were so focused on the watchmaker and the fake killingsand then on his scheme to flush out bakerwe never looked at what else was going on which was sachs asked breaking and entering the crime he actuallycommitted was trespass all of the offices on that floor were unguarded for a time when they evacuated the building they left the doors unlocked well yeah i suppose the big detective said sachs said so while we were focused on the flooring company the watchmaker mightve put on a uniform or just hung a badge over his neck then strolled right inside the delivery service and helped himself to that package access call the service find out what was in the package who sent it and where it was going now chapter a taxicab pulled up in front of the metropolitan museum of art on fifth avenue the huge building was decorated for christmas dolled up in the tasteful victorian regalia that youd expect on the upper east side subdued festive out of this cab climbed charles vespasian hale who looked around carefully on the remote chance that the police were following him it would have been exceedingly unlikely that hed be under surveillance still hale took his time looked everywhere for anyone showing him the least attention he saw nothing troubling he leaned down to the open taxi window and paid the drivertendering the cash in gloved handsand hooking a black canvas bag over his shoulder he climbed the stairs into the large cathedrallike lobby which echoed with the sound of voices most of them young the place was lousy with kids freed from school evergreens and gold and ornaments and tulle were everywhere bach twopart inventions plucked away cheerily on a recorded harpsichord echoing in the cavernous entryway tis the season hale left the black bag at the coat check though he kept his coat and hat the clerk looked inside the bag noted the four art books then zipped it back up and told hale to have a nice day he took the claim check and paid admission he nodded a smile at the guards at the entrance and walked past them into the museum itself the delphic mechanism rhyme was talking to the director of the metropolitan museum of art via speakerphone its still on display there yes detective the man replied uncertainly weve had it here for two weeks its part of a multicity tour fine fine fine is it guarded yes of course i theres a possibility that a thiefs trying to steal it steal it are you sure its a oneofakind objetwhoever took possession could never show it in public he doesnt intend to sell it rhyme said i think he wants it for himself the criminalist explained the package stolen from the delivery service in the building on thirtysecond street was from a wealthy patron of the arts and was destined for the metropolitan museum it contained a large portfolio of some antiques being offered to the museums furniture collection the metropolitan museum rhyme had wondered hed then recalled the museum programs found in the church hed asked vincent reynolds and the clock dealer victor hallerstein if duncan had mentioned anything about the met he had apparentlyspending considerable time thereand hed expressed particular interest in the delphic mechanism rhyme now told the director we think he may have stolen the package to smuggle something into the museum maybe tools maybe software to disable alarms we dont know i cant figure it out at this point but i think we have to be cautious my godall right what do we do rhyme looked up at cooper who typed on his keyboard and gave a thumbsup into the microphone the criminalist said weve just emailed you his picture could you print it out and get a copy to all the employees the security surveillance room and the coat check see if they recognize him ill do it right now can you hold for a few minutes sure soon the director came on the line detective rhyme his voice was breathless hes here he checked a bag about ten minutes ago the clerk recognized the picture the bags still there yes he hasnt left rhyme nodded at sellitto who picked up the phone and called bo haumann at esu whose teams were on their way to the museum and told him this latest news the guard at the mechanism rhyme asked is he armed no do you think the thief is we dont have metal detectors at the entrance he couldve brought a gun in its possible rhyme looked at sellitto with a lifted eyebrow the detective asked move a team in slow undercover he checked a bagand he knows clocks he asked the museum director did anybody look in the bag ill check hold on a moment later he came back books he has art books inside but the coatcheck clerk didnt examine them bomb for diversion sellitto asked could be maybe its only smoke but even then peoplell panic could be fatalities either way haumann called in on his radio his crackling voice okay weve got teams approaching all the entrances public and service rhyme asked dance youre convinced hes willing to take lives yes he was considering the mans astonishing plotmaking skills was there some other deadly plan hed put into play if he realized he was about to be arrested at the museum rhyme made a decision evacuate sellitto asked the entire museum i think we have to first prioritysave lives clear the coatroom and front lobby and then move everybody else out have haumanns men check out everybody who leaves make sure the teams have his picture the museum director had heard you think thats necessary yes do it now okay but i just dont see how anyone could steal it the director said the mechanisms behind inchthick bulletproof glass and the case cant be opened until the day the exhibit closes next tuesday what do you mean rhyme asked its in one of our special display cases but why wont it open until tuesday because the case has a computerized time lock with a satellite link to some government clock they tell me nobody can break into it we put the most valuable exhibits in there the man continued speaking but rhyme looked away something was nagging him then he recalled that arson earlier the one that fred dellray wanted us to help out on where was it again sachs frowned a government office the institute of standards and technology or something like that why look it up mel the tech went online reading from the website he said nist is the new name for the national bureau of standards and bureau of standards rhyme interrupted they maintain the countrys atomic clock is thatwhat hes up to the time lock at the met has an uplink to the nist somehow hes going to change the time convince the lock that its next tuesday the vaultll open automatically can he do that dance asked i dont know but if its possible hell find a way the fire at nist was to cover up the breakin ill bet then rhyme stopped talking as the full implications of the watchmakers plan became clear oh no what rhyme was thinking about kathryn dances observation that to the watchmaker human life was negligible he said time everywhere in the country is governed by the us atomic clock airlines trains national defense power grids computerseverything do you have any idea whats going to happen if he resets it in a cheap midtown hotel a middleaged man and woman sat on a small couch that smelled of mildew and old food they were staring at a television set charlotte allerton was the stocky woman whod pretended to be the sister of theodore adams the first victim in the alley on tuesday the man beside her bud allerton her husband was the man masquerading as the lawyer whod secured gerald duncans release from jail by promising that his client would be a spectacular witness in the crooked cop scandal bud really was a lawyer though he hadnt practiced for some years hed resurrected some of his old skills for the sake of duncans plan which called for buds pretending to be a criminal attorney from the big prestigious law firm of reed prince the assistant district attorney had bought the entire charade not even bothering to call the firm to check up on the man gerald duncan had believed correctly that the prosecutor would be so eager to make a name for himself on a police corruption case that hed believe what he wanted to besides who ever asks for a lawyers id the allertons attention was almost exclusively on the tv screen showing local news a program about christmas tree safety yadda yadda yaddafor a moment charlottes gaze slipped to the master bedroom in the suite where her pretty thin daughter sat reading a book the girl looked through the doorway at her mother and stepfather with the same dark sullen eyes that had typified her expression in recent months that girl frowning charlotte looked back to the tv screen isnt it taking too long bud said nothing his thick fingers were intertwined and he sat forward hunched elbows on knees she wondered if he was praying a moment later the reporter whose mission was to save families from the scourge of burning christmas trees disappeared and on the screen came the words special news bulletin chapter in doing his research into watchmaking so that he could be a credible revenge killer charles hale had learned of the concept of complications a complication is a function in a watch or clock other than telling the time of day for instance those small dials that dot the front of expensive timepieces giving information like day of the week and date and time in different locations and repeater functions chimes sounding at certain intervals watchmakers have always enjoyed the challenge of getting as many complications into their watches as possible a typical one is the patek philippe star calibre a watch featuring more than one thousand parts its complications offer the owner such information as the times of sunrise and sunset a perpetual calendar the day date and month the season moon phases lunar orbit and power reserve indicators for both the watchs movement and the several chimes inside the trouble with complications though is that theyre just that they tend to distract from the ultimate purpose of a watch telling time breitling makes superb timepieces but some of the professional and navitimer models have so many dials hands and side functions like chronographs the technical term for stopwatches and logarithmic slide rules that its easy to miss the big hand and the little hand but complications were exactly what charles hale needed for his plan here in new york city distractions to lead the police away from what he was really about because there was a good chance that lincoln rhyme and his team would find out that he was no longer in custody and that he wasnt really gerald duncan theyd realize he had something else in mind other than getting even with a crooked cop so he needed yet another complication to keep the police focused elsewhere hales cell phone vibrated he glanced at the text message which was from charlotte allerton special report on tv museum closed police searching for you there he put the phone back in his pocket and enjoyed a moment of keen almost sexual satisfaction the message told him that while rhyme hadtipped to the fact that he wasnt who he seemed to be the police were still missing the time of day and focusing on the complication of the metropolitan museum he was pointing the police toward what appeared to be a plan to steal the famous delphic mechanism at the church hed planted brochures on the horologic exhibits in boston and tampa hed rhapsodized on the device to vincent reynolds hed hinted to the antiques dealer about his obsession with old timepieces mentioning the mechanism specifically and that he was aware of the exhibit at the met the small fire hed set at the national institute of standards and technology in brooklyn would make them think he was going to somehow reset the countrys cesium clock disabling the mets timesecurity system and steal the mechanism a plot to steal the device seemed to be just the clever subtle deduction for the cops to seize as hales real motive officers would spend hours scouring the museum and nearby central park looking for him and examining the canvas bag hed left it contained four hollowedout books inside of which were two bags of baking soda a small scanner and of course a clocka cheap digital alarm none of them meant anything but each was sure to keep the police busy for hours the complications in his plan were as elegant if not as numerous as those in what was reportedly the worlds most elaborate wristwatch one made by gerald genta but at the moment hale was nowhere near the museum which hed left a half hour ago not long after hed entered and checked the bag hed walked into a restroom stall then taken off his coat revealing an army uniform rank of major hed donned glasses and a militarystyle hathidden in a false pocket in his coatand had left the museum quickly he was presently in downtown manhattan slowly making his way through the security line leading into the new york office of the department of housing and urban development in a short time a number of soldiers and their families would attend a ceremony in their honor hosted by the city and the us departments of defense and state in the hud building officials would be greeting soldiers recently returned from foreign conflicts and their families giving them letters of commendation for their service in recent world conflicts and thanking them for reenlisting following the ceremonies and the requisite photo ops and trite statements to the press the guests would leave and the generals and other government officials would reconvene to discuss future efforts to spread democracy to other places in the world these government officials as well as the soldiers their families and any members of the press who happened to be present were the real point of charles hales mission in new york he had been hired for the simple purpose of killing as many of them as he could with husky eversmiling bob driving lucy richter sat in the car as they made their way past the reviewing stand outside the housing and urban development building where the parade was just winding down her hand on her husbands muscular thigh lucy was silent the honda nosed through the heavy traffic bob making casual conversation talking about the party tonight lucy responded halfheartedly shed grown troubled once again about the big conflictwhat shed confessed to kathryn dance should she go through with the reenlistment or not selfinterrogation when shed agreed a month earlier was she being honest or being deceptive with herself looking for the things agent dance told her anger depressionam i lying she tried to put the debate out of her head they were close to the hud building now and across the street she saw protesters they were against the various foreign conflicts america was involved in her friends and fellow soldiers overseas were pissed off at anybody who protested but curiously lucy didnt see it that way she believed the very fact that these people were free to demonstrate and were not in jail validated what she was doing the couple drew closer to the checkpoint at the intersection near the hud building two soldiers stepped forward to check their ids and to look in the trunk lucy stiffened what her husband asked look she said he glanced down her right hand was on her hip where she wore her sidearm when on duty going for the fast draw bob joked instinct at checkpoints she laughed but it was a humorless sound bitter fog bob nodded at the soldiers and smiled to his wife i think were pretty safe not like were in baghdad or kabul lucy squeezed his hand and they proceeded to the parking lot reserved for the honorees charles hale was not completely apolitical he had some general opinions about democracy versus theocracy versus communism versus fascism but he knew his views amounted to the same pedestrian positions offered by listeners calling in to rush limbaugh or npr radio nothing particularly radical or articulate so last october when charlotte and bud allerton hired him for the job of sending a message about big government and wrongminded american intervention in heathen foreign nations hale had yawned mentally but he was intrigued by the challenge weve talked to six people and nobodyll take the job bud allerton told him its next to impossible charles vespasian hale liked that word one wasnt bored when taking on the impossible it was like invulnerable charlotte and budher second husbandwere part of a rightwing militia fringe group that had been attacking federal government employees and buildings and un facilities for years theyd gone underground a while ago but recently enraged at the governments meddling forays into world affairs she and the others in her nameless organization decided it was time to go after something big this attack would not only send their precious message but would cause some real harm to the enemy killing generals and government officials whod betrayed principles america was founded on and sent our boys andgod help usgirls to die on foreign soil for the benefit of people who were backward and cruel and nonchristian hale had managed to extract himself from his rhetoricaddicted clients and got to work on halloween hed come to new york moved into the safe house in brooklyn and spent the next month and a half engrossed in the construction of his timepieceacquiring supplies finding unwitting associates to help him dennis baker and vincent reynolds learning everything he could about the watchmakers supposed victims and surveilling the hud building which he was now approaching through the bitterly cold morning air this building had been chosen for the ceremonies and meetings not because of the departments mission which had nothing to do with the military of course but because it offered the best security of any federal building in lower manhattan the walls were thick limestone if a terrorist were somehow to negotiate the barricades surrounding the place and detonate a car bomb the resulting explosion would cause less damage than it would to a modern glassfacaded structure hud was also lower than most offices downtown which made it a difficult target for missiles or suicide airplanes it had a limited number of entrances and exits thus making access control easier and the room where the awards ceremony and later the strategic meetings would take place faced the windowless wall of the building across the alleyway so no sniper could shoot into the room with another two dozen soldiers and police armed with automatic weapons on the surrounding streets and tops of buildings hud was virtually impregnable from the exterior that is but no one realized that the threat wouldnt be coming from outside charles hale displayed his three militaryissue ids two of them unique to this event and delivered to attendees just two days ago he was nodded through the metal detector then physically patted down a final guard a corporal checked his ids a second time then saluted him hale returned the gesture and stepped inside the hud building was labyrinthine but hale now made his way quickly to the basement he knew the layout of the place perfectly because the fifth supposed victim of the psycho watchmaker sarah stanton was the estimator of the flooring company that had supplied carpeting and linoleum tile to the building a fact hed learned from public filings regarding government contractors in sarahs file cabinets he found precise drawings of every room and hallway in hud the company was also across the hall from a delivery servicewhich hed called earlier to complain about a package to the metropolitan museum that had never been delivered lending credence to the apparent plot to steal the delphic mechanism in fact all of the watchmakers assaults this week with the exception of the attentiongetting blood bath at the pier were vital steps in his mission today the flooring company lucy richters apartment the cedar street alleyway and the florist shop hed broken into lucys to photograph and later forge the special allaccess passes that were required for soldiers attending the awards ceremony hed learned her name from a newspaper story about the event hed also copied and later memorized a classified defense department memo shed been given about the event and security procedures that would be in effect at hud today the apparent murder of the fictional teddy adams had served a purpose as well it was in the alley behind this very building that hale had placed the body of the westchester car wreck victim when charlotte allertonplaying the mans distraught sisterhad arrived the guards had let the hysterical woman through the back door of hud and allowed her to use the restroom downstairs without searching her once inside shed planted what hale was now retrieving from the bottom of the inwall trash bin a silencedcaliber pistol and two metal disks thered been no other way to get these items into a building protected by a series of metal detectors and patdowns he now hid these in his pockets and headed to the sixthfloor conference room once there hale spotted what he thought of as the mainspring of his plan the two large flower arrangements that joanne harper had created for the ceremony one in the front of the room and one in the back hale had learned from the government service administration vendor liaison office that she had the contract to supply flower arrangements and plants to the hud facility hed broken into her spring street workshop to hide something in the vases which would pass through security with he hoped only a brief look since joanne had been a trusted vendor for several years when hale had broken into her workshop hed taken with him in his shoulder bag something in addition to the moonfaced clock and his tools two jars of an explosive known as astrolite more powerful than tnt or nitroglycerin astrolite was a clear liquid that remained explosive even when absorbed into another substance hale found which arrangements were going to hud and poured the astrolite into the bottoms of the vases hale of course might have simply broken into the four locations without the fiction of the watchmaker but if anyone had seen a burglar or noticed anything missing or out of order the question would have arisen what was he really up to so hed created layers of motives for the breakins his original plan was simply to pretend to be a serial killer to get access to the four locations he needed to sacrificing his unfortunate assistant vincent reynolds in order to convince the police that the watchmaker was just who he seemed to be but then in mid november an organized crime contact in the area called and told him that an nypd cop named dennis baker was looking for a hit man to kill an nypd detective the mob wouldnt touch killing a cop but was hale interested he wasnt but he immediately realized that he could use baker as a second complication to the plan a citizen getting revenge against a crooked cop finally he added the wonderful flourish of the delphic mechanism theft motive is the one sure way to get yourself caught eliminate the motive you eliminate suspicion hale now stepped to the front flower arrangement in the conference room and adjusted it the way any diligent soldier would doa soldier proud to be part of this important occasion when no one was looking he pushed one of the metal disks hed just retrieved from downstairscomputerized detonatorsinto the explosive pushed the button to arm it and fluffed up the moss obscuring the device he did the same to the arrangement in the back which would detonate via a radio signal from the first detonator these two lovely arrangements were now lethal bombs containing enough explosive to obliterate the entire room the tone in rhymes lab was electric everyone except pulaski on a mission at rhymes request was staring at the criminalist who was in turn gazing at the evidence charts that surrounded him like battalions of soldiers awaiting his orders therere still too many questions sellitto said you know whats going to happen if we push thatbutton rhyme glanced at amelia sachs what do you think he asked her ample lips tightened i dont think we have any choice i say yes oh man sellitto said rhyme said to the rumpled lieutenant make the call lon sellitto dialed a littleknown number that connected him immediately to the scrambled phone sitting on the desk of the mayor of new york city standing in the conference room in hud which was filling up with soldiers and their guests charles hale felt his phone vibrate he pulled it from his pocket and glanced down at the text message another one from charlotte allerton faa grounding all flights trains stopped special team at nist office checking us clock its a go god bless perfect charles thought the police believed the complication about the delphic mechanism and his apparent plan to hack into the computer controlling the nations cesium clock hale stepped back looked over the room and plastered a satisfied look on his face he left and took the elevator down to the main lobby he walked outside where limos were arriving under heavy security he eased into the crowd that was gathered on the other side of the concrete barriers some waving flags some applauding he noted the protesters too scruffy young people aging hippies and activist professors and their spouses he assessed they carried placards and were chanting things that hale couldnt hear the gist though was displeasure at us foreign policy hang around he told them silently sometimes you get what you ask for chapter entering the sixthfloor conference room with seventeen other soldiers from all branches of the armed services united states army sergeant lucy richter gave a brief smile to her husband a wink too to her familyher parents and her auntwho were sitting across the room the acknowledgment was perhaps a little abrupt a little distant but she was not here as bobs wife or as a daughter or niece she was here as a decorated soldier in the company of her superior officers and her fellow men and women at arms the soldiers had assembled downstairs in the building while their families and friends had come to the conference room waiting for their grand entrance lucy had chatted with a young man an air force corpsman from texas whod come back to the states for medical treatment one of those fucking rocketpropelled grenades had ricocheted off his chest pack before exploding several yards away he was eager to get back home hed said home shed asked i thought we were reenlisting hed blinked i am i mean my unit that ishome standing uneasily in front of her chair she glanced at the reporters the way they looked around them searching hungrily for story opportunities like snipers seeking targets made her nervous then she put them out of her mind and gazed at the pictures that had been mounted for the ceremony patriotic images she was moved by the sight of the american flag the photo of the trade center towers the military banners and emblems the officers with their decorations and rows of breast bars revealing how long and where theyd served and all the while the debate raged thinking back to what kathryn dance had said she asked herself and whats the truth for me go back to the land of bitter fog or stay here yes no the side doors opened and in walked two quickeyed mensecret servicefollowed by a half dozen men and women in suits or uniforms with senior staff insignias and ribbons and medals covering their chests lucy recognized a few of the bigwigs from washington and new york city though she was more stirred by the presence of the brass from the pentagon since theyd come up through the world that shed made a part of her life the wearisome debate continued within her yes no the truthwhats the truth when the officials were seated a general from new jersey made a few comments and introduced a poised handsome man in a dark blue uniform general roger poulin chairman of the joint chiefs of staff rose and walked to the microphone poulin nodded to his presenter and then to those in the room in a deep voice he said generals distinguished officials from the departments of defense and state and the city of new york fellow servicemen and women and guestsim delighted to welcome you here today to this celebration honoring eighteen brave individuals people who have risked their lives and displayed their willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice to preserve the freedom of our country and carry the cause of democracy throughout the globe applause erupted and the guests rose to their feet the noise died down and general poulin began his speech lucy richter listened at first but her attention soon faded she was looking at the civilians in the roomthe family members and guests of the soldiers people like her father and mother and husband and aunt the spouses the children the parents and grandparents the friends these people would leave after the ceremony go to their jobs or their homes theyd get back to the simple business of making their way in the world one day one hour one minute at a time her military demeanor would not of course let her smile but lucy richter could feel her face relaxing and the tension in her shoulders vanish like the bitter fog carried away on a hot wind the anger the depression the denialeverything that kathryn dance had told her to look forsuddenly were gone she closed her eyes momentarily and then turned her attention back to the man who was after the president of the united states her senior commander understanding clearly now that whatever else happened in her life her decision had been made and she was content charles hale was in the mens room of a small coffee shop not far from the hud building in a filthy stall he extracted a trash bag from beneath his undershirt he stripped off the military uniform and put on jeans sweats gloves and a jacket which hed just bought he stuffed the uniform coat and hat inside keeping the gun he took the battery and chip out of his phone and added them to the bag then waiting until the restroom was empty he stuffed it into the trash left the coffee shop and walked outside on the street again he bought a prepaid mobile phone with cash and wandered along the shadowy sidewalk until he was three blocks from hud from this vantage point he had a narrow view of the back of the building and the alley where the first victim of the watchmaker had been found he could just make out a sliver of the sixthfloor window of the conference room where the ceremonies were going on the jacket was thin and he supposed he should be cold but in the excitement of the moment he felt no discomfort he looked at his digital wristwatch which was synchronized to the timers in the bomb detonators the time was the ceremony had been under way since noon with bombs hed learned in his exhaustive research you always gave people the chance to settle in for stragglers to arrive for guards to grow lax one nice aspect of these particular bombs he reflected something fortuitous was that joanne the florist had filled the vases with hundreds of tiny glass marbles anybody not killed or badly injured by the explosives themselves would be riddled with these pellets of glass hale found himself leaning forward his weight on the balls of his feet there was always the possibility that something would go wrongthat security would make a lastminute sweep for explosives or that somebody had seen him on the video camera entering the building then leaving suspiciously after a short period of time still the risk of failure made the victory against boredom that much sweeter his eyes were riveted on the alleyway behind the hud building silently a huge fist of flame and debris shot out of the conference room window a half second later came the stunning sound of the explosion itself voices around him oh my god what screams look there whats that god no call nineoneone somebody pedestrians were clustering on the sidewalk staring a bomb an airplane concern on his face hale shook his head lingering for a moment to savor the success the explosion seemed bigger than hed anticipated the fatalities would be greater than charlotte and bud had hoped it was hard to see how anybody could have survived he turned slowly and continued up the street where he descended once more into the subway station and took the next train uptown he emerged at the station and headed toward the allertons hotel where hed pick up the rest of his payment charles hale was satisfied hed staved off boredom and had earned some good money most important though was the breathtaking elegance of what hed done hed created a plan that had worked perfectlylike clockwork he thought enjoying the selfconscious simile chapter oh thank you charlotte whispered speaking both to jesus and to the man whod made their mission a success she was sitting forward staring at the tv the special news report about the evacuation of the metropolitan museum and the halting of public transportation in the area had been replaced by a different storythe bombing at the hud building charlotte squeezed her husbands hand bud leaned over and kissed her he smiled like a young boy the news anchorwoman was grimdespite her restrained pleasure at being on duty when such a big story brokeas she gave what details there were a bomb had gone off within the housing and urban development building in lower manhattan where a number of senior government and military officials had been attending a ceremony an undersecretary of state and the head of the joint chiefs were present the cameras showed smoke pouring from the windows of a conference room the important detailthe casualty counthad not come in yet though at least fifty people were in the room where the bomb detonated a talking head popped up on the screen his complete lack of knowledge of the event didnt stop him from drawing the conclusion that this was the job of fundamentalist islamic terrorists theyd soon know differently look honey we did it charlotte called to her daughter who had remained in the bedroom lost in a book that satanic harry potter charlotte had thrown out two of them where on earth had the girl gotten another copy the girl gave an exasperated sigh and returned to the book charlotte was momentarily furious she wanted to storm into the bedroom and slap the girls face as hard as she could theyd just won a spectacular victory and the girl was showing nothing but disrespect bud had asked several times if he could take a hickory stick to the girls bare butt charlotte had demurred but she was now wondering if maybe it wasnt such a bad idea still her anger faded when she thought of their victory today she stood up we better leave she shut the tv off and continued packing a suitcase bud walked into the bedroom to do the same they were going to drive to philadelphia where theyd get a plane back to st louisduncan had told them to avoid the new york airports afterward theyd then return to the backwoods of missouri and go underground againwaiting for the next opportunity to further their cause gerald duncan would be here soon hed collect the rest of his money and leave town too she wondered if she could convert him to their cause shed spoken to him about the idea but he wasnt interested though he said hed be more than happy to help them out again if they had any particularly difficult targets and if the money was right a knock on the door duncan was right on time laughing charlotte strode to the door and flung it open you did it i but her words stopped short the smile vanished the policeman in black helmet and combat outfit pushed inside with him was amelia sachs a large black pistol in her hand her face furious eyes squinting as she scanned the room a half dozen other cops streamed in behind them police freeze freeze no charlotte wailed she twisted away but got only one step before they tackled her hard in the bedroom bud allerton gasped in shock as he heard his wife scream the harsh voices and the stomping of feet he slammed the door shut and pulled an automatic pistol from his suitcase worked the slide to put a round in the chamber no his stepdaughter cried dropping her book and scrabbling for the door quiet he whispered viciously he grabbed her by the arm she screamed as he flung her onto the bed her head hit the wall and she lay stunned bud had never liked the girl didnt like her attitude didnt like her sarcasm and her rebelliousness children were put on earth to obeygirls especiallyor suffer the consequences if they didnt he listened at the door it sounded like a dozen officers were in the living room of the suite bud didnt have much time for a prayer but those through whom god speaks can be moved to communicate with him as circumstances allow my dear lord and savior jesus christ thank you for the glory youve bestowed upon us the true believers please give me the strength to end my life and hasten my journey to you and let me send to hell as many of those as i can who have come here to transgress against you there were fifteen bullets in the clip of his pistol he could take plenty of the police with him if he remained steady and if god gave him the strength to ignore the wounds hed receive but still theyd have a lot of firepower he needed some advantage bud turned toward his sobbing stepdaughter who was clutching her bleeding head he added a coda to the prayer with a kindness that he thought was particularly generous under the circumstances and when you receive this child into heaven please forgive her her sins against you she knew not what she did he rose walked over to his stepdaughter and grabbed her by the hair is allerton in there amelia sachs shouted to charlotte nodding at the closed bedroom door she said nothing the girl downstairs the desk manager explained what suite charlotte and bud allerton along with their daughter were staying in and the layout of the place he was pretty sure they were upstairs now the clerk recognized the picture of the watchmaker and said that the man had been here several times but hadnt been back today as far as he knew wheres allerton sachs now snapped she wanted to grab the woman and shake her charlotte remained silent glaring up at the detective bathroom clear one esu officer called second bedroom clear closet clear called ron pulaski the slim officer looking nearly comical in the bulky flak jacket and helmet only the bedroom with the closed door remained sachs approached it stood to the side and motioned the other officers out of the line of fire you inside the bedroom listen im a police officer open the door no response sachs tested the knob the door was unlocked a deep breath gun up she opened the door fast and dropped into a combat shooting position sachs saw the girlthe same one whod been in charlottes car at the watchmakers first crime scene the girls hands were tied together and adhesive tape was over her mouth and nose her skin was blue and she thrashed on the bed desperate for oxygen it was a matter of seconds until she suffocated ron pulaski shouted look the windows open nodding toward the bedroom window guys getting away he started forward sachs grabbed him by the flak jacket what he asked its not secure yet she snapped she nodded to the living room check the fire escape from there see if hes outside and be careful he might be targeting the window the rookie ran to the front of the room and looked out fast he called nope mightve gotten away he radioed esu outside to check the alley behind the hotel sachs debated but she couldnt wait any longer she had to save the girl she started forward but then stopped fast despite the horrifying suffocation charlottes daughter was sending her a message she was shaking her head no which sachs took to mean that this was an ambush the daughter looked to her right indicating where allerton or somebody was hiding probably waiting to shoot sachs dropped into a crouch whoevers in the bedroom drop your weapon lie down face forward in the middle of the room now silence the poor girl thrashed eyes bulging drop the weapon now nothing several esu officers had come up one hefted a flashbang grenade designed to disorient attackers but people can still shoot if theyre deafened and blinded sachs was worried that hed hit the girl if he started pumping bullets indiscriminately she shook her head to the esu officer and aimed into the bedroom through the door she had to get him and now the child had no time left but the girl was shaking her head again she struggled to control the convulsions and looked to sachss right then down even though she was dying she was directing sachss fire sachs adjusted her aimit was much farther to the right than she would have guessed if shed fired at the place shed been inclined to a shooter wouldve known her position and possibly hit her with return fire the girl nodded still sachs hesitated was the girl really sending her this message the child was revealing discipline that few adults could muster and sachs didnt dare misinterpret it the risk of hurting an innocent was too great but then she recalled the look in the girls eyes the first time shed seen her in the car near the alley by cedar street there shed seen hope here she saw courage sachs gripped her pistol firmly and fired six rounds in a circular pattern where the girl was indicating without waiting to see what shed hit she leapt into the room esu officers behind her get the girl she shouted sweeping the area to her rightthe bathroom and closetwith her glock one esu trooper covered the room with his mp machine gun as the other officers pulled the girl to safety on the floor and ripped the tape off her face sachs heard the rasp of her desperate inhalation then sobbing sachs flung open the closet door and stepped aside as the mans corpsehit four timestumbled out she kicked aside his weapon and cleared the closet and the bathroom thennot taking any chancesthe shower stall the space under the bed and the fire escape too a minute later the entire suite was clear charlotte redfaced with fury and sobbing was sitting handcuffed on the couch and the girl was in the hallway being given oxygen by medics shed suffered no serious injuries they reported charlotte would say nothing about the watchmaker and a preliminary search of the rooms gave no indication where he might be sachs found an envelope containing cash which suggested that hed be coming here to collect a fee she radioed sellitto downstairs and had him clear the street of all emergency vehicles and set up hidden takedown teams rhyme was on his way in his van and sachs called to tell him to take the back entrance she then went into the hallway to check on the girl how you doing okay i guess my face hurts they took the tape off pretty fast ill bet yeah kinda thanks for what you did you saved lives you saved mylife the girl gazed at sachs with a curious look then glanced down the detective handed her the harry potter book shed found in the bedroom and sachs asked if the girl knew anything about the man calling himself gerald duncan he was creepy like way weird hed just look at you like you were a rock or a car or a table not a person you have any idea where he is she shook her head all i know is i heard mom say he was renting a place in brooklyn somewhere i dont know where he wouldnt say but hes coming by later to pick up some money sachs pulled pulaski aside and asked him to check all the calls to and from charlottes and buds mobile phones as well as the calls from the hotel room phone how bout the lobby phone too the pay phone i mean and the ones on the street nearby she lifted an eyebrow good idea the rookie headed off on his mission sachs got a soda and gave it to the girl she opened the can and drank down half of it fast she was looking at sachs in a strange way then she gave a laugh sachs asked what you really dont remember me do you i met you before near the alley on tuesday sure no no like a long time before that sachs squinted she recalled that she hadfelt some sense of familiarity when shed seen the girl in the car at the first crime scene in the alley and she felt it even more strongly now but she couldnt place where she mightve seen the girl prior to tuesday im afraid i dont remember you saved my life i was a little girl a long time then amelia sachs squinted turned toward the mother and studied charlotte more closely oh my god she gasped chapter inside the shabby hotel room lincoln rhyme shook his head in disbelief as sachs told him what shed just learned that they had known charlotte some years ago when shed come to new york using the pseudonym carol ganz she and her daughter whose name was pammy had been victims in the first case sachs and rhyme had worked togetherthe very one hed been thinking of earlier the kidnapper obsessed with human bones a perp as clever and ruthless as the watchmaker to pursue him rhyme had recruited sachs to be his eyes and ears and legs at the crime scenes and together theyd managed to rescue both the woman and her daughteronly to learn that carol was really charlotte willoughby she was part of a rightwing militia movement which abhorred the federal government and its involvement in world affairs after their rescue and reunion the woman managed to slip a bomb into the united nations headquarters in manhattan the explosion killed six people rhyme and sachs had taken up the case but charlotte and the girl disappeared into the movements underground probably in the midwest or west and eventually the trail went cold from time to time they would check out fbi vicap and local police reports with a militia or rightwing political angle but no leads to charlotte or pammy panned out sachss concern for the little girl never diminished though and sometimes lying in bed with rhyme at night shed wonder out loud how the girl was doing if it was too late to save her sachs whod always wanted children was horrified at the kind of life her mother was presumably forcing the girl to livehiding out having few friends her age never going to a regular schoolall in the name of some hateful cause and now charlottewith her new husband bud allertonhad returned to the city on yet another mission of terrorism and rhyme and sachs had become entwined in their lives once again charlotte now glared at rhyme her eyes filled with both tears and hatred you murdered bud you goddamn fascists you killed him the prisoner then gave a cold laugh but we won how many did we kill tonight fifty people seventyfive and how many senior people in the pentagon sachs leaned close to her face did you know thered be children in that conference room husbands and wives of the soldiers their parents grandparents did you knowthat of course we knew it charlotte said they were just sacrifices too is that right for the greater good charlotte replied which was maybe a slogan she and her group recited at the beginning of their rallies or whatever meetings they had rhyme caught sachss eye he said maybe we should show her the carnage sachs nodded and clicked on the tv an anchorwoman was on the screen one minor injury a bomb squad officer who was driving a remotecontrol robot in an attempt to defuse the bombs was wounded slightly by shrapnel hes been treated and released property damage was estimated at five hundred thousand dollars despite initial reports neither alqaeda nor any other islamic terrorist group has been implicated in the bombing according to a new york police department spokeswoman a domestic terrorist organization was responsible again if youre just joining us two bombs exploded around noon today in the office of housing and urban development in lower manhattan but there were no fatalities and only one minor injury an undersecretary of state and the head of the joint chiefs of staff were among the intended victims sachs muted the volume and turned a smug gaze toward charlotte no the woman gasped oh nowhat rhyme said obviouslywe figured it out beforethe bomb went off and evacuated the room charlotte was appalled butimpossible nothe airports were shut down the trains oh that rhyme said dismissively we just needed to buy some time at first sure i thought he was stealing the delphic mechanism but then i decided it was just a feint but that didnt mean he hadntdone something to the nist clock so while we were figuring out what he was really up to we called the mayor and had him order flights and public transportation in the area suspended you know whats going to happen if we pushthat button she glanced into the bedroom where her husband had died such a pointless death then the ideologue within her kicked in and she said in a flat voice youll never beat us you may win a battle or two but well take our country back well yo hold that rhetoric wouldja the speaker was a tall lanky black man stepping into the room this was fbi special agent fred dellray when hed heard about the domestic terrorist angle hed handed off the accounting fraud case that hed been assisting on was a yawner anyway and announced that that he was going to be the federal liaison on the hud bombing dellray was wearing a powder blue suit and a shocking green shirt underneath a brown herringbone overcoat circa the agents taste in couture was as brash as his manner he looked charlotte over well well well lookit what we caught ouselves the woman gazed back defiantly he laughed a shame youre going to jail forwell foreverand you didnt even do whatchall had your heart set on hows it feel tbe swimmin laps in the loser pool dellrays approach to interviewing suspects was a lot different from kathryn dances rhyme suspected she wouldnt approve charlotte had been arrested by sachs on state charges and it was now dellrays turn to arrest her for the federal crimesboth for this incident and for the un bombing years ago her involvement in a federal courthouse shooting in san francisco and some miscellaneous charges charlotte said she understood her rights and then started another lecture dellray wagged a finger at her gimme a minute sweetheart the lean man turned to rhyme so howd you figure this one out lincoln we heard xwe heard yall bout some boys in blue taking money they shouldnta been doin and then some bizarre fella leavin clocks as callin cardsthen next thing we know the airportsre closed and theres a priorityone security alert at hud innerupting my nap rhyme detailed the frantic process of kinesic and forensic work that led them to figure out the watchmakers real plan kathryn dance had suggested that he was lying about his mission in new york so theyd looked into the evidence again some of it pointed to the possible theft of a rare artifact in the metropolitan museum but the more he thought about it the less likely it seemed rhyme figured duncan had made up the story about the undelivered package to the met just to get them focused on the museum somebody as careful as the watchmaker wouldnt leave the trail he did he turned in vincent knowing the rapist would give up the church where hed left other museum brochures referring to the mechanism he mentioned it to hallerstein and to vincent as well no he was up to something else but what kathryn dance reviewed the interview tape again several times and decided that he might have been lying when he said he picked the supposed victims simply because their locations meant easy getaways which meant rhyme told dellray that he picked them for some other purpose so did they have anything in common rhyme had remembered something dance learned about the first crime scene ari cobb had said that the suv was originally parked in the back of the alley but then the watchmaker returned to the front to leave the body why one reason was that he needed to put the victim in a particular place what was it near the back door to the housing and urban development building rhyme had then gotten the client list from the flooring company where hed planted the fake fire extinguisher bomb and learned that theyd provided carpeting and tile for the hud offices i sent our rookie downtown to look around he found a building across cedar street that was being renovated the crews had tarred the roof a week ago just before the cold spell flakes of tar matched those found on our perps shoes the roof was a perfect place to check out hud this also explained why hed poured sand on the ground at the crime scene and swept it upto make absolutely certain they didnt find trace thatd help anyone identify him later when he came back to assemble and arm the bombs rhyme also found that the other victims had a connection to the building lucy richter was being recognized there today and shed had the specially issued passes and ids to get into all parts of the building she also had a classified memo on security and evacuation procedures as for joanne harper it turned out that shed done the flower arrangements for the ceremonya good way to smuggle something into the building a bomb i guessed we got the mayor involved and he called the press had them hold off on the story that we were evacuating hud so the perps wouldnt rabbit but the device blew before the bomb squad could disarm it rhyme shook his head just hateit when good evidence blows up you know how hard it is to lift prints off pieces of metal thatve been flying through the air at thirty thousand feet a second howdja get miss congeniality here dellray asked nodding at charlotte rhyme said dismissively that was easy she was careless if duncan was fake then the woman helping him at the first scene in the alley had to be fake too our rookie got all the tag numbers of cars in the vicinity of the alley off cedar the car the supposed sister was driving was an avis rented to charlotte allerton we checked all the hotels in the city until we found her dellray shook his head an what about yo perp mr clockmaker its watchmaker the criminalist grumbled and thats a different story he explained that charlottes daughter pam had heard that he had a place in brooklyn but she didnt know where it was no other leads dellray bent down where in brooklyn need to know and now charlotte replied defiantly youre pathetic all of you youre just lackeys for the bureaucracy in washington youre selling out the heart of our country and dellray leaned forward right into her face he clicked his tongue uhuh no politics no phi losophyall we wantre answers to the questions we all together on that fuck you was charlottes response dellray blew air through his cheeks like a trumpet player he moaned i am nomatch for this intellect rhyme wished kathryn dance was here to interrogate the woman though he guessed it would take a long time to pry information from her he eased forward in the wheelchair and said in a whisper so pam couldnt hear if you help us out i can make sure you see your daughter from time to time when youre in prison if you dont cooperate i will guarantee that you never see her again as long as you live charlotte glanced into the hallway where pam sat on a chair defiantly clutching her harry potter the darkhaired girl was pretty with fragile features but very slim she wore faded jeans and a dark blue sweatshirt the skin around her eyes was dark she clicked her fingernails together compulsively the girl seemed needy in a hundred different ways charlotte turned back to rhyme then ill never see her again she said calmly dellray blinked at this his usually unrevealing face tightening in revulsion rhyme himself could think of nothing more to say to the woman it was then that ron pulaski came running into the room he paused to catch his breath what rhyme asked it took a moment for him to be able to answer finally he said the phonesthe watchmaker out with it ron sorry a deep breath we couldnt trace his mobile but a hotel clerk saw her charlotte making calls around midnight every night over the past four or five days i called the phone company i got the number she called they traced it its to a pay phone in brooklyn at this intersection he handed the slip of paper to sellitto who relayed it to bo haumann and esu good job sellitto said to pulaski he called the deputy inspector of the precinct where the phone was located officers would start a canvass of the neighborhood as soon as mel cooper emailed pictures of the composite to the di rhyme supposed that the watchmaker might not live near the phoneit wouldnt have surprised the criminalistbut a mere thirty minutes later they had a positive identification from a patrol officer who found several neighbors who recognized the man sellitto took the number and alerted bo haumann sachs announced ill call in from the scene hold on rhyme said glancing at her why dont you sit this one out let bo handle it what theyll have a full tactical force rhyme was thinking of the superstition that cops on short time were more likely to get killed or injured than others rhyme didnt believe in superstitions that didnt matter he didnt want her to go amelia sachs would be thinking the same thing perhaps she was debating it seemed then he saw her looking into the hallway at pam willoughby she turned back to the criminalist their eyes met he gave a faint smile and nodded she grabbed her leather jacket and headed for the door in a quiet neighborhood in brooklyn a dozen tactical officers moved slowly along the sidewalk another six creeping through an alley behind a shabby detached house this was a neighborhood of modest houses in small yards presently filled with christmas decorations the minuscule size of the lots had no effect on the owners ability to populate the land with as many santas reindeer and elves as possible sachs was walking down the sidewalk slowly at the head of the takedown team she was on the radio with rhyme were here she said softly whats the story weve cleared the houses on either side and behind theres nobody opposite a community vegetable garden was across the street a ragged scarecrow sat in the middle of the tiny lot across his chest was a swirl of graffiti pretty good site for a takedown werehold on rhyme a light had gone on in one of the front rooms the cops around her stopped and crouched she whispered hes still here im signing off go get him sachs she heard an unusual determination in his voice she knew he was upset that the man had escaped saving the people at the hud building and capturing charlotte were fine but rhyme wasnt happy unless all the perps ended up in cuffs but he wasnt as determined as amelia sachs she wanted to give rhyme the watchmakeras a present to mark their last case together she changed radio frequencies and said into her stalk mike detective five eight eight five to esu one bo haumann at a staging area a block away came on the radio go ahead k hes here just saw a light go on in the front room roger b team you copy these were the officers behind the bungalow b team leader to esu one roger that werehold on okay hes upstairs now just saw the light go on up there looks like the back bedroom dont assume hes alone sachs said there could be somebody

just getting into position on the roof of the apartment building behind and in the garden across the street from the watchmakers safe house on which they were training their instruments s and s one to

pulled the right one away and blew into it did the same with the left then she cinched up the body armor and unsnapped the cover of her spare ammo clip carrier the other officers had machine guns but sachs never went for that she preferred the elegance of a single wellplaced round to a spray of lead sachs and the three officers on the primary entry team nodded at one another haumanns raspy voice began the count sixfivefourthree the sound of breaking glass filled the crisp air as officers flung the grenades through the windows haumann continuing calmly twoone the sharp crack of the flashbangs shook the windows and bursts of white light filled the house momentarily the burly officer with the battering ram slammed it into the front door it crashed open without resistance and in a few seconds the officers were spreading out in the sparsely furnished house flashlight in one hand gun in the other sachs stayed with her team as they worked their way up the stairs she began hearing the voices of the other officers calling in as they cleared the basement and the rooms on the ground floor one upstairs bedroom was empty the second as well then all the rooms were declared clear where the hell is he sachs muttered always an adventure huh somebody asked invisible fucking perp came another voice then in her earpiece she heard s and s one light in the attic just went out hes up there in the small bedroom toward the back they found a trapdoor in the ceiling a thick string hanging from it a pulldown stair an officer shut out the light in this room so it would be harder to target them they stood back and pointed their guns at the door as sachs gripped the string and pulled hard it creaked downward revealing a folding ladder the team leader shouted you in the attic come down now do you hear me this is your last chance nothing he said flashbang an officer pulled one off his belt and nodded the team leader put his hand on the ladder but sachs shook her head ill take him are you sure you want to sachs nodded only let me borrow a helmet she took one and strapped it on were set detective lets do it sachs climbed up near the topthen took the flashbang she pulled the pin and closed her eyes so the flash from the grenade wouldnt blind her and also to acclimate her eyes to the darkness of the attic okay here we go she pitched the grenade into the attic and lowered her head three seconds later it detonated and sachs opening her eyes charged the rest of the way up the ladder into the small area filled with a haze of smoke and the smell of explosive residue from the flashbang she rolled away from the opening clicking on her flashlight and sweeping it in a circle as she moved to a post the only cover she could find nothing to the right nothing center nothing it was then that she fell off the face of the earth the floor wasnt wood at all like it seemed but cardboard over insulating crud her right leg crashed through the sheetrock of the bedroom ceiling gripping her immobile she cried out in pain detective somebody called sachs lifted the light and the gun in the only direction she could seestraight in front of her the killer wasnt there which meant he was behind her it was at that moment that the overhead light clicked on almost directly above her making her a perfect target she struggled to turn around awaiting the sharp crack of a gun the numb slam of the bullet into her head or neck or back sachs thought of her father she thought of lincoln rhyme you and me sachs then she decided no way was she going out without getting a piece of him she took the pistol in her teeth and used both hands to wrench herself around and find a target she heard boots on the ladder as an esu officer charged up to help her of course thatswhat the watchmaker was waiting fora chance to kill more of the officers he was using her as bait to draw other cops to their deaths and hoped to escape in the chaos look out she called gripping her pistol in her hand hes where is he the a team leader asked the man was crouching at the top of the stairs he hadnt heard heror hadnt listenedand had sped up the ladder followed by two other officers they were scanning the roomincluding the area behind sachs her heart pounding furiously she struggled to look over her shoulder she asked you dont see him hes gotta be there zip he and another officer bent down gripped her body armor and pulled her out of the sheetrock crouching she spun around the room was empty howd he get out the esu officer muttered no doors or windows sachs noticed something across the room she gave a sour laugh he was never here at all not up here not downstairs he probably took off hours ago but the lights somebodywas turning them on and off nope take a look she pointed to a small beige box connected to the fusebox he wanted to make us think he was still here give him a better chance to get away what is it what else its a timer chapter sachs finished searching the scene at the house in brooklyn and sent what little evidence she could find to rhymes she stripped off her tyvek outfit and pulled her jacket on then hurried through the cutting chill to sellittos car in the back sat pam willoughby clutching her harry potter book and sipping hot chocolate which the big detective had scrounged for her he was still in the perps safe house finishing up the paperwork sachs climbed in sat beside her at kathryn dances suggestion theyd brought the girl here to examine the place and the watchmakers possessions in hopes that something might trigger a memory but the man hadnt left much behind and in any event nothing pammy saw gave her any more insights about him smiling sachs looked the girl over remembering that strange expression of hope when shed seen her in the rental car at the first scene the policewoman said ive thought about you a lot over the years me too the girl said looking down into her cup where did you go after new york we went back to missouri and hid out in the woods mom left me with other people a lot mostly i just stayed by myself and read i didnt get along very good with anybody they were crappy to me if you didnt think the way they didwhich was pretty messed upthey totally dissed you a lot of them were homeschooling people but i really wanted to go to public school and i made a big deal out of it bud didnt want me to but mom finally agreed but she said if i told anybody about her what shed done id go to jail too as an assistantno an accomplice and men would do stuff to me there you know what im talking about oh honey sachs squeezed her hand amelia sachs wanted children badly and knew that one way or another they were in her future she was appalled that a mother had put her child through this and sometimes when it got real bad id think about you and pretend you were my mother i didnt know your name maybe i heard it back then but i couldnt remember so i gave you another one artemis from this book i read about mythology she was the goddess of the hunt because you killed that mad dogthe one that was attacking me she looked down its a stupid name no no its a wonderful name i love it you recognized me in the alleyway tuesday didnt you when you were in the car yeah i think you were meant to be thereto save me again dont you think things like that happen no sachs didnt but she said life works in funny ways sometimes a city car pulled up and a social worker sachs knew climbed out and joined them whoa the woman a pretty africanamerican rubbed her hands together in front of the heater vent its not even winter yet officially this isnt fair shed been making arrangements for the girl and she now explained weve found a couple real nice foster families theres one in riverdale ive known for years youll stay there for the next few days while we see if we can track down some of your relatives pammy was frowning can i get a new name a new i dont want to be me anymore and i dont want my mother to talk to me again and i dont want any of those people shes with to find me sachs preempted whatever the social worker was going to say well make sure nothing happens to you thats a promise pammy hugged her so i can see you again sachs asked trying to contain her excitement at this the girl said i guess if you want how bout shopping tomorrow okay sure good its a date sachs had an idea hey you like dogs yeah some folks i stayed with in missouri had one i liked him better than the people she called thom at rhymes town house got a question go ahead any takers on jackson yet nope hes still up for adoption take him off the market sachs said she hung up and looked at pam ive got an early christmas present for you sometimes even the bestdesigned watches simply dont work the devices really are quite fragile when you think about it five hundred a thousand minuscule moving parts nearly microscopic screws and springs and jewels all precisely assembled dozens of separate movements working in unison a hundred things can go wrong sometimes the watchmaker miscalculates sometimes a tiny piece of metal is defective sometimes the owner winds the mechanism too tight sometimes he drops it moisture gets under the crystal then again the watch might work perfectly in one environment but not in another even the famed rolex oyster perpetual revolutionary for being the first luxury divers watch cant withstand unlimited pressure underwater now near central park charles vespasian hale sat in his own car which hed driven here from san diegono trail at all if you pay cash for gas and avoid toll roadsand wondered what had gone wrong with his plan he supposed the answer was the police specifically lincoln rhyme hale had done everything he could think of to anticipate his moves but the former cop managed to end up just a bit ahead of him rhyme had done exactly what hale had been worried abouthed looked at a few gears and levers and extrapolated from them how hales entire timepiece had been constructed hed have plenty of time to consider what went wrong and to try to avoid the same problems in the future hed be driving back to california leaving immediately he glanced at his face in the rearview mirror hed dyed his hair back to its natural color and the pale blue contact lenses were gone but the collagen which gave him the thick nose and puffy cheeks and double chin hadnt bled from his skin yet and it would takes months before he regained the forty pounds hed lost for the job and became himself again he felt pasty and sluggish after all this time in the city and needed to get back to his wilderness and mountains once again yes hed failed but as he told vincent reynolds that wasnt significant in the great scheme of things he wasnt concerned about the arrest of charlotte allerton they knew nothing of his real identity theyd believed all along his real name was duncan and their initial contacts had been through extremely discreet individuals moreover there was actually a positive side to the failure herehale had learned something that had changed his life hed created the persona of the watchmaker simply because the character seemed spooky and would snag the attention of a populace and police turned on by madefortv criminals but as he got into the role hale found to his surprise that this character was the embodiment of his true personality playing the part was like coming home he had indeed grown fascinated with watches and clocks and time hed also developed an abiding interest in the delphic mechanism stealing it at some point in the future was a distinct possibility the watchmaker charles hale was himself simply a timepiece you could use a watch for something joyous like checking contractions for the birth of a baby or heinous coordinating the time of a raid to slaughter women and children time transcends morality he now looked down at what sat on the seat next to him the gold breguet pocket watch in his gloved hands he picked it up wound it slowlyalways better to underwind than overand carefully slipped it between the sheets of bubble wrap in a large white envelope hale sealed the selfadhesive flap and started the car there were no clear leads rhyme sellitto cooper and pulaski were sitting in the lab on central park west going over the few things found in the perps brooklyn safe house amelia sachs was not present at the moment she hadnt announced where she was going but she didnt need to shed mentioned to thom that shed be nearby if they needed herat a meeting on fiftyseventh and sixth rhyme had checked the phone directory that was the location of the argyle security headquarters rhyme simply couldnt think about that and he was concentrating on how to continue the search for the watchmaker whoever he might be working backward rhyme constructed a rough scenario of the events the ceremony had been announced on october so carol and bud had contacted the watchmaker sometime around then hed come to new york around november the date of the lease on the brooklyn safe house a few weeks later amelia sachs had taken over the creeley case and soon after baker and wallace decided to have her killed then they hooked up with the watchmaker whatd he tell us when we thought he was duncan about their meeting sellitto said just that somebody at the club put them togetherthe club where baker put the touch on his friend but he was lying there was no club rhyme shook his head somebody put them together somebody who knows the watchmakerprobably somebody in the area if we can find them there could be some solid leads is baker talking nope not a word nobody is the rookie was shaking his head thats going to be a tough one i mean how many oc crews are there in the metro area take forever to track down the right one not like theyre going to be volunteering to help us out the criminalist frowned whatre you talking about whats an organized crime posse got to do with anything well i just assumed somebody with an oc connection was the one whod put them together why baker wants to have a cop killed right but he cant do it in a way thatll make him look suspicious so he has to hire somebody he goes to some mob connection he has the mobs not going to clip a cop so he puts baker in touch with somebody who might the watchmaker when nobody said anything pulaski blushed and looked down i dont know just a thought and a fucking good one kid sellitto said really rhyme nodded not badlets call the oc task force downtown and see if their snitches can tell us anything call dellray toonow lets get back to the evidence theyd located some friction ridges in the safe house in brooklyn but none of the fingerprints came back positive from the bureaus iafis system and none matched prints from prior scenes the lease for the house had been executed under yet another fake name and the man had given a phony prior address it had been a cash transaction an exhaustive search of internet activity in the neighborhood revealed that the man had apparently logged on occasionally through several nearby wireless networks there were no records of emails only web browsing the site hed visited most often was a bookstore that sold continuingeducation course texts for certain medical specialties sellitto said shit maybe somebody elses hired him you bet rhyme thought nodding hell be targeting another victimor victims probably coming up with his plan right now think of the damage he could do pretending to be a doctor and i let him get away an examination of the trace evidence sachs had collected revealed little more than shearling fibers and a few bits of a green vegetative material containing evaporated seawaterwhich didnt it turned out match the seaweed and ocean water found around robert wallaces boat on long island the deputy inspector at the brooklyn precinct called to report that further canvassing of the neighborhood had been useless a half dozen people remembered seeing the watchmaker but nobody knew anything about him as for charlotte and her late husband bud allerton the investigative efforts were much more successful the couple had not been nearly as careful as the watchmaker sachs had found a great deal of evidence about the underground militia groups theyd been harbored by including a large one in missouri and the infamous patriot assembly in upstate new york which rhyme and sachs had tangled with in the past phone calls fingerprints and emails would give the fbi and local police plenty of leads to pursue the doorbell rang and thom left the room to answer it a moment later he returned with a woman in a military uniform this would be lucy richter the watchmakers fourth victim rhyme noted that she was more surprised at the forensic lab in his town house than his disability then it occurred to him that this was a woman involved in a type of combat where bombs were the weapon of choice shed undoubtedly seen missing limbs and para and quadriplegia of all sorts rhymes condition didnt faze her she explained that shed called kathryn dance not long ago to say she wanted to speak to the investigators the california detective had suggested she call or stop by rhymes thom zipped in and offered her coffee or tea normally piqued about visitors and reluctant to give anyone an incentive to linger rhyme now to the contrary glared at the aide she might be hungry thom or might want something more substantial scotch for instance theres just no figuring you out thom said didnt know there was an armed forces hospitality rule in the lincoln rhyme edition of emily post thanks but nothing for me lucy said i cant stay long first i want to thank you for saving my lifetwice actually sellitto pointed out you werent in any danger the first time he was never going to hurt youor any of the victims the second time well okay acceptedsince he wanted to blow the conference room to smithereens my family was there too she said i cant thank you enough rhyme was as always uneasy with the gratitude though he nodded with what he thought was an appropriate acknowledgment the other reason is that i found out something that might be helpful ive been talking to my neighbors about when he broke in one man he lives three buildings down the street told me something he said that yesterday he was getting a delivery at the back of the building and he found a rope dangling into the alley from the roof you can get there from my roof pretty easily i was thinking that maybe that was how he escaped interesting rhyme said but theres something else my husband took a look bob was a navy seal for two years navy and youre army pulaski asked laughing she smiled we have someinteresting discussions from time to time especially during football season anyway he looked at the rope and said whoever tied it knew what he was doing it was a rare knot used in abseilingyou know rappelling its called a dead mans knot you dont see it much in this country mostly in europe he mustve had some experience rock climbing or mountaineering overseas ah some hard information rhyme glanced darkly at pulaski a shame the victimhad to find the evidence dont you think that really is in ourjob description he turned toward lucy the ropes still there yes goodyou in town for a while rhyme asked if we catch him we might need you to testify at his trial im going back overseas soon but im sure i can come back for a trial i could get a special leave for that how long will you be there i reenlisted for two years you did sellitto asked i wasnt going to its tough over there but i decided to go back because of the bomb at the ceremony no it was just before that i was looking at the families and the other soldiers there and thinking its funny how life puts you in places you never thought youd be but there you are and youre doing something good and important and basically it just feels right so she pulled on her jacket if you need me ill get a leave home they said goodbye and thom saw her out the door when he returned rhyme told the aide add that to the profile a rock climber or mountaineer possibly european trained to pulaski rhyme said and have somebody from the cs unit go collect the rope that you missed in the first place actually i wasnt really the one who searched and then find a climbing expert i want to know where he mightve trained and run the rope too whered he buy it and when yessir fifteen minutes later the doorbell rang again and thom returned with kathryn dance the white ipod earbuds dangling over her shoulders she greeted everyone she was holding a white eightandahalfbyeleven envelope hi said pulaski rhyme lifted an eyebrow in greeting im on my way to the airport dance explained just wanted to say goodbye oh this was on the doorstep she handed the envelope to thom the aide glanced at it no return address frowning lets be safe rhyme said the basket sellitto took the envelope and walked to a large bin that was made out of woven steel stripslike a wicker laundry hamper he set the envelope inside and clamped the lid shut as a matter of course any unidentified packages went into the bomb basket which was designed to diffuse the force of a smalltomediumsized improvised explosive device it contained sensors that would pick up any trace of nitrates and other common explosives the computer sniffed the vapors emanating from the envelope and reported that it wasnt a bomb wearing latex gloves cooper retrieved and examined it the envelope bore a computergenerated label reading only lincoln rhyme selfsticking the tech added with a resigned grimace criminalists preferred oldstyle envelopes that perps had to lick the adhesive was a good source of dna cooper added that he was familiar with the brand of envelope it was sold in stores all over the country and virtually untraceable rhyme wheeled closer and with dance beside him watched the tech extract a pocket watch and a note also the product of a computer printer its from him cooper announced the envelope had been there for no more than a quarter of an hourthe time between lucy richters departure and dances arrival sellitto called central to have some cars from the nearby twentieth precinct sweep the neighborhood cooper emailed the watchmakers composite to the house the timepiece was ticking and showed the accurate time it was gold and there were several small dials set in the face heavy cooper said he pulled on magnifying goggles and examined it closely looks old signs of wearno personalized engravings he took a camel hair brush and dusted the watch over a piece of newsprint the envelope too no trace was dislodged heres the note lincoln he mounted it on an overhead projector dear mr rhyme i will be gone by the time you receive this i have by now of course learned that none of the attendees at the conference was injured i concluded you had anticipated my plans i then anticipated yours and delayed my trip to charlottes hotel which gave me the chance to spot your officers i assume you saved her daughter i am pleased about that she deserves better than that pair so congratulations i thought the plan was perfect but i was apparently wrong the pocket watch is a breguet it is the favorite of the many timepieces i have come across it was made in the early s and features a ruby cylinder escapement perpetual calendar and parachute antishock device i hope you appreciate the phasesofthemoon window in light of our recent adventures there are few specimens like this watch in the world i give it to you as a present out of respect no one has ever stopped me from finishing a job youre as good as they get i would say youre as good as i but that is not quite true you did not after all catch me keep the breguet wound but gently it will be counting the time until we meet again some advice if i were you i would make every one of those seconds count the watchmaker sellitto grimaced what rhyme asked you get classier threats than me linc usually my perps just say im gonna kill you and what the hell is that he pointed to the note a semicolon hes threatening you and hes using semicolons thats fucked up rhyme didnt laugh he was still furious about the mans escapeand furious too that he apparently had no desire to retire when you get tired of making bad jokes lon you might want to notice that his grammar and syntax are perfect that tells us something else about him good education private school classically trained scholarships valedictorian put those on the chart thom sellitto was unfazed fucking semicolons got something here cooper said looking up from the computer the green material from his place in brooklyn im pretty sure its caulerpa taxifolia a noxious weed a what its a seaweed that spreads uncontrollably causes all kinds of problems its been banned in the us and presumably if it spreads you can find it everywhere rhyme said sourly useless as evidence actually no cooper explained so far its been found only on the pacific coast of north america mexico to canada pretty much rhyme added sarcastically thats virtually a street address call out the swat team it was then that kathryn dance frowned the west coast she considered something for a moment then she asked wheres the interview with him mel cooper found the file he hit playand for the dozenth time they watched the killer look into the camera and lie to them all dance leaned forward intently she reminded rhyme of himself gazing at evidence hed been through the interview so often he was numb to the words it provided nothing helpful now that he could tell but dance gave a sudden laugh got a thought what well i cant give you an address but i can give you a state my guess is that he comes from california or lived there for some time why do you think that she backed up with the rewind command then played part of the interview again the portion where he talked about driving to long island to take delivery of the confiscated suv dance stopped the tape and said ive studied regional expressions people in california usually refer to their interstate highways with the article the thefourohfive in la for instance in the interview he referred to the four ninetyfive here in new york and did you hear him say freeway thats common in california too more so than expresswayor interstatewhich is what you hear on the east coast possibly helpful rhyme thought another brick in the wall of evidence on the chart he said when i get back ill open a formal investigation in my office she said ill put out everything weve got statewide well see what happens okay i better be going oh ill be expecting you both out in california sometime soon the aide glanced at rhyme he needs to travel more he pretends he doesnt like to but the fact is once he gets someplace he enjoys it as long as theres scotch and some good crime to keep him interested its northern california dance said wine country mostly but not to worry we have plenty of crime well see rhyme said noncommittally then he added but one thingdo me a favor sure shut your cell phone off ill probably be tempted to call you again on the way to the airport if something else comes up if i didnt have the children to get back to i might just pick up sellitto thanked her again and thom saw her out the door rhyme said ron make yourself useful the rookie looked at the evidence tables i already called about the rope if thats what you mean no thats notwhat i mean rhyme muttered i said useful he nodded at the bottle of scotch sitting on a shelf across the room oh sure make it two sellitto grumbled and dont be stingy pulaski poured the whiskey and handed out two glassescooper declined rhyme said to the rookie dont neglect yourself oh im in uniform sellitto choked a laugh okay maybe just a little he poured and then sipped the potentand extremely expensiveliquor i like it he said though his eyes were telling a different story say you ever mix in a little ginger ale or sprite chapter before and after people move on for one reason or another they move on and before becomes after lincoln rhyme heard these words floating through his head over and over broken record people move on hed actually used the phrase himselfwhen hed told his wife he wanted a divorce not long after his accident their relationship had been rocky for some time and he had decided that whether or not he survived the broken neck he was going to go forward on his own and not tie her down to the difficult life of a gimps wife but back then moving on meant something very different from what rhyme was facing now the life hed constructed over the past few years a precarious life was about to change in a big way the problem of course was that by going to argyle security sachs wasnt really moving on she was moving back sellitto and cooper were gone and rhyme and pulaski were alone in the downstairs lab parked in front of an examination table organizing evidence in the th precinct scandal cases finally confronted with the evidenceand the fact theyd unwittingly hired a domestic terroristbaker wallace and henson copped pleas and were diming out everybody involved at the th though nobody would say a word about whod hooked the watchmaker up with baker understandable you simply dont give up the name of a senior member of an oc crew when youre headed off to the same prison he might end up in thanks to your testimony preparing himself for sachss departure rhyme had concluded that ron pulaski would eventually be a fine crime scene cop he had ingenuity and intelligence and was as dogged as lon sellitto rhyme could wear the rough edges off him in eight months or a year together he and the rookie would run scenes analyze evidence and find perps whod go to jail or die trying not to the system would keep going the process of policing was bigger than just one man or woman it had to be yes the system would keep going but it was impossibly hard toimagine that system without amelia sachs well fuck the goddamn sentiment rhyme said to himself and get back to work he glanced at the evidence board the watchmakers out there somewhere im going to find him he isnotgettingaway what pulaski asked i didnt say anything rhyme snapped yeah you did i justhe fell silent under rhymes withering glare returning to his tasks pulaski asked the notes i found in bakers office theyre on cheap paper should i use ninhydrin to raise the latents rhyme started to respond a womans voice said no first you try iodine fuming thenninhydrin thensilver nitrate you have to do it in that order rhyme looked up to see sachs in the doorway he slapped a benign look on his face putting on a good front he praised himself being generousbeing mature she continued if not the chemicals can react and you can ruin the prints well thisis awkward the criminalist thought angrily he stared at the evidence boards as the silence between them roared like the december wind outside she said im sorry unusual to hear those words from her the woman apologized about as often as lincoln rhyme did which was close to never rhyme didnt respond he kept his eyes on the charts really im sorry irritated at the greeting card sentiment he glanced sideways frowning barely able to control his anger but he saw that she wasnt speaking to him her eyes were fixed on pulaski ill make it up to you somehow you can run the next scene ill be copilot or the next couple of scenes hows that the rookie asked i know you heard i was leaving he nodded but ive changed my mind youre not quitting pulaski asked no hey not a problem pulaski said wouldnt mind sharing the job for a little while more you know his relief at not being the only ant under lincoln rhymes magnifying glass clearly outweighed any disappointment at getting busted back down to assistant sachs tugged a chair around to face rhyme he said i thought you were at argyle i was to turn them down can i ask why i got a call from suzanne creeley ben creeleys wife she thanked me for believing her for finding out whod really killed her husband she was crying she told me that she just couldnt bear the thought that her husband had killed himself murder was terrible but a suicidethat wouldve undermined everything theyd had together over the years sachs shook her head a knot in a rope and a broken thumbi realized that thats what this job is all about rhyme not the crap i got caught up in the politics my father baker and wallaceyou cant make it too complicated being a cop is about finding the truth behind a knot and a broken thumb nothing more than that you and me sachs so she asked matteroffact as she nodded toward the boards our bad boyanything new on him rhyme told her about his present the breguet then summarized a rock or mountain climber possibly trained in europe hes spent time in california near the shore and hes been there recently may live there now good education uses proper grammar syntax and punctuation and i want to go over every gear in the watch again hes a watch makerright that means hes probably taken the back off to poke around inside if theres a molecule of trace i want it rhyme nodded at the mans note and added he admits he was watching charlottes hotel around the time we collared her i want every vantage point where he mightve been standing searched youre recruited for that one ron got it and dont forget what we know about him maybe hes gone and maybe he isnt make sure your weapons in reach outsidethe tyvek remember search well but watch my back pulaski asked an afor retention the criminalist said now get to work iv pm monday what then is time if no one asks me i know what it is if i wish to explain it to him who asks i do not know saint augustine chapter the december day wasnt particularly cold but the ancient furnace in rhymes town house was on the fritz and everyone in his ground floor lab huddled in thick jackets clouds of steam blew from their mouths with every exhalation and extremities were bright red amelia sachs wore two sweaters and pulaski was in a padded green jacket from which dangled killington ski lift tickets like a veteran soldiers campaign medals a skier cop rhyme reflected that seemed odd though he couldnt say why exactly maybe something about the dangers of hurtling down a mountain with a hairtrigger millimeter pistol under your bunny suit wheres the furnace repair guy rhyme snapped to his aide he said hell be here between one and five thom was wearing a tweed jacket which rhyme had given him last christmas and a dark purple cashmere scarf which had been one of sachss presents ah between one and five one and five tell you what call him back and thats what he told no listen call him back and tell him we got a report theres a crazed killer loose in his neighborhood and well be there to catch him between one and five see how he likes them apples lincoln the patient aide said i dont does he know what we do here does he know that we serve and protect call him and tell him that pulaski noted that thom wasnt reaching for the phone he asked uhm you want me to call i mean ah the sincerity of youth thom replied to the young officer dont pay him any attention hes like a dog jumping up on you ignore him and hell stop a dog rhyme asked im a dog thats a bit ironic isnt it thom since here youare biting the hand that feeds you pleased with the retort he added tell the repairman i think im suffering from hypothermia i really think i am by the way so you can feel the rookie asked his question braking to a halt yes i goddamn well canfeel uncomfortable pulaski sorry wasnt thinking hey thom said laughing congratulations whats that the rookie asked youve graduated to lastname basis hes beginning to think of you as a step above a slug thats how he refers to the people he really likes i for instance am merely thom forever thom but sachs said to the rookie tell him youre sorry again and youll be demoted the doorbell sounded a moment later and firstname thom went to answer it rhyme glanced at the clock the time was could it be that a repairman was actually prompt but of course this wasnt the case it was lon sellitto who walked inside started to take his coat off then changed his mind he glanced at his breath billowing from his mouth jesus linc with what the city coughs up for you you can afford to pay your heating bill you know is that coffee is it hot thom poured him a cup and sellitto clutched it in one hand as he opened his briefcase with the other finally got it he nodded at what he now extracted an old redweld folder disfigured with faded ink and pencil notations many of the entries crossed out evidence of years of frugal municipal government reuse the luponte file rhyme asked thats it i wanted it last week the criminalist grumbled the inside of his nose stinging from the cold maybe hed tell the repairman hed pay the bill in one to five months he glanced at the folder id almost given up i know how much you love clichãs lon does the phrase day late and a dollar short come to mind naw the detective said amiably the one im thinking of is if you do somebody a favor and they complain then fuck em thats a good one conceded lincoln rhyme anyway you didnt tell me how classified it was i had to find that out on my own and i needed ron scott to track it down rhyme was staring at the detective as he opened the file and browsed through it he felt an acute sense of uneasiness wondering what he would find inside could be good could be devastating there should be an official report find it sellitto dug through the folder he held up the document on the cover was an old typewritten label that read anthony c luponte deputy commissionerthe folder was sealed with a fading piece of red tape that said classified should i open it he asked rhyme rolled his eyes linc tell me when the good moods going to kick in will you put it on the turning frame please and thank you sellitto ripped open the tape and handed the booklet to thom the aide mounted the report in a device like a cookbook holder to which was attached a rubber armature that turned the pages when instructed by a tiny movement from rhymes finger on his ecu touch pad he now began to flip through the document reading and trying to quell the tension within him luponte sachs looked up from an evidence table another page turned thats it he kept reading paragraph after paragraph of dense city government talk oh come on he thought angrily get to the goddamn point would the message be good or bad something about the watchmaker sachs asked so far thered been no leads to the man either in new york or in california where kathryn dance had started her own investigation rhyme said it doesnt have anything to do with him sachs shook her head but thats why you wanted it no you assumedthats why i wanted it whats it about then one of the other cases she asked her eyes went to the evidence boards which revealed the progress of several cold cases theyd been investigating not those then what i could tell you a lot sooner if i wasnt interrupted so much sachs sighed at last he came to the section he sought he paused looked out the window at the stark brown branches populating central park he believed in his heart that the report would tell him what he wanted to hear but lincoln rhyme was a scientist before all else and distrusted the heart truth is the only goal what truths would the words reveal to him he looked back at the frame and read the passage quickly then again after a moment he said to sachs i want to read you something okay im listening his right finger moved on the touch pad and the pages flipped back this is from the first page listening i said i was good this proceeding is and shall be kept secret from june eighteenth to june twentyninth ninety seventyfour a dozen new york city police officers were indicted by a grand jury for extorting money from shopkeepers and businessmen in manhattan and brooklyn and accepting bribes to fail to pursue criminal investigations additionally four officers were indicted for assault pursuant to these acts of extortion those twelve officers were members of what was known as the sixteenth avenue club a name that has become synonymous with the heinous crime of police corruption rhyme heard sachs take a fast breath he looked up and found her staring at the file the way a child stares at a snake in the backyard he continued reading there is no trust greater than that between the citizens of these united states and the law enforcement officers who are charged with protecting them the officers of the sixteenth avenue club committed an inexcusable breach of this sacred trust and not only perpetuated the crimes they were meant to prevent but brought inestimable shame upon their courageous and selfsacrificing brothers and sisters in uniform accordingly i the mayor of the city of new york hereby bestow upon the following officers the medal for valor for their efforts in bringing these criminals to justice patrolman vincent pazzini patrolman herman sachs and detective thirdgrade lawrence koepel what sachs whispered rhyme continued reading each of these officers risked his life on a number of occasions by working undercover to provide information instrumental in identifying the perpetrators and gathering evidence to be used in their trials because of the dangerous nature of this assignment these commendations are being presented in a closed proceeding and this record will be sealed for the safety of these three courageous officers and their families but they should rest assured that although the praises for their efforts are not being sung in public the gratitude of the city is no less amelia sachs was staring at him he rhyme nodded at the file your father was one of the good guys sachs he wasone of the three who got away only they werent perps they were working for internal affairs he was to the sixteenth avenue club just what you were to the st james crew only he was undercover how did you know i didnt know i remembered something about the luponte report and the corruption trials but i didnt know your father was involved thats why i wanted to see it how bout that sellitto said through a mouthful of coffee cake keep looking lon theres something else the detective dug through the folder and found a certificate and a medal it was an nypd medal for valor one of the highest commendations given by the department sellitto handed it to sachs her full lips parted eyes squinting as she read the unframed parchment document which bore her fathers name the decoration swung from her unsteady fingers hey thats sweet said pulaski pointing at the certificate look at all those scrolls and things rhyme nodded toward the folder on the turning frame its all in there sachs his handler at internal affairs had to make sure that the other cops believed him he gave your dad a couple thousand a month to spread around make it seem like he was on the take too he had to be credibleif anybody thought he was an informant he couldve been killed especially with tony gallante involved iad started a fake investigation on him so itd look believable thats the case they dropped for insufficient evidence they worked out a deal with crime scene so that the chainofcustody cards were lost sachs lowered her head then she gave a soft laugh dad was always the modest one it was just like himthe highest commendation he ever got was secret he never said a thing about it you can read all the details your father said hed wear a wire hed give all the information they needed about gallante and the other capos involved but hed never testify in open court he wasnt going to jeopardize you and your mother she was staring at the medal which swung back and forthlike a pendulum of a clock rhyme thought wryly finally lon sellitto rubbed his hands together listen glad for the happy news he grumbled but how bout we get the hell out of here and go over to mannys i could use some lunch and guess what ill bet theypay their heating bill id love to rhyme said with a sincerity that he believed masked his absolute lack of desire to be outside negotiating the icy streets in his wheelchair but im writing an op ed piece for the times he nodded at his computer besides i have to wait here for the repairman he shook his head one to five thom started to say somethingundoubtedly to urge rhyme to go anywaybut it was sachs who said sorry other plans rhyme said if it involves ice and snow im not interested he supposed she and the girl pammy willoughby were planning another outing with the girls adoptee jackson the havanese but amelia sachs apparently had a different agenda it does she said involve snow and ice i mean she laughed and kissed him on the mouth but what it doesnt involve is you thank god lincoln rhyme said blowing a stream of wispy breath toward the ceiling and turning back to the computer screen you hey detective how you doing amelia sachs asked art snyder gazed at her from the doorway of his bungalow he looked better than when shed seen him lastwhen he was lying in the backseat of his van he wasnt any less angry though his red eyes were fixed on hers but when your profession involves getting shot at from time to time a few glares mean nothing sachs gave a smile i just came by to say thanks yeah for what he held a coffee mug that clearly didnt contain coffee she saw that a number of bottles had reappeared on the sideboard she noted too that none of the home depot projects had progressed we closed the st james case yeah i heard kind of cold out here detective she said honey a stocky woman with short brown hair and a cheerful resilient face called from the kitchen doorway just somebody from department well invite her in ill make coffee shes a busy lady snyder said sourly running all over town doing all kinds of things asking questions she probably cant stay im freezing my ass off out here art let her in he sighed turned and walked inside leaving sachs to follow him and close the door herself she dropped her coat on a chair snyders wife joined them the women shook hands give her the comfy chair art she scolded sachs sat in the wellworn barcalounger snyder on the couch which sighed under his weight he left the volume up on the tv which displayed a frantic highdefinition basketball game his wife brought two cups of coffee none for me snyder said looking at the mug ive already poured it you want me to throw it out waste good coffee she left it on the table beside him and returned to the kitchen where garlic was frying sachs sipped the strong coffee in silence snyder staring at espn his eyes followed a basketball from its launchpad outside the threepoint line his fist clenched minutely when it swished in a commercial came on he changed channels to celebrity poker sachs remembered that kathryn dance had mentioned the power of silence in getting somebody to talk she sat sipping looking at him not saying a word finally irritated snyder asked the st james thing uhhuh i read it was dennis baker behind it and the deputy mayor yep i met baker a few times seemed okay him being on the bag surprised me concern crossed snyders face homicides too sarkowski and that other guy she nodded and an attempt she didnt share that she herself had been the potential victim he shook his head moneys one thing but offing peoplethats a whole different ball game amen snyder asked was one of perps that guy i told you about had a place in maryland or something she figured that he deserved some credit that was wallace but it wasnt a place it was a thing sachs explained about wallaces boat he gave a sour laugh no kidding the maryland monroe thats a pisser sachs said might notve broken the case if you hadnt helped snyder had a millisecond of satisfaction then he remembered he was mad he made a point of rising with a sigh and filling his mug with more whiskey he sat down again his coffee remained untouched he channelsurfed some more can i ask you something i can stop you he muttered you said you knew my father not many peoplere still around who did i just wanted to ask you about him the sixteenth avenue club nope dont want to know about that snyder said he was lucky he got away sometimes you dodge the bullet at least he cleaned up his act later heard he never got into any trouble after that you said you worked with him he didnt talk much about his job i always wondered what it was like back then thought id write down a few things for his grandkids something like that reluctantly snyder said we never were partners but you knew him a hesitation yeah just tell me what was the story on that commanderthe crazy one i always wanted to know the scoop whichcrazy one snyder scoffed there were plenty the one who sent the tactical team to the wrong apartment oh caruthers i think that was him dad was one of the portables holding off the hostagetaker until esu found

send his boots out to be polished hed have the rookies do it you know and hed tip em like a nickel i mean tipping uniforms is weird to start but then five goddamn cents the tv volume came down a few bars snyder laughed hey you wanta hear one story you bet well your dad and me and a bunch of us off duty were going to the garden see a fight or game or something and this kid comes up with a zip gunyou know what that is she did she said she didnt like a homemade gun holds a single twentytwo shell and this poor fuck mugs us you can believe it he sticks us up right in the middle of threefour

the muzzles of our pieces four smitties cocked and ready to unload the look on that kids facehe said guess it aint my day is that classic or what guess it aint my day man we laughed all night about that his face broke into a smile oh and one other thing as he talked sachs nodded and encouraged him in reality she knew many of these stories herman sachs wasnt the least reluctant to talk to his daughter about his job theyd spend hours in the garage working on a transmission or fuel pump while stories of a cops life on the streets reeled pastplanting the seeds for her own future but of course she wasnt here to learn family history no this was simply an officerneedsassistance call a of the heart sachs had decided that former detective art snyder wasnt going down if his supposed friends didnt want to see him because hed helped nail the st james crew then shed set him up with plenty of cops who would herself sellitto rhyme and ron pulaski fred dellray roland bell nancy simpson frank rettig a dozen others she asked him more questions and he repliedsometimes eagerly sometimes with irritation sometimes distracted but always giving her something a couple of times snyder rose and refilled his mug with liquor and frequently hed glance at his watch and then at her his meaning clear dont you have someplace else to be but she just sat back comfortably in the barcalounger asked her questions and even told a few war stories of her own amelia sachs wasnt going anywhere she had all the time in the world authors note authors are only as good as the friends and fellow professionals
