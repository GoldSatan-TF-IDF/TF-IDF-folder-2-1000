jeffery deaver the bodies left behind copyright for robby burroughs the clearest way into the universe is through a forest wilderness john muir i april silence the woods around lake mondac were as quiet as could be a world of difference from the churning chaotic city where the couple spent their weekdays silence broken only by an occasional ahooah of a distant bird the hollow siren of a frog and now another sound a shuffle of leaves two impatient snaps of branch or twig footsteps no that couldnt be the other vacation houses beside the lake were deserted on this cool friday afternoon in april emma feldman in her early thirties set down her martini on the kitchen table where she sat across from her husband she tucked a strand of curly black hair behind her ear and walked to one of the grimy kitchen windows she saw nothing but dense clusters of cedar juniper and black spruce rising up a steep hill whose rocks resembled cracked yellow bone her husband lifted an eyebrow what was it she shrugged and returned to her chair i dont know didnt see anything outside silence again emma lean as any stark white birch outside one of the many windows of the vacation house shook off her blue jacket she was wearing the matching skirt and a white blouse lawyer clothes hair in a bun lawyer hair stockings but shoeless steven turning his attention to the bar had abandoned his jacket as well and a wrinkled striped tie the thirtysixyearold with a full head of unruly hair was in a blue shirt and his belly protruded inexorably over the belt of his navy slacks emma didnt care she thought he was cute and always would and look what i got he said nodding toward the upstairs guest room and unbagging a large bottle of pulpy organic vegetable juice their friend visiting from chicago this weekend had been flirting with liquid diets lately drinking the most disgusting things emma read the ingredients and wrinkled her nose its all hers ill stick with vodka why i love you the house creaked as it often did the place was seventysix years old it featured an abundance of wood and a scarcity of steel and stone the kitchen where they stood was angular and paneled in glowing yellow pine the floor was lumpy the colonial structure was one of three houses on this private road each squatting on ten acres it could be called lakefront property but only because the lake lapped at a rocky shore two hundred yards from the front door the house was plopped down in a small clearing on the east side of a substantial elevation midwest reserve kept people from labeling these hills mountains here in wisconsin though it rose easily seven or eight hundred feet into the air at the moment the big house was bathed in blue lateafternoon shadows emma gazed out at rippling lake mondac far enough from the hill to catch some descending sun now in early spring the surrounding area was scruffy reminding of wet hackles rising from a guard dogs back the house was much nicer than they could otherwise affordtheyd bought it through foreclosureand she knew from the moment shed seen it that this was the perfect vacation house silence the colonial also had a pretty colorful history the owner of a big meatpacking company in chicago had built the place before world war ii it was discovered years later that much of his fortune had come from selling blackmarket meat circumventing the rationing system that limited foods here at home to make sure the troops were nourished in the mans body was found floating in the lake he was possibly the victim of veterans who had learned of his scheme and killed him then searched the house looking for the illicit cash hed hidden here no ghosts figured in any version of the death though emma and steven couldnt keep from embellishing when guests were staying here theyd gleefully take note of who kept the bathroom lights on and who braved the dark after hearing the tales two more snaps outside then a third emma frowned you hear that again that sound outside steven glanced out the window the breeze kicked up now and then he turned back her eyes strayed to her briefcase caught that he said chiding what dont even think about opening it she laughed though without much humor workfree weekend he said we agreed and whats in there she asked nodding at the backpack he carried in lieu of an attaché case emma was wrestling the lid off a jar of cocktail olives only two things of relevance your honor my le carré novel and that bottle of merlot i had at work shall i introduce the latter into evid voice fading he looked to the window through which they could see a tangle of weeds and trees and branches and rocks the color of dinosaur bones emma too glanced outside that i heard he said he refreshed his wifes martini she dropped olives into both drinks what was it remember that bear he didnt come up to the house they clinked glasses and sipped clear liquor steven said you seem preoccupied whats up the union case research for a corporate acquisition had revealed some possible shenanigans within the lakefront workers union in milwaukee the government had become involved and the acquisition was temporarily tabled which nobody was very happy about but she said thiss something else one of our clients makes car parts right kenosha auto see i do listen she looked at her husband with an astonished glance well the ceo turns out is an absolute prick she explained about a wrongful death case involving components of a hybrid car engine a freak accident a passenger electrocuted the head of their randd departmentwhy he demanded i return all the technical files imagine that steven said i liked your other case betterthat state representatives last will and testamentthe sex stuff shhhh she said alarmed remember i never said a word about it my lips are sealed emma speared an olive and ate it and how was your day steven laughed pleasei dont make enough to talk about business after hours the feldmans were a shining example of a blind date gone right despite the odds emma a u of w law school valedictorian daughter of milwaukeechicago money steven a city college bachelor of arts grad from the brewline intent on helping society their friends gave them six months tops the door county wedding to which all those friends were invited had occurred exactly eight months after their first date steven pulled a triangle of brie out of a shopping bag found crackers and opened them oh okay just a little snap snap her husband frowned emma said honey its freaking me a little that was footsteps the three vacation houses here were eight or nine miles from the nearest shop or gas station and a little over a mile from the county highway which was accessed via a strip of dirt poorly impersonating a road marquette state park the biggest in the wisconsin system swallowed most of the land in the area lake mondac and these houses made up an enclave of private property very private and very deserted steven walked into the utility room pulled aside the limp beige curtain and gazed past a cutback crepe myrtle into the side yard nothing im thinking we emma screamed honey honey honey her husband cried a face studied them through the back window the mans head was covered with a stocking though you could see crewcut blondish hair a colorful tattoo on his neck the eyes were halfway surprised to see people so close he wore an olive drab combat jacket he knocked on the glass with one hand in the other he was holding a shotgun muzzle up he was smiling eerily oh god emma whispered steven pulled out his cell phone flipped it open and punched numbers telling her ill deal with him go lock the front door emma ran to the entryway dropping her glass the olives spun amid the dancing shards picking up dust crying out she heard the kitchen door splinter inward she looked back and saw the intruder with the shotgun rip the phone from her husbands hand and shove him against the wall a print of an old sepia landscape photograph crashed to the floor the front door too swung open a second man his head also covered with mesh pushed inside he had long dark hair pressed close by the nylon taller and stockier than the first he held a pistol the black gun was small in his outsized hand he pushed emma into the kitchen where the other man tossed him the cell phone the bigger one stiffened at the pitch but caught the phone onehanded he seemed to grimace in irritation at the toss and dropped the phone in his pocket steven said pleasewhat do you voice quavering emma looked away quickly the less she saw she was thinking the better their chances to survive please steven said please you can take whatever you want just leave us please emma stared at the dark pistol in the taller mans hand he wore a black leather jacket and boots his were like the other mans the kind soldiers wear both men grew oblivious to the couple they looked around the house emmas husband continued look you can have whatever you want weve got a mercedes outside ill get the keys you just dont talk the taller man said gesturing with the pistol we have money and credit cards debit card too ill give you the pin what do you want emma asked crying shhh somewhere in its ancient heart the house creaked once more a what kinda a hangup to nineoneone right just somebody called and said this and then hung up said what this the word this this sheriff tom dahl asked he was fiftythree years old his skin smooth and freckled as an adolescents hair red he wore a tan uniform shirt that had fit much better when his wife bought it two years ago yessir todd jackson answered scratching his eyelid and then it was hung up was hung up or he hung it up theres a difference i dont know oh i see what you mean five twentytwo pm friday april this was one of the more peaceful hours of the day in kennesha county wisconsin people tended to kill themselves and their fellow citizens intentionally or by accident either earlier in the day or later dahl knew the schedule as if itd been printed if you cant recognize the habits of your jurisdiction after fourteen years running a law enforcement agency you have no business at the job eight deputies were on duty in the sheriffs department which was next to the courthouse and city hall the department was in an old building attached to a new one the old being from the s the new from exactly one century later the area of the building where dahl and the others worked was mostly openplan and filled with cubicles and desks this was the new part the officers here at the momentsix men and two womenwore uniforms that ranged from starched as wood to old bedsheet reflecting the tour starting hours were checking jackson said he too had infant skin though that was unremarkable considering he was half the sheriffs age this dahl mused you hear from the lab oh bout that wilkins thing jackson picked at his stiff collar wasnt meth wasnt nothing even here in kennesha a county with the sparse population of meth was a terrible scourge the users tweakers were ruthless crazed and absolutely desperate to get the product cookers felt exactly the same about the huge profits they made more murders were attributed to meth than coke heroin pot and alcohol combined and there were as many accidental deaths by scalding burning and overdoses as murders related to the drug a family of four had just died when their trailer burned down after the mother passed out while cooking a batch in her kitchen shed overdosed dahl speculated after sampling some product fresh off the stovetop the sheriffs jaw tightened well damn just goddamn hes cooking it we all know hes cooking hes playing with us is what hes doing and id like to arrest him just for that well where did it come from that nineoneone call landline no somebodys cell thats whats taking some time the e system which kennesha county had had for years gave the dispatcher the location of the caller in an emergency the e was for enhanced not emergency it worked with cell calls too though tracing them was a little more complicated and in the hilly country around this portion of wisconsin sometimes didnt work at all this a womans voice called across the cluttered space todd com center for you the deputy headed to his cubicle dahl turned back to the wad of arrest reports he was correcting for english as much as for criminal procedure jackson returned he didnt sit down in either of the two office chairs he hovered which he did a lot okay sheriff the nineoneone call it was from someplace around lake mondac creepy dahl thought never liked it up there the lake squatted in the middle of marquette state park also creepy hed run two rapes and two homicides there and in the last murder investigation theyd recovered only a minority of the victims body he glanced at the map on his wall nearest town was clausen six seven miles from the lake he didnt know the town well but assumed it was like a thousand others in wisconsin a gas station a grocery store that sold as much beer as milk and a restaurant that was harder to find than the local meth cooker they have houses there around the lake think so dahl stared at the blue pebble of lake mondac on the map it was surrounded by a small amount of private land which was in turn engulfed by huge marquette park this jackson said and the campgroundsre closed till may whose phone that were still waiting on the young deputy had spiky blond hair all the rage dahl had worn a crew cut for ninetenths of his life the sheriff had lost interest in the routine reports and in a beer bash in honor of one of their senior deputies birthdays an event that was supposed to commence in an hour at the eagleton tap and which he had been looking forward to he was thinking of last year when some guya registered sex offender and a stupid onepicked up johnny ralston from grade school and the boy had the presence of mind to hit last call on his cell phone and slip it in his pocket as they drove around the sicko asking him what kind of movies he liked it took all of eight minutes to find them the miracle of modern electronics god bless edison or marconi or sprint dahl stretched and massaged his leg near the leathery spot where a bullet had come and gone not stinging much at the time and probably fired by one of his own men in the countys only bank robbery shootout in recent memory whatta you think todd i dont think you say this is the number i want to fouroneone i think you say this is an emergency to nineoneone and then you pass out or get shot or stabbed and the line just went dead and peggy tried calling back but it went to voice mail direct no ring and the message said just this is steven im not available no last name peggy left a message to call her boater on the lake dahl speculated had a problem in this weather april in wisconsin could be frigid the temperatures tonight were predicted to dip into the high thirties dahl shrugged my boys went into water thatd scare off polar bears and boatersre like golfers i dont golf another deputy called got a name todd the young man produced a pen and notebook dahl couldnt tell where they came from go on steven feldman billing address for the phone is two one nine three melbourne milwaukee so its a vacation house on lake mondac lawyer doctor not a beggarman run him the sheriff ordered and whats the number of the phone dahl got the numbers from jackson who then returned again to his cubicle where hed look up the particulars on the federal and state databases all the important ones ncic vicap wisconsin criminal records google out the window the april sky was a rich blue like a girls party dress dahl loved the air in this part of wisconsin humboldt the biggest town in kennesha had no more than seven thousand vehicles spread out over many miles the cement plant put some crap into the air but it was the only big industry the county had so nobody complained except some local environmental protection agency people and they didnt complain very loudly you could see for miles quarter to six now this dahl mused jackson came back yet again well here we go sheriff feldman works for the city hes thirtysix his wife emmas a lawyer hartigan reed soames and carson shes thirtyfour ha lawyer i win no warrants or anything on either of them have two cars mercedes and a cherokee no children they have a house there where i mean lake mondac found the deed no mortgage owning and not owing well dahl hit redial for the fifth time straight to voice mail again hi this is steven im not available dahl didnt leave another message he disconnected let his thumb linger on the cradle then removed it directory assistance had no listing for a feldman in mondac he called the phone companys local legal affairs man jerry caughtya fore you left tom dahl on my way out the door got a warrant we looking for terrorists ha just can you tell me theres a landline for a house up in lake mondac where about twenty miles north of here twentyfive house is number three lake view thats a town lake mondac probably just unincorporated county a moment later nope no line us or anybody everybody uses their mobiles nowadays what would ma bell say who after they disconnected dahl looked at the note jackson had given him he called steven feldmans office the milwaukee department of social services but got a recording he hung up ill try the wife law firms dont ever sleep at least not ones with four names a young woman an assistant or secretary answered and dahl identified himself then said were trying to reach mrs feldman the pause you always got then is something wrong no just routine we understand that shes at her vacation house at lake mondac thats right emma and her husband and a friend of hers from chicago were driving up there after work they were going for the weekend please is anything wrong has there been an accident in a voice with which hed delivered news of fatal accidents and successful births tom dahl said nothings wrong that we know of id just like to get in touch with her could you give me her cell phone number a pause tell you what you dont know me call back the kennesha county centers main number and ask to speak to the sheriff if itd make you feel any better it would he hung up and the phone buzzed one minute later wasnt sure shed call he said to jackson as he was picking up the handset he got emma feldmans mobile number from the assistant then he asked for the name and number of the friend driving up with them shes a woman emma used to work with i dont know her name dahl told the assistant if emma called in to have her get in touch with the sheriffs department they hung up emmas mobile went straight to voice mail too dahl exhaled this the way hed let smoke ease from his lips up until seven years and four months ago he made a decision ill sleep better anybody on duty up that way erics the closest was checking out a gta in hobart that turned into a mistake oops shouldve called the wife first that sort of thing eric hmm called in five minutes ago went for dinner in boswich falls eric nobody else within twenty miles usually isnt up there with the park closed and all this time of year dahl looked out the interior window over the cubicles of his deputies jimmy barnes the deputy whose birthday was tomorrow was standing beside two coworkers all of them laughing hard the joke mustve been pretty funny and itd surely be told again and again that night the sheriffs eyes settled on an empty desk he winced as he massaged his damaged thigh howd it go joeys fine she said hes just fine graham was in the kitchen two skills on display brynn observed of her husband he was getting the pasta going and hed progressed with the new tile about twenty square feet of kitchen floor were sealed off with yellow police line tape hi graham the boy called hey young man how you feeling the lanky twelveyearold in cargo pants windbreaker and black knit hat held up his arm excellent he was nearly his mothers fivefootfiveinch height and his round face was dusted with freckles which hadnt come from brynn though he and his mother shared identical straight chestnut brown hair his now protruded from under the watch cap no sling howre you going to get any sympathy from the girls ha ha grahams stepson crinkled his nose at the comment about the opposite sex the lean boy got a juice box from the fridge poked the straw in and emptied the drink spaghetti tonight alright the boy instantly forgot skateboard injuries and female classmates he ran to the stairs dodging books that were stacked on the lower steps intended for putting away at some point hat graham shouted in the house the boy yanked the cap off and continued bounding upward take it easy graham called your arm hes fine brynn repeated hanging her dark green jacket in the front closet then returning to the kitchen midwest pretty her high cheekbones made her look a bit nativeamerican though she was exclusively norwegianirish and in roughly the proportion her name suggested kristen brynn mckenzie people sometimes thought that especially with her shoulderlength hair pulled back taut she was a retired ballet dancer whod settled into a sizeeight life with few regrets though brynn had never danced outside of a school or club in her life her one concession to vanity was to pluck and peroxide her eyebrows more longterm tactics were in the planning but so far none had been put into practice if there was any imperfection it was her jaw which seen from straight on was a bit crooked graham said it was charming and sexy brynn hated the flaw he now asked his armits not broken nope just lost some skin they bounce back that age she glanced at the kettle he made good pasta thats a relief the kitchen was hot and sixfootthreeinch graham boyd rolled his sleeves up showing strong arms and two small scars of his own he wore a watch with much of the gold plate worn off his only jewelry was his wedding band scratched and dull much like brynns nestled beside the engagement ring shed had on her finger for exactly one month longer than the band graham opened cans of tomatoes the oxos sharp round blade split the lids decisively under his big hands he turned down the flame onion was sizzling tired some shed left the house at fivethirty that was well before the day tour started but shed wanted to follow up at a trailer park the site of a domestic dispute the afternoon before nobodyd been arrested and the couple had ended up remorseful tearful and hugging but brynn wanted to make sure the excessive makeup on the womans face wasnt concealing a bruise she didnt want the police to see nope brynn had learned at am she just wore a lot of max factor after the predawn start she was planning to be home earlywell for her at five but shed gotten a call from an ems medical tech a friend of hers the woman began brynn hes all right ten minutes later she was in the emergency room with her son she now puffed out her tan sheriffs department uniform blouse im stinky graham consulted the triple shelves of cookbooks about four dozen of them altogether they were mostly annas whod brought them with her when she moved in after her medical treatments but graham had been browsing through them recently as hed taken over that household duty his motherinlaw hadnt been well enough to cook and brynn well it wasnt exactly one of her skills ouch i forgot the cheese graham said rummaging futilely in the pantry cant believe it he turned back to the pot and his thumb and forefinger ground oregano into dust how was your day she asked he told her about an irrigation system gone mad turned on prematurely april first then cracking in a dozen places in the freeze that surprised nobody but the owner whod returned home to find his backyard had done a katrina youre making headway she nodded at the tile its coming along so the punishment fit the crime she frowned joey the skateboard oh i told him hes off it for three days graham said nothing concentrated on the sauce did that mean he thought she was too lenient she said well maybe more i said well see they oughta outlaw those things he said going down railings jumping in the air its crazy he was just in the school yard those stairs there the three stairs going down to the parking lot all the kids do it he said he has to wear that helmet i see it here all the time thats true hes going to i talked to him about that too grahams eyes followed the boys route to his room maybe i should have a word with him guytoguy thing i wouldnt worry about it i dont want to overwhelm him he got the message brynn got her own beer drank half ate a handful of wheat thins so you going to your poker game tonight thought i might she nodded as she watched him roll meatballs with his large hands honey a voice called hows our boy hey mom anna seventyfour stood in the doorway dressed nice as usual today the outfit was a black pantsuit and gold shell her short do had been put in place by the hairdresser just yesterday thursday was her day at style cuts just a few scrapes a few bruises graham said he was skateboarding down stairs oh my three steps not stairs brynn sipped everythings fine he wont do it again nothing serious really weve all done things like that graham asked anna whatd she do when she was a kid nodding at his wife oh ive got stories but she told none of them ill take him paintballing or something graham suggested channel some of that energy thatd be a good idea graham ripped up lettuce with his hands spaghetti okay anna whatever you makell be lovely anna took the glass of chardonnay her soninlaw poured for her brynn watched her husband take plates from the cupboard think theres some dust on them from the tiling i sealed it off with plastic took it down after i was done he hesitated then rinsed them anyway can somebody take me over to ritas tonight anna asked megans got to pick up her son just for an hour and a half or so i promised to handle bathroom duty hows she doing brynn asked not good anna and her dear friend had been diagnosed around the same time annas treatment had gone well ritas had not ill take you she told her mother sure what time sevenish anna turned back to the family room the heart of brynns small house on the outskirts of humboldt the nightly news was on lookit another bomb those people the phone rang graham answered hi tom hows it going brynn set the beer down looked at her husband holding the phone in his large hand yeah i saw it good game youre calling for brynn im guessing hold on shes here the boss he whispered offering the handset then turning back to dinner tom the sheriff asked about joey she thought he was going to lecture her about skateboards too but he didnt he was explaining about a situation up in lake mondac she listened carefully nodding need somebody to check it out youre closer than anybody else brynn eric graham lit a burner on the kenmore stove blue sparks ascended id rather it wasnt him you know how he gets graham stirred the pot it was mostly the contents of cans but he still stirred like he was blending handdiced ingredients in the family room a mans voice was replaced by katie courics anna announced thats more like it what the news should be about brynn debated then she said you owe me a half day tom give me the address which turned grahams head dahl put on another deputy todd jackson who gave directions brynn wrote she hung up might be a problem up at lake mondac she looked at the beer didnt drink any more aw baby graham said im sorry i feel obligated i left work early because of joey but tom didnt say that she hesitated no he didnt the thing is im closest i heard you mention eric hes a problem i told you about him eric munce read soldier of fortune magazine wore a second gun on his ankle like he was in downtown detroit and would go prowling around for meth labs when he should have been breathalyzing duis and encouraging kids to get home by pm from the doorway anna said should i call rita i guess i can take you graham said brynn put a stopper on her beer bottle your poker game her husband paused smiled then said itll keep anyway with joey being hurt better to stay here keep an eye on him she said you guys eat and leave the dishes ill clean up when i get back itll be a couple hours is all okay graham said and everybody knew hed clean up she pulled on her leather jacket lighter weight than her sheriffs department parka ill call when i get up there let you know when ill be back sorry about your game graham bye he said not looking back as he eased the jackstraws of spaghetti into the boiling pot north of humboldt the landscape is broken into bumpy rectangles of pastures separated by benign fences a few stone walls and hedgerows the sun was sitting on the tops of the hills to the west and shone down on the landscape making the milk cows and sheep glow like bright bulky lawn decorations every few hundred yards signs lured tourists this way or that with the promise of handmade cheeses nut rolls and nougat maple syrup soft drinks and pine furniture a vineyard offered a tour brynn mckenzie who enjoyed her wine and had lived in wisconsin all her life had never sampled anything local then eight miles out of town the storybook vanished just like that pine and oak ganged beside the road which shrank from four lanes to two hills sprouted and soon the landscape was nothing but forest a few buds were out but the leafbearing trees were still largely gray and black most of the pines were richly green but some parcels were dead killed by acid rain or maybe blight brynn recognized balsam fir juniper yew spruce hickory some gnarly black willows and central castings oak maple and birch beneath the trees were congregations of sedge thistle ragweed and blackberry daffodils and crocuses had been tricked into awakening by the thaw that had murdered the plants in the yard of grahams client although married to a landscaper she hadnt learned about local flora from her husband that education came from her job the rampant growth of meth labs in outoftheway parts of rural america meant that police officers whod never done anything more challenging than pulling over drunk drivers now had to make drug raids out in the boondocks brynn was one of the few deputies in the department who took the state police tactical training refresher course outside of madison every year it included assault and arrest techniques part of which involved learning about plants which ones were dangerous which were good for cover and which might actually save your life even young hardwoods could stop bullets fired from close range as she drove the glock mm pistol was high on her hip and while the sheriffs department crown victoria cruiser had plenty of room for accessories the configuration of bucket seat and seat belt in the honda she was now driving kept the boxy guns slide bridling against her hip bone thered be a mark come morning she shifted again and put on the radio npr then country then talk then weather she shut it off oncoming trucks oncoming pickups but fewer and fewer of them and soon she had the road to herself it now angled upward and she saw the evening star ahead of her hilltops grew craggy and bald with rock and she could see evidence of the lakes nearby cattails bog bean and silver and reed canary grass a heron stood in a marsh immobile his beak and gaze aimed directly at her she shivered the outside temperature was in the midfifties but the scene was bleak and chilly brynn flicked on the hondas lights her cell phone rang hi tom thanks again for doing this brynn sure had todd check things out dahl explained that he still couldnt get through on either of the couples mobiles as far as he knew the only people at the house were the feldmans steven and emma and a woman from chicago emma used to work with who was driving up with them just the three of them thats what i heard now theres nothing odd about feldman he works for the city but the wife emmaget this shes a lawyer at a big firm in milwaukee seems that she mightve uncovered some big scam as part of a case or a deal she was working on what kind i dont know the details just what a friend in milwaukee pd tells me so shes maybe a witness or whistleblower or something could be and the call the nineoneone callwhatd he say exactly just this she waited i missed it what a chuckle whos on first i mean he said the word this this thats all yep dahl then told her but it could be a big deal this case todds been talking to the fbi in milwaukee the bureaus involved well any threats against her none they heard of but my father always said those that threaten usually dont do those that do usually dont threaten brynns stomach flippedwith apprehension sure but also with excitement the most serious nonvehicular crime shed run in the past month was an emotionally disturbed teenager with a baseball bat taking out plateglass windows in southland mall and terrorizing customers it was a potential disaster but shed defused it with a brief facetoface smiling at his mad eyes while her heart thudded just a few beats above normal you watch yourself brynn check the place out from a distance dont go stumbling in anything looks funny call it in and wait sure thinking as a last resort maybe brynn snapped her phone shut and set it in the cup holder this reminded her she was thirstyand hungry too but she pushed the thought aside four of the roadside restaurants shed passed in the last ten miles were closed shed check out whatever was happening at lake mondac then get home to grahams spaghetti for some reason she thought of dinners with keith her first husband had cooked too in fact he did most of the cooking in the evening unless he was working secondshift tour she pushed the accelerator down a bit harder deciding that the difference in response between the crown vic and the honda was as noticeable as that between fresh idahos and instant potato buds out of a box thinking as she had been about food well boy you got yourself shot in a downstairs bedroom of the feldman house shades drawn hart was looking at the left sleeve of his brown flannel shirt dark to start with but darker now halfway between wrist and elbow from the blood his leather coat was on the floor he slouched on the guest bed yep lookit that tugging his green stud earring skinny lewis finished making obvious and irritating observations and began to roll up harts cuff carefully the men had taken off their stocking masks and gloves just be careful what you touch hart said nodding at the other mans bare hands lewis pointedly ignored the comment that was a surprise hart bitch blindsided us never saw that coming so who the hell is she i dont really know lewis hart said patiently looking at his arm as the curtain of sleeve went up how would i know itll be a piece of cake hart hardly any risk at all the other placesll be vacant and only the two of them up there no rangers in the park and no cops for miles they have weapons are you kidding theyre city people shes a lawyer hes a social worker hart was in his early forties he had a lengthy face with the mask off his hair came well below the bottom of his ears which were close to the side of his head he swept the black strands back but they didnt stay put very well he favored hats and had a collection hats also took attention away from you his skin was rough not from youthful eruptions but simply because it was that way had always been he gazed at his forearm purple and yellow around the black hole from which oozed a trickle of blood the slug had gone through muscle an inch to the left it would have missed completely to the right the bullet would have shattered bone did that make him lucky or unlucky speaking to himself as much as to lewis hart said of the blood not pulsing out means its not a major vein then can you get some alcohol a bar of soap and cloth for a bandage i guess as the man loped off slowly hart wondered again why on earth anybody would have a bright redandblue tattoo of a celtic cross tattooed on his neck from the bathroom lewis called no alcohol whisky in the bar i saw get vodka whisky smells too much can give you away dont forget your gloves did the thin man give an exasperated sigh a few minutes later lewis returned with a bottle of vodka true the clear liquor didnt smell as much as the whisky but hart could tell that lewis had had himself a hit he took the bottle in his gloved hands and poured the liquid on the wound the pain was astonishing well he gasped slumping forward his eyes focused on a picture on the wall he stared at it a jumping fish a fly in its mouth whod buy something like that phew youre not going to faint are you man lewis asked as if he didnt need this inconvenience too okay okay harts head dropped and his vision crinkled to black but then he breathed in deeply and came back around he rubbed the ivory soap over the wound whyre you doing that cauterizes it stops the bleeding no shit hart tested the arm he could raise and lower it with some control and not too much pain when he closed his fist the grip was weak but at least it was functioning fucking bitch lewis muttered hart didnt waste much anger at the moment he was more relieved than anything what ended up being a shot arm had almost been a shot head he remembered standing in the kitchen scratching his face through the stocking when hed looked up to see movement in front of him it turned out though to be a reflection of the young woman moving up silently from behind lifting the gun hart had leapt aside just as shed firednot even aware hed been hitand spun around shed fled out the door as hed let go with a couple of rounds from his glock lewis whod been standing next to himand would have been the next to diehad spun around too dropping a bag of snacks hed pilfered from the refrigerator then theyd heard a series of cracks from outside and hart knew she was shooting out the tires of both the ford and the mercedes so they couldnt pursue her got careless there hart now said ominously lewis looked at him like he was being blamed which he wasthe skinny man was supposed to be in the living room not the kitchen at the time but hart let it go think you hit her lewis now asked no hart felt dizzy he pressed the side of the glock pistol against his forehead the cold calmed him who the hell is she lewis repeated that was answered when they found her purse in the living room a little thing with makeup cash and credit cards inside michelle hart said glancing at a visa credit card he looked up her names michelle hed just got shot by a michelle wincing hart now walked across the worn rug dark tan and shut off the living room lights he peered carefully out the door and into the front yard no sign of her lewis started into the kitchen ill get those lights no not there leave em on too many windows no curtains she could see you easy whatre you some wuss bitch is long gone grimfaced hart glanced down at his arm meaning you want to take the chance lewis got the point they looked outside again through the front windows and saw nothing but a tangle of woods no lights no shapes moving in the dusk he heard frogs and saw a couple of bats flying obstacle courses in the clear sky lewis was saying wish id knew that soap trick thats pretty slick me and my brother were in green bay one time we werent doing shit just hanging you know i went to pee by the railroad tracks and this asshole jumped me had a box cutter got me from behind homeless prickcut me down to the bone i bled like a stuck pig hart was wondering whats his point he tried to tune the man out oh i whaled on that dude hart didnt matter i was bleeding he felt pain that day come off the worst of it ill tell you hart squeezed the wound and then stopped paying attention to the pain it was still there but was lost in the background of sensations gripping his black gun he stepped outside crouching no shots no rustles from the bushes lewis joined him bitchs gone im telling you shes halfway to the highway by now hart looked over the cars grimaced look at that both the feldmans mercedes and the ford that hart had stolen earlier in the day had two flats each and the wheel sizes were different the spares wouldnt be compatible lewis said shit well better start hiking you think hart scanned the deep woods surrounding them shadowy now he couldnt imagine a better place in the world to hide good goddamn see if you can plug one of those he nodded at the fords shotout tires lewis sneered im not a fucking mechanic id do it hart said trying to be patient but im a little disadvantaged here he nodded at his arm the skinny man tugged at his earring a green stone and loped off resentfully toward the car whatre you going to be doing what the hell did he think with his glock at his side he started in the direction hed seen michelle flee eight miles from lake mondac the landscape ranged from indifferent to hostile no farms here the country was forested and hilly with forbidding sheer cliffs of cracked rocks brynn mckenzie drove through clausen which amounted to a few gas stations two of the three unbranded a few storesconvenience package and auto partsand a junkyard a sign pointed to a subway but it was miles away she noted another sign for hot sausages in the window of a quik mart she was tempted but it was closed across the highway was a tudorstyle building with all the windows broken out and roof collapsed it bore a prize that had surely tempted many a local teenager but the all girl staff sign was just too high or too well bolted to the wall to steal then this sneeze of civilization was gone and brynn began a long sweep through treeand rockfilled wilderness broken only by scruffy clearings the few residences were set well off the road trailers or bungalows from which gray smoke eased skyward the windows glowing dimly were like sleepy eyes the land was too harsh for farms and the sparse populace would drive their rusted pickups or datsunera imports to work elsewhere if they went to work at all for miles the only oncoming traffic three cars one truck nobody in her lane ahead or behind at she passed a sign saying that marquette state park campground was ten miles up the road open may which meant that lake mondac had to be nearby then she saw lake view drive private road no trespassing no public lake access violators will be prosecuted and howdydo to you too she turned slowing as the honda bumbled over the gravel and dirt thinking she shouldve taken grahams pickup according to the directions that todd jackson had given her the distance was miles from the county route to lake view the feldmans vacation house their driveway hed added was a couple football fields long or thats what it looked like on yahoo making slow progress brynn drove through a tunnel of trees and bushes and blankets of leaf refuse mostly the landscape was needles and naked branch and bark then the road widened slightly and the willow jack pine and hemlock on her right grew sparse she could see the lake clearly shed never spent much time on bodies of water didnt care for them she felt more in control on dry land for some reason she and keith had had a tradition of going to the gulf coast in mississippi his choice pretty much brynn had divided her time there between reading and taking joey to amusement parks and the beach keith spent most of the time in the casino it wasnt her favorite locale but at least the beige water lapping at the shoreline was as easygoing and warm as the locals lakes around here seemed bottomless and chill and the abrupt meeting of rocky shore and black water made you feel helpless easy prey for snakes and leeches she reflected on another course shed taken through the state police a water safety rescue seminar it had been held at a lake just like this and though shed done the exerciseswimming underwater to rescue a drowning dummy in a sunken boatshed hated the experience she now scanned the surroundings looking for boaters in trouble car accidents fires for intruders too there was still enough light to navigate by and she shut the lights out so as not to announce her presence and drove even more slowly to keep the crunch of the tires to a minimum she passed the first two houses on the private road they were dark and set at the end of long driveways winding through the woods large structuresfour five bedroomsthey were old impressive somber there was a bleakness about the properties like sets in the opening scene of a family drama the homestead boarded up the story to be told in flashbacks to happier days brynns own bungalow which shed bought after keith bought her share of their marital house would have fit inside either of these and still have left it half empty as the honda crawled along she passed a small bald patch between copses of fir spruce and more hemlock giving her a partial view of the house at number the feldmansahead and to her left it was grander than the others though of the same style smoke trailed from the chimney the windows were mostly dark though she could see a glow behind shades or curtains in the back and on the second floor she drove on toward the house and it was lost to sight behind a large copse of pine her hand reached down and for reassurance tapped the grip of her glock not a superstitious gesture but one shed learned long ago you had to know the exact position of your weapon in case you needed to draw it fast brynn recalled that shed loaded the weapon with fresh ammo last weekthirteen rounds which wasnt superstitious either but more than enough for whatever shed run into in kennesha county besides it took all your thumb strength to jam the slick brass rounds into the clip tom dahl wanted his deputies on the range for a checkup once a month but brynn went every two weeks it was a rarely used but vital skill she believed and she blew through a couple boxes of remingtons every other tuesday shed been in several firefights usually against drunk or suicidal shooters and had come away with the sense that the brief seconds of exchanging bullets with another human being were so chaotic and loud and terrifying that you needed any edge you could get and a big part of that was making automatic the process of drawing and firing a weapon shed had to cancel her session last week because of another incident with joeya fight at schoolbut the next morning shed made her range time of am and upset about her son had run through two boxes of fifty rounds her wrist had ached from the excess for the rest of the day brynn slowed about fifty yards from the feldmans driveway and pulled onto the shoulder sending a startling cluster of grouse into the air she stopped intending to walk the rest of the way she was reaching for her phone in the cup holder to shut the ringer off before approaching the crime scene when it trilled a glance at caller id tom look brynn doesnt sound good what tell me he sighed she was irritated he was delaying though a lot more irritated at the news she knew was coming im sorry brynn oh brother wild goose chase oh damntell me feldman called back the husband called back com central called me feldman said hes got nineoneone on speed dial hit it by mistake hung up as soon as he realized it didnt think itd gone through oh tom grimacing she stared at thrushes picking at the ground beside a wood lily i know i know im practically there i can see the house you moved fast well it was a nineoneone remember im giving you a whole day off and when would she have time for that she exhaled long at least youre buying me dinner out tonight and not burger king i want chilis or bennigans not a single bit of problem enjoy it night tom brynn called graham but got his voice mail it rang four times before it switched over she left a message saying the call was a false alarm she hung up tried again this time it went right to voice mail she didnt leave another message was he out your poker game itll keep thinking of the false alarm though brynn wasnt wholly upset she was going to take an advanced course next week in domestic violence negotiations and could use her dinner break tonight to make some headway in the course manual shed just received if shed been home she wouldnt have been able to crack the book until bedtime she also had to admit that she wouldnt mind a bit of a break from evenings with anna especially if a run to ritas was scheduled it was odd having anna back in the house after so many years of mutual independence emotions from years past surfaced like that night last week when her mother had shot a look her way after brynn returned late from a shift the tension was identical to that when as a teenager shed lost herself in steeplejumping and had come home hours after shed promised no fight no lectures just a simple burdened look beneath an unflappable smile theyd never fought anna wasnt temperamental or moody she was a perfect grandmother which counted for a lot to brynn but mother and daughter had never been chummy and during brynns first marriage anna largely faded from her life emerging only after joey was born now divorced and with a man whom brynn believed anna approved of theyd reconnected at one point a year ago brynn had wondered if mother and daughter would finally grow close but that hadnt happened they were after all the same people theyd been twenty years ago and unlike her siblings brynn had never had much in common with her mother brynn had always spent her life riding pushing looking for something outside eau claire annas had been spent working unchallenging jobsmostly four hours a day as a real estate office managerand raising her three children evenings were invariably knitting chatting and tv perfectly fine for relations living apart but when anna moved in after her surgery it was like brynn had been transported back to those days of her youth oh yes she was looking forward to a few hours of evening time to herself and a free dinner at bennigans hell shed even order a glass of wine brynn flipped the car lights on and put the car in reverse to turn around then she paused the nearest gas station was back in clausen a good twenty minutes the feldmans were behind this mixup the least they could do was let her use their bathroom brynn put the car in gear and headed for their driveway curious to see just how far yahoo thought two football fields was squatting next to the stolen ford theyd driven here from milwaukee lewis sucked blood off the knuckle hed gigged on the sheet metal trying to repair one or both of the flats he examined the wound and spat great hart thought fingerprints and dna and here im the one picked this guy to tag along tonight any sign of her the skinny man asked crouched over one of the wheels hart crunched over leaves returning from making a circuit of the property as hed searched for michelle being as quiet as he could hed had the queasy sense of being targeted maybe she was gone maybe she wasnt grounds plenty muddy i found some footprints probably hers going toward the county road at first but they seemed to turn that way he pointed to the dense woods and steep hillside behind the house shes gotta be hiding there someplace you hear anything no but its freaking me out i keep looking over my shoulder man she is going down when we get back i am tracking down that bitch i dont care who she is where she lives shes going down she fucked with the wrong man im the one who got shot hart reminded silently he examined the forest again we almost had a problem lewis blurted sarcastically you think i checked his phone turned it back on and checked the the husbands a nod toward the house remember the one you took away from him lewis was looking defensive already as well he should got through to nineoneone it was a connected call said hart couldntve been on it more than a second three seconds but it was enough shit lewis stood up and stretched i think its okay i called back and told em i was him i said id called by mistake the sheriff said theyd sent a car to check it out he was going to tell em to come on back that wouldve been fucking pretty they believe you i think so just think going on the offensive now hart ignored the question he gestured at the ford can you fix it nope was the glib response hart studied the man his sneering grin his cocky stance after hart had agreed to do this job hed gone out to find a partner hed checked around with some contacts in milwaukee and gotten lewiss name theyd met the younger man had seemed all right and a criminal background check revealed nothing that raised alarmsa rap sheet for some minor drug arrests and larcenies a few pleas the skinny guy with the big earring and the redandblue neck decoration wouldve been fine for the routine job this was supposed to be but now it had gone bad hart was wounded they had no wheels and an armed enemy was out in the woods nearby it suddenly became vital to know compton lewiss habits nature and skills the assessment wasnt very encouraging hart had to play things carefully he now tried some damage control and keeping his voice as neutral as he could said think your glovesre off lewis licked the blood again couldnt get a grip on the wrench detroit piece of crap probably want to wipe everything a nod toward the tire iron lewis laughed as if hart had said wow did you know grass is green so thats how it was going to be what a night ill tell you my friend lewis muttered fixaflat does shit when theres a fucking bullet hole in the sidewall of a tire hart saw the can of tire sealant where lewis had flung it in anger he supposed so that now the mans prints were on that too he blinked away tears of pain fourteen years in a business in which firearms figured prominently and hart had never been shotand hed rarely fired a weapon himself unless of course that was what hed been hired to do the other houses up the road we could try them might have a car parked there hart replied wouldnt make sense leaving a car out here anyway try hotwiring a car nowadays you need a computer ive done it i can do it easy lewis scoffed you never have hart said nothing still scanning the brush any other ideas call triple a hart said ha triple a well guess thats it we better start hiking its a couple miles to the county road lets empty out the ford and get moving hart went into the garage and came back with a roll of paper towels and glass cleaner the fucks that for lewis said and gave one of those snide laughs again fingerprintsre oil you need something to cut it with wiping just distorts them the cops can reconstruct them a lot of times thats bullshit i never heard of that its true lewis ive studied it studied another sarcastic laugh hart began spraying the cleaner on whatever lewis had touched hart himself hadnt touched a single thing except his own arm with his bare hands since theyd been here heh you do laundry too as hart scrubbed he also was looking over the property threesixty listening he said we cant leave just yet whatre you talking about weve got to find her but lewis said with a sour smile as if the one word conveyed a whole argument about the futility of the task no choice hart finished wiping he then took out his map examined it they were in the middle of a huge stew of green and brown he looked around studied the map some more folded it up another of those irritating snickers well hart i know you want to fuck her up after what she did but lets worry about that later its not revenge revenge is pointless beg to differ revenge is fun that asshole i told you about with the box cutter fucking him up was more fun than seeing the brewers depending on whos pitching hart reined in a sigh its not about revenge its just what we have to do shit lewis blurted what hart looked at him alarmed lewis tugged at his ear i lost the back started looking down at the ground back of my earring he put the emerald or whatever it was carefully into the small front pocket of his jeans jesus our lord hart collected the flashlights and extra ammunition from the trunk of the ford waiting until lewis put his gloves back on hart handed him a box of mm ammo and one of gauge shells for the shotgun weve got a half hour before we lose the light completely itll be a bitch to track her in the dark lets get going lewis wasnt moving he was looking past hart and playing with the colorful boxes of bullets like they were rubiks cubes hart wondered if the head butting was going to start now in earnest but it turned out that the younger mans attention was just elsewhere lewis put the boxes into his pocket snagged the shotgun clicking off the safety and nodded down the driveway we got company hart as she approached the feldman house brynn mckenzie decided that even with the glow from behind ivory curtains the place was eerie as hell the other two houses shed passed might have been the sets for family dramas this was just the place for a stephen king movie the kind she and her first husband keith would devour like candy she looked up at the threestory home you sure didnt see many houses of this style or size in kennesha county white siding which had seen better days and a wraparound porch she liked the porch her childhood house in eau claire had sported one shed loved sitting out in the chain swing at night her brother singing and playing his battered guitar her sister flirting with her latest boyfriend their parents talking talking talkingand the home she and keith owned had a nice wraparound but as for her present house she didnt even know where a porch would fit approaching the feldmans she glanced at the yard impressed the landscaping was expensive the place was surrounded by strategically placed dogwoods ligustrum and crepe myrtles that had been cut way back she recalled her husbands advice to his customers against this practice dont rape your crepes parking in the circular gravel drive she caught movement inside a shadow on the front curtain she climbed out into the chill air fresh and sweet with the perfume of blossoms and firewood smoke hearing the comforting sound of frogs croaking and the honk of geese or ducks brynn walked over gravel and up the three steps to the porch flashed on joey imagining him skateboarding off this height into the school parking lot well i did talk to him itll be fine her issue black oxfords as comfy and unstylish as shoes could be thunked on the wood as she approached the front door hit the bell it rang but there was no response she pressed the button once more the door was solid but flanked by narrow windows curtained with lace and brynn could see into the living room she noted no motion no shadows only a pleasant storm of flames in the fireplace she knocked loud reverberating on the glass another shadow like before she realized that it was from the waving of the orange flames in the fireplace there was light from a side room but most of the other rooms on this floor were dark and a lamp from the top of the stairs cast bony shadows of the stair railings on the hallway floor maybe everybody was out back or in a dining room imagine that she thought a house so big youd miss the doorbell a throaty honk above her brynn looked up the light was dim and the sky was shared by birds and mammals mallards on final approach to the lake a few silverhaired bats in their erratic purposeful hunt she smiled at the sight then looking back into the house her eye noted something out of place behind a massive brown armchair a briefcase and backpack lay open and the contentsfiles books penswere dumped on the floor as if theyd been searched for valuables her gut clenched and in a snap came the thought a call cut short an intruder realizes the victim dialed the police and then calls back to say its a false alarm brynn mckenzie drew her weapon she looked behind her fast no voices no footsteps she was stepping back to the car to get her cell phone when she saw something curious inside what is that brynns eyes focused on the edge of a rug in the kitchen but it was glistening how can a rug be shiny blood she was looking at a pool of blood all right think how to handle it heart stuttering she tested the knob the lock had been kicked out cell phone in the car or go inside the blood was fresh three people inside no sign of the intruders somebody could be hurt but alive phone later brynn shoved the door open glancing right and left said nothing didnt announce her presence looking looking everywhere head dizzy she glanced into the lit bedroom to her left a deep breath and she stepped inside keeping her gun close to her side so it couldnt be grabbed as keith had lectured in his class on tactical operations the class where shed met him the room was empty but the bed was mussed and first aid materials were on the floor her misshapen jaw quivering she moved back into the living room where the fire crackled trying to be silent she found the carpet and navigated carefully around the empty briefcase and backpack and file folders scattered on the floor the labels giving clues about the womans professional life haberstrom inc acquisition gibbons v kenosha automotive technologies pascoe inc refinancing hearingcounty redistricting she continued on to the kitchen and stopped fast staring down at the bodies of the young couple on the floor they wore business clothes the shirt and blouse dark with blood both had been shot in the head and the wife in the neck tooshe was the source of the blood the husband had run in panic slipping and falling a skid mark of red led from his shoe to the carpet of blood the wife had turned away to die she lay on her stomach with her right arm twisted behind her a desperate angle as if she were trying to touch an itch above her lower spine where was the friend brynn wondered had she escaped or had the killer taken her upstairs she recalled the light on the second floor had the intruder left the answer to that question came a moment later a voice outside whispered hart the keys arent in the car shes got em it came from toward the front of the house but she couldnt tell where exactly brynn flattened herself against the wall wiped her right palm on her left shoulder then gripped her gun firmly after a moment another voiceharts she supposedspeaking firmly not to his partner but to her you lady in the house bring your keys out here we just want your car is all youll be fine she lifted the gun muzzle up brynn mckenzie had fired a weapon at another human being four times in the decade and a half shed been a public safety officer not a lot but four times more than most deputies did in their whole careers like breathalyzing drivers and comforting beaten wives this was a part of her job and she was filled with an odd blend of tension terror and contentment really hart called dont worry or tell you what just throw em out the front you dont trust us but otherwise we come in and get them believe me we just want to be gone just want to be out of here brynn flicked the kitchen lights out now the only illumination was from the roaring fireplace and the bedroom shed glanced into a whisper its source uncertain this meant theyd joined each other but where and were there just two or more she found herself staring at the bodies of the couple and where was the friend hart again speaking so very calmly youve seen those folks inside you dont want that to happen to you throw the keys out here im telling you not to be stupid please of course the moment she showed herself shed be dead should she say she was a deputy and that more were on their way no dont give yourself away pressing back against the pantry door brynn scanned the back windows they reflected the living room and she gasped softly as a man appeared in the front door slipping inside cautious he was tall solid wearing a dark jacket long hair boots he carried a pistol in histhe reverse image confused her momentarilyhis right hand the other arm hung at his side and she got the impression hed been injured he disappeared somewhere in the living room brynn tensed gripped the pistol in a shooting pose she stared at the reflection at the front of the house go for the shot she told herself your only advantage is surprise use it hes in the living room its only twenty feet step into the doorway fire a burst of three then back to cover you can take him do it now brynn swallowed and stepped away from the wall turning toward the living room she gasped as the voice from behind her in the dining room shouted listen lady you do what were saying a skinny man in a combat jacket with short light hair a tat on his neck and eyes mean had come through the french doors he was lifting a shotgun to his shoulder brynn spinning to face him they fired simultaneously her slug came closer than his buckshothe ducked and she didntpuncturing a stuffed dining room chair inches from him as the pellets from his shotgun crunched into the ceiling above her the light fixture rained down he crawled out the french door hart a gun shes got a gun she wasnt sure these were his exact words though the shots were thunderclap loud and had numbed her ears brynn glanced into the living room no sign of hart she started toward the back kitchen door then paused she couldnt just leave if the feldmans friend was still here im a sheriffs deputy she shouted hello is someone in the house are you upstairs silence brynn desperately scanned the windows shivered sure somebody was aiming at her even as she crouched in the shadows hello nothing is anybody here the longest twenty seconds of her life leave she told herself get help you cant do anything for anybody if youre dead she raced out the back door gasping in fear and from the effort her keys in her left hand she made her way to the front yard she saw no one the sun was down altogether and the darkness was growing fast but there was still just enough light in the sky barely to make out one of the intruders running toward some bushes his back was to her it was the wounded man hart she drew a target but he vanished in a thicket of bearberry and rhododendron brynn scanned the front yard the other man with the shotgun and the narrow face wasnt visible she sprinted for her car when she heard the rustle of bushes from behind her she dropped instantly the shotgun fired pellets hissed around her and clattered off the ford brynn fired twice into the bush breaking the number one rule about never shooting except at a clear target she saw the slight man disappear behind the house running in a crouch then she stood and opened her car door rather than jump in though she remained standing a clear target pointing the black glock at the bushes where hart had fled struggling to steady her breathing and her shooting grip come on come oni can only wait a second or two then hart rose fast from the bushes he was close enough for her to see him blink in surprise that she was waiting for him brynn too was surprised she hadnt been expecting him so far to the right and by the time shed corrected and fired three shots hed dived to cover she believed she mightve hit him but now it was time to escape jumping into the car concentrating on getting the key in the ignition not looking around the engine roared and she slammed the shifter into reverse flooring the limp accelerator the car skittered backward along the gravel whipsawingnow rearwheel drive she glanced behind her to see the men converging in the driveway running flatout after her answering one of her questions shed missed hart after all the skinny man stopped and fired the shotgun the pellets missed our loving savior look over us she whispered an invocation they said as grace every night and that shed never meant more than now brynn had taken the state polices pursuit and evasive driving course several times shed used the techniques often in the highspeed chases when after a speeder or a getaway car this though was the opposite evading an attacker something shed never imagined would happen yet her hours of practice came back to her left hand on the wheel right arm around the passenger seat gripping the pistol two long football fieldsshe came to the end of the driveway and debated turning around to drive in forward or just stay in reverse and back down lake view toward the county road to pause even for five seconds to turn around could be disastrous the men continued to sprint brynn decided stay in reverse and keep going put some distance between them as she approached lake view drive she realized it was the right decision they were closer than shed thought she never heard the shotgun fire again but pellets snapped into the windshield starring it she took the turn onto the private road and accelerated as fast as she dared staring out of the dirty rear window and struggling to keep the car under control it whipped back and forth and threatened to slam into the rocks or trees to the right or tumble down the embankment to the lake on the opposite side of the road but she managed to keep control brynn eased off the gas a little but kept the speed at thirty the transmission was roaring in protest she doubted she could make it to the county road before the gears tore apart shed have to turn around soon the private road was too narrow to do so but she could use the driveway at number it wasnt closethree four hundred yards of the serpentine private roadbut she had no choice her neck stung from twisting to look backward she glanced down at the cup holder goddamn the man whod checked for keys had taken her cell phone she realized she still gripped the gun in her right hand finger around the trigger glocks have a very light pull she set the weapon on the seat brynn looked quickly behind herout the front windshield no sign of them she turned back and steered the car through a curve to the left the house at lake view was now about two hundred yards away the driveway was growing closer she let up on the gas a bit the raging whine of the gears diminished she was thinking pull in fast get into drive and a solid load of buckshot crashed into the drivers side of the car both windows vanishing into hundreds of pieces of ice pelting her a sphere of buckshot stabbed through her right cheek and knocked out a molar she began choking on the tooth and the blood tears flowed and she couldnt see the road any longer wiping her eyes brynn managed to hawk up the tooth and spit it out coughing hard on the blood which spattered the steering wheel slippery as oil she lost her grip and didnt make a curve the car going about thirtyfive dove off the edge and started down the steep rocky hill toward the lake she flew out of her seat her feet nowhere near the brakes as the honda rolled backward down the cliff it dropped about six feet and the trunk slammed onto a shelf of limestone hood pointed straight up in the air the gun hit her in the ear the car balanced for a moment with brynn sprawled across the backs of the two front seats then with the utmost leisure the honda continued to topple belly flopping upside down into the lake the car filled instantly with dark water as it sank brynn stunned was snagged beneath the steering wheel she screamed as the frigid water embraced her body swatting her hands in panic she called out joey joey and inhaled a breath that began as air and ended as water well were fucked lewis said oh man she was a cop dont panic the fuck you talking about she was a cop hart you get your head around that there could be a dozen of em in the woods weve gotta leave my friend leave breathing hard from the run the men had slowed and were walking through the dense woodland toward where theyd seen the car go off the road after lewis had sent a load of shot into the drivers side they moved carefully looking around like soldiers on patrol they had no idea if the woman was out of commission from the crash or was in hiding waiting for them and they couldnt forget about michelle either who mightve been drawn out of hiding by the ruckus she wasnt in a cruiser and she wasnt in a uniform jacket lewis scrunched his face up skeptically i didnt see what she was wearing underneath i was a little busy again sarcastic and im not panicking ill bet she was probably off duty and came up here to check out that nineoneone didnt get the message it was a false alarm lewis snickered you say she wasnt on duty my friend but she was on enough duty to nearly blow your fucking head off he said this as if hed won an argument your head too hart corrected silently he said a lot of cops have to carry their pieces all the time regulation i know that lewis gazed at the lake i heard the bang you know like a crash but i wasnt sure if there was a splash i couldnt hear it go in the water hart nodded toward the winchester and tapped his ear loud i dont usually use shotguns you oughta learn em boy the weapon of choice nothing like a scattergun scares the shit out of folks weapon of choice crouching they continued walking slowly in this morass of trees and tangled brush hart grew disoriented they could see the road but he now had no idea where the car had gone over the side with every step it seemed the vista changed lewis paused rubbed his neck hart looked him over you hit nope right as rain i dodged in time i can sense when bulletsre coming like in the matrix now that was a good flick i have the whole set you see it hart had no idea what he was talking about no jesus you dont get out much do you a crinkle in the bushes nearby lewis swung the shotgun toward the sound something low was in the grass nearby moving fast badger or coyote maybe a dog lewis aimed for it clicked the safety off no no nogive ourselves away and you never shoot anything you dont have tohuman or animal who the hell was this boy lewis muttered we take it out whatever the fuck it is it wont spook us anymore youre spooked im not hart picked up a rock and flung it nearby the animal an indistinct shadow moved off but it moved off slowly as if the men werent worth bothering about crouching hart saw a few paw prints in the mud not normally superstitious he couldnt help thinking that the prints were a warning sign of sorts telling them that theyd strolled casually into a very different universe from what they were used to this is my world the creature whod left the prints was saying you dont belong here youll see things that arent there and miss things thatre coming up right behind you for the first time that night including the gunshot at the house hart felt a trickle of real fear fucking werewolf lewis said then looked back to the lakeshore so shes gone gotta be im saying we gotta keep going get out of here after thathe nodded back to the feldmans houseall bets are off this thing is very fucked up well get a car on the county road take care of the driver and were back in the city in a couple hours he snapped his fingers theatrically hart didnt respond he gestured down the road i want to see if she went for a swim or not lewis sighed exasperated like a teenager but he followed hart they walked stealthily toward the rocky shore in silence pausing every so often the younger man was looking over the lake it was completely shaded by dusk shadow now the water rippling in the breeze like black snake scales he announced that lake i dont like it its freaky talking too loud walking too loud hart thought angrily he decided he had to get some control of the situation itd be a fine line but he had to he whispered you know lewis you shouldntve said anything back there about the keys i couldve gotten up behind her so i gave it away huh its all my fault im saying weve gotta be more careful and when you were in the dining room you started talking to her you shouldve just shot lewiss eyes were good at being defensive and surly at the same time i didnt know she was a cop how the fuck could i know that i stood my ground and nearly took lead there my friend took lead hart thought nobody ever said took lead i hate this fucking place lewis muttered he rubbed the bristle on his head poked the lobe where his earring had been frowned then remembered hed put it away got a thought hart its what a mile back to the county road about that lets get the spare on the ford the front and drive her to the county road drag the bad wheel behind us you see what im saying its frontwheel drive wont be a problem get to the county road somebodyll stop to help ill flag em down then theyll open the window and bang thats it fucker wont know what hit im take their car back home in no time well go to jakes you ever go there eyes on the lake hart said absently dont know it lewis scowled and you call yourself a milwaukee boy best bar in town peering along the shore he said i think it was there he pointed at a spot about fifty yards to the south hart i hit her in the fucking head and her cars in the water shes dead either way from buckshot or drowning maybe hart thought but he couldnt shake the image of her back at the feldmans house standing in the driveway she hadnt scurried away she hadnt panicked shed just stood tall brownish hair pulled back off her forehead the car keyskeys to safety you could sayin one hand her weapon in the other waiting waiting for him to present a target none of that meant she wasnt drowned trapped in a twoton automobile of course at the bottom of the spooky lake but it did mean she wouldnt drown without one hell of a fight hart said before we go anywhere lets just make sure another scowl hart was patient a few minutes wont hurt lets split up you take the right side of the road ill do the left if you see anybody its got to be either one of em so just draw a target and shoot he was going to remind lewis not to say anything just shoot but the skinny man was already bunching his mouth up into a little pout so hart just said okay a nod ill just draw my target and shoot yes sir captain and gave a snide salute her cheek rested against a rock slimy with algae her body was submerged in breathtakingly cold water up to the neck teeth clicking breath staccato cheek swollen it seemed to push her eye out of the socket tears and sour lake water covering her face brynn mckenzie spat blood and oil and gasoline she shook her head to get the water out of her ears had no effect she felt deaf wondered if a piece of buckshot or glass had pierced her eardrum then her left ear popped and tickling water flowed out she heard the lapping of the lake after muscling her way out of the car nestled in twenty feet of opaque water shed tried to swim to the surface but couldnttoo much weight from her clothes and shoes so shed clawed her way to the rocks at the shore and scrabbled upward desperate hands gripping whatever they could find feet kicking shed hit the surface and sucked in air now she told herself get out move brynn pulled up hard but got only a few inches no part of her body was working the way it should and her wet clothes mustve boosted her weight by fifty pounds her hands slipped on the slime and she went under again grabbed another rock pulled herself up to the surface her vision blurred and she started to lose her grip on a rock then forced her muscles to attention im not dying here she believed she actually growled the words aloud brynn finally managed to swing her legs up and found a ledge with her left foot the right one joined in and finally she eased herself onto the shore she rolled through debrismetal and glass and red and clear plasticinto a pile of rotting leaves and branches surrounded by cattails and tall rustling grasses the cold air hurt worse than the water theyll be coming of course those two menll be coming after her they wouldnt know exactly where the car went in but they could find out easily enough you have to move brynn climbed to her knees and tried crawling too slow move she stood and immediately fell over her legs wouldnt cooperate in panic she wondered if shed broken a bone and couldnt feel the injury because of the cold she frisked herself nothing seemed shattered she rose again steadied herself and staggered in the direction of lake view drive her face throbbed she touched the hole in her cheek and with her tongue probed the gap where the molar had been winced spat more blood and my jaw my poor jaw thinking of the impact that had cracked it years ago and later the terrible wire the liquid meals the plastic surgery was all that cosmetic work ruined brynn wanted to cry the ground here was steep rocky narrow stalkswillow maple and oakgrew out of the angular ground horizontally but obeying nature turned immediately skyward using them as grips she pulled herself up the hill toward lake view drive the moon neatly sliced in half was casting some light now and she looked behind her for the glock but if it had flown from the car before the dive the weapon perfectly camouflaged for a dark night was nowhere to be seen she picked up a rock shaped a bit like an ax head gazed at the weapon manically then brynn recalled finding joey bloody and gasping after eighthgrader carl bedermier had challenged him after school acting by rote from her medical training shed examined the wounds pronounced him fine and then said honey there are times to fight and times to run mostly you run so what the hell are you doing she now snapped to herself staring at the chunk of granite in her hand run she dropped the rock and continued up the incline to the private road as she neared the top her foot slipped dislodging an avalanche of shale and gravel it fell in a huge clatter brynn dropped to her belly smelling compost and wet rock but no one came running she wondered if the men were deafened themselves from the shooting probably guns are much louder than people think move fast while you can still take advantage of it another few feet then ten twenty the ground leveled some and she could move faster eventually she was at lake view drive she saw no one on it and crossed fast then rolled into a ditch on the far side hugging herself and gasping no dont stop she thought of a highspeed chase last year bart pinchett in his mustang gt yellow as yolk why didnt you pull over shed muttered ratcheting the cuffs on you knew wed get you sooner or later hed lifted a surprised eyebrow well long as i was moving i was still a free man brynn rolled to her knees and stood she slogged up the hill away from the road and into the trees plunging into a field of tall yellow and brown grass ahead of her two or three hundred yards or so she saw the silhouette of the house at lake view as earlier it was dark would the telephone be on did they even have a telephone brynn gave a brief prayer that they would then she looked around her no sign of the attackers she shook her head again swiveling it from side to side until the second water bead burst which made the sudden soundfootfalls charging through the grass directly toward herall the more vivid brynn gasped and started to sprint away from hart or his partner maybe both when a forsythia branch caught her foot and she went down hard breathlessly hard in a tangle of branches which were covered with yellow buds bright as youd see on wallpaper in a babys bedroom they were driving back from ritas a mile away it seemed to graham that every place in humboldt was a mile away from every other place hed brought joey alongdidnt want to leave him alone because of the skateboard injury even if he was fine and because hed ditch homework for video games instant messaging and myspace on the computer and texting from his iphone the boy wasnt crazy about picking up his grandmother but he was in pretty good humor as he sat in the backseat and textmessaged a friendor half the school to judge from the volume of his keyboarding they collected anna and headed back home there joey charged upstairs taking the steps several at a time homework graham called i will the phone rang brynn he wondered no a name he didnt recognize on caller id hello hi thiss mr raditzky joeys central section advisor middle school was a lot different nowadays graham reflected hed never had advisors and central section sounded like a communist spy organization graham boyd im brynns husband sure how you doing good thanks is ms mckenzie there shes out im afraid can i take a message or can i help you graham had always wanted children he made his living with plants but he had an innate desire to nurture more than that his first wife had decided against motherhood suddenly and emphaticallyand well into the marriage which was a big disappointment to graham he believed he had instinctive skills for parenting and his radar was picking up early warning signals from mr raditzkys tone well i want to talk to you about something did you know joey cut school today and that he was phalting something faintly accusatory in the tone cut school no he was there i dropped him off myself brynn had to be at work early well he did cut mr boyd graham fought the urge to deny go on please joey came to central section this morning gave me a note that he had a doctors appointment and left at ten it was signed by ms mckenzie but after we heard he hurt himself i checked in the office it wasnt her signature he forged it graham now experienced the same unexpected alarm hed felt last summer while wheeling a plant across a customers yard not realizing hed rolled it over a yellow jackets nest blithe and happy enjoying the day unaware that the threat had already been unleashed and dozens of attackers were on their way oh he looked up in the direction of the boys bedroom from it came the muted sounds of a video game homework and what else did you say defaulting the word is apostrophe ph phalting as in asphalt its when kids run up behind a truck at a stoplight with their skateboards and hold on thats how joey hurt himself he wasnt in your school lot no mr boyd one of our substitutes was on her way home she saw him on elden street the highway in downtown humboldt elden was a broad commercial strip but once past the town line it returned to its true nature a truck route between eau claire and green bay where the posted limit meant nothing she said the truck was doing probably forty when he fell hes only alive because there werent any cars close behind him and he veered into a patch of grass couldve been a telephone pole or a building jesus this needs some attention i talked to him it sure does mr raditzky ill tell brynn i know shell want to talk to you thanks mr boyd hows he doing okay scraped up a little hes fine hes one lucky young man though there was an undercurrent of criticism in the mans tone and graham didnt blame him he was about to say goodbye when something else popped into his head mr raditzky graham crafted a credible lie we were just talking about something yesterday was there any fallout from that scuffle joey was in a pause well which one lord how many were there graham hedged i was thinking about the one last fall oh the bad one in october the suspension treading again blithely over a yellow jackets nestbrynnd told him there was a pushing match at the schools halloween party nothing serious graham recalled joey had stayed home afterward for a few daysbecause he hadnt felt well brynn explained but that was a lie it seemed so hed been suspended the teacher said ms mckenzie told you the parents decided not to sue didnt she lawsuitwhat exactly had joey done he said sure but i was mostly wondering about the other student oh he transferred out he was a problem ed what emotionally disturbed hed been taunting joey but thats no excuse for nearly breaking his nose of course not i was just curious you folks dodged a bullet on that one it could have cost you big more criticism now we were lucky graham felt his gut chill what else didnt he know about his family a little pushing match its nothing joey went to the halloween party as a green bay packer and this other boy was a bears fan something silly like that a little rivalry ill keep him out of school for a bit hes got the flu anyway well thanks again for the headsup well have a talk with him when theyd hung up graham got another beer he sipped a bit went into the kitchen to do the dishes he found the task comforting he hated to vacuum hated to dust set him on edge he couldnt say why but he loved doing the dishes water maybe the life blood of a landscaper as he washed and dried he rehearsed a half dozen speeches to joey about cutting school and dangerous skateboard practices he kept refining them but as he put the dishes away he decided the words were stilted artificial they were just thatspeeches it seemed to graham that you needed conversation not lectures he knew instinctively that theyd have no effect on a twelveyearold boy he tried to imagine the two of them sitting down and speaking seriously he couldnt he gave up crafting a talk hell hed let brynn handle it shed insist on that anyway phalting graham dried his hands and went into the family room and sat down on the green couch near annas rocker she asked was that brynn no the school everything okay fine sorry you missed poker tonight graham no problem returning to her knitting anna said glad i went to ritas she doesnt have long a tsk of her tongue and that daughter of hers well you saw didnt you occasionally his softspoken motherinlaw surprised him by letting go with a steely judgment like this one he had no idea what the daughters crime was but he knew anna had considered the offense carefully and come back with a reasonable verdict sure did he flipped a coin for the channel lost and they put on a sitcom which was fine with him his team was toast this season the frantic young woman was in her midtwenties face gaunt and eyes red from tears her stylishly short pixieish hair dark red now disheveled and flecked with leaves her forehead was scratched and her hands shook uncontrollably but only partly from the cold it had been her panicked footsteps brynn had heard not those of an intruder moving toward her through the brush youre their friend brynn whispered feeling huge relief that the woman hadnt met the feldmans fate from chicago she nodded and then gazed out into the deepening dusk as if the men were hot on her trail i dont know what to do she said in a manic voice she seemed childlike her fear was heartrending we stay here for the time being brynn said times to fight and times to run times to hide too brynn looked over at the couples houseguest she wore chic clothes city clothesexpensive jeans and a designer jacket with a beautiful fur collar the leather was supple as silk three gold hoops were in one ear two in the other a stud atop both a sparkling diamond tennis bracelet was on her left wrist and a bejeweled rolex on her other she was about as out of place in this muddy forest as she could possibly be scanning the forest around them brynn could see no movement other than swaying branches and herds of leaves migrating in the breeze the wind was pure torment on her soaked skin over there she finally said pointing to cover the women crawled a dozen feet awayto a cavity beside a fallen chinquapin oak in a snarled area of the forest fifty yards from lake view drive and about a hundred and fifty from the house at number when theyd settled into a nest of forsythia ragweed and sedge brynn looked back toward the road and the feldmans no sign of the killers as if awakening the young woman suddenly focused on brynns uniform blouse youre a policewoman she turned her gaze to the road are there others no im alone she took this news without emotion and then looked at brynns cheek your facei heard gunshots they shot you too like steve and emma her voice choked did you call for help brynn shook her head you have a phone its back there in the house brynn wrapped her arms around herself it did nothing to warm her she looked at the womans supple designer jacket her face was pretty heartshaped her nails were long and perfectly sculpted she could have been on the cover of a grocery store checkout magazine illustrating an article on ten ways to stay fit and sexy the woman dug into her pocket and pulled on tight stylish gloves whose price brynn couldnt even guess at brynn shivered again and was thinking if she didnt get dry and warm soon she might pass out shed never been this cold that house the young woman nodded toward lake view i was going to call for help lets go there lets call the police we can get warm im so damn cold dont want to yet brynn said it seemed less painful to speak in abbreviation dont know where they are wait until we know they could be headed there too the young woman winced you hurt brynn asked my ankle i fell brynn had run plenty of trauma calls she unzipped the womans bootsmade in italy she noticedand examined the joint through her black kneehighs it didnt look badly hurt a sprain probably thank god it wasnt broken she saw a gold ankle bracelet that probably equaled a half dozen of brynns and grahams car payments the young woman stared toward the feldmans house chewing her lip whats your name michelle im brynn mckenzie brynn a nod she usually didnt explain its derivation im a deputy with the county sheriffs office she explained about the call you know who they are those men no brynn whispered her voice growing more distorted need to figure out what to do tell me what happened i met emma after work and we picked up steve and all drove up together got here about five fivethirty i went upstairsi was going to take a showerand i heard these bangs i thought the stove exploded or something or somebody dropped something i didnt know i ran downstairs and saw two men they didnt see me one of themd put down his gun it was on the table near the stairs i just picked it up they were in the kitchen standing over theover the bodies talking just looking down and they had this expression on their faces she shut her eyes whispered i cant even describe it they were like we shot them okay no big deal whats next her voice cracked one of them he was going through the refrigerator as brynn scanned the woods the young woman continued forcing back tears i started to walk toward them i wasnt even thinking i was like numb and one of themone had long hair and one had a crew cutthe one with the long hair started to turn and i guess i just pulled the trigger it just happened there was this bang i dont think i hit them no brynn said one of thems hurt i think one you just mentioned with long hair hurt bad she asked his arm i shouldvei shouldve told them to stop or put their hands up i dont know they started shooting at me and i panicked i just lost it completely i ran outside i didnt have the car keys a disgusted look on her face i did something so stupid i was afraid theyd come after me so i shot out the tires they wouldve just left if i hadnt done that got in the car and left i was so stupid thats all right you did fine nobodyd think straight at a time like that you have the gun still please brynn thought i want a weapon so badly but the woman shook her head i used up all the bullets i threw it into a creek by the house so they couldnt find it and i ran she squinted youre a deputy do you have a gun i did but lost it in the lake suddenly michelle became animated almost giddy you know like i saw this show one time it was on a e or discovery and somebodyd been in a car wreck a bad one and they lost a lot of blood and they were in the wilderness for days they shouldve died but something happened like the body stopped the bleeding itself the doctors saved them and brynn had experienced this mania before at car wrecks and heart attack scenes and knew the implicit question was best answered simply and honestly im sorry i was there in the kitchen i saw them im afraid theyre gone michelle held on to a fragment of hope for a moment longer then let it go she nodded and lowered her head brynn asked you have any idea what they want ow she flinched shed bit her tongue was it robbery eyes lensing with tears i dont know the shivering grew worse consuming brynn michelles perfect fingernails she had noticed were dark from plumcolored polish brynns unpolished were the same shade i understand you and emma worked together are you a lawyer too a shake of her pretty head no i was a paralegal in milwaukee for a while before i moved to chicago thats how we met it was just a way to make some money im really an actress did she ever talk to you about her cases not too much no could bea case at her law firm she mightve found out about a scam or crime of some kind michelle gasped you mean they came up here to kill her on purpose brynn shrugged a snap nearby brynn gasped and turned fast about twenty feet away a badger elegant in its round clumsy way nosed past warily wisconsin the badger state brynn asked michelle will somebody start to wonder if they dont hear from you my husband except hes traveling we said wed talk in the morning thats why i came up here with steve and emma i had the weekend free look brynn was pointing toward the feldman house two flashlight beams were scanning the side yard a quarter mile away theyre back there hurry the other house lets go brynn rose to a crouch both of them staggering forward so the cop had gone into the water hart and lewis had found debris and an oil slick dead gotta be lewisd said looking distastefully at the lake as if he were expecting monsters to slither out im outa here come on hart jakes i need a fucking beer first rounds on you my friend theyd returned to the feldman house the fire in the hearth had burned itself out and hart had shut off all the lights hed put into his pocket all the used medical supplies stained with his blood he didnt bother with the spent shells that littered the house and front yard hed worn gloves when loading the glocks and had watched to make sure lewis had too then he sprayed and wiped everything lewis had come near with his bare hands lewis couldnt resist a snicker at this keep that an irritated hart said pointing to michelles purse lewis slipped it into his combat jacket pocket and took a bottle of vodka from the bar chopin shit this is good stuff he uncorked it and took a drink he lifted the bottle to hart who shook his head because he didnt want any booze just now though lewis took it as a criticism about drinking on the job which was true too at least he wore gloves when handling the bottle you worry too much hart lewis said laughing i know the score my friend i know how they operate in places like this i wouldnt do that in milwaukee or st paul but herethese copsre like andy in mayberry not csi they dont have all that fancy equipment i know how to play it and how not to still hart noted that he wiped the lip of the bottle with his shirtsleeve before replacing it and he saw in that tiny gestureso fast youd miss it easilya clue a telling clue about mr compton lewis he recognized the careless aggressive attitude that hed seen in other menin his brother for instance the source was simple insecurity which can control you the way a pinch collar controls a dog they returned outside lewis went to work on the ford once more getting the spare on the front in place of one of those thatd been shot outso they could drag the other flat on the rear like hed suggested hart reflected on how much the disaster at the house was eating at him blindsided looking for clues he shouldve seen but hadnt he hated incompetence but hated it most when he was the guilty party hart had once canceled a hit in st louis when it turned out that the park his victim used to walk home from worka perfect shooting zonewas a neighborhood playground filled with dozens of energetic little witnesses angrily hed realized that the two times hed surveyed the place in preparation for the kill had been in midmorning while the kids were still in school he now looked around the house and yard there was a possibility that somewhere hed left damning trace evidence but probably lewis was right the cops here werent out of that famous show csicrime scene international or whatever it was called hart didnt watch tv though he knew the idea all that expensive scientific equipment no something more fundamental was bothering him he was thinking back to the paw print and the creature whod left it its disregard for the men whod invaded its territory any challenges here werent about microscopes and computers they were more primitive he felt that tickle of fear again lewis was moving along with the jack and the lug wrench swapping the wheels on the ford he looked at his watch well be back to civilization by tenthirty man i can taste that beer and burger now and returned to the task working fast with his small but clever fingers no alarm brynn whispered grimacing what michelle asked not understanding the mumpy voice she repeated slowly no alarm brynn was looking over the spacious mountain house lake view the owners clearly had money why no security she broke a window in the back door with her elbow unlatched the lock the women hurried into the kitchen brynn walked immediately to the stove and turned on a burner to warm herself risking the light nothing the propane was shut off outside no time to find the valve and turn it on please she thought just have some dry clothes it was cold inside but at least they were protected from the wind and the bones of the house retained a bit of heat from the days sun she touched her facenot the bullet wound but her jaw when the weather was cold or she was tired the reconstructed spot throbbed though she often wondered if the sensation was imaginary weve gotta move fast first look for a phone or a computer we could email or instantmessage joey was always online she was sure she could get a message to him but shed have to phrase it so that hed get the urgency but not be upset thered be no vehicular escape theyd already peered into the garage and found it empty brynn continued and look for weapons not much hunting here with the state park and most of the land posted but they still might have a gun maybe a bow and arrow michelle asked her eyes panicked at the thought of shooting one at a human being i cant do that i wouldnt know how brynn had played with one of the weapons at summer camp once or twice years ago but shed learn to handle it fast if she had to she was considering this fantasy when she noted that michelle had walked away she heard a click and a rumble the sound of a furnace brynn ran into the living room and found the young woman at the thermostat no brynn said her teeth chattering im freezing michelle said why not brynn shut the unit off michelle protested im so cold it hurts tell me about it brynn thought but she said therell be smoke the men could see it its dark out they wont see anything we cant take the chance the woman shrugged resentfully the furnace hadnt been on for more than a few seconds and from the distance the men wouldntve been able to see anything we dont have much time brynn glanced at a clock radio which glowed blue they might decide to come here lets look fast phone computer weapons the darkness outside was now almost complete and the frustration intense maybe their salvation was two feet away a phone or gun but it was impossible to tell they had to search mostly by touch michelle was cautious moving slowly faster brynn urged they have black widow spiders up here i found one in my room when i came to visit steve and emma last year the least of our worries they continued to search frantically for ten minutes through drawers closets baskets of papers and personal junk brynn smiled as she found a nokia but it was an old one no battery and a broken antenna she dumped out all the contents on the rug and felt for a charger nothing damn brynn muttered standing stiffly her face throbbing ill check upstairs keep on looking down here michelle nodded uncertainly not happy about being left alone spiders brynn climbed the stairs her search of the second floor revealed no weapons or phones or computers she didnt bother with the attic a glance out the window revealed flashlights in the yard around the feldman house but the men couldnt be counted on to stay there much longer she longed to turn on a light but didnt dare and continued feeling her way through the bedrooms concentrating on the largest she began ripping open drawers and closet doors and finally found some clothing she stripped off her jacket and the leathery wet uniform and dressed in the darkest clothing she could find two pairs of navy blue sweat pants two mens tshirts and a thick sweatshirt she pulled on dry socksher heels were already blistering from the waterlogged footgearbut had to put on her sheriffs department oxfords again there were no spare shoes she found a thick black ski parka and pulled it on and finally began to feel warmer she wanted to cry the sensation was so comforting in the bathroom she opened the medicine cabinet and felt her way through the bottles until she found a rectangular one she sniffed the contents to make sure it was rubbing alcohol then soaked a wad of toilet paper with it and bathed her wounded cheek she gasped at the pain and her legs buckled swabbed the inside of her mouth too which hurt ten times more she dropped her head before she fainted inhaled deeply okay she whispered as the pain dissolved then pocketed the alcohol ran downstairs any phones or guns anything michelle asked no i lookedbut its so spooky i couldnt go into the basement i was afraid brynn herself took a fast look down there she risked the light but since shed seen no windows she figured it was safe she found nothing helpful though either for communications or defense in what seemed like an endless series of small rooms and passages several small doorways led to what would probably be pretty good hiding places as brynn returned to the kitchen michelle whispered i found those she nodded at a block of kitchen knives chicago cutlery brynn took one about eight inches long she tested the factoryhoned blade with her thumb the deputy looked back at the feldmans saw the flashlight beams still scanning the yard she had a thought gazed around the house didnt we see a pool table somewhere down here michelle gestured toward the dining room through there i think as they walked quickly in that direction brynn said the way i drove up six eightytwo was from the east after clausen i didnt see anything but some trailers and a few shacks in the distance nothing for miles if id kept going west would i have come to some stores or a gas station a place with a phone i dont know i never went that way the women entered the recreation room a spacious place with a bar pool table and thousands of books on builtin shelves beneath the bigscreen tv the cable box showed the time brynn was now warm again curious she reflected she had no direct memory of the cold she recalled how terrible shed felt but couldnt summon up the sensation as intense as it had been she studied the room the sports memorabilia the liquor bottles the family pictures the rack of pool cues the balls aligned in their triangular nest on the table then began rummaging through drawers at the bottom of the bookshelves no weapons no phones lets see if we can find a map they began to scour the shelves and stacks of papers brynn was looking through a bookcase when michelle gave a cry brynn gasped and spun around look somebodys coming the women dropped to their knees by the window brynn could see several hundred yards away headlights moving slowly down lake view drive toward the county highway are there any other houses past the feldmans brynn asked she seemed to recall that there were only three residences here i dont know maybe its a neighbor or the police maybe a police car came to look for you and we missed them if we run we can stop them lets go michelle rose and in a frantic limping rush started for the door wait brynn said in a harsh whisper but theyll be gone in a few minutes her voice was angry we cant wait dont be crazy brynn held up a hand michelle no look the moon was higher now bright enough for them to make out the car it was the killers ford oh no the young woman said through set teeth how can they drive it with the flat tires you shot out two they put the spare on the front and theyll let the other one rim its frontwheel drive theyll just drag the rear look see the dust can they get very far miles yeah if they dont go fast the taillights cast a ghostly red aura in the dust kicked up by the dragging wheel the ford eased around the snaky road and toward the county highway the lights were soon obscured by a tangle of jack pine yew and elegant willow the car vanished michelle hugged herself she sighed with relief so theyre gone itll be okay right we can just wait here we can put the heat on now cant we please sure brynn said staring after the car lets put the heat on lewis piloted the limping ford along lake view drive past the house at number and then turned and continued along the winding road toward the county highway hart said was a good shot you made with that scattergun hitting her car all that distance lewis offered a dismissive sneer but hart saw that the words hit home the punk was pleased i wanted to take her out thats why i was aiming high compensated for the wind too didnt want to hit the tires i didnt hit em you see i did but i led her just right didnt i about four feet and high didnt think shed go out of control whod guess that a moment or two passed lewis said hey hart looking at the woods around him yeah okay what it isi shouldntve said anything about the keys keys in the house with the woman cop i gave it awayyou were right i got excited my brother always said i do things or say something before i think i gotta watch that whodve thought a cop hart nodded at him cant stay on top of everything but you did some fine shooting the car was filled with the smell of hot rubber and metal from the selfdestructing tire it was then that hart glanced back shit he whispered what whatta you see i think its her yeah it is the cop what she got out of the water fuck where is she in that other house the one we just passed number two the cop no shit youre sure in the window yeah i saw her plain as day i cant even see the house was a break in the trees she probably saw us go past and stood up thinking we were gone man that was stupid of her they both there i dont know all i saw was the cop hart was silent a moment lewis kept driving hart continued i dont know what to do were doing pretty good with the tire shes holding up lewis agreed and well be at the highway in ten minutes id love to get the fuck out of here amen course then we miss the chance for some payback jesus that womans slugs came six inches away from my head i dont dodge lead the way you do true too lewis said thinking things over and laughing about the bullet dodging and wouldnt be a bad idea to get things finished up now so we dont have to worry especially since she knows my name hart shrugged but i dont know whatever youre up for get her or not a pause then lewis lifted his foot off the accelerator considering this sure and michelle maybe shes there too fuck her up bad is what i really want my friend okay i say lets do it hart said he looked around again and then pointed ahead to the driveway at lake view shut the lights off and head up there well move around behind shell never guess lewis grinned payback you son of a bitch hart i knew youd be up for it hart gave a short laugh and pulled his pistol from his belt in fact hart hadnt seen anything in the window at number like lewis he couldnt even see the place but instinct had told him that the cop was there he knew shed survived the crash hed seen footprints leading from the lake shed have gone toward the closest shelter she could find the second house on lake view hed concluded none of this hed shared with lewis though hart had been taking soundings for the past couple of hours and knew his partner definitely didnt want to stay here he wanted to head back to milwaukee he talked big about tracking down the two women and taking care of them but hart knew it was just that talk the mand get lazy and forget about ituntil somebody came for him in the middle of the night but if hart had insisted they remain here to hunt the women down lewisd dig his heels in and thered be a fight hart did not need any more enemies tonight but seeing lewis wipe the lip of the bottle back at the feldmans house hart had sized up the younger man and decided he could get lewis to stay here if he played on the mans insecurities complimenting his shooting and making it seem like staying to get the cop was lewiss idea hart was sometimes called the craftsman a reference to his hobby of furniture making and woodworking though the term was usually used by people in his profession the one that had brought him here to lake mondac tonight and the number one rule of craftsmanship is knowing your tools the animate ones like lewis in addition to those made from steel no hart never intended to return to the city without killing these two women even if it took all night or all the next day for that matter even if the place was swarming with cops and rescue workers yes he wanted to kill michelle though that was a lower priority than getting the policewoman she was the one he absolutely had to kill she was the threat hart couldnt forget her standing by her car just standing tall and waiting for him the look on her face a flash of gotcha which mightve been his imagination though he didnt think so like a hunter waiting for just the right moment to take the shot like hart himself only his instant reflex diving to the ground had saved him that and the fact that shed fired onehanded wisely not letting go of her car keys he actually heard a bullet near his ear a pop not a phushhhh like in the movies hart knew he was closer to death at that moment than when michelle had snuck up behind him and taken her shot lewis now continued up the drive of lake view at harts direction he beached the ford in a stand of brush behind the house it was well hidden in the tall grass and shrubs they climbed out and moved west into the woods about thirty feet and then started going north parallel to the private road moving as quickly as they could toward number hart led lewis around a pile of noisy leaves and they picked up the pace staying in the thick of the forest for as long as they could a snap of branches behind them both men spun around lewis readied the shotgun nervously the visitor wasnt human though it was that animal again the one nosing in the grass earlier or a similar one a dog or coyote he supposed or maybe a wolf did they have wolves in wisconsin it kept its distance hart sensed no threat other than the risk of noise that might alert someone in the house this time lewis paid it no mind the creature vanished hart and lewis paused and studied the house for a long moment there was no motion from inside hart thought he heard someone talking but decided it was the wind which brushed over leaves and made the sound of a mournful human voice no light no movement inside had he been wrong in his guess that the cop had come here then he squinted and tapped lewis on the arm a thin trail rose from the heating system exhaust duct next to the chimney lewis smiled they eased closer to the house under cover of thorny berry bushes that stretched from the woods nearly to the back porch hart carried his pistol with his trigger finger pointed forward outside the guard he held the gun casually at his side lewiss grip on the shotgun was tense at the back door they stopped noting the broken glass in the window hart pointed to the porch at their feet two fragments of differing footprints both womens sizes lewis gave a thumbsup he hooked the gun through his left arm and reached in through the broken pane unlatched the lock he swung the door open hart held up a hand whispered as low as he could assume one of em has a weapon and theyre waiting for us lewis gave another of his patented sneers evidencing his low opinion of their enemy but hart lifted an impatient eyebrow and the man mouthed okay and no flashlights another nod then their gun muzzles pointed forward they moved into the house moonlight slanted through the large windows and gave some illumination throughout the first floor they searched quickly in the kitchen hart pointed to the drawers a half dozen were open he tapped the knife block several slots were empty hart heard something he held up a hand frowning tilted his head yes it was voices womens voices very faint hart pointed up the stairs noting that his pulse which had been a little elevated by the trek through the forest was now back to normal stanley mankewitz was eating dinner with his wife in an italian restaurant in milwaukee a place that claimed to serve the best veal in the city that was a meat that troubled both mankewitz and his wife but they were guests of the businessman making up the threesome and so theyd agreed to come here the waiter recommended the veal saltimbocca the veal marsala and the fettuccine with veal bolognese mankewitz ordered a steak his wife picked the salmon their host had the choppedup calf as they waited for their appetizers they toasted with glasses poured from a bottle of barbaresco a spicy wine from the piedmont region of italy the bruschetta and salads came the host tucked his napkin into his collar which seemed tacky but was efficient and mankewitz never put down whatever was efficient mankewitz was hungry but he was tired too he was head of a local unionmaybe the most important on the western shore of lake michigan it was made up of tough demanding workers employed at companies owned by men who were also tough and demanding which words also described mankewitzs life pretty well their host one of the heads of the national union had flown in from new jersey to talk to mankewitz hed offered mankewitz a cigar as they sat in a conference room in the union headquarterswhere nosmoking ordinances werent taken seriouslyand proceeded to tell him that the joint federal and state investigation had better be concluded favorably pretty soon it will be mankewitz had assured guaranteed guaranteed the man from new jersey had said in the same abrupt way hed bitten the tip off his cigar hiding his fury that this prick had flown from newark to deliver his warning like a prissy schoolteacher mankewitz had smiled conveying a confidence he absolutely didnt feel he began spearing his romaine lettuce from the caesar salad dressing on the side but anchovies present and accounted for the dinner was purely social and the conversation meandered as they ate the men talked about the packers and the bears and the giants but delivered mere sound bites aware that a lady was at the table and everyone found the subject of vacationing in door county or the caribbean a more palatable topic the new jersey man offered his anchovies to mankewitz who declined but with a smile as a wave of absolute fury passed through him hatred too hed decided that if their host ever ran for head of the national union mankewitz would make sure his campaign sank like the edmund fitzgerald as the salad plates were noisily whisked away mankewitz noticed a man enter the restaurant by himself and shake his head curtly to the hostess he was in his late thirties with short curly hair and an easy face and looked like a goodnatured hobbit the man oriented himself looking around the underlit and overitalianized place which was owned by ukrainians and staffed by eastern europeans and arabs he finally spotted mankewitz who was hard to miss being pounds with an enviable shock of silver hair they made eye contact the man stepped back into the corridor mankewitz took a slug of wine and wiped his mouth he stood up be right back the labor boss joined the hobbit and they walked toward the banquet rooms tonight empty down a long corridor where the only other presences were effigies pictures of people like dean martin and frank sinatra and james gandolfino all of whose signatures and endorsements of the restaurant in bold marker looked suspiciously similar eventually mankewitz got tired of walking and stopped he said what is it detective the man hesitated as if he didnt want his job title used under these circumstances and mankewitz decided that of course he didnt theres a situation what does that mean situation thats a washington word a corporate word mankewitz had been in a bad mood lately unsurprisingly which prompted the retort but there wasnt much edge to it the hobbit said without a fleck of emotion up in kennesha county the hell is that about two hours northwest of here the cop lowered his voice even more its where the lawyer in the case has a summer house the case capital c the lawyer from got it now mankewitz was concerned about indiscretion and cut the cop off with a wave before he mentioned hartigan reed soames carson whats the story mankewitz had dropped the irritated act which was replaced by a concern that was no act at all apparently what happened was there was a nineoneone call from her husbands phone went to the county were monitoring all communication involving the players the players in the case you told me that i didnt know they were checking all the way out there the systemsre all consolidated how did they do that mankewitz wondered computers of course privacy was fucked as well he knew a call a nineoneone call go on mankewitz looked at a smiling dean martin nobody seems to know what was said it was really brief and then it seemed to get rescinded thats a word cops dont use very often whatta you mean the husband he called back and said it was a mistake mankewitz looked along the dark corridor to where his wife was chatting happily with a tall balding man standing at the table he wondered if the man only stopped by because hed seen mankewitz wasnt at the table determined slick tough pricks he focused on the hobbit so it was an emergency and then it wasnt right thats why it didnt go to anybody on the task force im the only one who knows the records there but its buried i have to ask stan what should i know about mankewitz held his eyes theres nothing you should know about pat maybe it was a fire nineoneonewho knows a fenderbender a breakin a raccoon in the basement ill go out on a limb for you but not walk the plank for what he was slipping into the cops anonymous account the man shouldve been willing to jump off the fucking plank and kill sharks with his bare hands mankewitz happened to notice his wife glancing his way the entrées had arrived he looked back at the cop and said i told you from the beginning theres nothing you have to worry about that was our deal youre completely protected dont do anything stupid stan like what eat here the detective gave a halfhearted grin he nodded at a photo next to them cant be that bad it was sinatras favorite restaurant mankewitz grunted and left the man in the corridor heading for the mens room and fishing a prepaid cell phone out of his pocket on the second floor of the house at lake view were five doors all closed the carpet was home depot oriental and on the walls were posters from an art gallery that was thirty feet of aisle in target or walmart hart and lewis moved with infinite care slowly pausing at each door they finally found the one the womens voices were coming from lewis was staying focused and thank god quiet the words the women were speaking were impossible to make out but it was clear that they didnt seem at all suspicious the men were nearby what the hell were those gals talking about strange allies on a strange night hart wasnt thinking much about that though he was feeling keen satisfaction in the success of the car trick that he was about to kill two human beings meant nothing to him nor did the fact thered be some pleasure in the death of michelle whod shot him or of the policewoman whod tried to no this nearly sexual pleasure he felt was due only to the approaching conclusion of a job hed begun the bloody deaths of two women happened to be that resolution but to him it was no different from that glow he felt when he gave the last finesteelwool buff to the lacquer on a cabinet hed built or dusted herbs on an omelet hed fixed for a woman whod spent the night of course thered be consequences from the deaths his life was about to change and he understood that for instance the cops colleagues would go all out to find her killer he even wondered whether her kinhusband brother or fathermight take the law into their own hands if the local investigators didnt do a very good job finding hart which he suspected they wouldnt but if and when the cops husband say came after him hart would create a plan to deal with that hed execute it and eliminate the problem and feel just as satisfied with the symmetry of conclusion as he was about to now when he fired the fatal bullet into her body hart gingerly tried the knob locked the voices continued unalarmed hart pointed to himself and his good shoulder lewis lowered his mouth to harts ear and whispered your arm ill live with it when im through ill drop down on the floor and give covering fire you come in over me and take them out they have guns you think glancing toward the door why take knives if youve got guns but we oughta count on one of them having a piece lewis nodded and gripped the shotgun eyed the safety the red button showed inside the talking continued casual as could be hart stepped back glanced at lewis who held the muzzle of the winchester skyward and nodded then hunched down like a tackle hart sped forward and flinched as his right shoulder connected with wood with a loud crack the lock popped and the door flew inward but stopped only a few inches inside hart gasped as his head slammed into the oak and he stumbled back stunned the door had hit some barricade inside the bedroom the voices stopped instantly hart shoved the door againit moved no fartherand then snapped to lewis push help me push its blocked the younger man dug his feet into the carpet but the door wouldnt budge no way its blocked solid hart looked around the hall he ran to the bedroom next door to the right and pushed his way inside he searched the room fast it had a french door leading to a deck outside he kicked this open and looked out to the left the deck was thirty feet long and the bedroom where the women hid opened onto it as well via a similar french door there were no stairs off the deck they hadnt escaped this way they were still inside hart called for lewis to join him together they stepped out onto the deck they moved to the first bedroom stopping just short of the windows which were closed shades pulled or curtains drawn and it seemed that other pieces of furniture had been pushed against the windows as barricades the french door beyond the end of the windows was curtained as well considering how best to approach the assault whether the woman would be holding her glock toward the hall or window barricades escape routesfor the women and for hart and lewis lewis was eager to move but hart took his time finally he decided you go down to that door ill stay here and kick this window out and try to push that dresser or table whatever it is out of the way ill fire theyll focus on that then you let go with a couple rounds crossfire hart nodded we got ammo we can afford to use it then well go in through the door okay lewis crouching covered the distance to the door staying low he took a deep breath and glanced back hart nodded kicked in the window with a huge crash and pushed over a small dresser he dodged back as lewis broke out a pane in the door and fired three shotgun rounds into the room shaking the curtains and rattling the glass while hart fired his glock four times in a random pattern he didnt expect to hit anything but he knew it would keep their prey down give him and lewis time to get inside go the men ran through the doorway guns ready they found a room filled with mismatched antiques rustic prints books and magazines stacked on dressers and in baskets but no human beings hart thought for a moment that the women had used the delay to escape by the door to the hallway but it was still blockedby a big dresser it turned out he gestured to the closet lewis pulled the door open and fired a shotgun round inside the noise was deafening wished the man had held back the sudden deafness was freaking hart out he couldnt have heard anybody sneaking up behind him looking around again where the bathroom hart supposed had to be the door was closed lewis stood in front of it hart pointed at lewiss fatiguejacket pocket the man nodded and set down the shotgun and pulled out his silver sigsauer pistol still loud but less deafening than the winchester scattergun he chambered a round and flicked off the safety hart started forward just as he was about to kick in the bathroom door though he paused cocking his head he gestured lewis back wait he mouthed he pulled a drawer out of a dresser and tossed it into the door which snapped open fumes poured from it their eyes stung fiercely and both men began to cough jesus what is that ammonia hart answered like fucking teargas holding his breath hart flicked on the bathroom light well look at this the women had propped a bucket of ammonia on the top of the door so that whoever walked through would get drenchedand possibly blinded luckily the door eased shut by itself and tipped the bucket to the floor before the men arrived a fucking trap he imagined what it wouldve been like to get soaked with the chemical the pain unbearable wiping his eyes hart slammed the door shut and scanned the bedroom look he sighed it wasnt them at all thats what we heard he pointed to a tv the electric cord of the sony was tied around the leg of the dresser and then plugged into the wall outlet when hart had tried to break in the door hed pushed the dresser inward about three inches which had unplugged the tvmaking it seem that the women had stopped talking and presumably were hiding in the room he plugged the cord in again the shopping channel came on women talking hart whispered shaking his head no music just voices they set it up and went out the patio door and through the other bedroom to keep us busy and give em time to get away so they waited in the woods saw us go past andre halfway to the county road maybe but hart wondered too if theyd made it seem like they were escaping to the highway when in fact they were hiding somewhere else in the house hed glanced downstairs earlier the place seemed to have a large basement yes or no he finally decided i think well have to search lewis replaced his pistol in his jacket and picked up the shotgun okay but lets get the fuck out of here he was coughing they pulled the dresser away from the door but hart paused noticed something stuffed under a table it was a pile of wet clothes of course the cop would have changed after her swim in the freezing lake hart looked through the clothes the pockets were empty he examined the front of the shirt the name tag black and etched with white lettering dep brynn mckenzie shed tricked him sure but hart was pleased for some reason he always found knowing the name of his enemy comforting muted gunshots from inside lake view drive snapped like impatient fingers there was a pause and then more shots followed brynn and michelle were approaching the feldmans house which was now completely dark the air was thick with the smell of fireplace flames and loam and rotting leaves the young woman had shut down again sullen and resentful she limped along more slowly using a pool cue as a cane brynn squeezed her arm no response come on michelle we have to move faster the young woman complied but was obviously distraught she seemed put out as if she were the only victim here it reminded her of joeys attitude when brynn insisted he do homework before playing computer games or textmessaging his friends as they neared the house brynn was reflecting on the dispute shed had with michelle back at lake view after agreeing to put the furnace on but shed done that simply to trick the men into believing they were hiding out in the house shed said to the young woman come on were going back to the feldmans place what hurry michelle with her injured ankle and in shock from losing her friends had begged to stay in the house at number hiding even in the spiderfilled basement and waiting for the police acting like a bit of a princess shed resisted heading outside she couldnt understand why brynn felt certain the men would circle back rather than go on to route but brynn was convinced they would do just that the drive to the highway was just a trick but why the young woman had argued adamantly it doesnt make sense brynn explained her logic from what you told me i dont think this was just a random breakin theyre professional killers that means theyre going to come after us they have to we can identify them and that means were a link to whoever hired them so theyre doubly desperate to find us if they dont their boss is going to come after them brynn didnt however tell her that there was another basis for her conclusion the man named hart he wasnt going away shed recalled how confident hed sounded talking to her in the house unemotional and fully prepared to kill her without a seconds hesitation when she showed herself hart reminded her of the surgeon who in a perfectly even voice explained how her father had died during exploratory surgery more chillingly though he reminded brynn of her exhusband harts look was the same as in keiths face once when she found him slipping a pistol she didnt recognize into the lockbox in the bedroom shed asked about it and the state trooper had hesitated but confessed to her that fellow officers would sometimes pocket a weapon found at crime scenes if it wasnt necessary evidence theyd collect them just to have keith had explained you meanyou mean to plant them on a perpso you can say you shot him in selfdefense her husband hadnt answered but hed glanced at her with a look that was identical to harts in that instant he rose from the foliage holding his pistol and looking for a target there was something else in the glance too brynn decided admiration maybe and a challenge too may the best person win assuming the men would return to the house where she and michelle were hiding brynn had set the tv to a shopping network blocked the door with a dresser and rigged the power cord around the leg then shed found a bottle of ammonia and poured it on the floor alongside a bucket to make it look as though shed set a trap that would make hart and his partner wary thinking she was willing to blind her pursuersthough in reality she would not risk hurting the homeowners or rescue workers later theyd grabbed a few other things which they now carried weapons each woman had a sock containing a billiard balllike a south american bolo throwing weapon which brynn had learned about helping joey with a project on argentina for school they also had chicago cutlery knives in their pockets wrapped in sock scabbards and brynn carried a pool cue at the end of which was taped a teninchlong chicago cutlery carving knife michelle had taken the weapons reluctantly but brynn had insisted and the young woman had grudgingly agreed then theyd slipped into the woods behind the house and turned north back toward the feldmans place picking their way carefully through the boggy ground and using logs and rocks as steppingstones to climb over the streams that ran to the lake now keeping under cover in the yard of her friends house michelle was staring south toward the gunshots she muttered to brynn why did you want to come back here we shouldve gone the other way to the county road now weve got to go past them to get there were not going that way what do you mean its the only way to the county road brynn shook her head i was on six eightytwo for nearly a half hour and i saw three cars and that was at rush hour wed have to risk walking on the shoulder in the open for who knows how long theyd find us there for sure but werent there some houses on the highway well go there call nineoneone we cant go to any of them brynn said i wont lead those men to somebody elses place i dont want anybody else hurt michelle was silent staring at the feldmans house thats crazy we have to get out of here were going to get out just not the way we came in well why arent there more police here she snapped whyd you just come here by yourself the police wouldnt do it that way in chicago the young womans voice was positively surly brynn tamped down her irritation she squinted as she looked past her and pointed in the house at lake view she could make out two flashlight beams one upstairs one on the ground floor scanning eerily the men were both in the house searching for them keep an eye on the flashlights im going to look inside did steven have a gun i have no idea michelle scoffed they really werent the gun type wheres your cell phone brynn asked in my purse in the kitchen as brynn sprinted for the porch she glanced back and could see the young womans eyes just visible in the moonlight yes there was a measure of sorrowthat her friends had died but it was the putupon expression brynn sometimes recognized in her son during one of his irritated moments the expression that asked why me life just isnt fair nothing spoken in a whisper in the basement of the house at lake view drive hart nodded acknowledging the comment by lewis who was sweeping his flashlight around a dark storage area which would have been perfect for hiding in and had been pretty much their last hope of finding the women in the house hart was feeling more confident it was likely that the women were no longer armed a conclusion hed come to by default otherwise they would have lain in wait and shot the men still hed insisted they use flashlights and not put on the overhead lights once hart had seen a movement spun around and fired but the target turned out to be just a fleeing rat its shadow magnified a dozen times the creature scurried away hart was angry with himself for the panicked shot hed hurt his injured arm in the maneuver and theyd been temporarily deafened again angry too for the loss of control sure it was logical the sudden motion jumping toward him it seemed naturally hed fired but excuses always tasted bad in harts mouth you had nobody to blame but yourself if you cut the plank wrong or planed a bow into a chair leg meant to be straight or split a dovetail joint measure twice cut once his father used to say they trooped upstairs into the dark kitchen hart was looking out the back windows and into the forest wondering if he was staring right at the women wasted some good minutes searching thats why they set up that little scene in the bedroom buy time and to blind us he could smell the ammonia all the way down here even with the upstairs bedroom door closed then hart mused but where are they where would i go if i was them the woods snuck past us andre making for the highway hart agreed yep thats what id guess theres no other way out theyll be thinking they can hail a car but there wont be much traffic this time of night hell there wasnt much on the way up here and theyll have to stick close to the shoulder out in the open and that blood on brynns uniform shes hurt be moving slowly well spot em easy brynn mckenzie was making a fast sweep through the feldmans house she left the lights out of course and searched by feel for weapons and cell phones she found none michelles purse was gone which meant the killers had itand that theyd now know her name and where she lived brynn walked into the kitchen where the bodies lay in their death poses the blood making a paisley pattern next to the husband and a nearperfect circle around the wife brynn hesitated briefly and then knelt and searched their pockets for cell phones none she tried the jackets similarly empty she then stood and looked down at them wished there were time to say some words though she had no idea what did the couple have laptop computers she looked at the briefcase on the floorit was the womansand at the pile of file folders all stamped with the word confidential but no electronics the husband apparently used a backpack for his briefcase but that had contained only a few magazines a paperback novel and a bottle of wine brynns feet were beginning to sting again from chafing the lake water had soaked through the dry socks she looked in the laundry room and found two pairs of hiking boots she pulled on dry socks and the larger of the boots she took the second pair for michelle she also found a candle lighter and slipped that in her pocket was there anything she gasped in shock outside the croak of frogs and the whisper of wind vanished in the insistent blare of a car alarm then michelles desperate voice calling brynn come here help me brynn ran outside gripping her makeshift spear blade forward michelle was standing beside the mercedes the window shattered the young woman was frantic wideeyed and paralyzed brynn ran to the car glancing at the house at number the flashlights went out theyre on their way great im sorry michelle cried i didnt think i didnt think brynn ripped the passenger door open popped the hood and ran to the front of the car shed made a point to learn all she could about cars and trucksvehicles make up the majority of police work in a county like kenneshaand her studies included mechanics as well as driving brynn struggled to work the cable off the positive terminal of the battery with the chicago cutlery knife the piercing sound stopped what happened i just michelle moaned angrily its not my fault no whose was it she continued i have low blood sugar i was feeling funny i brought some crackers with me she pointed to a bag of whole foodsbrand snacks in the backseat she said defensively if i dont get food sometimes i faint okay said brynn whod avoided breaking into and searching the mercedes specifically because shed known it would be alarmed she now climbed in fast grabbed the crackers and handed them to michelle then rifled through the glove compartment nothing helpful she muttered youre mad she said her voice an irritating whine im sorry i said i was sorry its okay but we have to move fast theyre on their way she handed michelle the boots shed found inside the smaller pair which should fit fine michelles own boots were chic and stylish with spiky threeinch heelsjust the sort for a young professional but useless footgear for fleeing from killers michelle stared at the fleece boots she didnt move hurry mine are fine no theyre not you cant wear those a nod at the designer footwear michelle said i dont like to wear other peoples clothes itsgross her voice was a hollow whisper maybe she meant dead peoples clothes a glance toward number no sign of the men not yet im sorry michelle i know its upsetting but you have to and now im fine with these no you cant especially with a hurt ankle another hesitation it was as if the woman were a pouty eightyearold brynn took her firmly by the shoulders michelle they could be here any minute we dont have any choice her voice was harsh put the goddamn boots on now a long moment michelles jaw trembling eyes red she snatched away the hiking boots and leaned against the mercedes to put them on brynn jogged to the garage and found beside it what shed seen when shed arrived a canoe under a tarp she hefted it the fiberglass boat wasnt more than forty or fifty pounds although yahoos estimate was accurate and two hundred yards separated them from the shoreline a stream was only about thirty feet from the house and it ran pretty much straight to the lake in the garage she found life preservers and paddles michelle was staring down at her friends boots grimacing she looked like a rich customer whod been sold inferior footwear and was about to complain to the store manager brynn snapped come on help me michelle glanced back toward the house at lake view and her face troubled shoved the crackers in her pocket then hurried to the canoe the two women dragged it to the stream michelle climbed in with her pool cue walking stick and brynn handed her the spear paddles and life vests with a look back at the morass of forest through which the killers were surely sprinting right now the deputy climbed in and shoved off into the stream a dark artery seeping toward a dark heart the men ran through the night sucking in cold damp air rich with the smell of rotting leaves at the sound of the horn hart had realized that rather than head for the county road like hed thought the women had snuck back to the feldman house theyd probably broken into the mercedes hoping to fix the tire not thinking the car was alarmed he and lewis had started running directly for the place but immediately encountered bogs and some wide streams hart started to ford one but lewis said no your feetll chafe bad gotta keep em dry hart never an outdoorsman hadnt thought about that the men returned to the driveway and jogged to lake view drive and then north toward number we goup careful hart said out of breath when they were halfway to the feldmans driveway stillcould be a trap the jogging was hell on his wounded arm he winced and tried moving it into different positions nothing helped a trap stillworried about a gun lewis seemed a lot less obnoxious now sure they slowed at the mailbox then started up the drive hart first both of them sticking to the shadows lewis was silent thank god the kid was catching on if you could call a thirtyfiveyearold a kid hart thought again of his brother about fifty feet up the driveway they paused hart scanned what they could see which wasnt much because of the dusk bats swooped nearby and some other creature zipped past his head floating down to a scampering landing hell a flying squirrel hartd never seen one he was squinting at the mercedes noting the broken window he saw no signs of the women it was lewis who spotted them he happened to look back down the driveway toward the private road hart look whats that he turned half expecting to see brynn rising from the bushes about to fire that black service piece of hers but he saw nothing what there they are on the lake hart turned to look about two hundred feet into the lake was a low boat a skiff or canoe it was moving toward the opposite shore but very slowly it was hard to see for certain but he thought there were two people in it brynn and michelle had seen the men stopped paddling and hunched down keeping a low profile the momentum was carrying them toward the opposite shore lewis said that alarm it wasnt a mistake it was to distract us so they could get away in the fucking boat the man had made a good catch hart hadnt even been looking at the lake he bridled once again at being outguessedand he decided it was probably brynn whod tried to trick them the men ran down to the shore too far for the scattergun lewis said grimacing disappointed and im not much of a pistol shot but hart was he went to a range at least once a week now holding his gun in one hand he began firing slowly adjusting the elevation of the barrel as he did so the sharp detonation rolled across the lake with each shot and returned as a pale echo the first and second kicked up water in front of the boat the rest did not they were right on target one shot every few seconds the bullets pelted the canoe sending fragments of wood or fiberglass into the air he mustve hit at least one of themhe saw her slump forward and heard a womans panicked scream filling the damp air more shots the wailing stopped abruptly the canoe capsized and sank hart reloaded nothings moving lewis said shouting because of their numb ears you got em hart well we gotta make sure hart nodded at a small skiff nearby can you row sure lewis answered bring some rocks to weigh the bodies down that was some fine shooting hart i mean really lewis muscled the small boat upright but hart wasnt thinking about marksmanship shooting was just a skill and in this business you had to be good at it just like you couldnt be a carpenter without knowing how to plane or lathe no he was recalling his earlier thoughts now that the evenings mission was finished he had to turn his attention to what came next how to anticipate and prepare for the hard consequences that would flow from these womens deaths because hart knew they surely would graham boyd sat forward on the green couch frowning looking not at the tv screen but at an antiqued table nearby splotched in white and gold under which sat a box containing the only knitting project hed ever known brynn to tacklea sweater for a niece shed given it up years ago after six inches of uneven sleeve anna looked up from her own knitting i let it go for a while her soninlaw lifted an eyebrow she traded the big blue needles for a remote control turned down the volume once again graham caught a glimpse of a tougher core within her than the spun hair and faint smile in her powdered face suggested you might as well tell me ill get it out of you sooner or later what the hell was she talking about he looked away at some nonsense on the flat screen her eyes didnt leave him that call right the one from the school he started to say something then paused but he went ahead finally was a little worse than i let on thought so he explained what joeys section advisor had saidabout the boys cutting school the forgery the phalting and even the suspension last fall and there were some other fights he got into too i didnt have the heart to ask his advisor about it well which one ah anna nodded i had a feeling you did she retrieved the knitting project whatre you going to do about it graham shrugged he sat back had an idea to talk to him but ill leave that for brynn let her handle it been eating at you i could see you didnt laugh once at drew carey if thiss happened once its happened before cutting class dont you think most likely my experience with children anna was speaking from knowledge brynn had an older brother and a younger sister a teacher and computer salesperson respectively pleasant kind people fun people conventional brynn tended to swim upstream more than her siblings anna mckenzie now dropped the hallmarkchannel demeanor which she donned like camouflage when needed the tone in her voice changed day to night what i want to say you never discipline him graham after keith i never knew whether to do this or that youre not keith thank god dont worry brynn doesnt let me or thats the message i get and i never pushed i dont want to undermine her hes her son not just she reminded quickly hes your boy too now you get the whole packageeven came with an ornery old lady you hadnt bargained for he gave a laugh but i want to be careful joeyi know he had a tough time with the divorce who doesnt thats life no reason for you to be a shrinking violet when it comes to him maybe youre right i am go up and see him now she added maybe its the best thing in the world brynn went out on that call tonight give you two a chance to talk what do i say i tried coming up with something it was stupid go with your instincts if it feels right it probably is thats what i did with my children got some things right and some things wrong obviously the last word was heavily seasoned you think i think somebodys got to be in charge he cant be and brynn the woman said nothing more any advice anna laughed hes the child youre the adult graham supposed that was a brilliant insight but it didnt seem to help evidently she could see he was confused play it by ear graham exhaled and walked upstairs the steps creaking under his big frame he knocked on the boys door and entered without waiting for a response which hed never done before joeys round freckled face looked up from his desk dominated by a large flatscreen monitor hed put his knit hat back on like a rapper he was apparently instantmessaging with a friend a webcam was involved graham didnt like it that the friend could see him see the room hows the homework coming finished he typed away not looking at the keyboard or at graham on the wall was a series of still pictures from the gus van sant movie paranoid park about skateboarders in portland joey must have printed them out it was a good moviefor adults graham had protested about their taking the boy but joey had become obsessed with the movie and sulked until brynn had acquiesced as it turned out though theyd fled the theater after one particularly horrific scene graham had dodged the incident that a toldyouso would have bought though he came real close to telling his wife that next time she should listen to him whos that graham asked glancing at the screen who youre iming just some guy joey tony the boy continued to stare at the screen grahams secretary could type words a minute joey seemed to be going faster worried it might be an adult graham asked tony who in my you know class tony metzer his tone suggested that graham had met him though he knew he hadnt were like into turbo planet he cant get past level six i can get to eight im helping him well its late thats enough iming for tonight joey continued typing and graham wondered if he was being defiant or just saying goodbye would this become a fight the mans palms sweated hed fired employees for theft hed faced down a burglar whod broken into the office hed stopped knife fights among his workers none of those incidents had made him as nervous as this after some fast keystrokes the computer screen went back to the desktop the boy looked up pleasantly asking what now hows the arm good the boy picked up his game controller pushed buttons so fast his fingers were a blur joey had dozens of electronic gadgetsmp players ipod cell phone computer he seemed to have plenty of friends but he communicated more with his fingers than with words spoken facetoface you want some aspirin naw its okay the boy concentrated on the game but his stepfather could see hed grown wary grahams first thought was to trick the boy into confessing about the phalting but that seemed to go against the instinct that anna had told him to rely on he thought back to his dishpan reflections dialogue not confrontation the boy was silent the only noise was the click of the controller and the electronic bass beat of the sound track of the game as a cartoon character strolled along a fantastical road okay get to it joey can i ask you why you skip school skip school why are there problems with teachers maybe with some other students i dont skip i heard from the school you skipped today no i didnt he kept playing on the computer i think you did no the boy said credibly i didnt graham saw a major flaw with the dialogue approach youve never skipped i dont know like once i got sick on the way to school and i came home mom was at work and i couldnt get her you can always call me my companys five minutes from here and fifteen minutes from school i can be there in no time but you cant sign me out yes i can im on the list your mother put me on the list didnt the boy know that tell you what joey shut that off shut it off yeah shut it off im nearly to no come on shut it off he continued to play or ill unplug it graham rose and reached for the cord joey stared at him no thatll dump the memory dont ill save it he continued to play for a momenta dense twenty secondsand then hit some buttons and with a deflating computergenerated sound the screen froze graham sat down on the bed near the boy i know you and your mother talked about your accident today did you tell her you skipped school graham was wondering if brynn knew and hadnt told him i didnt skip school i talked to mr raditzky he says you forged the note from your mother hes lying eyes evasive why would he lie he doesnt like me he sounded pretty concerned about you you just dont get it apparently thinking that this was irrefutable proof of his innocence he turned back to the frozen screen a creature of some sort bounced up and down running in place the boy eyed the game controller he didnt go for it joey somebody from school saw you phalting on elden street the boys eyes flickered theyre lying too it was rad right hes making that up i dont think they were joey i think they saw you on your board going forty miles an hour down elden street when you wiped out he bounced onto his bed past graham and pulled a book off the shelf so you didnt tell your mother you cut and you didnt tell her you were phalting did you i wasnt phalting i was just boarding i went off the parking lot steps is that where you had the accident today a pause not really but i dont phalt have you ever no graham was at a complete loss this was going nowhere instinct wheres your board joey glanced at graham and said nothing turned back to the book where his stepfather asked adamantly i dont know graham opened the closet where the boys skateboard was sitting on a pile of athletic shoes no more boarding this month mom said two days graham thought brynn had said three one month and you have to promise that youre never going to phalt again i dont phalt joey thiss such bullshit dont say that to me mom doesnt mind was that true well i do you cant stop me youre not my father graham felt an urge to argue to explain about authority and hierarchy and family units his and the boys respective roles in the household an argument on the merits though seemed like an automatic loss instinct he reminded himself okay lets see what happens are you going to tell me the truth i am telling the truth the boy raged and started to cry grahams heart was pounding furiously was he being honest this was so hard he tried to keep his voice steady joey your mother and i love you very much we were both worried sick about you when we heard youd been hurt you dont love me nobody does the tears stopped as quickly as theyd started and he slouched back reading his book joey graham leaned forward im doing this because i care about you he smiled come on brush your teeth put on your pjs time for bed the boy didnt move his eyes were frantically scanning words he wasnt even seeing graham rose and left the room carrying the skateboard he headed downstairs fighting the urge with every step to go back and apologize and beg the boy to be happy and forgive him but instinct won graham continued to the ground floor put the skateboard on the top shelf of the closet anna watched him she seemed amused graham didnt think anything was funny whenll brynn be home his motherinlaw asked he looked at his watch soon id guess shell probably get dinner but shell eat in the car she shouldnt do that not on those roads at night you look down for one minute pick up your sandwich and theres a deer in front of you or a bear jamie henderson nearly hit one it was just there i heard that i think big one big enough a nod toward the ceiling howd it go not good she continued to give him a halfsmile what he asked irritated its a start graham rolled his eyes i dont think so trust me sometimes just delivering a message is the important thing whatever that message is remember that he picked up the phone and dialed brynn again it went right to voice mail he tossed the phone on the table and stared absently at the tv screen thinking again about the yellow jackets how hed been going about his business wheeling a big shaggy plant enjoying the day never realizing that hed trod on the nest ten feet back never realizing it until the hard little dots with their fiery stingers were all over him he thought now and why does it even matter just let it go graham reached for the remote control upstairs a door slammed brynn and michelle were making their way through scruffy tangled forest about three hundred yards north of the feldmans house here the trees were denser mostly lush pine spruce and fir the view of the lake was cut off the car alarm had been an unfortunate mistake but since it had happened brynn hoped that shed turned it around to work to their advantage making the men think that it was an intentional distraction and that the women were escaping by canoe to the far shore of the lake in fact though theyd used the boat only to paddle downstream a short distance and cross to the opposite shore of the creek theyd propped up life preservers to look like two huddling passengers and then shoved the canoe into the speedy current which propelled the vessel into the lake theyd then hurried as best they could given michelles ankle away from the lake house enclave north toward marquette state park when the gunfire came as brynn expected she was ready and let go a fierce harrowing scream then abruptly stopped as if shot shed known the men would be half deafened and with the confusing echoes from the hills couldnt tell that the scream had come from someplace else entirely the trick might not fool them for long but she was sure shed bought some time can we stop now michelle asked why does your ankle hurt well sure it does but i mean lets just wait here theyll be gone soon she was eating her snack crackers brynn looked at them michelle reluctantly it seemed offered her some she ate a handful hungrily we cant stop we have to keep going where north what does north mean is there a cabin that way or something or a phone were getting as far away from them as we can into the park michelle slowed look at this place its all a mess its tangled andwell a mess there arent any paths its freezing and you in that twothousanddollar coatcomplaining brynn reflected theres a ranger station maybe four five miles from here five miles shhh thats bullshit we cant walk five miles through this youre in good shape you run right on a treadmill at my health club not in places like this and which way do we go im already lost i know the general direction the woods i cant we dont have any choice you dont understand im afraid of snakes theyre more afraid of you believe me michelle displayed the crackers this isnt going to be enough food do you know about hypoglycemia everyone thinks its nothing but i could faint brynn said firmly michelle there are men out there who want to kill us snakes and your blood sugar really come pretty low on the scale of problems here i cant do it the woman reminded brynn of joeys first day at elementary school hed planted his feet and refused to go it took two days for her to persuade him to attend in fact brynn now recognized similar signs of hysteria in michelles face the young woman stopped walking altogether her eyes were wide and she gestured broadly with twitchy hands i shop at whole foods i buy coffee at starbucks this isnt me this isnt my world i cant do it michelle brynn said gently itll be okay its only a state park thousands of people come through here every summer on the paths the trails and were going to find one but people get lost i saw this thing on tv this couple got lost and they froze to death and the animals ate their bodies michelle no i dont want to go lets hide here well find a place please she looked as if she was going to cry brynn remembered that the poor woman had seen her friends shot downand had nearly been killed herself she tried to be patient no that one man at least hart hell come after us as soon as he finds we tricked em with the boat he wont know for sure we came this way but he might guess michelle looked back her eyes zipping around in panic her breath fast okay michelle ate another handful of crackers not offering any to brynn and then shoved them back into her pocket she gave a disgusted grimace all right you win with one more glance back the women started their trek moving as fast as they could picking their way around the tangles many of which would be impossible to get through even with machetes there were plenty of conifer woods though and it was possible to find flat routes unobstructed by steelwool underbrush they continued on away from the houses michelle doing a fair job of keeping up the pace despite the limp brynn gripped her spear firmly feeling both confident and ridiculous because of the weapon soon theyd covered another quarter mile then a half brynn started and spun around shed heard a voice but it was only michelle muttering to herself her face ghostly in the blue moonlight brynn too had the habit of selfdialog shed lost her father to disease and a dear friend in the department to a drunk driver and shed lost a husband too she had talked to herself during those times of sorrow praying for strength or just plain rambling for some reason shed found words made pain less painful shed done the same just that afternoon with joey in the xray unit at the hospital she couldnt remember what shed said then they skirted scummy ponds choked with bog bean and cranberry she was surprised to see a swath of moonlight illuminate a cluster of pitcher plantsa carnivore brynn had learned about when helping joey with a report for school frogs screeched urgently and birds gave mournful calls it was too early in the season for mosquitoes thank the lord brynn was a magnet and in the summer wore citronella like perfume reassuring herself now as much as michelle brynn whispered ive been to the park on two searchandrescues here shed volunteered for the assignments to put to use some of the expertise shed picked up at the state police tactical training seminars which included an optionaland extremely exhausting and painfulminisurvival course one of the two searchandrescues here had actually become a very unpleasant bodyrecovery operation but brynn didnt mention that i dont know the place real well but i have a rough idea of the layout the joliet trails near here someplace no more than a mile or two you know it michelle shook her head eyes on the bed of pine needles in front of her feet she wiped her nose on her sleeve the trailll take us to that ranger station itll be closed now but we could find a phone or a gun there the station was brynns first choice but she went on to explain if they missed the building or couldnt break into it they could continue on the joliet which angled northeast till it crossed the snake river we can follow the river east to point of rocks thats a goodsized town on the other side of the park theyll have storesfor a phoneand a public safety office of some kind probably parttime but we can wake em up it s a ways six or seven miles but we can follow the river and its pretty flat walking the other option when we hit the snake is to turn west and climb the rocks along the snake river gorge thatll take us to the interstate by the bridge theres traffic all the time there a trucker or somebodyll stop for us climb the rocks michelle muttered im afraid of heights so was brynn though that hadnt stopped her rappelling down a sheer cliff face to a waiting keg of old milwaukeethe traditional graduation exercise in the state police course and the climb at the gorge would be steep and dangerous the bridge was nearly one hundred feet above the river and the rocks were often nearly vertical faces it was in that part of the park where the body the law officers had been searching for had been recovered a young man had lost his footing the fall was only twenty feet but hed been impaled on a sharp tree limb the coroner said it probably took him twenty minutes to die to this day brynn mckenzie was haunted by the image as they moved from the pine into ancient forestdenser and slathered in darknessbrynn tried to pick out the route that would be easiest on michelles ankle but the way was often impacted with rooty brush tangles of saplings and vines forcing them around some they just had to fight their way through and some routes were so dim they avoided them completely for fear of missing a steep dropoff or deep bog and always reminders that they werent really alone bats zipped by owls hooted brynn gasped when she trod on the end of a deer rib rack which swung up and clapped her in the knee she danced away from the bleached chewed bone the scarred skull of the animal was nearby michelle stared at the skeletal remains eyes wide without response lets go its just bones they pushed through the tangled wilderness for another hundred yards suddenly michelle stumbled grabbed a branch to support herself and winced whats the matter she ripped off her thin glove staring at her hand two thorns from the branch had punctured her palm and broken off into her skin her eyes flushed with horror no no its just blackberry youre fine here let me look no dont touch it but brynn took the womans hand and flicked the candle lighter over the skin examining the tiny wounds we just want to get them out so it doesnt get infected in five minutes you wont feel a thing brynn eased the thorns out of her skin and the woman winced whimpering and staring at the growing dots of blood brynn pulled out the bottle of alcohol dampened the edge of a sock with it and started to bathe the wounds she couldnt help notice the dark artistic nails let me do it michelle said and dabbed at the skin she handed back the sock and found a tissue in her pocket pressed it onto the wound by the time she lifted it away the bleeding had almost stopped how is it its okay michelle said youre right it doesnt hurt anymore they continued on their route heading in the direction that brynn pointed sure she thought hart would pursue them and theyd have to remain vigilant but hed have no idea where they were headed the women could have gone in any direction except south to the county roadsince theyd have to sneak around the killers to get there with every passing yard brynn grew more confident at least she knew something about the forest and where the trail ahead of them lay the men did not and even if hart and his partner happened to choose this direction the men would surely find themselves lost in ten minutes back on the shore near the feldman house hart was looking over the gps function on his blackberry then he consulted the map of the area theyd brought with them the joliet trail he announced whats that where theyre headed ah lewis said you think yep he held up the map were here he tapped a spot then moved his finger north that brown lines the trail itll take em right to that ranger station there lewis was distracted he was looking over the lake that was smart i gotta say what they did hart didnt disagree their short row into the lake had revealed that the women had propped up life vests to resemble bodies hunched down in the canoe and then shoved the boat into the water the screamat the sound of the shotswas ingenious had brynn or michelle uttered the sound brynn he bet hart wasnt used to having to outthink his opponents part of him liked the challenge but a bigger part liked being in control the contests he preferred were those in which he had a pretty good idea that the outcome would be in his favor like working with ebony the wood was temperamentalhard and brittleand could split easily wasting hundreds of dollars but if you took your time you were careful you foresaw any potential problems the end result was beautiful what kind of challenge was brynn mckenzie smelling the ammonia hearing the crack crack crack of her gun ebony of course his aching arm prodded him to think too and what kind was michelle that would remain to be seen so youre thinking of going after them lewis asked he opened his mouth and puffed out a bit of steam yep i gotta say hart this isnt what i planned on putting it mildly lewis continued everythings changed that bitch shooting you trying to shoot me the copyou or me in that bathroom the ammonia trap if itd worked one of usd be blinded and that shot in the house the cop missed me by inches i can dodge bullets hart said nothing he wasnt riled up the way lewis was the women were just being true to their nature like that animal hed seen of course theyd fight back so thats what im thinking lewis said i just want to get the hell out of here shes a cop hart lives round here she knows this place shes halfway to that ranger station or something right now theyll have phones in the park so weve gotta get outa here now back to milwaukee whoever that girl is michelle shes sure as hell not going to id us shes not stupid he tapped his pocket where her purse containing her name and address rested and the cop didnt really get a good look at us so back to plan a get to the highway jack a car whatta you say hart grimaced well lewis i am tempted yes i am but we cant hmm well im inclined to think otherwise lewis was speaking softly now more reasonable less surly we have to get them have to why wheres that written down look youre thinking im scared well im not tonight against two women thiss nothing let me tell you a story i did a bank job in madison last year banks never done a bank we got fifty thousand thats pretty good the average bank robbery take nationwide was another stat hart knew percent of the perps were arrested within one week yep was so this guard wanted to be a hero had a backup gun on his ankle hed been a cop what i figured exactly came out shooting i covered the other guys right out in the open kept him down i didnt even crouch he laughed shaking his head one of my crew the driver was so freaked he dropped the keys in the snow took a couple minutes to find them but i held that guard off even stayed upright while i reloaded and we could hear sirens in the distance but we got away he fell silent to let hart digest this then im talking about what makes sense you stand your ground when you need to you get the hell out when you need to and then take care of em later another tap of michelles purse nothing goods going to come of this he repeated everythings changed a mournful call filled the moist air a bird of some sort hart guessed waterfowl or owl or hawk he couldnt tell them apart he squatted down pushed his hair off his forehead lewis im thinking that nothing has changed not really sure it has the minute she tried to cap you it all went to shit in there a nod back at the house and a skeptical glance but its shit we couldve foreseen we shouldve foreseen look when you make a choicesigning on for this job for instancetheres a whole slew of consequences that can follow things could go left they could go right or what happened tonight they could turn around and slug you in the gut or shoot you in the arm nobody forced me to live this kind of life or you either but we chose it and that makes it our job to think everything through figure out what could happen and plan for it every time i do a job i plan everything out i mean every detail im never surprised doing the job itselfs usually boring ive been through it so often in my mind measure twice cut once tonight i figured out ninetyfive percent of what could happen and planned for that but what i didnt bother to think about was the last five percentthat that michelle was going to use me for target practice but i shouldve the slim man rocking on his haunches said the trickster the what hart asked my grandmother said when something went wrong something you didnt think could happen it was the tricksters fault she got it out of a kids book or something i dont remember the trickster was always hanging around looking for ways to make things go wrong like fate or god or whatever except fate could do you good things too like give you a winning lotto ticket or could make you stop for a yellow light even if you wouldve gone through and save you from getting tboned by a garbage truck and god would do things that were right so youd get what you deserved but the trickster he was just there to mess you up he nodded again at the house trickster paid us a visit in there trickster hart liked that but thats life sometimes aint it hart you miss that five percent but so what best thing still might be to get the hell out of here put it all behind us hart rose he winced as he accidentally reached his shot arm out to steady himself he looked out at the lake let me tell you a story lewis my brotheryoungern me you have a brother lewiss attention had turned from the house ive got two our parents both died about the same time when i was twentyfive my brother was twentytwo i was kind of like a father figure well even back then we were into this kind of stuff you know and my brother got this job one time easy just numbers he was a runner mostly he had to pick up some money and deliver it typical job i mean thousands of people do that shit every day right all over the world they do lewis was listening so i didnt have anything going on at the moment and was helping him out we picked up the money this was milwaukee no we grew up in boston we pick up the money andre about to deliver it but turns out we were going to be set up the guy ran the numbers operation was going to clip us and let the cops find the bodies and some of the books and some of the money the detectivesd think they closed up the operation you two were fall guys yep i had this sense something was wrong and we went around back of the pickup location and saw the muscle there my brother and me we took off a few days later i found the guys hired to do the clip and took care of them but the main guy just vanished word was hed moved to mexico lewis grinned scared of your bad ass after six months or so i stopped looking for him but it turns out he never went to mexico at all hed been tracking us the whole time one day he walks up to my brother and blows his head off oh shit hart didnt speak for a moment but see lewis he didnt kill my brother i did my laziness killed my brother your laziness yep because i stopped looking for that son of a bitch but six months hart thats a long time didnt matter if it was six years either youre in all the way a hundred and ten percent or dont bother hart shook his head hell lewis forget it thiss my problem i was the one hired on its not your issue now id consider it a privilege if you came with me but if you want to head back to milwaukee you go right ahead no hard feelings at all lewis rocked back and forth back and forth ask you a question sure what happened to the prick killed your brother he enjoyed life for three more days lewis debated a long time then he gave a whatthefuck laugh call me crazy hart but im with you yeah you bet i am thanks man means a lot to me they shook hands then hart turned back to his blackberry moved the bullseye to the closest part of the joliet trail and hit the start guidance command the instructions came up almost immediately lets go hunting a slight man in his thirties james jasons sat in his lexus the gray car slightly nicked a few years old he was parked in the lot of great lakes intermodal container services inc on the milwaukee lakefront jasons was watching the cranes offload the containers from ships incredible the operators lifted the big metal boxes as if they were toys swung them from the ships and set them down perfectly every time on the flatbed of a truck the containers mustve weighed twenty tons maybe more jasons was always impressed by anybody with skill whatever their profession a rumble filled the night a horn blared and a canadian pacific freight train ambled past the door of the old brick building opened a brawny man in wrinkled gray slacks a sports coat blue shirt no tie climbed down the stairs and crossed the parking lot jasons had learned that the head of the legal department of the companypaul morganregularly worked late morgan continued through the lot to his mercedes jasons got out of his car which was parked two slots down he approached the man arms at his side mr morgan the man turned and looked over jasons who was nearly a foot shorter and a hundred pounds lighter than the lawyer yeah weve never met sir i work with stanley mankewitz my names james jasons he offered a card which morgan glanced at and put into a pocket where it could be easily retrieved when morgan found himself near a trash can i know its late id just like a minute of your time morgans eyes swept around the parking lot meaning here now friday night he hit the key fob and with a click the mercedes unlocked stanley mankewitz didnt have the balls to come himself doesnt surprise me morgan sat down in the front seat the car sagging but he left the door open he looked jasons up and down from the delicate shoes to the size suit to the rockhard knot in the striped tie youre a lawyer im in the legal department ah theres a distinction for you morgan said you go to law school yes where yale morgan grimaced he wore a pinky ring that probably had a depaul crest on it well jasons hadnt brought up the alma mater issue tell me what your noble leader wants and then scoot off sure jasons said agreeably were aware that your company hasnt been particularly supportive of mr mankewitz and the union during this difficult time its a federal investigation for christs sake why the fuck would i want to support him your employees are members of his union thats their choice about the investigationyou know that no charges have been filed a goodnatured smile on jasonss face there are a few officials looking into some allegations officials its the fucking fbi look i dont know what youre after here but were a legitimate business look out there he waved toward the brilliantly lit cranes our customers know were a union shop and that the head of that union stanley mankewitz is under investigation theyre worried that were involved in something illegal you can tell them the truth that mr mankewitz hasnt been indicted for anything every union in the history of the country has been investigated at one point or another which tells you something about unions morgan muttered or about people who dont like the common folk standing up for their right to fair pay for hard work jasons replied evenly remaining close to the man despite the odor of garlic rising on morgans breath besides even if mr mankewitz was found guilty of something which is highly unlikely im sure your customers would be able to draw the distinction between a man and his organization enron after all was ninetynine percent hardworking people and a few bad apples again hardworking mr jasonjasons with an s mr jasons you dont understand you ever hear of homeland securitywere in the business of moving shipping containers any hint of something wrong with the people were connected to and everybody goes right to anthrax in our warehouses or a nuclear bomb or something customersre going to go elsewhere and your hardworking common folkll lose their fucking jobs i repeat my question what the hell do you want just some information nothing illegal nothing classified nothing sensitive a few technical things ive written them down a slip of paper appeared in jasonss gloved hand and he gave it to morgan if its nothing classified or sensitive look it up yourself morgan let the slip float to the damp asphalt ah morgan studied the thin smiling face closely he laughed hard and ran his hand through his thinning black hair so whats this like the sopranos only instead of sending paulie or chris to extort me mankewitz picks a scrawny little asshole like you that the plan you whine at me until i cave he leaned forward and laughed i could fuck you up with one hand ive got half a mind to do it send you back to your boss with a broken nose again a goodnatured grimace you look like you could mr morgan i havent been in a fight in probably twenty years school yard and i got whipped pretty bad youre not worth the sweat the man snapped so whats next the big boys come back with lead pipes you think that scares me no no theres nobody else coming its only me here and now this one time asking if youll help us out just this once nobodyll bother you again well im not helping you out now get the fuck off our property thanks for your time mr morgan jasons started to walk away then he frowned as if hed remembered something and lifted an index finger just as the lawyer was about to close the car door oh one thing just to be helpful you hear about tomorrow morning paul morgan gave an exaggerated grimace and said what about tomorrow morning public works is starting some construction on hanover street on saturday can you believe it and at eightthirty you might want to check out a different route if you want to get to the school by ten what hand on the halfopen door morgan was frozen staring at jasons the word was a whisper for the concert the slim man nodded pleasantly i think its great when parents take an interest in their childrens activities a lot of them dont and im sure paul junior and alicia appreciate it too i know theyve been practicing hard alicia especially every day after school in that rehearsal room three to fourthirtyimpressive just thought you might want to know about the roadwork okay you have a good evening mr morgan jasons turned and walked to his lexus thinking that the odds of getting rushed were about percent but he got inside safely and started the car when he looked out the rearview mirror there was no sign of morgans mercedes the slip of paper was gone too the first of this evenings tasks was finished now for the second his stomach rumbled again but he decided hed better get on the road right away the directions told him it would take more than two hours to get to lake mondac the ground around brynn and michelle was swampy and they had to be careful not to step on what seemed to be solid leaves but which was only a thin facade covering a deep bog the frogs calls were insistent piercing and they irritated brynn because the creekcrack could obscure the sound of anyone approaching they walked for twenty minutes in tense silencefollowing the least choked route they could sucked farther into the forests discouraging labyrinth brynn and michelle descended into a gully that was matted with blackberry trillium wood leek and a dozen plants brynn didnt recognize with considerable effort they climbed to the top of the other side where brynn realized suddenly that she was lost completely lost on higher ground theyd had more of a sense of the correct directiondue north to the joliet trail brynn had used certain landmarks to guide them peaks a stream unusual patterns of tall oak trees but theyd been forced farther and farther downward into the low ground by rocky cliffs and the compacted mass of brush and thorny bushes all of her navigation beacons had vanished she recalled the instructor at the state police tactical procedures course saying that if you put somebody in unfamiliar territory without recognizable landmarks theyd be completely disoriented within thirtyfive minutes brynn had certainly believed him but hadnt realized that too many landmarks could be as much of a problem as too few did you and your friends ever hike this way i dont hike michelle said petulantly and ive only been to their place once or twice brynn looked around slowly i thought you knew where we were michelle muttered i thought so too she said with more than a little exasperation well find some moss it grows on the north side of trees we learned that in grade school not really brynn replied looking around it grows where theres the most moisture which is usually on the north side of trees and rocks but only if theres enough sun to dry out the south side in deep forest itll grow everywhere brynn pointed lets try that way wondering if she was taking that route simply because it seemed less daunting the vegetation less tangled michelle followed numbly limping along with her polished rosewood crutch a short time later brynn stopped again if it was possible she was even more lost than ten minutes earlier cant keep going on like this she had a thought asked michelle do you have a needle a what a needle or a pin maybe a safety pin why would i have a needle just do you have one the woman patted her jacket no what for her badge brynn pulled it out of her pocket kennesha county sheriffs department chrome ridges radiating like sun rays out of the county seal she turned it over and looked at the clasp pin on the back could this actually work come on she led michelle to a nearby stream and dropped to her knees she began to clear away a thick pelt of leaves saying find me some rocks about the size of a grapefruit rocks hurry the young woman grimaced but began walking up and down the bank picking over stones while brynn cleared a space on the bank the ground was cold she could feel the chill through her knees they began to ache from her pocket she took the clear bottle of rubbing alcohol the chicago cutlery knife and the candle lighter set them on the ground in front of her next to her badge michelle returned limping along with five large rocks brynn needed only two forgot to mention that what are you doing making a compass this had been in the survival manual issued by the state police though the team brynn was on had not actually made one but shed read the material and thought she remembered enough to craft the instrument how can you do that im not sure i can but i know the theory the idea was simple you pounded a needle or pin with a hammer which magnetized it then you rested it on a piece of cork floating in a dish of water the needle aligned itself north and south simple no hammer now shed have to use the back of the knife blade the only metal object they had on her knees brynn set a rock in front of her she tried to break the pin off her badge by bending it the metal would not fatigue though it was too thick shit try to cut through it with the knife michelle suggested hit it with a rock brynn opened the pin as far as she could laid it on the rock and set the blade against the base of the needle holding the chicago cutlery in her left hand she tapped the back with another rock it didnt even make a mark youll have to hit it hard michelle said now intrigued with the project she slammed the rock into the pin once more the blade made a slight scratch on the needle but danced along the chrome metal she couldnt hold both blade and badge down on the rock in one hand handing the rock to michelle she said here you do it use both hands the younger woman took the second rock the hammer which weighed about fifteen pounds in her left hand brynn continued to hold the wooden knife handle she cupped her palm around the badge and with her fingers gripped the end of the blade near the point michelle looked at her i cant not with your hands there michelle had about an eightinch target on the back edge of the knife a miss could crush one of brynns hands or flip the blade sideways and slice the pads off her fingers we dont have any choice i could break your fingers go ahead dont tap hit hard come on do it the young woman took a deep breath she lifted the rock then grimaced exhaled and swung the stone in a blur whether it was headed for brynns fingers or for the knife was impossible to tell but brynn didnt move a muscle snap michelle hit the blade clean driving it through the metal and cutting off a twoinch bit of needle which spiraled through the air and disappeared in a shadowy sea of leaves near the stream no michelle cried starting forward dont move brynn whispered presumably their prize had landed on top of the pile though it wouldnt take more than a footstep to send it slipping into the leaves lost forever it couldnt have gone very far its too dark i cant see anything damnit shhhh brynn reminded they had to assume that hart and his friend were still after them we need the lighter brynn leaned toward the leaves the young woman was right in this dense grove with the light of a half moon sliced to pieces by a thousand branches and stubborn leaves still clinging to them it was impossible to see the metal but the candle lighter would shine like a warning beacon atop a skyscraper for hart to see again the bywords for the evening came to mind no choice here brynn gave her the lighter go around there she pointed to the far side of the pile keep it low and wave it over the ground michelle hobbled off ready she whispered go a click and the flame blossomed it was far brighter than shed expected anybody within a hundred yards could have seen brynn leaned forward and scanned the ground crawling forward carefully there something was shiny was that it brynn reached out carefully and picked up a tiny twig covered in bird shit a second possibility turned out to be a streak of mica in a rock but finally brynn spotted a silver flare in the night sitting on top of a curl of oak leaf she picked up the needle carefully shut it out she said to michelle nodding at the candle lighter the area went soot blackeven darker now because the light had numbed their eyes brynns sense of vulnerability soared the two men could be walking directly toward them and shed never see them only a cracking branch or crunch of leaves would give away their approach michelle crouched can i help not yet the young woman sat down crossed her legs and fished the crackers out she offered them to brynn who ate several then brynn began tapping the needle with the back of the knife twice she struck a finger hard and winced but she never let go and never paused in the poundinglike the flare of the lighter the sound of the tink tink tink seemed to broadcast their position for miles after an eternal five minutes she said lets try it i need some thread something thin they unraveled a strand from brynns ski jacket and used it to tie the needle to a bit of twig brynn dumped out the alcohol from the bottle and refilled it halfway with water slipped the twig and pin inside and set the bottle on its side brynn hit the candle lighter trigger they stared at the bottle the bit of wood slowly revolved to the left and stopped it works michelle blurted giving her first true smile of the night brynn glanced at her and smiled back damn she thought it does it surely does but which ends north and whichs south around here the high grounds generally west thatd be to the left they shut the lighter out and after their eyes were accustomed to the dark brynn pointed out a distant hilltop thats north lets head for it brynn screwed the lid on the bottle and slipped it into her pocket picked up her spear they started walking again theyd pause every so often to take another reading as long as they continued north they would have to cross the joliet trail sooner or later curious she thought how much reassurance shed gotten by making this little toy kristen brynn mckenzie was a woman whose worst enemy worst fear was the lack of control shed begun this night without anyno phone or weaponcrawling cold drenched and helpless out of a black lake but now with a crude spear in hand and a compass in her pocket she felt as confident as that character out of one of joeys comic books queen of the jungle the dance what hart called it this was a part of the business and hart was not only used to dancing he was good at it being a craftsman after all a month ago sitting in a coffee shopnever a bar keep your head about youhed looked up at the voice so hart how you doing a firm handshake good you im okay listen im interested in hiring somebody you interested in some work i dont know maybe so how do you know gordon potts you go back a long ways not so long howd you meet him hart had asked a mutual friend whod that be freddy lancaster freddy sure hows his wife doing thatd be tough to find out hart she died two years ago oh thats right bad memory how does freddy like st paul st paul he lives in milwaukee this memory of mine the dance it went on and on as it has to then two meetings later credentials finally established the risk of entrapment minimal the dancing was over and they got down to details thats a lot of money yeah it is hart so youre interested keep going heres a map of the area thats a private road lake view drive and there thats a state park all of it hardly any people around heres a diagram of the house okaythis a dirt road or paved dirthart they tell me youre good are you good i hear youre a craftsman thats what they say whos they people well yeah im a craftsman can i ask you a question yeah im curious whyre you in this line of work it suits me hed said simply it looks like it does okay whats the threat situation the what how riskys the job going to be how many people up there weapons police nearby its a lake houseare the other houses on lake view occupied itll be a piece of cake hart hardly any risk at all the other placesll be vacant and only the two of them up there the feldmans and no rangers in the park or cops around for miles they have weapons are you kidding theyre city people shes a lawyer hes a social worker just the feldmans nobody else itll make a big difference thats my information and its solid just the two of them now in the middle of marquette state park hart and lewis circled around a dangerous stand of thorny brush like a plant out of a science fiction movie hart reflected sourly yeah right just the two of them feeling the ache in his arm angry with himself hed done percent it shouldve been at least they knew they were on the right path a half mile back theyd found a scrap of tissue with blood on it the kleenex couldntve been there for more than a half hour hart now paused and gazed around them noted some peaks and a small creek were doing fine be a lot tougher without the moonlight but weve caught a break somebodys looking out for us the trickster somebodyyou believe that lewis said this as if he did hart didnt but no time for theology now id like to move a little faster when they hit the trail they might start running well have to too run right smooth groundll give us the advantage we can move faster them being women you mean yep well and one of them being hurt pain slows people down he paused and stared to their right then hunched over the map and examined it closely with the flashlight its lens muted by his undershirt he pointed that a smoke tower whats that rangers look for forest fires from them its one of the places i thought she might go for where on that ridge they were looking at a structure about a half mile away it was a tower of some sort but through the trees they couldnt tell if it was a radio or microwave antenna or a structure with a small enclosure on top maybe lewis said you see any sign of them now that their eyes were used to the dark the halfmoon provided fair illumination but the ravine separating the men from the ranger tower was shadowy and in the bottom a canopy of trees provided perfect cover the women heading for the tower made some sense rather than the joliet trail or the ranger station the place might have a radio or even a weapon he debated for a moment and risked scanning the ground with the flashlight if the women were near at least theyd be moving away and might not see the light then they heard a rustle of leaves and turned fast toward the sound six glowing red eyes were staring at them lewis laughed raccoons three big ones were pawing at something on the ground it glistened and crackled whats that lewis found a rock and pitched it toward them with a meansounding hiss they ran off hart and lewis approached and found what theyd been doingfighting over some food it looked like bits of crackers theirs hart picked one up broke it in half with a snap fresh he studied the ground the women had stopped here apparentlyhe could make out prints of knees and feet and then they had continued north women stopping for a fucking picnic hart doubted though it was to rest that wasnt brynn maybe somebody needed first aid he believed he smelled rubbing alcohol but whatever the reason the important thing to hart was that they hadnt made for the fire tower they were headed right for the trail he consulted the gps and pointed ahead that way mind that patch there lewis said hart squinted when the moon was obscured by branches or a wisp of cloud the forest around them turned black as a cave he finally saw what lewis was pointing at whats that poison ivy bad stuff not everybodys allergic indians arent doesnt affect them nope not a bit you might not be allergic but you dont want to take a chance hart hadnt known that what were you a boy scout lewis laughed funny hadnt thought about that for years but yeah i was well not really in them i went on a couple camping trips then kind of dropped out but i know thats poison ivy cause my brother threw me in a patch once and that fucked me up good i never forgot what it looked like you were saying you have two brothers he was the older one what else im in the middle he know it was poison ivy i dont think so but something i always wondered about mustve sucked lewis hart said yupoh bout that my friends call me comp you can use that okay comp wheres that come from town where my parents lived when i was born compton minnesota my parents thought it sounded you know distinguished he snickered like anybody in our family was ever distinguished what a joke but daddy tried give him that and yoursre both dead your folks thats right sorry about that was a while ago still they continued on through the tangled brush in silence for what seemed like two miles though it was probably a quarter of that hart checked his watch okay he decided its time he reached into his pocket and pulled out the phone hed been carrying he pushed the on button and it went through that electronic ritual they all did nowadays he figured out the settings and put the ringer on vibrate then scrolled through recent calls the one on top was home he noted that the call had lasted eighteen seconds long enough for a message was all he wondered how long it would take before a light flashed and the phone buzzed hart touched lewiss arm and motioned for him to wait then lifted his fingers to his lips lewis nodded hart answered the call graham felt his scalp crawl when brynns mobile actually began to ring rather than go right to voice mail it clicked he heard the rustle of wind and his scalp stopped tensing but his heart took over thumping hard brynn thiss officer billings said the low voice graham frowned and glanced at anna the voice asked hello well this is graham boyd brynn mckenzies husband oh sure sir deputy mckenzie is she all right graham asked fast chest throbbing yessir shes fine she gave me her phone to hold relief flooded through him ive been trying all night receptions terrible up here comes and goes surprised when it rang just now to be honest she was due home a while ago oh the man sounded confused she said she called you she did but her message said she was coming right home it was a false alarm or something oh she was going to call again probably couldnt get through about the case turned out it wasnt a false alarm after all was a domestic dispute pretty ugly husband tried to downplay it lot of times that happens deputy mckenzies talking to the wife right now getting the facts sorted out the relief was so thick graham could taste it he smiled and nodded to anna billings continued she left her phone with me didnt want any distractions shes calming the situation down shes good at that thats why the captain wanted her to stay oh hold on a minute sirhey sergeantwheres ralphoh okay the trooper came back on the line sorry sir do you know how long shell be weve got to get child protective services up here lake mondac near there could be a few hours bad situation with the kid husbands going to spend the night in jail at least the night few hours yessir ill have her call you when shes free okay well thanks you bet night graham hung up what anna asked and he explained what was going on domestic situation sounded pretty bad husbands going to jail graham sat on the couch staring at the tv screen whyd she have to handle it though not expecting an answer but he was aware that the knitting needles had stopped and anna was looking up from the scarf she was knitting the colors were three shades of blue it was pretty graham you know brynn had some trouble with her face her jaw sure the car accident he had no idea where she was going with this the womans gray eyes were on his that was one thing about anna mckenzie as demure as she could be as polite and proper she always looked you right in the eye accident she repeated slowly so you dont know more yellow jackets graham was beginning to sense go on i just assumed shed told you he was alarmed and hurt at the lie whatever it might be yet he wasnt very surprised go on keith hit her broke her jaw what wired shut for three weeks god it was that serious he was a big man dont feel too bad she kept it from you graham she was embarrassed ashamed she didnt tell hardly anybody she said he was moody i didnt know he hurt her moody true but mostly it was his temper problem like some people drink and some people gamble hed lose control it was scary i saw it happen a few times rageaholic what happened the night he hit her im sure it wasnt anything big that set him off it never was that was the scariest it could be the power went out before a game the store was out of his brand of beer brynn telling him she was going back to work parttime when joey got a little older whatever it was hed just snap i never knew so domestic problemsthey mean a lot to her she does run those a lot graham agreed i always thought it was tom dahl you know wanting a woman there no shed volunteer what did she do after keith hit her she didnt have him arrested if thats what you mean i think she was worried about joey he ever do it again no not that she ever told me hitting someone you were married to he couldnt imagine it hell hitting anyone unless it was selfdefense was almost impossible to picture graham was matching this information against other incidents in their past against his wifes words her behavior dozens of times shed touch her jaw in the morning even her waking sweaty and groaning from dreams her moodiness her defensiveness her control he pictured her hand coasting along the uneven line of her jaw as they sat at the dinner table or watching tv on the green couch still sitting back he said she didnt know what was going on at lake mondac until she got there domestic mayve been why she stayed tonight its not why she volunteered to go in the first place thats what i want to know i think the answersre pretty much the same graham the needle clicks resumed as anna cranked up the assembly line of yarn once again they paused to take a compass reading as theyd been doing every quarter mile or so the routine was that brynn and michelle would kneel down rest the alcohol bottle on its side and tease their magnetic vessel into the center of its tiny ocean where it would nose out north for them the compass was a lifesaver brynn was astonished at how easily they would start to veer in the wrong direction though shed been absolutely convinced they were on course michelle asked how did you know how to make that nodding at the compass as brynn slipped it back into her pocket you have children a school project a course i took through the state police but i do have a son she tried to imagine skateboarding fiend joey sitting still long enough for a science fair project the idea was amusing how old is he michelle was suddenly animated twelve i love children she said then she smiled whats his name joseph biblical i guess so we named him after his fathers uncle is he a good boy he sure is hesitated though he gets into things sometimes she told michelle about the skateboarding incident today some of his scrapes at school the woman listened with interestand sympathy brynn asked you and your husband have kids michelle glanced at her not yet we lead pretty busy lifestyles and youre an actress you were saying a shy smile just little things now tv commercials community theater but im going to get into second city the improv comedy troupe ive had a couple of callbacks and im auditioning for the touring company of wicked brynn listened attentively as the young woman told her about some parts she was pursuing brynns opinion though was that she was a dilettante it sounded like she jumped from medium to medium hoping to find one she was talented at or one that was easier than others she wasnt surprised to learn that michelle also tried her hand at writing plays but had recently decided that independent films were the way to go and was thinking of getting a job in la to meet people in the movie industry they were walking uphill now and breathless fell silent as they slogged their way over another quarter mile shed thought theyd have come across the joliet trail by now it couldnt be that far away but with all this dense brush she had no realistic sense of how fast they were traveling like treading through water a lot of effort didnt lead to a long distance covered after fifteen minutes they paused in a clearing surrounded by briars to take another compass reading the lighter flared and brynn saw they were on track okay shut it out according to the routine theyd fallen into they now sat for a moment or two eyes squeezed shut to help them adjust to the dark a snap sounded behind them loud michelle gasped both women tensed rising to a crouch from their knees brynn slipped the compass away and grabbed the spear another snap and a rustle of footsteps brynn squinted until her cheek screamed in pain but she couldnt see anything was it the killers what do you shhh something was moving circling them then stopped moved again snap then it vanished a moment later from their right came another snap a shuffle of leaves they spun suddenly in that direction brynn could vaguely make out a shadowy form rocking back and forth it wasnt the men in fact it wasnt a human brynn observed that it was an animal about the size of a german shepherd brynn believed it was staring at them with shoulders tensed and hackles high michelle gasped and gripped brynns arm was it a mountain lion the last one in wisconsin had reportedly been shot a hundred years ago but every year there were supposed sightings youd see coyotes from time to time they were timid but rabid ones their minds melting had strolled right into tents and attacked campers lynx werent unheard of either but this seemed too big for that she decided it was a gray wolf which were being reintroduced into the state she didnt know if theyd attack humans but the eerie probing facealmost humanwas unsettling had michelle and brynn come close to the creatures lair were there pups to be protected a crazed mother was the worst of enemies keith an avid hunter had told her a flash of anger burned within her they didnt need another enemy tonight she gripped the spear firmly and stood up she strode forward between michelle and the creature whatre you doing dont leave me brynn thought dont hesitate keep going the animals head cocked and its eyes caught light from the loppedoff moon brynn kept walking moving faster hunched over still staring their way the animal backed up then turned and receded into the night brynn stopped and returned to the young woman who was staring at her jesus michelle said its okay but it wasnt the animal she was referring to are you all right she asked uncertainly me the deputy asked sure why you wereyou were making this noise i thought you couldnt breathe or something noise like growling it was scary growling brynn was aware of breathing hard teeth set tightly together she wasnt aware that shed made a noise queen of the jungle she gave an awkward laugh and they continued on their route led them into a ravine the rocks and trees along the side ensnared with vines and the floor covered with patches of poison ivy and vinca boggy pools too surrounded by mushrooms and fungus they pushed through it all exhausted and struggled up the other side using saplings and sandstone outcroppings for handand footholds at the top they stumbled onto a trail it wasnt wideabout four feetand was overgrown from disuse during the winter months but it was heaven compared with what theyd been slogging through since fleeing the feldmans house is this it michelle asked they found their answer only thirty feet away a large wooden sign perkinstown miles duluth mn miles camp responsibly on the joliet trail only you can prevent forest fires how much time do you think it bought us lewis asked referring to the conversation with graham boyd brynns husband hard to say theyd come miles through the underbrush adjusting their course occasionally after consulting the gps google earth and the paper map as they made their way north so that was why you turned it on her phone right though just after the conversation hed removed the battery so the police couldnt trace it ive been waiting for that wanted to hold out for as long as we could now we put him at ease hell go to sleep and wont worry until three or four when he wakes up in an empty bed by then theyll both be dead and buried he believed you pretty sure as they walked on hart was wondering about her husband somebody married to a woman like brynnwhat would he be like low voice seemed smart wellspoken wasnt drunk he wondered if the mans words had contained clues that might help him find and kill her more efficiently not really still he kept replaying the conversation it fascinated him two different last names didnt surprise him that brynn had kept her maiden name grahamthe man she slept with the man she shared a life with unusual name where did it come from was he conservative liberal religious what did he do for a living hart was interested in the relief that had filled his voice something seemed a bit off about it hart didnt know what to make of that yeah relievedbut another emotion too he wished hed gotten a better look at her in the feldmans driveway pretty enough he recalled brownish hair pulled back a nice figure hadnt let herself go picturing her eyes brows furrowed as she registered his presence when he rose from the bushes hart had killed six people three had looked at him as he did it seeing their eyes meant nothing to him he didnt prefer that they look away he didnt look away either the only one who hadnt cried was the one woman hed killed a drug dealer yo you gonna do this he hadnt answered you and me we work something out shed stolen money or hadnt skimmed the drugs or hadnt wasnt harts issue hed made an agreement with the man who wanted her dead and so he a craftsman made her dead staring into her face as he did so to make sure she wasnt going to leap aside or pull a hidden weapon brynn had looked him in the eye too as she fired a craftswoman hart lewiss voice shook him out of his reflection he tensed looking around yeah youre a milwaukee boy im one too how come we never worked together before dont know you work in the city much not much no safer that way where you live south of town toward kenosha not that far lotta building going on in those parts lewis stopped suddenly look up there a post or something a sign where see it on the right they moved forward carefully hart putting aside his thoughts about brynn with some reluctance and stopped at the sign in the summer of louis joliet a yearold philosopher and fr jacques marquette a yearold jesuit priest crossed wisconsin on their way to the mississippi river although the trail you are standing on is named for him joliet never hiked this mile route he and marquette made their voyage mostly by waterway the joliet trail was created by fur traders and people just like you outdoorlovers some years later hart consulted the gps on his blackberry and the paper map which wayd those girls get has to be to the right thats the ranger station few miles away lewis looked up and down the trail which little traveled this time of year was overgrown and tangled with branches and dotted with stubborn saplings rising through the sludge of leaves whats wrong you ask me this aint no trail at all its just less forest hart smiled at that which made lewis smile too here they were two women moving relentlessly forward on a tourists trail one with an inlaid rosewood cane one with a matching spear bolos and knives in their pockets and grim faces both the trail reminded brynn of the last time shed been horseback ridingone spring several years ago shed loved cantering along the bridle path in some woods near humboldt years ago before shed become a deputy shed been an amateur competitive jumper and loved the sport in fact it was at a competition that shed seen an exhibition by some mounted police from milwaukee the eighteenyearold had spent time talking to an officer which had ignited a fascination ironically not in the art of dressage riding but in police work which a few years later provided the same thrill shed experienced hurtling over jumps atop a half ton of animal now she realized how much she missed riding and wondered if shed ever have the chance to get back into the saddle as they continued along the trail theyd see poignant evidence that the park was usually a far more innocent place than tonight signs dispensing bits of history and information the most troubling dangers had to do with fires steep dropoffs and ecological risks emerald ash borer warning firewood purchased from clausen may be infested with emerald ash borer if you have purchased any henderson brand firewood please burn any such wood immediately to avoid endangering our hardwood trees with the emerald ash borer one treea massive oakearned a sign all its own maybe the biggest or oldest tourists loved their superlatives brynn though thought of it simply as a source of cover around here the trail wound through patches of bare fields exposing them to pursuers to move off the trail into the lowland brush though would slow them down way too much the flying squirrels were plentiful and bats flitted by silently owls noisier several times theyd hear a beat of wing and a final squeak from a predators successful strike michelle kept up pretty well but brynn was growing concerned about her her ankle wasnt badfrom the job and from joeys many mishaps she knew about serious injuries when to dole out sympathy and when to call medics rather it was the young womans resignation she was lagging behind once she paused and looked up a steep incline grimaced lets go brynn urged i need to rest lets cover a little more ground she smiled lets earn a break im tired now im so tired my blood sugar i told you then she gasped and jerked back as a small animal scampered past what was that a vole or mouse brynn told her harmless it could crawl up your pants not yours brynn thought considering michelles tight jeans the younger womans good mood from earlier had faded she was like a child whod missed her afternoon nap patiently brynn said come on michelle the more we walk the closer to getting back home and we cant stop here they were in a clearing very visible in the moonlight her lips tight almost in a pout she complied and they climbed the steep hill at the top brynn suddenly smelled rosemary and wanted to cry thinking back to the easter lamb shed struggled to roast for her family just weeks ago they slipped through a copse of wiry trees eerie something out of lord of the rings her face was now throbbing with every step she touched her cheek and inhaled as the ache flowed through her head and neck the swelling was worse she wondered if the wound would get infected would there be terrible scarring the thought of plastic surgery came to mind and she actually smiled thinking you vain girl maybe you should concentrate on staying alive before you worry about making yourself presentable for the multiplex on saturday night graham had caught her once in the habit of stroking the dip in her crooked chin shed blushed and hed smiled then whispered its sexy dont fret she grew irritated at how persistently thoughts of her past kept intruding tonight she hadnt thought about keith so much in years and graham and joey kept making regular appearanceswhile her only goal was getting to safety like that old cliché memories flashing through her thoughts at the end of her life damnit concentrate they followed the trail around a bend to the left brynn looked back a clear panorama was behind them and she could see a hundred yards away the crest of a rolling hill there was movement along it going from tree to tree she gripped michelles arm whats that it was as if a sniper were crawling into position to take a shot get down brynn ordered they both crouched she surveyed the ridge and the trail no clouds now and the halfmoon cast light bright enough to shoot by at this distance they were probably safe from a shotgun but hart had fired at her with a glock a mm slug could easily make it here and he obviously was skilled she squinted at the ridge then she laughed its just our friend she pointed standing up or maybe one of his friends the pursuer was of the fourlegged variety loping from tree to tree the gray wolf she assumed they usually hung in packs brynn believed but this one was clearly solo was he following them maybe her growl hadnt scared him off completely then the creature stiffened looked back was gone in a fraction of a second you see that like he vanished brynns smile faded nooh no in the distance two men were moving quickly along the joliet trail headed in their direction a half mile away moving doggedly no doubt that they were hart and his partner one carried a shotgun the men disappeared where the trail dipped beneath the cover of trees no its them michelle whispered how did they find us bad luck there were a dozen ways we couldve gone they gambled and won come on move the women began jogging and hobbling as quickly as they could their breath coming fast go go go i didnt think theyd really follow us michelles rasping voice whimpered it was a pathetic sound why hart brynn thought the answer is hart the trail turned to the right due east and when they broke from the trees the ground opened up with a moonlit view of rocky terrain tall hills rising above the path and deep ravines falling away below gashes in the trees revealed rugged sandstone bluffs look there they saw an intersection another path narrower than the joliet branched off to the left and rose up a hillside skirting a steep cliff into a dim valley brynn motioned her companion along michelle followed glancing back from time to time her hand in her jacket where the chicago cutlery knife rested in her waistband she seemed to find solace in making sure the weapon hadnt vanished at the juncture they paused there was an open shelter with a benchno phone brynn noted immediately a trash can which was empty the area was trampled down courtesy of a hard wisconsin winter the joliet trail continued on into the inky night descending to the rightnortheast the small path was marked with a sign apex lake miles trapper grove miles umstead ranger station miles brynn walked to the fence marking the edge of the cliff and looked into the valley she pointed to the left down there can you see it that building its the ranger station oh way over there i dont see any lights no im sure its closed the place was less than a mile awayas the crow flewthrough a deep valley though hiking via this path would take them on a much longer trip more than two miles according to the sign the path would meander leading to apex lake the grove and finally to the station brynn had a vague memory of the station which had served as a staging area for one of the searches shed been on it had been closed then toothe time of year was winterbut she could picture it clearly i remember phones there but i dont know if theyre working now and a gun cabinet i think but we cant take the path nodding toward the sign its too long wed never make it in time they might not go that way just keep going on the joliet trail brynn considered i think theyd be inclined to figure that we headed for the station she was staring at the dark void beyond the cliff and stepped even closer to the edge she paused by a danger sign looked down climb it or not whatever they did theyd have to choose soon the men could be here in ten or fifteen minutes is it straight down michelle asked still gazing down into the murkiness brynn saw a narrow ledge maybe twenty feet below them below that the cliff face descended for another fifty or sixty feet brynn whispered i think its climbable tough but it can be done if they could make it to the forest floor theyd have an easy direct walk to the ranger station the odds of a working phone and gun and ammunition brynn couldnt say a roll of the dice she decided that breaking in wouldnt be a problem if they could get to the building even the strongest lock in the world wouldnt keep her out i hate heights michelle whispered im with you there baby are we going to try it the young woman asked in a shaky voice brynn grabbed a birch sapling and leaned out into space studying the rocks below theyd managed a fast walk breaking into a jog occasionally lewis pulled up gripping his side he leaned against a tree you all right yeah i quit smoking last week he inhaled deeply well pretty much a month ago but i had one last week then stopped for good but it catches up with you you smoke wincing at a pang from his shot arm hart kept looking from side to side nope hed grown convinced that the women werent armed but he didnt like that damn dog or wolf or whatever it was nosing around people were predictable hed made a study of human nature in the extremes and he was comfortable taking them on however dangerous they were animals though operated with a different mindset he recalled the paw print near the feldman house this is my world you dont belong here youll see things that arent there and miss things thatre coming up right behind you but then he inhaled hard and leaned against another tree the mens eyes met and they shared a smile hart said i havent run like this in years i thought i was in shape man you work out he did regularlyhis line of work required strength and staminabut it was mostly weightlifting not aerobic that wouldntve been helpful hart rarely chased anyone and he didnt think hed ever run from anybody not once in his life he told lewis i dont do much jogging nope health clubs dont figure much in the lewis family but i work construction some was working for gaston on that tower near the lake i dont know it gaston construction the big tower other side of the expressway the glass is up now i hired out with the concrete sub thatll keep you in shape you handy hart said some ive done plumbing no patience for painting and electricity i stay away from i hear that carpentrys my favorite framing more furniture hart explained you make furniture simple things measure twice cut once like tables and chairs yeah cabinets its relaxing lewis said i built my grandmother a bed once a bed come on lets keep going they started walking again howd you happen to build her a bed lewis explained she started going crazy getting older maybe that alzheimers thing i dont know or maybe she just got old shed walk around the house singing christmas carols all year round all the time and shed start putting up decorations and my motherd take them down and then shed be putting them up again hart picked up the pace so shes pretty flaky and she starts looking for her bed the bed she had with my grandfather it musta got thrown out years ago but she thought it was somewhere in the house walking all over the place trying to find it i felt bad for her so i found some pictures of it and made her one wasnt all that good but it looked close enough i think it gave her a good couple of months i dont know hart said like making a bed only you really did make one not with sheets and blankets yeah i guess i did he gave a laugh whyre you in this line comp you could be making union scale oh im in it for the money how can you score big at sweat labor you score big doing this i score bigger now my mothers in a home too and my brothers they contribute i cant do less than them hart felt lewiss eyes on him like he wanted to ask about his family but remembered the story about the brother and the parents being dead anyway im good at this what i do hell you heard my rep you checked right people vouched for me they did thats why i called you banks payroll offices collection work protectionive got a talent for it i got contacts all over the lakefront how bout you hart whyre you in this fuckedup business he shrugged i dont do well working for other people and i dont do well sitting i do well doing got that itchy gene it suits me lewis looked around you think theyre hiding hart wasnt sure but he didnt think so he had a feeling that brynn was somehow like him and he would rather move any day keep moving however dangerous it was anything rather than hiding but he didnt tell lewis this no i dont theyll keep going besides i saw some patches of mud back there prints in them lewis gave a crisp laugh the sound had irritated hart at first now he didnt mind so much the man said youre the last of the mohicans that movie rocked you hunt ill bet hart said nope never been bullshit really truth you lewis said he hadnt for a while but he used to a lot he liked it i think you would too you seem like you know your way around here this isnt the north woods thatd be different were in wisconsin a state park just using logic naw i think youre a natural hart was about to ask natural what but froze a shout a womans voice came to them on the wind a shout for help she was trying to keep it quiet he got the impression but he heard alarm if not desperation it was in the distance but not too far maybe a quarter a half mile up the joliet trail the direction they were headed another call the words ambiguous same person calling hart asked i dont know lets go staying low they moved forward as quickly as they dared keep a lookout i dont trust her one of em screamed fake before at the lake dont forget maybe theyre trying to sucker us in wanting a fight maybe no guns but theyve got knives ten minutes later the men keeping low and scanning the greenery around them paused ahead of them the trail broadened and a smaller trail branched off to the left the intersection was marked by a wooden sign visible in the moonlight an arrow pointed out a path that hart had seen on gps it went west and north and after circling a small lake ended at a ranger station from there a twolane road led to the highway hart gestured lewis down into the bushes beside him scanning the surroundings you see anything nope hart listened carefully no more cries no voices just the breeze which hissed through the branches and made the leaves scuttle along like crabs then lewis touched his arm pointed fifteen feet past the intersection was a dark wood fence with a sign that said danger black space behind it where cliff dropped into ravine that tree there hart where finally he spotted it a branch had broken off the tree beside the cliff you could see the white wood below the bark i dont know if its a trick or not hart whispered you go round there to the right that bunch of bushes got it im going to the edge and look around ill be making some noise to give em a chance to make a move if i see anybody ill take her out shoot high then low lewis grinned and ill keep my mouth shut for the first time that night lewis looked confident hart finally at ease with his partner on this difficult night decided the man would do fine go on stay clear of the leaves silently lewis crouching crossed the path and slipped behind a stand of brush when hart saw he was in a good position to cover the area he started forward also low head swiveling back and forth he noticed in the distance at the bottom of the ravine what appeared to be the ranger station holding his own weapon pointed forward he moved to the sign he examined the broken branch then peered over the edge of the cliff he couldnt see anyone took out his flashlight and shone it down into the night jesus he stood put the gun away called lewis over what is it look they tried to climb down but it didnt work peering over the edge of the cliff they could see in the faint moonlight a ledge twenty feet below at the bottom of a steep rocky wall one of the women or maybe both had fallen on the ledge was a fourfootlong branchthe one that had broken off the tree beside them and around it was a large smear of bright red blood glistening under the flashlight man lewis said she hit hard he tried to peer farther into the ravine broke her leg ill bet bleeding plenty they had tove kept going down they couldnt get back up hurt like that or maybe theres a cave behind the ledge theyre trying to hide in well we gotta go after em lewis announced like hunting you follow a wounded animal till you find it no matter what you want ill go down first hart lifted an eyebrow bit of a climb i told youconstruction on the lakefront thirty stories up and im strolling around on the ironwork like its a sidewalk no somethings wrong graham boyd rose from the couch walked past anna who had switched from knitting to a large needlepoint samplerthe woman found peace and pleasure in transforming cloth of all kindsand walked into the kitchen his eyes glanced at a picture of his wife as a teenager sitting atop the horse shed later ride to win the midwisconsin junior horse jumping competition years ago she was leaning down her cheek against the horses neck patting him though her eyes were focused elsewhere presumably on one of her competitors he found the county phone book and looked at the map the nearest towns to lake mondac were clausen and point of rocks clausen had a town magistrates office point of rocks a public safety office he tried the magistrate first no answer and the message referred callers to city hall which turned out to be just a voice mail the public safety office in point of rocks was closed and the outgoing message said that anyone with an emergency should call either the county sheriffs office or the state police and thank you for calling it concluded politely have a nice day how can a fucking police department be closed he heard joeys bedroom door open and close the toilet flushed a moment later whens mom coming home the boy still not in his pajamas was at the top of the stairs soon you called her shes busy she cant be disturbed put your pajamas on and go to bed lights out the boy turned around the bedroom door closed graham thought that he heard the video game again he wasnt sure anna asked where is she im worried graham i dont know that deputy i talked to said it was just routine but it didnt feel right how do you mean her phone giving it to somebody else no way he could talk to anna without worrying that shed become defensive when it came to serious topics he had trouble talking to brynn and to her sonhell that was tonights theme apparentlybut he could talk to his motherinlaw shes too much of a control person for that he had however pulled back from control freak annas frown morphed into a smile as if shed caught on thats my daughter youre right graham picked up the landline made a call deputy munce eric its graham hey whats up the sheriff in now nope he goes home about six seven most nights look brynn went out on something tonight up at lake mondac right heard about that well shes not back yet silence not back forty minutes from there to your place youre north of town forty minutes tops ive drove it in a half hour i called and got some other deputy said there was a domestic and that brynn was handling it child services or something a pause that doesnt sound familiar graham who were you talking to i dont remember maybe billings well thats nobody from our office hold on muted sounds of conversation graham rubbed his eyes brynn had been up at five hed been up at fivethirty the deputy came back on all right graham story is the guy who made that nineoneone call called back and said it was a mistake brynn was going to turn around that was close to seven seventhirty i know but this deputy said it wasnt a mistake it was some domestic dispute and they wanted brynn to handle it could she have run into some state police up there town cops could happen but thats not the sort of thing the troopersd handle grahams skin chilled at this eric somethings wrong let me call the sheriff hell get back to you graham hung up he paced the kitchen surveyed the new tiles on the floor organized a stack of bills drew a line in the dust on top of the small rabbitear tv listened to the computer game upstairs goddamnit why wasnt the boy listening to him he decided to ban joey from skateboards for the rest of the school year anger or instinct the phone rang lo graham its tom dahl eric just called we checked with the state police nobody got any calls up at lake mondac clausen point of rocks even as far as henderson graham explained what hed told eric munce irritated that the man hadnt filled the sheriff in the deputy was named billings silence for a moment billingss the name of a road between clausen and the state park so it mightve been fresh in the mind of somebody trying to make up a name grahams hands were sweating her phone keeps going to voice mail again tom im plenty worried whats wrong a voice called joeys graham looked up the boy was standing halfway down the stairs hed been listening whats wrong with mom nothing go back to bed everythingll be fine no somethings wrong joey graham snapped now joey held his eye for a moment the chill look sending a shiver through grahams back then turned and stomped up the stairs anna appeared in the door glanced at grahams grimacing face what she whispered he shook his head said im talking to the sheriff then tom whatta we do ill send some people up there look relax her car probably broke down and she hasnt got cell phone reception then who was billings another pause well get up there right away graham gasping face dotted with cold sweat michelle crouched leaning against her pool cue cane brynn beside her they were still on the joliet trail hiding in a tangle of juniper and boxwood which smelled to brynn of urine theyd come a half mile from the cliff top intersection with the danger sign and shelter running as best they could the entire distance they now watched the beam from a flashlight pointed downward slowly sweeping the ledge and cliff face as hart and his partner climbed down they continued walking along the trail moving quickly the men had bought the sham brynn had orchestrated the shouting the broken branch the bloodher ownspattered on the ledge the men would continue to the bottom now either on the cliff or the path around apex lake and make for the ranger station which would give brynn and michelle an extra hour to get to safety before hart and his partner realized that theyd been tricked in the end it hadnt been michelles fear of heightsor brynnsthat decided the matter brynn had concluded that even climbing down the cliff and hiking through the tangled brush in the ravine would take too much time the men would have caught up with them before they were halfway to the ranger station but the cliff was a good chance to mislead their pursuers brynn had broken the branch to make it look like an accident then carefully climbed down the cliff to the ledge there shed taken a deep breath and cut her scalp with the kitchen knife as a deputy she knew a lot about head injuries and that lacerations on the head didnt hurt badly but bled copiously she knew this from joey as much as from auto accident calls after smearing the blood on the stone shed climbed back up to the cliff top and theyd fled down the joliet trail she now looked back the sweeping flashlight beam was still visible through the bones of trees then the path turned and the women lost sight of the killers how does it feel michelle nodded at brynns head she apparently thought brynn had made her decision not to climb down the cliff face because of the young womans fear of heights she glowed with gratitude brynn said it was fine michelle began rambling telling a story about how shed been hit on the head by a schoolgirl on the playground and had bled all over a new dress which had upset her more than the fight girlsre worse than boys brynn didnt disagree she did antigang campaigns at the high schools gangseven in modest humboldt an image of joey panting and bloody after one of his fights at school also came to mind she pushed it away michelle kept up the manic banter and brynn tuned her out she paused and looked around i think we should go off the trail now find the river we have to were making good time but the trail brynn told her didnt lead them anywhere except deeper into the woods the closest town that way was fifteen miles i need to use the compass she knelt to the side of the trail and set the alcohol bottle on the ground with some prodding the needle finally swung north we go that way its not far a couple of miles id guess probably less she put the bottle in her pocket they were on higher ground here and looking back they could still see a flashlight slowly probing for the pathway down the cliff face that would lead the killers into the valley and to the ranger station theyd eventually learn that the women werent going that way but every minute they delayed on the cliff was a minute more brynn and michelle had to escape brynn found a section of the woods that was less ensnarled than others and she stepped off the trail michelle somber again gazed at the rocky boggy ground and started forward with a look of distaste like a girl reluctantly climbing into her dates filthy car they were doing eighty without the light bar going or the throaty siren didnt need them there was hardly any traffic out here this time of night and none of the retrofit accessories in the dodge would have any inhibiting effect on suicidal wildlife sheriff tom dahls feeling was that deer were born without brains he was sitting in the passenger seat and a young deputy peter gibbs was driving behind them was another car eric munce at the wheel and beside him howie prescott a massive shavedheaded deputy who got good respect during traffic stops dahl had called his deputies and found no shortage of volunteers to help find out what had happened to their colleague brynn mckenzie they all stood ready to go but four he figured was plenty the sheriff was on the phone with an fbi agent in milwaukee his name was brindle which dahl thought was a coloring of a horse or dog the agent had been getting ready for bed but didnt hesitate to help out he sounded genuinely concerned the subject of the conversation was the woman lawyer emma feldman well sheriff started out as a little thing shes handling this corporate deal shes doing her homework and finds out that a lot of the companies on the lakefront have more than their fair share of documented aliens next thing a cithats a confidential informant dahl asked but brindle missed the irony right he says that stanley mankewitz head of some local union is selling forged green cards to illegals how much could he make doing that no thats not what its about he doesnt even charge em what he does is gets them to guarantee that theyll get jobs in open shops then unionize the workers the union gets bigger mankewitz gets richer hmm dahl thought clever idea thats what were investigating right now and this mankewitz he done it up in the air so far hes smart hes old school and he only hires people who keep their mouths shut hes a prick too pardon my french so yeah he did it but the cases weak it takes just one witness having an accident or getting killed in a quote random house invasion and the whole case could fall apart and here she is out in the wilderness this lawyer a lot of accidents could happen there exactly milwaukee pd shouldve had somebody on her they dropped the ball there this was offered a little too fast dahl thought the fingerpointingd already started up it seemed policing wasnt much different in milwaukee washington dc or kennesha county dahl said go faster what the fbi agent asked im talking to the driver when my deputys husband called her phone some man answered claiming to be a deputy near as we can tell therere no troopers or neighboring law out there none at all i see why youre worried where is this happening lake mondac i dont know it next to marquette state park ill give my man a call who runs cis see if theres any word about somebody talking to a prohired killer so thats what he means by pro dahl was getting irritated thatd be much appreciated agent brindle you want one of our people there on the ground not yet i dont think lets see whats going on first okay well call if you need to well be totally on board sheriff this mankewitz hes fucking around with illegals and homeland security and terrorist issues not to mention putting a poor family at risk dahl thought something else he refrained from saying he thanked the agent and they hung up how soon he muttered to the young deputy beside him half hour well dahl began impatiently rubbing his scarred leg i know sheriff gibbs said but were doing eighty any faster and all it takes is one deer and if it doesnt kill us coming through the windshield ericll get us from behind that boy really oughta back off a bit theyd left the joliet trail twenty minutes before with brynn deviating only when necessaryaround thickets and brambles and beds of leaves that might cover trip holes and bogs they headed up into the hills steep ones and already the incline was dramatic in some places a slip could turn into a tumble down a hillside for many yards over sharp rocks and through thornbushes the men would be at the bottom of the cliff by now she hoped that finding no bodies theyd continue through the ravine to the ranger station it could be forty minutes an hour before they realized theyd been tricked and returned to the joliet trail to resume the hunt a brief pause for another compass reading theyd remained largely on course due north for the first time tonight brynn was beginning to feel that she and michelle might survive theyd be at the river soon and then either a trek south along the bank to point of rocks or the shorter but arduousand dangerousclimb up the gorge she couldnt get that image out of her head the hiker whod fallen and been impaled on the tree limb the recovery team had needed a chain saw to cut the body free theyd had to stand around waiting for an hour for an officer to arrive with the tool brynn squinted at a silver flash in the distance ahead of them was that the river no just a narrow band of grass shining in the moonlight otherworldly she wondered what kind it was graham could have told her in a heartbeat but she didnt want to think about graham then she shivered at the sound of a howl behind them a creature baying was it the wolf that seemed to be following them as persistently as the men michelle looked back at the sound she froze and then she screamed michelle no brynn whispered harshly its just the them its them the young woman was pointing into the darkness what what did she see all brynn was looking at were layers of shadow some moving some still smooth or textured where there him finally brynn could see a hundred feet away a man stood behind a bush no they hadnt believed the trick at the junction brynn gripped her spear get down but whateverd been building within the young woman now exploded in rage and madness you fuckers she screamed i hate you no michelle please be quiet we have to run now but the younger woman seemed transfixed as if brynn werent even present she flung aside the pool cue steadying her and pulled out a pool ball bolo brynn stepped forward gripping michelles leather jacket but her face a mask of fury the woman shoved brynn away sending her slipping down an incline of slick leaves the bolo in one hand the knife in the other michelle charged the man moving fast despite her limp i hate you i hate you she screamed no michelle no they have guns but she seemed deaf to the pleas when she was thirty feet away from the man she flung the bolo which flew in a fierce arc and nearly struck his head he stood his groundjust as brynn herself had back in the feldmans driveway undaunted michelle continued her charge brynn debated should she follow itd be suicide then decided oh hell she grimaced rose to her feet and charged after the woman trying to keep low michelle stop any minute the man would fire it mustve been hart he remained motionless waiting for the perfect shot michelle sprinted directly toward him the man couldnt miss but no shots came slowing to a stop brynn could see why it wasnt a person at all what the crazed young woman had been attacking was just a weird configuration of tree trunk broken about six feet up the branches and leaves giving the impression of a human it was like a scarecrow i hate you the young womans shrill voice echoed michelle then when she was ten feet away michelle apparently realized her mistake she stopped gasping for breath staring at the trunk she dropped to her knees lowering her head hands over her face sobbing an eerie keening came from her throat both mournful and hopeless the horror of the evening finally poured out the tears up until now had been tears of confusion and pain this was a rupture of pure sorrow brynn approached and then stopped michelle its okay lets michelles voice rose to another wail leave me alone please shhhh michelle please be quiet its okay no its not okay its not okay at all lets keep at it we dont have much farther to go i dont care you go on a faint smile im not leaving you here michelle hugged herself rocking back and forth brynn crouched next to her she understood that something else was going on within the young woman what is it michelle looked absently at the knife slipped it back in the sock scabbard theres something i have to tell you what brynn persisted its my fault theyre dead she whispered her face miserable steve and emma its my fault you why she snapped because im a spoiled little brat oh god brynn looked behind them a few minutes this was important she sensed they could afford a few minutes the men were miles away tell me my husband she cleared her throat my husbands seeing somebody else what a faint pained smile and she managed to say hes cheating on me i said hes on a business trip he is but hes not going alone im sorry a girlfriend of mine works for the travel agency his company uses i made her tell me hes going with somebody else maybe its just somebody he works with no its not and they got one hotel room oh i was so mad and so hurt i couldnt be alone this weekend i just couldnt be i talked emma and steve into coming up here and bringing me along i wanted to cry on their shoulders i wanted them to tell me its not my fault that hes a bastard that they would be my friends after the divorce and dump him and now theyre dead because i couldnt act like a grownup thats hardly your fault brynn looked back and saw no pursuers nor any sign of their mascot the wolf she put her arm around the young woman and helped her to her feet lets walk tell me while we walk michelle complied they collected her pool cue and continued toward the river how longve you been married six years her voice caught michael was like my best friend everything seemed so fine he was so laidback generous he took really good care of me and you know whats so messed up thats why i lost himbeing a spoiled little girl she gave a sour laugh hes a banker he makes all this money when we got married i quit my job its not like he wanted me to or anything it was my idea it was like my chance to go to acting school michelle winced stepping hard and apparently jarring her ankle she continued i told you i was an actress bullshit im a twentynineyearold acting student and not a very good one i was an extra in two local commercials and second city told me no my life is lunch with my girlfriends tennis my health club my spa the only thing im good at is spending money shopping and keeping myself in shape to the tune of a svelte size brynn couldnt help but observe and i becamea nobody michaeld come home and i couldnt even talk about the houseworkbecause the maids had done it all i got boring he fell out of love with me part of a law enforcers job is to recognize the psychological issues at work within the people she meets professionallythe bystanders witnesses and victims in addition to the criminals brynn didnt know that she had any particular insights but she told michelle her honest assessment its not all your fault it never is im such a loser no youre not brynn believed this a little spoiled true a little too pampered a little too much in love with money and the good life in a curious way maybe this night was teaching her there was more within her than a richgirl dilettante as for the other issue the more important one brynn now put her arm around michelles shoulders theres one thing you have to understand whether you asked them here or not made no difference whoever killed emma and steve was a professional hired to murder her if it wasnt tonight it wouldve been next week you had nothing to do with that you think i do yes the girl wasnt completely convinced brynn knew that guilt has a complex dna it doesnt need to be purebred to be virulent but michelle seemed to take some comfort in brynns words i just wish i could turn back the clock isnt that a prayer for every day brynn thought michelle sighed im sorry i lost it i shouldntve screamed i dont think we have to worry theyre miles away in the bottom of the ravine they couldnt hear a thing graham boyd was pulled from his stew of thoughts about his wife when he heard the distinctive sound of the engine in his f start up somebodys stealing the truck he stared at his motherinlaw and instinctively slapped his pants pocket felt his set of keys how he wondered in the shows anna watched matlock and magnum pi everybody was hotwiring cars he didnt think you could anymore but when he saw the deadbolt on the kitchen door open and that the spare keys he kept on the hook were gone he knew jesus not this not now ill call the sheriff anna said no graham shouted its okay he ran outside the truck was backing up against the gardening shed to turn around so the driver could head out hood first down the narrow driveway it tapped into the corrugated metal with a loud bang not much damage none to the truck the driver slammed the transmission into drive waving his hands like a traffic cop graham walked to the passenger window which was open joey looked straight at him with a fierce expression graham said shut off the engine get out of the truck no joey do it now this minute you cant make me im going to look for mom out of the car now no there are people doing that tom dahl some deputies shell be fine you keep saying that he shouted but how do you know true graham thought he saw the boys edgy eyes his firm grip on the wheel he wasnt shorthis father was well over six feetbut he was skinny and looked tiny in the big seat im going he still couldnt make the turn down the driveway so he eased forward tapped a trash can and backed up again this time judging correctly he stopped before he hit the shed he straightened the wheels toward the road and put the truck in forward once more joey no we dont even know where she is saying this seemed like a retreat he shouldnt be arguing from logic he was commanderinchief instinct remember lake mondac shut the engine off get out of the truck should he reach in for the keys what if the boys foot slipped off the brake one of grahams workers had been badly injured reaching into a moving truck just like this trying to grab the shifter when the driver forgot to engage it our bodies are no match for two tons of steel and detonating gasoline he glanced at the seat jesus the boy had a pellet gungraham recognized the powerful breakaction model at close range it was as accurate as a and as deadly to squirrels and river rats brynn had forbidden him to have weapons where had he gotten it stolen graham wondered joey now graham snapped you cant do anything your motherll be home soon and shed be furious if you werent here another retreat in the betheparentincontrol game no she wont somethings wrong i know somethings wrong the boy let up on the brake and the vehicle began to roll forward and not even thinking graham ran in front of the vehicle and stood there hands on the hood graham anna called from the porch no dont make a war out of it and he thought no its time somebody did make it a war get out of that truck im going to find mom the only thing keeping him alive was a twelveyearolds untied running shoe on the pedal of brakes that had needed servicing for a year no youre not shut the engine off joey im not going to tell you again when graham was a child that was all his father had needed to say to get him to comply though the offenses back then were things like failure to take out the trash or neglecting his homework im going the truck lurched forward a foot graham gasped but didnt move if you move he told himself you lose though his mind was also running through the places he could leap if the boy floored the accelerator he didnt think hed make it in time youre not going the boy raged are you he was inclined to say its not our job to go let the police do their thing theyre the experts but instead he said calmly get out of the truck aware that his instincts might be about to kill him are you going to go find her he muttered something else graham thought one word was coward joey get out of the way the boy screamed his eyes were wild for a momentan eternal momentgraham believed the boy was going to hit the gas then joey grimaced looked down at the shifter and shoved it into park he climbed out reaching for the gun no leave it graham walked up to the boy and put his arm around his shoulders come on joey he said kindly lets get some the boy who seemed furious at this defeat shrugged the gesture off and stormed into the house past his grandmother saying not a word after a compass reading the women continued through a portion of the park less entangled with shrubbery and ground cover than the area theyd left behind around lake mondac there were patches of clearinggrass and meadow and increasingly imposing rock formations pushed up by glaciers millions of years ago they walked in silence now a quarter mile from the last compass check brynn was about to ask michelle how her ankle was feeling instead she said my husband is too shocking herself did i really say that she wondered my god did i really michelle glanced at her frowning your husband just like yours brynn inhaled the cold fragrant air grahams having an affair oh god im sorry are you separated getting a divorce after a pause she said no he doesnt know i found out then she regretted speaking this was absurd brynn thought just shut up and keep walking but she wanted to tell the story desperately wanted to which was curious because she hadnt shared it with anyone else not her mother not her best friend katie from the fire department or kim from the parentteacher organization in fact she supposed it was significant that only here in these extreme circumstances with a complete stranger could she talk about what had been tormenting her for months part of her hoped michelle would respond with a few words of sympathy that the subject would dwindle and they could get back to completing their trek but the young woman responded with genuine interest tell me please whats the story brynn arranged her thoughts finally she said i was married to a state trooper keith marshall she glanced at michelle to see if the name had registered it didnt seem to brynn continued we met at a state police training seminar in madison she remembered seeing the tall broadshouldered man standing in front of the table that served as their desk keith had glanced her way with a lingering gaze that confessed he certainly liked her looks but she hadnt really caught his interest until her turn to run a mock hostage negotiation which the psychologist running the exercise said was perfect what really got his attention though seemed to be the glock fieldstripping and reassembly test she had her slide mounted and clip loaded while the runnerup was still struggling to get the locking block pin back into the frame thats pretty romantic michelle offered what brynn had thought too after the seminar theyd had coffee and discussed smalltown policing and smalltown dating hed winced once and shed asked if he was all right then he explained that hed just gotten back from a medical hed been shot in a real hostage rescue which nonetheless ended happilyfor everybody but the hostage takers the hts didnt quite make it oh that incident shed thought recalling the bank robbery gone bad two armed tweakersmeth headsinside a branch of piny grove savings with customers and employees the windows were too thick for a safe sniper shot so keith had walked around the barricade and through the front door holding his weapon at his side not even crouching to present a smaller target hed shot one in the head took a round in the side and in the vest from the other one then killed him too through the kiosk he tried to hide behind the hts didnt quite make it keith had recovered quickly from his minor injuries he was reprimandedit had to be donefor the bruce willis clint eastwood procedure but nobody had treated his disobedience very seriously and of course the media had lapped it up like a kitten gorging on milk brynn made him tell her the story in depth she was fascinated too fascinated shed decided later utterly won over by the tough quiet man their first date involved a horror movie mexican food and lengthy discussions of calibers body armor and highspeed chases they were married eleven months after that so you married a cowboy brynn nodded michelle added with a grimace i married my father my therapist says anyway what happened ah what happened brynn managed to refrain from stroking her deformed jaw but couldnt stop a compulsive memory keith his face flipping instantly from rage to shock stumbling back under the impact of the bullet gripping his chest as their brightly lit kitchen filled with the pungent smell of gun smoke from her service glock brynn michelle persisted softly what happened finally she whispered things just didnt work out so there i was single again i had joey and my jobmy mother was living with us then so there was a builtin babysitter i loved work had no plans to get married again but a couple years ago i met graham bought some plants from his landscaping company they didnt work out too well and i came back for more he told me what i was doing wrong and then asked me out i said yes he was funny he was nice he wanted children but his first wife hadnt we went out for a while and i found it was really comfortable he proposed i accepted comfortables nice oh real nice no fights home every night but now she was touching her jaw she lowered her hand brynn grimaced a little time goes by and suddenly im working more assignments longer hours tougher jobs lot of domestics and when i wasnt doing that id spend time with joey hed had some problems at school thats an issue i dont know if you heard children of law enforcers michelle shook her head statistically more behavior problems psychological issues joey keeps getting into scrapes at school and he can be a little recklesshe skateboards like a speeddemon so i was focusing on my job and on joey and next thing i know grahams started going out to regular poker games but they werent really poker games sometimes they were but sometimes he wouldnt go for the whole game sometimes he didnt show up at all one thing she didnt share with michelle was that when tom dahl asked her to drive to lake mondac earlier her first thought was if i go graham cant leave tonight cant see her thinking too he didnt answer his phone when shed called from the car had he gone anyway youre sure michelle asked oh there was an eyewitness saw them together do you trust im pretty much it was me brynn could picture the scene now outside of humboldt driving in a detectives car to a briefing on a meth lab situation shed seen graham standing next to a blonde tall outside the albemarle motel she was nodding smiling brynn remembered it seemed like a nice smile he was talking to her head down outside the motel when hed told brynn that he was going to be twenty miles away on a job in lancaster at dinner that night hed looked her in the eye and told her about the drive up to that idyllic vacation town how the job had goneoffering a liars saturation bombing of too many details brynn knew all about that shed run plenty of traffic stops seeing them at the motel shed wondered was it after or before theyd been to the room whatd you say to him nothing no i dont know why exactly didnt want to rock the boat for joey splitting with keith then another divorce couldnt do that to him and hes such a good person graham is aside from cheating michelle said darkly brynn smiled wanly and echoed her earlier comment its not all his fault really im pretty good at being a deputy im not so good at this family stuff i think people ought to take more than a blood test when they get married there ought to be a twoday exam like the bar brynn felt like she was in a movie a comedy in which two sisters separated young are reunited one whod gone to live the high life in the city one off to the country and then they find themselves going on some trip together and learning that at heart theyre virtually the same michelle paused then pointed ahead and to the left careful theres a steep dropoff that way they steered the safer route brynn realized that for the first time that night michelle was walking in the leadand she was content to let her there they are compton lewis touched harts good arm and pointed through a gap in the trees two three hundred yards away they could just make out in the moonlight the backs of two figures dressed in dark clothes one limping along using what looked like a pool cue for a walking stick hart nodded his heart tapped faster seeing their quarry in clear view at last not quite in range but close and completely unsuspecting the men began to move toward their targets the trickster had been at work again as theyd stood at the top of the cliff the bloody ledge below hart had been debating fiercely with himself had the women really tried to climb down the rock face and make for the ranger station or had they continued along the joliet trail finally hed decided that brynn was faking if either one of them had actually fallen and been hurt she wouldve done whatever she could to hide the bloodstain with dirt or mud leaving it exposed was an attempt to fool them get them to head to the station hart had turned the trick against them though he wanted brynn to think shed been successful lull them into slowing down and growing careless he didnt know for sure if theyd have any view of the cliff face but in case they did hed decided to sacrifice one of the flashlights hed tied it to a rope made out of lewiss cutup undershirt and dangled it from a branch the wind eased it back and forth close to the ledge giving the impression they were searching for a way to climb down to the forest floor and pursue the women to the station the craftsman had surveyed his handiwork and he was pleased then he and lewis had continued fast over the trail but as to where the women had actually gonethat was up for speculation it was likely theyd continued on the trail which according to the gps kept northeast for a waysthrough nearly fifteen miles of woods they wouldnt have gone that way somewhere north of here theyd have to make a decision they could go left off the trail west bypass the ranger station and find the road that led eventually to the county highway or they might go north aiming for the snake river which would lead them either west to the interstate or east to the town of point of rocks but thanks to the screamthe wailing voice a few minutes beforehe knew that they were making for the river the earlier shoutfrom the intersection by the shelterhad been faked of course like the screams when the men were shooting at the canoe but the second howling was real hart knew since the women believed the men had climbed down the cliff and were miles away hart and lewis had left the trail too and moved in the general direction of the sound picking their way slowly to avoid noisy leaves and branches as well as the knifesharp thorns and the steep dropoffs as for where the women actually were in this mess of woods north of the trail they couldnt sayuntil they found a clue lewis stopped pointing to something white lying on the ground small but very bright in the sea of blacks they approached it very slowly hart didnt think it was a trapcouldnt imagine what it would bebut he didnt trust anything about brynn now the trickster cover me ill check it out dont shoot unless im about to get shot or stuck i dont want to give us away a nod hart crouching moved in close until he was about three feet away from the object it was a white tube about eighteen inches long and three inches wide one end bulged out he prodded the object with a branch when nothing happened he looked around lewis was scanning the nearby scenery he gave a thumbsup to hart the man bent down and picked it up lewis joined him a sock with a billiard ball inside that was theirs has to be its clean and dry shit one of em was going to use that to clobber us man thatd break some bone brynn hart thought whats that lewis asked hart looked at him eyebrow raised whatd you say i missed it nothing didnt say a thing had he said her name aloud theyd continued straight going almost due north just now their prey had come into view they were directly behind the women on a relatively flat stretch of forest mostly oak and maple and birch that seemed to end in a clearing about a quarter mile ahead to the right the ground dropped sharply toward a small rocky trougha streambed feeding what seemed to be a small lake surrounded by dense pine forest on their left the ground rose to a series of ridges some covered with trees some dotted with brush and rock some bald hart crouched motioning lewis to join him the man complied instantly were going to split up here you go way round to the left that ridge see it a nod youll be in grass so you can move faster then come in and get close to them on their left flank ill keep going straight come up behind them when they hit that place theresee that sweet little clearing yeah got it ill wave the sock he tapped his pocket where hed stuffed the billiard ball cudgel you shoot thatll keep em down i ll come up behind and finish them bodies lewis asked we cant leave em the animalsll carry the parts off all over the park thatll be a lot of evidence no well bury them been cold this april grounds pretty hard still and whatll we dig with lewis looked around he pointed at a small lake to their right there we could weigh em down with rocks probably nobody comes there its a pretty shitty little lake hart glanced at it good now ill set the choke wide but if i dont hit both of em with the first shot the otherll go to cover right away well have to track her down whod i ought to target first michelle or the cop hart was watching the women make their way through the forest casual as oblivious tourists you get michelle ill take brynn my pleasure lewis nodded it was clearly his preference anyway the white f sped out of humboldt and onto the highway the pickup truck was doing close to fifty the gassy engine accelerating hard graham boyd was driving and his only passengers were three azaleas in the truck bed which he hadnt bothered to untether hed locked away the pellet gun in the same closet that contained joeys skateboard after the confrontation with his stepson hed gone into the boys room to talk to him but he was pretending to sleep graham had called joey twice in a whisper part of him had been relieved that the boy didnt respond hed had no clue what he was going to say he just hated that all this tension was unresolved hed thought about taking the game cartridges the computer and the whole xbox itself and locking them in the toolshed but he didnt it seemed to him that when it came to children decisions about punishments shouldnt be made in anger youre the adult hes the child chalk that one up to instinct hed checked five minutes later and the light under the boys door was still out im pretty worried graham anna had said hed stared again at the picture of his wife in her velvet helmet and riding outfit and then walked out the back door with a full beer bottle in his hand so cold it stung his fingers hed stood on the small deck which hed built himself and looked up at the halfmoon hed fished his phone from his pocket intending to try to reach brynn but then paused what if the man answered again graham knew he wouldnt be able to stay calm if he gave away that they were suspicious and the police were on their way then the man might hurt brynn and flee hed dropped the phone into his pocket and poured the beer onto a mulch bed surrounding a christmas azalea behind the deck when hed returned to the living room hed blinked in surprise joey had come downstairs in his pajamas he was curled up on the couch beside his grandmother his head in her lap anna was whispersinging joey a song grahams eyes had met his motherinlaws hed pointed to himself and then the door you sure you want to do that graham shed asked softly no hed thought but nodded ill hold down the fort here be careful please be careful hed fired up the temperamental engine and sped out of his driveway tires skidding and scattering gravel now he gripped his phone again started to type in a numbersandra of course wasnt on speed dial but he hesitated and decided not to call her he slipped the device back into his pocket the protocol was off the hour was late and hed already talked to her earlier briefly sneaking a call when anna was in the bathroom to tell her he couldnt make it tonight and even if she answered now which she probably would not what would he tell her he wasnt sure besides he reasoned it was better to concentrate on his driving he was going just over seventy in a forty zone defying any trooper to stop him what exactly he would do when he got to lake mondac he had no idea why he was doing this was even more of a mystery for his part he longed to be lying in bed endofday groggy with his arm around his wifes tummy and lips against her shoulder talk about his day at work and hers a dinner party coming up on friday their childs braces and report card a refinancing offer on the mortgage until they dozed off one after the other but that wasnt apparently to be his fate would it ever be and when tomorrow next year defying the troopers further he edged the boxy truck up to eighty as the kidnapped azaleas shivered in the back there brynn whispered excitedly see that what michelle was following brynns extended arm as they crouched behind a stillbare dogwood the ground beneath them thick with crocus shoots and fragrant decay in the distance a thin sparkling ribbon the river the snake their lifeline they walked for five minutes without another glimpse of the water brynn was looking around to orient herself and make sure they were traveling in the right direction when she froze jesus she crouched a hum of fear in her chest it was one of the men the one with the shotgun harts partner he was no more than two hundred yards away on a ridge to their left its my fault michelles face was grim i had that fucking outburst her face revealed the selfdisgust of earlier they heard me spoiled little girl no brynn whispered they couldnt be here this fast if theyd bought our trick at the cliff they rigged something with the flashlight hart did to fool us same way i tried to fool him except his trick worked and where was he hart she remembered a recent tactical training course the instructor had lectured about piewedge crossfire never directly opposite of courserisk of friendly fire injuries hart would be coming up behind them not from the right flank she couldnt see him but she knew he was back there someplace which meant the men had spotted them and were moving in for the kill they were on flat ground here headed for a clearing which brynn had been looking forward tono dense tangles to fight through just planes of low grass flat but now she steered michelle to the right toward a steep rocky hill several hundred feet long descending to a creek bed at the bottom there was no moonlight and theyd have good cover there down into the ravine do the best you can come on fast they started down the hill sticking to the thicker clumps of oak and dense brush where theyd be less of a target they half slid half ran scrabbling down the steep slope michelle in front brynn behind her they were doing well until halfway down brynn tripped her foot catching on a vine or branch she landed hard on her butt and slid on the slick leaves right into michelle taking her legs out from under her they began a long unstoppable tumble down the hillside brynn desperately trying to keep a grip on the spear so it didnt slash either of them to death they ended up in a shallow ravine the knife in brynns pocket had poked through the ski parka but the blade hadnt cut her michelle lay on her back frantically patting her belly brynn was terrified that the younger womans knife had cut her deeply gasping for breath brynn whispered you all right michelles hand found the knife inside her jacket it hadnt apparently done any damage a nod brynn slowly sat up gripping the spear she looked around and saw a depression in the dry creek bed they headed into it brush and a natural line of threeand fourfoot boulders gave them some cover look michelle whispered and pointed brynn watched harts partner holding the shotgun ready to shoot moving easttoward themin a jog the breeze was busily stirring leaves but he mustve heard something he was looking directly at the spot where theyd fallen then he gazed around him and vanished into a thick copse of trees to the north brynn gripped the spear handle staring toward him hows your ankle okay i fell on my other leg scanning the hill neither of the men was visible brynn was estimating distances and speculating where the partner mightve gone michelle whispered something brynn didnt hear she was lost in consideration she made a decision then surveyed the ground okay were going to split up i want you to move that way stay in the ravine and keep your head down over there see that dip get down into it and cover yourself up with leaves what are you going to do michelle asked her eyes wide see it brynn repeated firmly youre going to go after him arent you times to run times to fight brynn nodded i want to come with you i can help itll be a bigger help to me if you just stay hid michelle looked somber for a moment then smiled i wont worry about breaking a nail if thats what you mean brynn smiled too this is my job let me do it now go on down there cover yourself up if they get close and you have to run she looked along the dry streambed and pointed to the lake which was really no more than a pond thatll be our rallying point the near shore by those rocks rallying point whats that where soldiers meet when they get split up its not a cop thing i got it from saving private ryan drawing another smile from michelle charles gandy a lean bearded man in his early thirties wearing a north face insulated windbreaker stood beside a winnebago camper parked in the woods of marquette state park next to a ramshackle ranger station that had been abandoned years ago the camper was nicked and dented and the butt end sported a half dozen bumper stickers extolling the importance of green energy and listing such accomplishments as mountain biking snoqualmie pass and hiking the appalachian trail you hear anything else honey asked susan a round woman with straight light brown hair a few years older than gandy she wore a necklace in the shape of an egyptian ankh two braided friendship bracelets and a wedding ring nope what was it voices im pretty sure well sounded like a shout almost the parks closed and this time of night i know whens rudy due back any time her husband squinted into the night daddy he turned to see his nineyearold stepdaughter standing in the doorway tshirt denim skirt and old running shoes amy its time for bed im helping mommy she wanted me to gandy was distracted all right whatever your mom says but go on inside its freezing out here the girl disappeared with a swirl of long blond hair the camper had two doors front and back gandy walked to the back one stepped inside and found a battered deer rifle he loaded the clip whatre you doing honey ive got to go see but the rangers not around here and not now you lock up tight pull the curtains and dont open the door for anybody cept me or rudy sure honey be careful susan climbed the steps inside and closed and locked the door shutters closed and the camper went dark the faint sound of the generator was pretty much covered up by the wind good zipping up his jacket and pulling on a gray knitted hat that susan had bought him for his birthday gandy started down the small path that led eventually to the joliet trail the rifle held in the crook of his arm he made his way south and east theyd been here for four days and hed spent much of that time hiking nearby he knew the place well had found impromptu paths and trails made by deertrampled leaves broken branches and pelletsand people ditto minus the shit he moved slowly cautiously not afraid of getting lost afraid of whom he might run into out here had that sound been a scream or not he wondered if so human or animal gandy now walked two or three hundred yards in the direction he thought hed heard the sounds and then knelt down surveying the moonlit forest he heard snaps and a crack or too not far away maybe branches falling maybe deer maybe bear or maybe my damn imagination but then he tensed there yesno doubt about it he was looking at a persona woman he was suremoving from tree to tree keeping low she was carrying something in her hand it seemed thin a rifle he gripped his own a savage tightly what was this all about shouting and howling in a deserted and officially closed state park so late at night his heart was slamming his instinct was to get back to the camper and get the hell out of here but the rattling diesel engine could attract unwanted attention as he hunkered low spying on her he wondered why she was acting like a soldier cautious creeping from cover to cover she was clearly no ranger she didnt have on a distinctive smokey the bear hat or a typical ranger uniform jacket it seemed she was in a ski parka his instincts told him she was a threat the woman disappeared behind a large clump of blackberry and he didnt see her emerge gandy rose and holding the gun muzzle up moved in her direction just get the hell out of here part of his mind shouted but then no youve got too much at stake keep going he stopped at a steep decline that led down to the forest floor steadying himself with his left hand on thin birch and oak saplings and then when the ground flattened he moved toward the bush where the woman had disappeared he studied the area no sign of her then there she was thirty or so feet away she was in shadow but he could just make her out lying half hidden beside the bush her head down like a lioness waiting for an antelope very quietly he worked the bolt on the savage chambering a round and started forward picking his steps around branches and leaves as if he were treading through a minefield playing at being a soldier himself a role he wasnt very comfortable with at all kristen brynn mckenzie crouched behind a gnarled but stately black oak gripping the pool cue spear hard and taking deep breaths her mouth open wide for silence shed climbed back up the hill toward the spot where the man had disappeared her palms sweated though she was cold again having slipped out of her parka and one set of sweatpants the clothes stuffed with leaves now sat like a fallen scarecrow under a blackberry bush bait to attract harts partner the trick seemed to be working he was now approaching cautiously still no sign of hart good shed thought one on one i can take you shed risked his shooting at her from a distance and stepped into the moonlight to give him a brief view of her then disappeared fast behind the blackberry bush where shed stripped off the clothes and left them on the ground like someone hurt or hiding shed slipped down the hill circled back to this tree praying that harts partner would take the bait which he had gun pointed up the shadowy form started down the hill toward the effigy brynn now huddled behind the tree tracking his progress by his footsteps her hearing was sharply attuned all her senses were in fact the blade of the spear the chicago cutlery knife was close to her face deep in the shadow of the tree so that it wouldnt flash in the moonlight and give her position away she reflected that it was curious that this unused knifes first task wouldnt be to trim a beef tenderloin or chicken cutlet but to kill a human being and she reflected too that this thought troubled her very little a faint snap a rustle then the breeze came up and blew hard she momentarily lost track of his footfalls in the scampering of leaves and the hiss through branches where she thought in panic then she could hear him again the partner was still headed directly for the bait his route would take him just past the tree where she was hiding twenty feet ten feet the faint crunch of his steps she examined as much of the area as she could from her hunting blind looking for hart nothing six feet five then he was even with the tree finally he walked past it brynn looked out at his back hed swapped the combat jacket she remembered from the feldmans for a north face ski parka which hed probably stolen from their house or from lake view hed put on a cap too covering his blond crew cut okay nows the time she told herself her body filled with a calm almost euphoric sensation this had happened on other occasions but usually at the most unexpected times a triplecombination jump with her atop a speeding chestnut mare in a horse competition a frantic pursuit of a weapons dealer down a county road hitting mph when she and keith on vacation defused a potentially fatal fight by two teenagers in biloxi times to fight she now thought stun him with the bolo and charge in fast jam the spear into his back as hard as you can grab the shotgun and get ready for hart to come because come he wouldat the first sound of his partners screams brynn stepped from the tree sized up her target then swung the bolo and let it fly the ball arced toward him and clipped his ear he cried out and dropped the gun brynn ignored the pain in her body and leapt forward she wasnt a deputy now not a wife or mother she was the wolf a primitive creature survival its only thought running running toes of her boots digging into the hard earth in her hands the spear now gleaming bright in the cold light and aimed directly for him she managed to resist a fierce urge to let go a mad howl now they were gone hell for ten minutes hart had closed the distance between himself and the women heading straight toward the clearingthe shooting zone he thought of itwhile hed kept tabs on lewis the other man had seen or heard something to the right the east and hurried down the hill to the flatter ground hed looked around but apparently it had been a false alarm hed returned to the woody ridge on harts left both men had continued forward scanning the landscape for the prey that had disappeared where were they had they spotted him or lewis and if they had what were their options for escape the clearing was in frontto the northand they obviously werent there lewis was now on a ridge to the west and hart himself was facing due south there was a band of trees around the clearing which the women might be hiding in or they mightve fled down a steep dropoff to the right and were making their way east into the thick of the park that direction would take them back eventually to the joliet but according to the gps the trail was a long way off now and theyd have to cover miles of dense woods to get there what would brynn do he decided shed gone down the incline that led to the streambed and then continued north toward the snake riveronly avoiding the exposure of the clearing a longer route and harder but safer she was like an animal with finely tuned instincts of survival anticipating him he glanced toward the ridge where lewis had now paused and was looking around then he turned to him and lifted his arms meaning theyve vanished hart pointed to himself and then to lewis who nodded hart began the climb to the high ground to join his partner where where was michelle carrying the savage rifle in one hand the spear in the other brynn mckenzie paused and looked around her she was disoriented shed been so focused on harts partner that she hadnt paid enough attention to her route after shed left the other woman to hide under the blanket of leaves had she gone to the rallying point brynn hoped not the lake was farther than shed thought and she didnt want to have to make any detours she was flagging as it was then she spotted a configuration of trees that looked familiar she paused glancing around for the pursuers none in sight she jogged down a short hill turning the corner behind a large rock brynn stopped suddenly startled michelle was reaching into her pocket to grab her knife her eyes were fierce feral brynn stopped and blinked the young woman sighed in relief jesus brynn you scared me shhh theyre still around here someplace what happened the young woman whispered whered you get that looking at the rifle come on quick i hurt somebody one of them michelles eyes glowed brynn grimaced no what somebody else this way they climbed the hill back to the blackberry tangle where the bearded man was sitting on the ground head low between his legs nursing his torn ear he looked up at michelle blinked then nodded wincing brynn explained that shed beaned him with the billiard ball and was charging forward to spear him when hed glanced back having heard her footsteps shed stopped just before she stabbed him seeing his bearded face realizing her mistake not expecting to find anyone else out here armed and stoked by adrenaline brynn had missed that he was carrying a deer rifle not a shotgun and that his build seemed different from harts partners brynn had apologized profusely still she was a law officer and after showing her id and badge took control of the weapon and asked to see his drivers license his name was charles gandy he and his wife and some friends were camping in a winnebago not far away are you okay to walk she asked him brynn wanted to get to the camper as soon as they could sure its not bad he was holding the sock from the bolo against his injured ear it seemed most of the bleeding had stopped which didnt mean he wasnt going to sue the department but that was fine with brynn shed insist that the county pay whatever he wanted she couldnt describe the reassurance she felt having found a way to escape from the parkand with a rifle in her hands control while brynn kept guard michelle helped gandy up youre hurt too he asked nodding at the pool cue its okay michelle said absently looking warily over the overwhelming tangle of branches brush and trees we should get moving brynn said lead the way charles gandy knew the woods well it seemed he directed them past the dry streambed and along paths that brynn hadnt even seen this was good since they avoided entirely the noisy leaves and branches that could have given them away they moved up an incline then he led them around a clearing going steadily higher the general direction was north michelle limped along as quickly as she could now using the spear as her walking stick brynn gripping the rifle followed looking behind more often than she looked forward they paused hiding behind a sevenor eightfoot outcropping of granite gandy touched brynns arm and pointed her heart jumped across a long ravine was a bare ridge hart and his partner holding the shotgun stood there scanning the ground frustration seemed evident in their posture is that the ones you were telling me about gandy asked softly she nodded it was then that michelle whispered shoot them brynn turned toward her wideeyed the young woman said go ahead and shoot them brynn looked down at the rifle in her hands she said nothing didnt move michelles head turned toward gandy he said hey dont look at me i work in an organic grocery store for a living ill do it michelle said give me the gun no youre a civilian if you killed one of them itd be murder youd get off probably but you dont want to go there then brynn leaned over a large rock set the rifle on it the muzzle in the mens direction they were about one hundred yards away and gandys rifle didnt have a telescopic sight but brynn was familiar with riflesfrom the training courses mostly shed also been hunting a few times though she gave it up years ago on a trip to minnesota keith had been reloading his rifle when theyd been charged by a wild boar brynn had killed the crazed animal with two fast shots shed quit the sport after that not out of fearshed secretly enjoyed the rushbut because shed killed an animal whose only crime was defending its invaded home shed been prepared to kill the partner with her spear a few minutes ago but this seemed different shooting somebody like a sniper well are you going to do it or not brynn coolly asked herself if so now theyre not going to be standing still forever brynn decided to aim about two inches high to compensate for the arcing of the bullet over that distance the breeze well that was anybodys guess it whipsawed back and forth have to hope for luck here brynn gazed down the notch in the back of the rifle and the blade sight in the front both eyes open she flicked the safety off she started to squeeze the trigger the trick was to keep the sights aligned on the target and apply pressure until the gun went off you never actually pull the trigger but just then the men separated what had been a cluster of target became two distinct ones hart had apparently seen something and had moved forward he was pointing are you sure you want to do that gandy asked are you sure its them yes michelle snapped in a whisper its them shoot but which one brynn asked herself assuming the one i dont hit gets under cover who should i target choose now she aimed at the partner the man with the shotgun she lifted the muzzle high began to squeeze the trigger again but at that moment the men started down into the ravine in an instant they were simply dark forms moving through the brush no michelle cried shoot anyway then there was no target theyd disappeared brynn lowered her head why had she hesitated she wondered why gandy said we better go theyre headed in this direction brynn didnt look at michelle it was as if the young woman the spoiled princess the dilettante had been more in control than she why didnt i take the shot she clicked on the safety and stared at the pool of gloom where hart and his partner had disappeared then turned away to follow the others the campers not far gandy said a quarter mile my friends got a van and he should be back now he was getting some food and beer well all jump in it and get out of here whos there michelle asked my wife and stepdaughter a couple of our friends stepdaughter amy shes nine gandy touched his ear and examined his fingers the bleeding had stopped shes with you tonight brynn asked frowning its spring break he noted her troubled expression whats wrong i didnt know you had a child she said softly youre not bringing us trouble if thats what youre thinking imagine whatd happen if i hadnt found you those guys mightve stumbled onto our camper and who knows what they wouldve done you have a phone michelle asked brynns first question after shed made sure gandy wasnt badly hurt i was telling your friend he replied im not a big fan of microwaves in the brain but weve got one back at the camper he asked brynn say you have a helicopter you could get officers here pretty fast with one of them brynn said just medevac not tactical she was thinking about the daughter and the mans family here shed tried all night not to bring this horror to innocent local residentsand now shed endangered a family with a child walking fast breathless from the largely uphill route theyd put the ravine far behind them brynn shamefully thought of it as the place where i balked she was furious with herself for the lapse gandy said to brynn you just said they were after you you didnt say why michelle wincing as she limped said they killed my friends im a witness no oh my god brynn added house breakin by lake mondac justyou mean tonight michelle nodded im so sorry i gandy could think of nothing to say he asked brynn and you tried to arrest them there was a nineoneone call we werent sure what it was about i got there afterward lost the car and my weapon we had to run lake mondac wheres that about five six miles south we were making for the snake when they found us we had to detour how much farther to your camper not far he paused as a sheet of high cloud slipped between earth and moon and complete darkness enveloped them a thin wash of illumination returned and he gestured to their right gandy led them farther through the woods then pointed out the start of a smaller trail after they began down it he stopped and gathered some brush using it to obscure the path brynn helped him add more camouflage michelle pitched in too looking over their handiwork and announcing perfect theyll never find it brynn shivered the adrenaline from her abortive assaultand the sniper shothad worn off shed dressed once more in the parka and the second set of sweats but the chill was back in her bones are you in a campground the searchandrescue mission here had been limited to the joliet trail and the snake river gorge no theres an old ranger station and a parking lot deserted all overgrown nobodys been there for years looks like kind of spooky stephen king ought to write a book about it ghost rangers he could call it brynn asked how far to the access road from there gandy considered this for a moment theres a dirt road that goes for about a mile it takes you to the main road in the park then its about four miles to the entrance on six eightytwo thats the closest he looked their way you can relax well be on the highway in twenty minutes where hart muttered the men were moving through the dry streambed where theyd seen their prey disappear look lewis called softly he was staring at a muddy patch of ground what i cant see anything lewis pulled off his jacket and made a tent with it he took a cigarette lighter out of his pocket and inside the garment flicked it kneeling hart could see a series of footprints in the mud they came from three people how old you think those are look fresh to me who the hells with them shit if its a cop hes got a cell phone or radio the lighter clicked off the men stood up and looked around as lewis tugged his jacket on hefted the shotgun he shook his head you wouldnt think a copd be around this time of night true but who elsed be here no campers this time of year ranger maybe we gotta find em fast hart walked a little farther up the streambed he crouched and ran his hand over another patch of mud theyre going that way he pointed up the hill that a path looks like it hart grabbed a fallen tree trunk to push himself to his feet the wood was rotten and a portion of it crumbled under his grip in less than a second the rattlesnake nesting inside about two and a half feet long had launched itself silently into the back of harts handon his good arm before he could even shout in horror the dark glistening stripe of muscle had vanished lewis hart pulled off his glove and saw two puncture wounds in the back of his hand near the wrist shit was he going to die one of the fangs had pierced a vein feeling faint he sat down lewis whod seen the strike flicked his lighter and examined the wound hart asked should i suck it out i saw that on tv a movie youre going to be okay you dont want to suck it out venom gets to your heart faster under your tongue than through a vein hart noted that his breathing was suddenly coming fast stay calm the calmer the better let me look lewis studied the wound carefully you going to burn it harts eyes danced as he gazed at the bic flame no relax lewis let the lighter go dark he took a shotgun shell out of his pocket and with his buck knife carefully cut it open he tossed aside the pellets and the plastic wad hold your other hand out hart did and the man poured the gunpowder fine little black cylinders into his cupped palm lewis told him spit in it go ahead spit i know what im doing go ahead hart did this again get it wet okay then lewis reached into his inner pocket and took out a pack of camels he smiled like a cookiestealing schoolboy i meant to give up smoking last week then he ripped open three cigarettes and sprinkled the tobacco into harts palm mix it all up hart thought this was crazy but he was feeling even more lightheaded he did what he was told with the knife lewis cut the tail off his shirt put that mess on the wound and ill tie it hart pressed the blackbrown wad onto the punctures and lewis tied the cloth around them and helped him put his glove back on itll sting but youll be fine fine i just got bit by a rattler it was pretty much a dry bite a what snake was a rattler yeah but a massasauga they control how much venom they let go theyre small and dont have a lot so they conserve it use it on prey so they can eat for defense they dont use much just enough to scare off a threat well scared the shit out of me i didnt hear it rattle thats only if they sense you coming you surprised him as much as he surprised you no not quite hart muttered i feel faint you got a little venom and youll feel funny some but if that was a wet bite your handd be twice its size and youd be screaming already or out like a light i know weve gotta move but its better you just sit still for five ten minutes hart had been in fist fights hed faced down people with weapons when hed had none and hed exchanged bullets from time to time but nothing had shocked him like that snake this is my world youll see things that arent there and miss things thatre coming up right behind you hart took a deep breath exhaling slowly thats a rush for you he was almost enjoying the giddy sensation he looked down at his hand which had stopped stinging now how come you know all this comp my dad and med go hunting same thing happened to you happened to him he explained it all what to do then he switched my bare behind for not looking where i was going and stepping on the nest they sat in silence for a moment hart wished that lewis had pocketed one of the vodka bottles he wouldnt have minded a jolt right about now hart remembered that lewiss mother was in a home your father still alive yep you see him much not really you know things happen lewis grinned looked away and said nothing more for a moment he started to say something but didnt they looked around at the wilderness the wind shuffling leaves the faint lapping of the lake i was thinking hart yeah when we take care of them and get back home you and me we could do a job together i was thinking with my contacts guys in my crew and your you know the way you plan things and think wed be a good team this thing tonight we just fell into it it happened fast too fast hart muttered to put it mildly i know some people in kenosha theres money there illinois money chicago money so how bout it you and me go on i was thinking of this place outside of town benton plastics you know it no its on haversham road big fucking place sell shit all over the world on payday they have this bigass checkcashing truck the guards this lazy asshole we could walk up and clear twenty thirty thousand if it was early on friday morning how bout that hart was nodding lewis continued id get all the information you know like reconnaissance he patted his shirt felt the cigarettes but it was like he was doing it from habit he wasnt about to light up out here im a good listener everybody talks to me tells me all kinds of shit one time this guy and i were bullshitting and he mentions the name of his dog along with a bunch of other stuff so guess what i boost his atm card and the dogs name is his pin i cleaned him out i got that just by talking that was pretty slick so whatta you say you know what comp i like the idea yeah well look at the details and put together a plan do it right this time a hundred ten percent one ten now ive rested enough weve got unfinished business and our girlfriends could be calling in the cavalry right now you feeling okay lewis asked no sir hart whispered laughing i just got shot i just got snakebit and lets not leave out i nearly took a shower in ammonia no im not feeling okay at all but whats a man going to do lewis picked up the shotgun and they started to walk in the direction the tracks seemed to lead hart flexed his snakebit hand it felt fine he asked that tobacco and gunpowderwhat exactly does it do you ask me it doesnt do shit excepting it calms you down hart inhaled deeply nothing like the smell of country air our lucks changing comp lets go that way i think i see a path looks like the tricksters on our side now right down there in that hollow charles gandy led them along the dim path toward the camper it was a big one their escape vehicle a long panel van like an econoline sat nearby gandys friend was back im freezing michelle muttered gandy smiled you can sit right in front of the heater in the van if you want i want the coldest ive ever been was skiing in colorado and you can head back to the lodge anytime thiss a little different they plunged along another path steeply downhill the camper was in a crumbling parking lot an old building being reclaimed by the forest was nearby they were fifty feet from the lot when brynn inhaling the cool night air stopped suddenly she turned back played her eyes up the path theyd just descended she lifted the gun the others stopped too what is it brynn michelle asked gandy took a step forward paused scanning the forest what he whispered brynn said to gandy get down i heard something over there to the right see anything the man crouched and studied the trees brynn pulled michelle into a crouch on the other side of the path she leaned close to the womans diamondstudded ear smelled sweat and very expensive perfume she said softly were in trouble here michelle dont ask questions and dont say a word you remember the rallying point the young woman froze then nodded when i tell you run for it run like hell keep that with you glancing at the spear but brynn waved her hand dismissing the young womans perplexed frown brynn turned to gandy and in a normal voice asked see anything no brynn clicked the safety off on the savage pointed the weapon at gandy who blinked in shock whatre you doing now michelle run the man stepped back but stopped as brynn tensed run she cried ill meet you where i said michelle hesitated only a moment then fled back up the path she melted into the night what the hells going on here gandy stopped eyes wide in confusion get down on your knees hands on your head this is bullshit now whos in her words were cut off as a hand grabbed her collar from behind and tugged hard off balance she stumbled backward a large woman with straight hair and fury in her eyes stepped in front of her and swung a fishkilling club into her belly brynn dropped to her knees and vomited the gun fell to the ground and the woman snatched it up the fuck is she the woman muttered gandy strode forward and pulled brynn to her feet he searched her and pulled the knife out of her pocket he hit her in the face with a hard fist the pellet wound opened she cried out and shoved gandy away hard making a grab for the rifle in the heavy womans hand but the man twisted the deputy around and got her in a neck lock dont fucking move brynn slumped defeated when he relaxed his grip she stomped on his foot high and hard and he let go a fast scream you fucking cunt the woman aimed the rifle at her and growled thats it honey brynn looked at her pinprick eyes you okay the woman asked gandy do i look okay he spat out he peered up the path was another one she got away who is she they with fletcher he grabbed brynn by the collar and hair howd you know goddamn it howd you know she didnt tell him that the distinctive smell of cooking methamphetaminepropane chlorine and ammoniahad wafted to her on the damp night air the camper was a portable lab lets get inside the woman said looking around weve gotta tell rudy hes not gonna be happy gandy dragged brynn along the path he snarled you scream you say a word youre dead youre the one screamed she couldnt resist saying and was rewarded with another fist in her face the camper was filthy filled with plates of old food and discarded beer cans and clothing and other trash and it was hot a half dozen metal pots sat on two propane stoves canisters of anhydrous ammonia lined one wall a workstation for cutting apart lithium batteries was in the corner there were also huge piles of matches gandy pushed brynn inside and tossed her knife on a table whos she said a scrawny twitchy young man in an aerosmith tshirt and filthy jeans he hadnt shaved in some time or washed his hair his fingernails were black crescents a heavier man in overalls with curly red hair looked brynn over the overweight woman whod slugged her with the club said to a little girl about nine or ten in a shabby tshirt and stained denim skirt keep going youre not through yet the girlamy the stepdaughter brynn assumedblinked at the visitor and returned to filling larger plastic bags with smaller ones containing the finished product the skinny man said lookit her face its all swole up whats going shhh the heavy one snapped whats the story gandy grimaced shes a deputy rudy bullshit dressed like that and shes a fucking mess look at her shes from fletchers crew i saw her id rudy was looking brynn over carefully with a disgusted visage well fuck me police i dont want to burn this place too fuck i dont want to do that after all this work brynn muttered there are troopers on the way shut up gandy said though lethargically as if it would take too much effort to hit her again the skinny one obsessed with her face picked at the speed bumps on his forearm gandy the woman and rudy didnt seem to have been slamming their own product which didnt put her at ease it meant theyd make rational decisions about protecting their operation and that meant killing her and finding michelle and doing the same she remembered how casually gandy had offered his id because the man had known shed be dead soon mommy the woman slapped her own thigh twice apparently a command meaning be quiet amy instantly stopped speaking this infuriated brynnand broke her heart the womans fingers were stained yellow though she probably wasnt a tweaker herself she clearly wanted a cigarette but lighting up in a meth lab would be like using a match to find a gas pocket in a coal mine rudy asked was she alone no somebody was with her she got away they claim a couple of guysre after them i saw em but i dont know whats going on something about a breakin in lake mondac its about five miles i know where it is rudy walked close examined brynns wound he announced sa setup fletcher called them had that ho of his do it ill bet the skanky redhead said we were here didnt have the balls to come up against us himself gandy said i dont know how the hell could he find us here we covered all the tracks rudys eyes went mad for a moment and he leaned into brynns face raging talk to me bitch talk to me whats going on who the fuck are you brynn had dealt with the emotionally disturbed rudy was out of control running on pure anger her heart beat fast from both present fear and past memory of keiths fist strafing her jaw when she said nothing he screamed who are you he pulled a pistol from his taut waistband and pushed it against her neck no brynn whispered and turned away as if avoiding the challenging eyes of a mad dog she managed to say evenly therell be state troopers and county deputies and tactical backup in the area anytime now the woman dropped the club on the counter oh no but gandy was laughing no way she had a fucking spear she was on the run from some assholes broke into a house around here what she told mes the truth no police no troopers oh and no choppers in the county she told me they dont use them around here for tactical work only medical that answers one of our questions he smiled at brynn thanks for the info by the way thats true she said speaking evenly though still struggling to breathe after the blow to her belly the pain was making her jaw quiver we werent part of a drug operation but the protocol is if a deputy doesnt report in a certain amount of time theyll send backup she glared at gandy tactical backup rudy considered this chewing his wet bottom lip he put the gun away she continued if theyre not on their way by now they will be soon dont make this worse on yourselves im way overdue this is a state park the woman said they wont search here rudy sneered well susan why wouldnt they search can you give me a reason of course not jesus dont be stupid we had a good deal going and now its fucked up you understand that you understand how fucked we are sure rudy i understand susan looked away from him and angrily gestured to the child to fill the bags faster gandy said that leaves those other two the men after them at least one had a gun i could see they could be with fletcher rudy asked brynn these meneither of them hispanic one of em black she didnt answer rudy looked at gandy who said was night they were a couple hundred yards away i couldnt tell brynn said youre in enough trouble we can shut up do you believe her these guys just broke in gandy replied i dont know if she was lying she was really good at it you see anybody actually shooting at her no she tried to shoot them with the savage then gandy frowned but she didnt take the shot she couldve that seemed off to me maybe she was trying to trick me i dont know you gave her your gun what was i going to do say no because my familys back in the camper cooking crystal i couldve taken it away from her anytime i wanted but she didnt shoot nope balked why rudy asked moving close to brynn i dont know she thought and stared into the fat mans watery eyes in the corner little blond amy was sealing bags of meth she was working real hard for a kid who was up at this hour rudy grabbed the duct tape the little girl was using taped brynns wrists behind her back and shoved her toward gandy i cant worry about her now well bring her with us get her out of here he glanced at the kettles cool it down everything pack it up to travel fuck what a waste the woman and the skinny young man were shutting down the cooker and filling bags with the finished product amy the mother whined faster whats your problem im sleepy you can sleep when were on the road no excuses wheres chester the child asked hes your doll you should take better care of him rudy took the deer rifle and handed it to the scabby young guy henry get outside up the path dont shoot unless you can take everybody out we dont want any calls for backup if fact dont shoot at all unless you have to you see anybody get your ass back here sure rudy youre notyoure not going to leave with me out there are you rudy gave a guttural sound registering his disgust move gandy roughly took brynns arm limping he pulled her outside and dragged her to the van pushed her inside it was filled with clothes suitcases junk magazines toys bottles of chemicals he looped a rope through her bound arms knotted it to a tiedown brynn said therell be roadblocks and the state police does have choppers youre not going to get through and dont think about using me as a hostage that never works theyll shoot you before you shoot me or after theyd prefer the first but theyll do the second its the way we train he laughed even now youre balls out but i will cut a deal with you you personally call my office well get it worked out me personally you why me because im the one who washes his hands who doesnt say him and me are going to do this because i have green bumper stickers on the camper so i may actually care about the environment which means ill be reasonable yep exactly youve got that little girl in there do it for her at least i just fuck her momma the kids not mine he slid the door closed with a hollow bang james jasons was still some distance from lake mondac but figured hed better cut off the gps not as easy as youd think but hed had a special switch installed those satellites and those serverswho knew what incriminating information they retained good for security but bad to find restaurants still hed spotted a golden arches and went for it he did the drivethrough going for two plain hamburgers sliced apples and a diet cola he was back on the road driving fast but not too far over the limit he looked to all appearances like a slim agreeable businessman but if you got stopped even for nothing other than an unplanned dui roadblockat which theyd let nondrinkers like him go immediatelyyour name and tag might still go into the system but tonight he had to make good time and was pushing the limit he was prepared for a speed stop of course presently listening to jazz he would flip the preset selector on the steering wheel if stopped by a trooper and a christian inspirational sermon would come on he also would slip a spongebacked jesus effigy and prolife sticker onto the dash might not save him from a ticket but it would probably prevent a car search and james jasons definitely didnt want his car searched tonight eating his food he wondered how things were going at great lakes intermodal container services in percent of the cases all you have to do is find a sensitive spot and you touch it thats all you dont need to hit you dont need to stab a touch only instead of sending paulie or chris to extort me mankewitz picks a scrawny little asshole like you that the plan you whine at me until i cave jasons chuckled his satellite phone chirped it was an iridium model and customized the signal was scrambled both through a camouflage system and a multiline shifting program impervious to any snooping probably even to the governments infamous echelon because of the dualmode scrambling he swallowed the burger he was fastidiously chewing yes the voice said your meeting seemed to go well mankewitz didnt identify himself the key word about echelon was probably good thereve already been certain overtures of cooperation so morgan had read the note and decided to be smart jasons wondered if the information he was going to deliver to mankewitz would be helpful there was always the chance it wouldnt and the risk had been wasted but isnt that the truth about life the union boss said on that other matter your personal trip now yes ive heard from a relative hed mean the round fuzzyhaired detective in the milwaukee pdwhom jasons thought was cute the cop was more than on the take he was basically on the payroll and it seems theres going to be a party up there this was troubling really did he know whod be attending no close relatives mostly local but i think some folks from the east coast might be theyre debating coming meaning no milwaukee police just local officers probably county though the fbithe east coast familywas a possibility that was very troubling so it could be pretty crowded could be anything more about what theyll be celebrating nope jasons wondered what the hell was going on up there still think i should go he said think but the real verb was want sure have some fun youve had a busy day a partyll do you good meaning hell yes get your ass up there and fix whatevers broken whatever it takes without hesitating jasons said i think ill go then like to see who shows up besides im not that far away have fun mankewitz said the weight of the world on his shoulders they disconnected jasons sipped the soda then ate some of the green apple it was sour they gave you a yogurt dip with it but he didnt like the flavor he was reflecting on mankewitzs deferential tone the man always sounded like he didnt know what planet jasons came from was almost afraid of him stan mankewitz one of the most powerful men on the lakefront from minnesota to michigan and yet he was uncomfortable around the slim young man who weighed probably half what the union boss did and who walked around with a pleasant smile most of the time some of this might have been because jasons although he did have a law degree from yale and an office in the unions legal department didnt technically work for mankewitz a labor relations specialist he was an independent contractor powerful in his own right he had his autonomous fiefdomwith the authority and budget to hire whomever he wanted jasons could also use money in ways that were beneficial to the union and mankewitz but that avoided various inconvenient reporting regulations then there was a lifestyle difference too mankewitz was not a stupid man nobody was going to do what jasons did without his complete dossierverbal at leastbeing delivered to the union boss hed know that jasons lived alone in a nice detached house near the lakefront that his mother lived in a nice apartment connected to her sons house that his boyfriend of several years robert lived in an amazing townhouse near the lakefront and he probably knew that robert a successful engineer and one hunky bodybuilder shared jasonss interest in hockey wine and music and that the partners had planned a civil union next year with a honeymoon in mexico but jasons appreciated that mankewitz did his homework because it was exactly how he himself worked his magic alicia especially every day after school in that rehearsal room three to fourthirty impressive mankewitz didnt care about jasonss lifestyle of course which was ironic considering that the membership of local was made up of bluecollar folk men mostly some of whom would beat the crap out of james jasons and robert given no excuse some opportunity and a few too many beers welcome to the new millennium a last bite of apple sweetened by the diet soda he put the second hamburger back in the bag which he twisted closed he passed a sign that announced it was fortynine miles to clausen which he knew was about eight miles before the turnoff for lake mondac since he hadnt seen any traffic let alone a patrol car on the road for miles he edged the speed up to seventyfive and clicked the selector to the christian cd just for the fun of it holding the heavy savage rifle henry headed down the path toward where rudy had directed him he took a foil pack out of his pocket a pipe and lighter too then he hesitated and put them away he blew into his hands and continued along the path scratching at the scars on his arm he stopped where the small path met the bigger one the one that led down to the lake they got their water from he stood there for five minutes squinting looking from right to left didnt see a soul he leaned the rifle against a tree as he was reaching into his pocket again for the pack of meth and the lighter a man stepped out of the shadows and hit him in the forehead with the butt of a shotgun which was rubber padded but still hard enough to knock henry off his feet his head lolled back eyes unfocused a gurgling rose from his throat and his hands flailed and his knees jerked when the butt of the deer rifle which wasnt padded crushed his windpipe henry stopped thrashing quite so violently after a minute he stopped moving altogether cradling the deer rifle in his arm hart tensed as someone approached but it was just lewis who glanced at the body on the ground grunted and picked up the shotgun hart bent down and felt the skinny mans neck with the backs of his fingers dead you know they can lift prints from skin no i didnt they can yep hart pulled his gloves back on whats the story lewis said that girl deputy brynns in the van i saw some guy put her there looked like she was taped her hands behind her i mean so they walked right into the helpful arms of meth cookers hart gave a faint laugh everybodys having a reversal of fortune tonight we end up with a cop coming to visit in lake mondac and they end up with a trailer full of slammers was she alone in the van i didnt see anybody else i wasnt that close so wheres michelle no idea hart pressed the catch on the bolt of the deer rifle slipped it out of the gun flung it away threw the gun itself in the opposite direction he was a much better shot with a pistol than a rifle besides a bolt action let you fire off a round only every few seconds in that time he could have emptied the glocks fifteenround clip and been halfway through reloading they eased silently toward the camper how many people inside hart whispered couldnt see too good definitely one other manand the guy who put brynn in the van a woman too hart was looking over lewis carefully the man was staring at the camper and kneading the shotgun stock his eyes were troubled comp yeah he looked up weve gotta do it sure i know what youre thinkingthey havent exactly done us harm but theyre tweakers comp they cook meth theyll be dead anyway in a year odd or burned to death or clipped by somebodys upset theyre peeing on his turf thisll be faster thisll be better for them well get brynn find michelle finish with them and thats it lewis was looking at the van how we handle its this theyre pros and that means theyre going to have guns now we bought some time when i talked to brynns husband but thats not to say he believed me or that they arent going to send a car around to the park just for what the hell i think we have to assume therere cops at the house already and on a quiet night like this soundll carry they could hear the gunshots weve got to finish it up fast once the shooting starts real fast sure you have that lighter of yours always carry one in case i meet a lady in a bar needs a light the crack in his voice belied the joke courteous of you nonsmoker that you are hart smiled and lewis exhaled a brief laugh okay you go around to the right side of the camper the one without the doors get some dirty leaves and see if you can find something plastic or rubber start a fire under the camper just small we dont want it to spread and call attention to us i just want smoke with all that ammonia and propane in there theyll freak and get the hell out head for the van when they come outokay he nodded ill take the front door you take the back you locked and loaded yes i am hart checked his glock and made sure one of the full clips was upside down in his waistband to the right so he could grab it easily in his left hand to reload keep your sig handy too lewis fished his chromeplated pistol out of his jacket pocket and slipped the automatic into his waistband hart noticed that the suggestion was greeted with none of the sarcasm or resistance of earlier lewis gave an uneasy laugh well arent we a couple of gunslingers move in slow move in quiet get the fire going then come back around let em all get out before you start shooting last thing we want is to have to go in and get anybody you counted three right yeah but now i think about it the woman turned her head and said something she wasnt looking at the two men maybe theres somebody else okay well plan on four the rope gandy had used to hook her to the tiedown in the back of the fourteenfoot van was thick and made of nylonstrong but slippery brynn finally managed to untie it the tape on her hands behind her wouldnt yield but she managed to climb to her feet the buttons in the back doors were flush and she couldnt lift them she stumbled to the front of the van tripped over the transmission shifter and hit her head on the dash she lay stunned for a moment then managed to right herself and turning her back to the glove box got it open empty except for papers she collapsed into the front seat of the van catching her breath her stomach muscles were in agony from the navigation to the front and from the smack of the club gandys wife had used on her brynn tried for the unlock button on the armrest but it was just out of reach of her bound hands she surveyed the rest of the van the junk the boxes the shopping bags no knives or tools no phones she sat back in the seat despairing eyes closing then behind her a woman screamed michelle she whispered had she returned had they found her at the lake and dragged her back here brynn spun around but there were only two windows in the van aside from those in the front in the rear doors they were opaque with dirt brynn looked in the sideview mirror smoke filled the night was the camper burning meth labs were notorious for incinerating the cookers the little girl was inside she thought panicked the voice called again no no please the womans voice wasnt michelles it was amys mothers then the crack of pistol fire the boom of a shotgun four or five more rounds a pause for reloading maybe more shots silence then a voice highpitched in fear or desperation a man or woman or childbrynn couldnt tell another shot more silence please let her be all right pleasepicturing the tiny girls face motion flickered in the sideview mirror a figure carrying a pistol was walking around the camper studying it carefully and the bushes nearby he then turned toward the van brynn sat in she looked around for anything that would free her hands she slipped them around the gearshift lever between the seats and began to saw the gesture was futile she glanced outside the figure was now looking directly at the van sheriff tom dahl stood over the two bodies in the kitchen a businesswoman in her thirties looking like shed kicked off her shoes after work happily anticipating a weekend of relaxation the other corpse was a solid man about her age with a mop of postcollege hair he was the sort of guy youd have a beer with at the corner place in humboldt the blood made huge stains on the floor although dahl had the edge most law enforcers develop from the job this particular crime shook him the majority of deaths in kennesha county were accidental and occurred outside homeless people frozen car accident victims workers betrayed by their equipment and sportsmen by the forces of nature seeing these poor young folks inside their own home ganglandkilled like this was hard he was staring at their pale hands those of the typical dead around here were ruddy and calloused and on top of it all his own deputyhis secret favorite in the department the daughter he would have liked to havewas missing from a house tattooed with smallarms fire he exhaled slowly footsteps came downstairs the friend dahl asked eric munce the man hed chosen not to send here picking instead kristen brynn mckenzie and the man whose future presence in the department would be a constant reminder of that decision however things turned out no sign of her one relief hed been sure that they were going to find her body upstairs in the bedroom murdered and maybe not right away munce said they might have her with them or shes with brynn hiding somewhere lets pray for that dahl thought and he did though very briefly a call came in for him the fbi special agent brindle explained was sending several agentsnow that emma feldman a witness in the case against mankewitz was dead a state police commander was headed here too and wouldnt like the feebieshe tended to squeeze hard in pissing contestsbut dahl was all for the more the merrier no criminals ever escaped because too many talented cops were on his trail well most of the time a crime scene unit from the state police was en route as well so dahl ordered his boys to leave the evidence for collection but to look everywhere they needed in order to figure out what had happened and where brynn and the feldmans friend might be it didnt take long to find significant pieces of the puzzle gunshots through windows gunshots inside gunshots outside footprints that suggested two males were probably the perps brynns sheriff department uniform shoes were inside and the friend had abandoned her chic city boots beside the feldmans mercedesboth in favor of practical hiking footgear one was injured she was using a cane or crutch and appeared to be dragging one foot the mercedes sat in front of the garage with gunshots in two tires window smashed and hood up a battery cable dangling another car had burned rubberwell scattered gravelas it fled another had limped out dragging a flat but the jigsaw pieces didnt give any sense of the big picture now standing in front of the fragrant fireplace in the living room dahl summarized to himself a mess we got a mess on our hands and where the hell is brynn eric id rather it wasnt him you know how he gets dahl noticed something in the woodwork anybody trying to play csi he asked sourly eyes on munce the deputy looked where he was pointing it seemed like someone had dug a bullet out of the molding not me why would somebody take the trouble to dig out one but not the other bullets why because it had his dna on it most likely and that meant he was wounded it also meant that he was a pro most crimes in kennesha county involved people who didnt even know what dna was much less worried about leaving any a hit man okay think the two men had been hired to kill emma feldman theyd done thatand killed her husband too then maybe theyd been surprised by the friend whod driven up with them maybe shed been out for a walk or upstairs in the shower when the killers arrived or maybe it was brynn whod surprised them somebody brynn probably had shot one of the men wounding him hed dug the dnacoated bullet out of the wall but what had happened next had they ditched their car somewhere and taken brynns were the friend and brynn with them captives had the women put on those hiking boots to run off into the woods were they dead he called deputy howie prescott on his radio the big man was near the lake in the yard between and lake view where theyd found some footprints he was looking for any sign of a trail anybodyd left prescott was the best hunter in the office though how the pound man snuck up on his prey was a mystery to them all anything howie no sir but its dark as night here dark as night dahl thought it is goddamn night keep looking dahl said to eric munce who was rubbing the grip of his pistol the way a child plays with its sippy cup i want to get some bodies dahl hesitated at the inappropriate word i want to get some searchers up here fast as many as we can but armed only no volunteers munce hurried to his squad car to call in a search party dahl stepped outside and gazed toward the lake the moon was low withholding most of its illumination from the surface dahls radio crackled thiss pete go ahead im in the driveway of number one havent checked it out yet but wanted to tell you he was breathless theres a truck just passed me white pickup headed your way a truck whos inside couldnt see okay check out the house i want to know what you find will do got company the sheriff said to munce then called prescott and told him to keep an eye out for the vehicle they saw it approach slowly and turn up the drive both dahls and munces hands were near their weapons but it turned out not to be a threat though it was certainly a complication graham boyd climbed out of the cab leaving his passengers three fuzzy bushes in the back and walked straight up to dahl shes not here graham we dont know where she is let me see the big man said in an unsteady voice heading for the house no i cant let you in theres some bodies peopleve been killed shot its a crime scene where is she grahams voice was ragged the sheriff put his arm around the mans solid shoulders and led him away brynn and those folks friend got away we think they did where we dont know anything for sure were getting a search team up here now jesus christ look let us do our job here i know its hard but im going to ask you to help us out and go on home please the radio crackled once more sheriff its howie i was looking around the shore and found something go ahead a car off the road went into the lake looks like looks like he snapped or did a pause yeah it did where can you see the flashlight im signaling two or three hundred yards away a small yellow dot waved through the darkness graham shouted whats the debris what color a hesitation dahl repeated the question prescott said theres a bumper here its dark red oh shit graham said and started running goddamn dahl spat out he and munce climbed into the sheriffs car munce driving they stopped and graham climbed in the back then they sped to the shore skid marks airbag dust scrapes on the rocks and auto detritushunks of red plastic from lights bits of glassand an oil slick near the shore left no doubt the car had sailed off the road hit a rocky ledge then tumbled into the water jesus graham muttered what did this do to the scenario who was in the car or who is in the car still doesnt mean its hers for sure graham or that she was even in it brynn her husband shouted the voice echoed across the lake graham scrabbled down the rocks no dahl said we dont know where the shooters are then to munce call back the state police we need a diver and a truck with a winch tell em lake mondac western shore they can check the depth graham thats a crime scene too we cant have you fucking it up graham scooped something out of the water and dropped to his knees his head was down dahl was about to shout at him again but held back i get him up here munce asked no let him be dahl made his way to the waters edge moving carefully down the rocks his game leg in agony graham stood slowly and handed the sheriff a hagstrom map of the county on the soggy cover was written in marker dep k b mckenzie for a moment dahl thought graham was going to dive in after her he was tensing to restrain him but the big man did nothing his shoulders were slumped and he stared out over the black water a hiss and a crackle sheriff pete im at number one lake view nobodys home and its sealed up but theres a car abandoned behind the house abandoned i mean recent i called it in stolen in milwaukee a few days ago according to the vin the plates match the same year and model but not this id number and therere two bullet holes in the side and a rear tires shot out so thats the car that rimmed its way out of the feldmans drive he thought of graham and wished with all his heart the man was elsewhere but he couldnt waste any time pop the trunk tell me whats inside i did sheriff empty thank you lord and nobody broke into the house no ive been around it they mightve picked the lock and locked back up forget it get to the closer house number two yessir you get over there too dahl said to prescott the big deputy nodded and he started up the dirt road a lengthy silence graham rubbed his eyes then peered into the lake dont imagine its that deep she couldve got out im sure of it you dont believe that do you you think shes dead well she isnt im not saying that at all graham shes real tough one of the toughest you have to search the area we will i mean now get state troopers here theyre on their way ive already called the fbi theyll get involved for something like this wont they yep theyll be here too graham turned and looked at lake view gibbss squad car was pulling up now dahl had a lot on his mind but not so much that he couldnt offer a silent prayer that his deputy and the houseguest werent in that house dead as the feldmans go on home be with joey hell need you now then an excited clatter through the tinny speaker got something here sheriff pete gibbs radioed go ahead been broken into and i think i see bullet holes in some windows upstairs stay put till eric gets there he nodded at the young hotshot of a deputy who took off at an earnest run looks empty to me gibbs said hold your position yessir when eric gets there move in but assume theyre inside and we know theyre armed graham was examining the shore his back to dahl who was staring at the house the minutes passed slow as could be and dahl found himself holding his breath waiting for a gunshot finally the radio crackled teasingly no transmission dahl didnt want to call back and have their radios squawk giving away their position nothing damnation finally eric munce called in house is cleared tom they were here been a firefight but no bodies but weve got something weird weird eric i cant use weird just tell me upstairs bedroom theres ammonia all over the bathroom floor stinks like a babys diaper bin ammonia and we found brynns uniform all her clothes graham tensed they were soaking wet and full of mud and the closet and dresser were open i think she changed clothes and then took off dahl glanced at graham who closed his eyes in relief sheriff its howie im outside i see two sets of footprints womens id guess theyre smaller running to the woods behind the house they go to a stream heading back to the feldmans then i lose them roger that dahl put his arm around grahams massive shoulders walked the man back to his squad car listen we know your wife got outa the car okay if anybody knows how to stay alive its her i mean i know that for a fact graham i signed the payment request for her to go to all those training courses she takes hell she takes so many of em they call her the schoolmarm behind her back only dont tell her i said that come on ill drive you back to get your truck you and me were too old to be out jogging the vans automatic lock clicked brynn turned toward the passenger door as it opened hart stood there his gun forward scanning carefully for threats he saw her hands were taped and that the van was otherwise unoccupied he climbed in the door slammed behind him he put his gun away and began searching through the mounds of junk on the floor and directly behind the front seats brynn said the girl back there in the camper the little girl no shes all right the fire diversion the camper wasnt burning brynn looked the smoke had cleared he was telling the truth hart found some bleach opened it and drenched his gloves and the keys which were bloody then poured more in a tear in his leather jacketthe bullet hole from michelles shot it seemed he exhaled slowly from the pain the chlorine stench rose and stung her eyes his too they both blinked druggiescant be too safe nowadays it was like he was apologizing for the fumes hart looked her over focusing on her vastly swollen cheek he frowned are you telling me the truth is she alive her eyes bored into his he gazed back the girl yes i told you the mother if she was the mother shes not the others arent either youre interested they left the kid in the camper when they thought it was burning and ran outside maybe they just meant to fight or maybe they just meant to leave her to burn brynn looked him over a solid face gray eyes long hair dark and dry skin rough shed had a bout of acne as a girl it had tormented her but the condition had cleared up as soon as she hit college he wasnt handsome not really but he had confidence in spades an attraction all its own brynn he mused howd he know her name had gandy told him before he died no the men had been in the second house along lake view drive the bedroom he would have seen the name badge on her blouse hart he nodded with an exasperated smile my friend was talking a bit much giving that away whats his name again the smile lingered brynn said tell me where the girl is in her room in the camper hart continued shes in bed with some doll named chester i found it for her or a rabbit i dont know you left her there brynn asked angrily she could look outside and see her mothers body no my friends moving them all into the woods i told the girl to stay put come morning this parkll have more cops per square foot than the police academy theyll find her shes dead isnt she you killed her too his face tightened he was upset that she doubted him no i didnt kill her shes in bed with chester i told you brynn decided that she believed him so what happened he asked you met that fellow in the woods and he was going to let you use his phone here and you walked into a meth lab i figured it out before but not before enough smelled it right the ammonia yep and the chlorine too and burning propane thats how i found it hart said i was down by that lake and could smell it down there wind mustve shifted she said i didnt smell it till we were almost here hart stretched phew quite a night bet you dont see many of em like this inwhats this county again kennesha he looked again at the wound on her face hed be noting how infected it was how painful she supposed hed be considering how long she could hold out before she told him where michelle was forever wondering if that was true and as if he were reading her thoughts where is your friend michelle he said evenly i dont know recalling that theyd found her purse they knew who she was and where she lived hart moved in the seat slightly and grimaced apparently at the pain in his shot arm whats that namebrynn norwegian he nodded as he took this in well about michelle youre lying to me you do know where she is he actually seemed offended or hurt after a moment hart said i talked to somebody tonight you know on the phone talked to somebody your husband she said nothing thinking at first that he was bluffing but then remembered that theyd taken her phone graham might have called and hart might have answered i pretended i was another trooper i told him youd been delayed he bought it i could tell theres nobody coming to save you and before you get your hopes up i took the battery out cant be traced now where is she michelle they held each others eyes she was surprised at how easy it was you killed her friends why would i tell you where she is so you can kill her too so he said nodding michelle was a friend of the family is that how she got mixed up in this whole thing a laugh wrong time and wrong place you might say a lot of that going around tonight we need to talk about making arrangements here ill bet thiss a first for you has been for me what the game weve been playing tonight like poker bluffing you fool me i fool you poker my friend was telling me about this character his mama or grandma i forget was talking about the trickster some mythology thing a fairy tale he causes all kind of grief thats what ive been calling you all night brynn trickster she reflected hart continued that tv in the house at number two lake viewfinding a channel with women talking that was smart and the ammonia above the door but now i think about it you didnt rig it to fall did you youd worry about rescue workers or your cop friends getting blinded funnyknowing you didnt come up with a cowardly trapmakes me feel better about you brynn mckenzie repressed a smile and didnt give him the satisfaction of a response then the canoe and the blood on the ledge and you in the threewheeled car she replied didnt fool you though did it i can say the same after all here you are you found me he looked her over the blood at the ledge you cut yourself extra for that didnt bring any ketchup with me she tilted her head so he could see the coagulated blood in her hair then she added the flashlight tricked me on the ledge whatd you do make a rope out of a tshirt yep my friends got to see more of his tattooed body than i wanted i used a branch too so itd hang out a ways and dangle in the wind but howd you find us blackberry she shook her head smiling ruefully he has satellite i have a homemade toy compassthough one worked as good as the other brynn thought the sheriffs department wont pay for those i figured youd make for that trail the joliet and north from there and go to the interstate or point of rocks id decided on the interstate the climbd be a bitch but its closer and by the time we got to the highway thered be plenty of trucks on the road how come you didnt get lost good sense of direction she looked him over closely why are you doing this hart she asked its hopeless ah brynn were both too smart for hostage negotiation oneohone she continued nonetheless less than two percent of perps get away with murderand thosere usually drug clips where nobody cares about the victim or therere so many suspects its not even worth investigating but tonightthey wont stop until they get you youre not stupid hart again he seemed hurt that was condescending and what youre tryings cheap ive been treating you with respect he was right he stretched and massaged his shot arm the bullet hole was near the edge of the jacket it had apparently missed bone and vital vessel he mused crazy line of work were in dont you think brynn were not in the same line of work she couldnt help but scoff sure we are take tonight we came up here to do jobs wed agreed to do and now weve still got the same goals to stop each other and get out of this damn forest alive who writes your paycheck and who writes mine thats just a technicality doesnt matter much why were here the important thing is that we are she had to laugh but he continued as if shed conceded his point and looked into her eyes as he said animated but dont you think its what makes everything worthwhile even whats gone down tonight all this crap i do i wouldnt trade the life i lead for anything look at most of the rest of the worldthe walking dead theyre nothing but dead bodies brynn sitting around upset angry about something they saw on tv doesnt mean a single thing to them personally going to their jobs coming home talking stuff they dont know or care aboutgod doesnt the boredom just kill them it would me i need more brynn dont you he massaged his neck with his uninjured arm tell me where she is please its going to get bad i tell you and you let me live a pause then no i cant hardly do that but i have your phone number i know you have a husband and you might have children probably do if you tell me theyll be fine whats your full name he shook his head giving her a frown well okay hart first or last name listen youre under arrest she recited the miranda warning start to finish she never used those laminated cards that bail bondsmen handed out shed memorized the language years ago youre arresting me do you understand your rights amused he said i know you know where she is you had a meeting point somewhere didnt you i know that because thats what i would have done breaking the silence that followed he continued lifes funny isnt it everything seems perfect the plan the background the research the details you even nail that fishy human factor clear road easy escape youve distracted everybody who needs distracting and then something small happens too many red lights tire goes flat an accident ties up traffic and the psycho security guard who just got a new fortyfour desert eagle hes itching to use comes to work ten minutes early because he woke up before the alarm because a dog started barking two blocks away because a squirrel his voice faded he tented his gloved fingers wincing slightly when he moved his left arm and all your plans go up in smoke the plans that couldnt go wrong go wrong thats what happened to us tonight brynn you and me both undo my hands give me your weapon you really think youre going to arrest me just like that you werent paying attention i already did he stretched again not as young as i used to be he massaged his left arm how long have you been married she didnt answer but glanced involuntarily at his gloved hand marriage doesnt suit me does it suit you brynncome on whats michelle to you my job thats what she is how important can a job be brynn wrinkling her brow cynicallyand with pain you know the answer to that he began to speak then stopped tilted his head in concession you mightve talked to my husband but you dont know him hellve put things in motion by now hes not falling asleep after the ten oclock news again disappointment in his face thats a lie brynn she inhaled slowly maybe it is she found herself saying so okay no more lies hart graham mightve gone to sleep but hell wake up about four am for the bathroom which he does like clockwork and when im not there hell call my boss and his first callll be to mobilize the state police you have some time but not a lot and not nearly enough for you to get me to tell you where she is and thats not a lie okay what we could do is his voice faded brynn laughed you were going to lie to me werent you yeah i was he grinned going to give me some hope right yep but it felt wrong he reached into his pocket and pulled out a map opened it and spread it between them he located the faint road where they were flicked on the overhead light where is she brynn she noted the tiny blue dot that was the lake where michelle waited she said im not telling you he shook his head well i wont hurt you thats not dignified and your familys safe i know that he drew his gun glanced at it butyou understand hes reluctant to shoot she thought surprised but shoot he would in a curious way though she felt that shed won this part of the game and she felt too with a deep pang that shed also lost not because of her death but for a dozen reasons that hovered far outside this van this forest this park the silence was awkward like that surrounding a couple near the end of their first date hart this is your last chance he laughed call nineoneone i meant what i said ill ask the da to be lenient no more lies between us hart i mean it his head was down he was caressing the black gun absently you going to surrender she persisted you know i cant they exchanged rueful smiles then a faint frown crossed harts face as he glanced out the window what the van was moving easing downhill and picking up speed in the moments just before hed climbed inside shed shifted the transmission into neutral with her bound hands disengaged the emergency foot brake and then sat back as theyd been talking shed kept her foot on the main brake pedal finally when it was clear she couldnt talk him into giving up shed lifted her foot the van pointed downhill surged forward it now bounded over a railroad tie parking barrier in the lot and began careening down the steep hillside filled with brush and saplings christ hart muttered he grabbed for the wheel and transmission lever but brynn slammed herself sideways colliding with his bad arm he shouted in pain the vehicle sped up crashing into rocks which made it veer to the left then going a good twenty miles an hour rolled on its side the passenger window exploding inward as brynn pitched hard into harts chest the van began to tumble madly down the endless hillside by the time tom dahl drove graham boyd back to the feldmans house two state police cars lights flashing were bounding up rough lake view drive they made the turn fast churning up dust and hurried along the driveway the six troopers climbed out graham shook dahls hand solemnly and wandered off to his truck pulling his phone from his pocket dahl joined the wsps night watch commander arlen tanner a big man with a mustache he and the sheriff had worked together for years dahl briefed him and the other men tanner said crime scenell be here in a half hour so its a search and rescue thats right arlen weve got teams from humboldt and a half dozen troopers from gardener coming barlow countyll send some too woke up our two divers theyre on the way im not sure well need em its likely our officer got out of the car and hooked up with a friend of the victims theyre in the woods around here someplace but were pretty sure the two shootersre after them dahl had a phone call the area code told him it was coming in from the kenosha area he frowned take it or not hell better sheriff dahl here a somber voice on the other end of the line said sheriff thiss andrew sheridan he said this as if dahl ought to know uncertainly the sheriff said yessir i worked with emma feldman i just heard oh that was it after discovering the bodies dahl had called the law firm assistant and gotten the name of several partners emma feldman regularly worked with hed taken a deep breath and delivered the news word would travel fast of course in those circles im sorry sir sorry for your loss thank you they talked for a moment or two dahl giving away what he could which wasnt much sheridan finally got down to business sheriff this is a hard time for everybody but i have to ask you something about emmas files she had some with her didnt she yessir she did are you going to want them for evidence yes theyll have to be processed it looks like somebody went through them what who dahl lifted eyebrows apologetically to arlen tanner just be a minute he whispered then into the phone we arent sure sir so we cant have them back not yet no do you know when we can i cant say at this time then can i ask that you secure them somehow as evidence theyll be locked up sir a hesitation its nothing critical but we worry about trade secrets and issues like that you understand no he didnt but he said well make sure theyll be safe well thank you sheriff if theres anything i can do anything at all just let me know yep let me do my job they disconnected dahl was irritated but couldnt really blame the man the practicality of his call didnt mean he wasnt mourning like dahl sheridan had a job to do the sheriffs radio crackled again then he heard more companys coming sheriff rescue team tow truck no private car get the tag wisconsin all i saw okay the sedan slowed and turned toward lake view the house lit up like the titanic in her last hours dahl decided having just seen the movie with his wife he waved the car to a stop with his flashlight and asked the driver to get out the businessman in his midthirties or so stared at the tableau his face etched with concern he climbed out whats wrong whats going on tanner deferred to dahl who said could i see some id sir whats your name ari paskell he offered his drivers license to the state police commander who handed it to one of his troopers to check out please whats going on whats your business here business i was coming to spend the weekend with emma and steve whats going on ive been calling them all night and cant get through how do you know them steve and i are friends we used to work together he invited me to spend the weekend are they all right dahl glanced at graham who was staring into the woods how i hate this the sheriff thought he then noticed the trooper in the front seat of his squad car he nodded meaning that the mans license and tag checked out dahl lowered his voice im very sorry to have to tell you this sir but theres been a crime the feldmans were well they were the victims of a homicide tonight my god no but no you cant be right i just talked to steve this afternoon im afraid theres no doubt no he gasped butno youre wrong his face went even paler than it had been dahl wondered if he was going to slip into hysteria it happened pretty frequently at times like this even with the toughest folks which this fellow didnt seem to be im sorry but it cant be the mans eyes were wide hands shaking i brought them their favorite beer and i got fresh bratwurst i mean the kind we always have his voice cracked i got them a few hours ago i stopped in he lowered his head in a defeated voice he said are you sure about this im sorry sir paskell leaned against his car saying nothing just staring at the house hed be reliving memories pleasant ones of events that thered be no repeat of munce joined them what happened paskell whispered who did it we dont know now mr paskell but theyre not rich whod rob them mr paskell do you know who the other houseguest is all we know is shes a woman from chicago used to work with emma he shook his head no they said somebody elsed be visiting i dont know who i think you should head back home sir or get a motel if youre too tired or upset to drive therere some past clausen on six eightytwo theres nothing you can do here now he didnt seem to hear he was frowning dahl paid a bit more attention and like he always did with witnesses gave him time to play the thought to the surface this is probably crazy he cocked his head just a thought usually civilians suggestions were crazy but sometimes they led to the killers front door dahl said go on steven was talking to me this was last fall yessir and he said hed had a runin with a man up here at one of the stores a big guy a local steve said some stupid thing about nearly bumping cars in the lot the guy went crazy followed him home threatened him he give you any details no just he lived around here and he was pretty big three hundred pounds munce looked at dahl shaking his head doesnt seem like the perp it was two of them and nobody was that big to judge from the footprints did he give you a name or description no it was just one of those stories this scary thing happened to me you know but he was shook up no question i mean the man came right to the house if there were more than one maybe the big man brought his friends and theywell they hurt steve and emma while he waited in the car if dahl had a dollar for every conflict in a parking lot that could have turned violent but didnt hed be rich he asked could you give me your number mr paskell we may want to ask you a few questions paskell was looking at the car where the groceries bought specially for his friends sat soon to be discarded would he throw them out in anger or despair despite his benign appearance the man was dahl figured a rager mr paskell he still wasnt listening then the sheriff asked again and the friend blinked my number yeah sure he recited it for dahl brawny tanner stroked his mustache and looked at the sheriff his expression saying it never gets any easier does it are you all right to drive dahl asked a few minutes he was gazing at the house just a few minutes sure you take your time the businessman his face a mask pulled out his phone he rubbed it between thumb and finger delaying making calls to friends dahl left him to the agonizing task prescott and gibbs were putting up crime scene tape munce reported that the three deputies had gotten a ways into the woods and had lost all trace of the womens trail whatta you think about that big local tanner asked dahl doesnt set off fireworks for me but well keep it in mind get me a map anybody got a map and spotlights maps yes spots no so they walked up the steps to the front porch whose overhead light was blazing and attracting the first few bugs of the season one deputy produced the large map of the area and set it on a wooden café table on the porch moved the chairs back the houses here werent depicted but lake view drive was a narrow yellow line lake mondac was on one side and on the other was a vast mass of green marquette state park elevations and trails were shown ranger stations parking lots and a few of the scenic highlights natural bridge devils deep the snake river gorge tens of thousands of acres dahl looked at his battered timex give them five six hours since the murder how far could brynn and the girl get in that brush at night not very his leg hurt like the dickens prescott ambled up found something by the garage sheriff the troopers eyed the deputys bulk he nodded at them as confident as any twentysevenyearold could be whats that found a tarp the sort youd cover a canoe with and drag marks leading to that stream it runs into the lake footprints couldnt tell its grass and gravel but the skids could be fresh and i looked in the garage theres only one life vest no paddles ill bet they took the boat dahl looked over the map no streams or rivers flowing out of the lake they could get as far as the opposite shore but then theyd have to hoof it they have the boots for it munce pointed out swapping footgear dahl noticed that graham still hadnt left yet but was hanging back eyes on the dark woods graham you help us out here he joined them and accepted various measures of sympathy from the other law enforcers after introductions were made and they learned it was his wife who was missing dahl explained about the canoe graham shook his head i dont think it was brynn who took it why not she hated boats hated water well commander arlen tanner pointed out was a pretty extreme situation she mightve made an exception only if there was no other way to go dahl asked did brynn know the state park good some and i saw her in the car before she left looking over her map she always does that prepares you know she and her ex came here a few times she and ive never been munce said brynn and me were on a search and recovery here a while ago he was frowning and tense as if there was something hed been meaning to bring up gotta say tom dont know why you didnt have me come up here i wasnt but twenty minutes away thought you were busy on that grand theft case no no didnt you hear that was a mistake i wouldve come dahl continued to examine the map we know she got dry clothes and she hooked up with that friend of the feldmans they came back to the house here got boots and then took off but which way tanner liked the canoe idea despite what grahamd said couldve paddled across the lake and are hiding there or if they didnt take the boat they could be up there he gestured at the steep hill behind the house it was covered with vegetation another trooper shrugged id vote for six eightytwo theyd plan on flagging down a car or truck or getting to one of the houses along there itd take em a few hours but they could do it dahl felt the same graham was shaking his head what dahl asked i dont think shed go that way tom not if those men were still around the highways the closest to safety for them dahl said he was inclined to believe the men were in the area here and moving slowly toward the highway brynn wouldnt lead them to anybodys house not out here she wouldnt endanger anybody innocent shed keep running and she wouldnt hide either why not tanner asked because she wouldnt i dont know graham dahl said okay she might not go to a house but she could flag down a car and how many did you see on the road when you drove up i saw a hundred deer and one chevrolet she knows how deserted it is round here well whatta you think she did graham munce asked headed into the park itself straight into the middle but shed know none of the ranger stationsre open this time of year but they have phones dont they theyre not working if theyre closed for the season well pay phones maybe i dont know tapping the map im not even sure shed go for a ranger station i think maybe shed make for the interstate his finger tapped the snake river gorge bridge arlen tanner was looking over the map all respect mr boyd thats a lotta ground to cover howd they find their way weve had people lost in this place for nearly a week its thousands and thousands of acres and its pretty rough a lot of it caves dropoffs swamps thats exactly what shed want graham countered the harder the better if those men are after them put her more in control one of the troopers looking like a big buff soldier offered thats what seven eight miles from here its mostly offtrail and the gorge is one of the most dangerous places in the park all respect tanner announced the odds are theyre going to be hiding around here somewhere or hiking back to the highway thats the logical approach dahl said i agree with arlen graham i know her too but nobodyd strike out in that direction shed never find her way even with gps and a map and in daylight i think for now weve got to concentrate around here and six eightytwo at least send a few people into the park at the snake river gorge tom graham insisted we just dont have the manpower graham i cant send volunteers not with those men out there has to be armed troopers or deputies now go on home graham joeys going to be worried hes got to know youre there for him im talking as a father now not a cop i promise your numbers the first one i call we find anything eric munce walked graham back to his truck dahl stood on the porch and looked out over the chaos of the front yard the lights the law enforcers the police cars an ambulance useful only as a taxi ride for two dead bodies the victims friend paskell had joined graham and munce they shook hands and seemed to be sharing mutual sympathy as he turned back to the map to organize the search parties dahl thought a short prayer that ended with and bring brynn home to us if you please steam or smoke or both rose from the van but even if it was burning it wouldnt blow up they never did brynn mckenzie lay on her back breathing hard locating pain and thinking in the movies every car that crashes blows up in real life they never do shed run probably a hundred highway accidents including four fires that wholly immolated the vehicles the cars or trucks burned furiously but none of them had ever actually exploded which hadnt stopped her escaping as fast as she could through the gap where the windshield had beenmoving like a caterpillar with her hands taped scrunching along painfully over glass and rocksand putting as much distance between herself and the shattered van as possible shed paused only to turn her back to harts map and grab it then crumple it into a ball she was now about twenty feet from the vehicle which lay on its side at the foot of the steep hill theyd tumbled down sidewaysthat orientation had probably saved her life had they kept going forward over the drop the airbags would have come and gone with first impact and the final drop would have fired them out through the windshield and underneath the tumbling vehicle as it was hart ironically might have saved her life she recalled how hed broken her fall as shed slammed into him smelling of aftershave smoke and bleach she was hurting in various places but she tested the important appendages they all seemed to work it was odd not having the use of her hands still taped behind her to evaluate injuries the wound in her cheek and the gum where the tooth had been still won the pain award the throbbing had claimed everything north of her shoulders where was hart she couldnt see him she looked to the top of the hillit seemed very far awaywhere there was a faint light from the camper she could hear harts partner calling him hed undoubtedly heard the crash but couldnt see the van which had rolled through tall stands of brush they hadnt fallen all the way to the bottom of the ravine the van was resting on a flat area about twenty feet wide at the edge of which was another dropabout thirty feet down she estimatedto a fastmoving stream she told herself your legsre working fine get up only she couldnt not with her hands taped she couldnt find any leverage fuck a word shed said perhaps only a dozen times in her life finally she tucked her knees up and managed to roll onto them facedown and then rose staggering upright she slipped the map into the back waistband of her sweats and looked around quickly for hart and there he was hed been thrown freewhich is usually the way she described the demise of a crash victim who wasnt wearing his seat belt and had ragdolled against a tree or signpost he lay on his back on the other side of the van his eyes were closed but his leg was moving his head lolling slightly his black glock lay about fifteen feet from him she decided she could kick the weapon forward like one of joeys soccer balls until she was safely away then drop to her knees and pick it up then crawl upright again but starting for the weapon brynn had heard a whimper she spun around and saw amythe little blond girl in her dirty white tshirt and denim skirt clutching her toy she was running down the hill in a panic maybe harts partner had scared her and shed fled from the camper brynn was between her and hart who was coming to consciousness his eyes were closed but his fingers were clenching and unclenching he moaned the girl was nearly at the foot of the hill running blindly crying in ten seconds shed be over the edge of the ravine amy stop she didnt hear or if she did she paid no attention a glance back toward hart he was trying to sit up looking around though he hadnt seen her yet the gun oh how she wanted the gun but there was no choice brynn gave up on the weapon and began sprinting toward the girl she intercepted her about three feet from the cliff edge dropping to her knees painfully right in front of the child startled amy pulled up fast its okay honey remember me its all right be careful i dont want you to fall lets get back over there into those bushes wheres mommy im not sure amy but im here youll be okay i heard come on with me brynn glanced back hart was struggling to get up still hadnt seen her hart the voice came from the top of the cliff brynn saw the silhouette of harts partner amy lets go over there i dont like that cliff wheres my mommy a raw edge to her voice come on brynn hated herself for saying it but she had to ill help you find her the hysteria faded okay brynn moved fast toward the base of the cliff and led the girl into a thick stand of brush and tall grass out of sight from hart ill help you find your mother but i cant do it with my hands this way can you help me you know how you were taping those bags she nodded well i have tape on my hands rudy did that thats right it was like a joke i dont think it was a joke he does lots of things like that it hurts my hands will you take it off ill take it off okay i dont like rudy he looks at me sometimes when he thinks im asleep brynns heart thudded you dont have to worry about rudy anymore im a policewoman you are like charlies angels like that yeah amy youre older than them brynn nearly smiled amy was slowly tugging at the tape how did you know my name your father told me hes not my father charlie told me after a number of false starts amy was unwinding the tape why did rudy do that he was going to hurt me but dont say anything amy there are other people around we dont want them to hear us i saw them i think one of them hurt my mommy dont worry i wont let anybody hurt you just dont say anything now well be quiet both of us okay at last her hands were free brynn rubbed them shed scraped an elbow but the parka had protected her pretty well and there was no other damage that hadnt been there before the tumble down the hill she grabbed the precious map and put it in her jacket thank you honey now lets be quiet amy nodded crouching brynn led her back quietly toward the clearing where the van lay she peeked through the bushes hart was gone so was the gun graham boyd drove fast away from the place where two bodies lay in a fancy vacation house his wifes clothing in another and her car at the bottom of a black lake he tried to leave those images behind but he couldnt hed thought hed be seeing sandra then stopping for a fast drink at jjsso he could honestly tell brynn hed been to the poker game but man had everything changed hed never experienced a night like this one glancing up into the rearview mirror he saw the police car behind him coming up close real fast graham glanced at the speedometer he was doing eightyfive he drove a half mile farther then pulled over leaned his head against the steering wheel gripping the plastic compulsively with his strong hands a few minutes later a uniformed officer was standing beside the drivers side window graham took a deep breath and climbed out of the car he stepped up to the officer and shook eric munces hand thanks i really mean it i knew youd understand nobody else would isnt the most regular thing in the world but ill go on your word graham brynns husband zipped his jacket up he got his flashlight and a buck knife from the tool carrier in the back of the truck as he relocked the box he said im not sure im right not sure at all but everything i know about her tells me that shed head this way and the canoe if she used it it was a trick to fool those men shoved it in the lake and then took off on foot brynn hated the water shed never try to escape that way if she could help it lakes and oceans werent her environment he didnt explain to munce about his wifes control issue i sure hope youre right graham id like a piece of those bastards munce muttered eyes gleaming he had a round face narrow lightcolored eyes and short blond hair he looked more like a marine than a deputy and graham wondered if hed been in the military he asked yessir i was then confessed national guard never saw the big show though he shrugged with a stoic grin and asked but there was that ranger station on the map you saw it the one near apex lake why wouldnt she make for that might have im not saying im certain but i think brynnll take the harder route like i was saying itll equalize them the women and those men after em on a trail the men can move faster in the woods shell have the advantage and brynn wont let anybody get an edge over her woman must be hell to play cards with we dont play cards graham said absently staring at the map he then looked over the dark woods one car whizzed past the highway was otherwise empty youd be a good cop graham me he laughed grimly no sir he tapped the map heres the joliet trail shell leave the path about there he touched a spot then make for the snake river and follow it right up here to the interstate munce looked at the steep hill vanishing below them into a morass of woods thats a tough climb you ever been here to the park yeah but not here hiking when i was younger graham recalled asking joey to come with him several times in the past year the boy had always declined with a look on his face that said and id want to do that why graham had regretted that he hadnt insisted he believed he couldve made joey enjoy himself thinking shouldve listened to my instincts then what does it matter munce told him he was familiar with this area he and brynn had been involved in a searchandrecovery mission that had ended about a mile from here graham noted the word recovery as in body recovery not a successful rescue the deputy continued i remember some paths hikers and rock climbers made them therere some level areas but were going to see mostly dropoffs twenty thirty feet some of them even more youll come on them real sudden watch where you walk graham nodded he said im guessing theyll stick close enough to hear the river to guide them that means theyll be somewhere in a strip fifty a hundred yards wide from the edge of the gorge thats where we should make our way down we cant call to em loud give ourselves away well just have to stop every so often and look around us we could probably whisper the sheriff said its two men are after them right yeah what the footprints show graham looked at the deputys car the shotgun locked in the front seat i dont have a gun here eric i cant do that graham thats a loseyourjob thing ah stay close i scored second in the department shooting competition well maybe it wouldnt be a bad idea for you to have two at least munce considered this he returned to the car unlocked the shotgun pocketed a half dozen shells he locked the car door and returned to graham together they walked to the edge of the forest and peered down the slope of boulders and trees to their left the river a hundred feet down the sheer gorge walls roared as it broke over boulders and tree trunks and a small dam at the bottom of which was an eerie sinkhole where leaves and trash spiraled into a foul broth and disappeared looks like the waterway to hell thanks for this eric you going to get into trouble sheriff sent us out to search i said i was checking some roads north i just didnt say how far i was going toms a good man but i have a feeling hes wrong on this one i know my wife for a few minutes they wound or muscled their way through stands of thick brush then over a soft bed of pine needles which was a pleasure after the ornery forsythia vinca and other viney and stalky plants that seemed unnaturally attracted to their boots the hussssh of the water from the snake river grew louder time to get serious here munce bent down spat in the dirt and made mud he smeared it on his face and cheekbones graham hesitated feeling foolish then did the same okay well lets do it munce racked the shotgun put the safety on and led the way they started downward into an impossible tangle of trees and branches and rocks and shadow graham whispered eric curious was it brynn who beat you beat me in the shooting competition you said you were second oh no was dobbie masters boy come outa his mommas tummy with a pistol in his hand but i will say this brynn may not be the best shot but she empties the clip and reloads twice as fast as anybody on the force in a firefight that counts for more believe me james jasons finished his second hamburger which was cold but he wanted the calories he drove along the interstate glancing from time to time at the screen on a small box stuck to the lexus dashboard the indicator told him he was about one mile from his target which had stopped moving and had been parked by the roadside for about ten minutes jasons assessed his performance as the feldmans grieving friend ari paskell which was one of his four identities complete with car registration and drivers license when you work for somebody like stanley mankewitz the budget isnt quite unlimited but its big enough that you can afford the tools to do your job withthe union bosss favorite wordefficiency back at the feldman house as hed pretended to compose himself after hearing the sad news hed learned plenty hed made up the story about a phone call from steven to learn what the police actually suspected that there were two of them and they werent physically large thank you deputy munce hed also told the story to plant the seed that the killing was locally motivated it didnt originate in milwaukee he couldnt tell if dahl believed that or not jasons had also overheard other snippets giving him a good idea of what the police knew about the crime while pretending to make a phone callyoure invisible when youre on your mobile nobody thinks youre listening the sheriff missed that completely but jasons didnt put him down as a smalltown rube brilliant people always look for the simplest most logical explanation for a situation and jasons had offered one a grieving friend a drivers license and a legitimate tag number on a nice car it helped too that jasons had left soon after as hed been asked to before the sheriff started to wonder about this continued presence in fact he didnt need to stay because his next steps had nothing to do with how the police were handling the investigation no he had focused on the husband of that woman deputy whod fled into the woods escaping emma feldmans killers noting the conspiratorial conversation that graham boyd had had with munce jasons deduced that they were planning their own renegade search independent of the sheriffs plan dahl mightve known his staff and he mightve known logic and human nature in generalall good cops didbut he hadnt known the sort of things you learn about a person by sharing his life and spending bedroom time with him jasons just had to look at his own relationship with robert to know this was true so he put his money on the husband and munce to lead him to the deputynamed brynnand to the feldmans friend the witness to the murder the two women who were the moths drawing the men jasons was trying to keep alive tonight he recalled back at the lake mondac house graham shaking paskells hand and giving his sympathies then jasons had wished them luck with the search graham had then turned away and spoken to munce the deputy looking down as he considered the words munce then said something back and theyd both looked at their watches might as well shout their intentions over a megaphone but it turned out everybody else was concentrating on the business at hand and the exchange had gone unnoticed on the pretext of asking another officer for directions jasons had passed by the husbands pickup truck and dropped what looked like a small chip of wood inside the bed behind some potted plants the wood chip contained a gps trackeroriginally designed for hunters to use to track their dogs should they get overly enthusiastic when going after a shot bird and vanish into the distance jasons owned and had used lots of equipment from security services some of it worthy of master spies but these dog trackers which sold for about five hundred dollars were far superior to the security equipment that cost ten times as much even more if the customer was the federal government hed learned now as he approached what a sign reported was the snake river bridge the tracker was humming steadily then he saw the white pickup and a squad car parked off the road half hidden in some bushes about two hundred yards this side of the bridge jasons piloted his lexus past them so this was where they believed deputy mckenzie and the two killers were heading jasons drove over the bridge below which was an impressive moonlit gorge then as soon as the interstate was deserted he made a u over the flat grassy median and crossed the bridge again going the other way then about even with where the men had parked on the other side he nosed his car into a woody area off the shoulder and pulled to a stop he climbed out and stretched he opened the trunk and replaced his sports coat with a windbreaker and his dress shoes with boots he took out a canvas bag which he slung over his shoulder waiting for a massive peterbilt tractortrailer to pass swirling dust and grit in its wake he crossed asphalt the median and then more road and vanished into the woods at the pond an oval far smaller but no less dark and eerie than lake mondac brynn touched her finger to her lips and glanced at amy smiling the little girl nodded she was wearing brynns dark sweatshirt over her white t her legs were bare and pale but she didnt seem cold shed given up asking about her mommy and now walked dutifully beside brynn cuddling chester a stuffed creature of indeterminate species surveying the pond their rallying point brynn thought how happy shed been when shed first met charlie gandy an ally a weapon a ride to safety control and it had all been just a cruel joke she didnt even have her spear anymore she felt wholly depleted she pulled the girl down beside her and continued to scan the pond carefully motion in the bushes brynn tensed and amy looked at her warily was it hart and his partner was it the wolf whod attached himself to them no brynn exhaled long it was michelle the young woman was crouching like a huntress the spear in one hand and something in the otherthe knife it seemed waiting for the killers defiant tense as if daring them to try to hurt her brynn and the girl started to make their way toward the woman in a whisper brynn called michelle its me the woman froze but then brynn moved forward and stepped into a wash of azurewhite light from the moon brynn michelle cried slipping the knife into her pocket and running forward she stopped seeing amy standing bewildered behind brynns back the women embraced briefly and michelle dropped to her knees hugging the girl whos this amy eased free from the overly emotional embrace thiss amy shes going to come with us brynn shook her head foregoing for now the story of how shed come by the new companion the young woman was sensitive enough to ask no questions youre adorable and whos this chester hes as cute as you are the little girl remained somber sensing the atmosphere of tragedy if not comprehending the actual events that had caused it if she didnt know about her mothers fate maybe she hadnt witnessed the other killings the moon was lower now darkness was deepening curiously amy was the only one among them who didnt seem uneasy at this maybe if you have parents like hers fear of the dark doesnt figure much in your life the girl blinked at a flying squirrel as it sailed past brynn hoped shed laugh or show a bit of delight at the bizarre animal nothing her face was a mask i heard some noises michelle said meaning the gunshots our friends still with us one hurt a little more but mobile so they could be on the way here we have to get going to the snake river well climb the gorge and be at the interstate in fortyfive minutes an hour tops you said there was an easier way easier but a lot longer and hart thinks were going that way michelle blinked you talked to him yep you did the woman whispered in astonishment howd that happen she told her briefly about her captivity in the van oh my god he nearly killed you it was pretty close to mutual brynn reflected and whatd he say not much but i told him we were making for the interstate so hell think were going toward point of rocks like reverse psychology yep brynn dug the map out of her pocket and opened it whered you get that stole it from himour friend mr hart michelle gave an astonished laugh brynn oriented herself and pointed out where they were she didnt need a compass reading the map was detailed and it was easy to tell from landmarks the best route she pointed out the direction to head i want my mommy brynn shook her head at michelle and said to the girl honey we have to get out of here before we can find her and that means walking do you like to walk i guess and then were going to climb a hill like rock climbing theres a climbing wall near my school charlie said hed take me but he never did well thisll be like that only more adventurous like dora the explorer michelle said and boots when amy looked at her blankly the young woman added the monkey i know i just like havent seen that for years thats not what mom and charlie watch not wishing to speculate on what was viewing material in that household brynn said cheerfully lets go then to michelle you keep the spear you can use it for a crutch let me have one of the knives michelle pulled a chicago cutlery out of her jacket and handed it to brynn a bit of control not much but better than nothing a faint laugh brynn turned to michelle who was studying her do i look as bad as you the young woman asked doubt it i just experienced my second car wreck of the night i win but yep youre not so hot either i wouldnt go out on the town without a makeover michelle squeezed her arm they started hiking the snake river was closer than shed estimated they made it in a half hour and that included keeping to the thickest cover and pausing to look behind them frequently for the men of whom there was no sign this was reassuring but brynn wouldnt allow herself the thought that hart had fallen for her bluff and was in fact headed in the opposite direction along the riverbank they paused in a circle of tall grass to look up and down the bank of the wide shallow river punctuated with rocks logs and small islands no one wait here clutching the knife brynn eased forward she knelt on the bank and immersed her face in the freezing water now she didnt mind the cold which dulled the pain in her cheek and neck then she drank what must have been a quart she hadnt realized she was dehydrated she studied the otherworldly landscape saw no one else and motioned to michelle and amy to join her they too drank then brynn gazed up the hill in the direction of the interstate it couldnt be more than a mile away though a mile straight up jesus michelle said following brynns eyes about fifty feet away the landscape went up at a steep angleat least thirty degrees though at points it seemed fortyfive there were also vertical faces they couldnt climb those of course but brynn knew from the searchandrescue a few years ago that they wouldnt have to it was possible to hike up if you picked your route carefully there were also a number of wide plateaus that were more or less flat and filled with vegetation for cover they now walked to the beginning of the hill the churning river on their right where the gorge began looking back michelle gestured at the muddy ground behind them wait our footprints they dont look too obvious they will to somebody with a flashlight good point michelle ran back to where theyd taken their drinks and broke some branches off an evergreen bush then backing toward the cliff she swept the leaves over the mud wielding the improvised broom furiously obscuring their footprints brynn could hear her gasping hard michelle ignored her injured ankle though the pain must have been significant brynn was watching a woman very different from the rich dilettante of earlier in the evening bragging about future stardom and whining about other peoples shoes and thorn pricks brynn had known people who collapsed under the smallest stress and people who unexpectedly rose to meet impossible challenges shed been sure that michelle fell into the first category she was wrong and she knew now she had an ally the young woman joined the others amy yawned im tired i know honey michelle said well get you to sleep soon can i put chester in my pocket will you zip it up so he wont fall out you bet but dont close it all the way so he can breathe acting so much younger than her years brynn reflected sadly michelle slipped the stuffed animal into her pocket and they started to climb as in the distance on the interstate a trucks engine brake rattled harshly beckoning them forward graham and munce were making their way carefully down the slope from the interstate a truck sped past behind them the noise dampened by the foliage and confused by the wind as the driver downshifted and filled the night with the rattle of a gatling gun soon they were well into the trek not talking uttering only labored breathingthe effort to stay upright and not fall forward was as great as a climb upward would have been they could hear the rush of the river a hundred feet below in the cellar of the gorge graham made his living with flora and he was keenly aware of how different the vegetation around him now was from that at his company plants sitting subdued in ceramic pots or lolling on bundled rootballs for years hed changed the geography of residences and offices by plopping a few camellias or rhododendrons into planting beds primed with limey soil and tucking them away under a blanket of mulch here plants werent decorations they were the infrastructure population society itself controlling all he and munce meant nothing were less than insignificant as were all the animals here it seemed to graham that the croaks and hisses and hoots were desperate pleas that the trees and plants blithely ignored indifferent and treacherous too once they had to tightrope walk across a log above a thick sea of poison ivy to which he was allergic had any touched his face the rash and swelling would have blinded him even dead vegetation was dangerous munce stepped on a ledge covered with last years leaves which slid out from underneath him starting a small avalanche of loam gravel and dirt hed saved himself from a twentyfoot fall down a steep rocky slope by grabbing a fortuitous overhanging branch and as they wound downward looking for the safest route graham couldnt help but think that the noise from stepping on a desiccated branch or kicking an unnoticed pile of crisp leaves might also alert the killers they found some paths which summer hikers had worn but the trails were sporadic and didnt run very far so the men were forced to make their own sometimes a path would vanish at the edge of a cliff and they had to climb down six seven feet when they did this munce set the safety on the shotgun and handed it to graham who waited until the deputy was down and then regretfully passed it back they were now a hundred yards from the interstate with the dangerous precipice above of the gorge not far away on their left to maintain silence munce would give hand commands hed indicate pause go right or left look at this or that graham thought it was as silly as the face paint but hed talked munce into this mission and if the young man wanted to play soldier fine with him they paused looking down a very steep hill theyd have to use saplings and trees as handholds munce grimaced and started to reach out for one when graham cried out in a whisper no eric no the deputy turned back quickly eyes wide fumbling with the gun he slipped on the incline and went down hard sliding headfirst along the bed of pine needles slippery as ice graham lunged forward and managed to seize the deputys cuff jesus what the deputy managed to turn around grab grahams hand and together they scrabbled to more level ground you see something sorry graham said look eric frowning didnt get it at first then he saw that graham was pointing to the thin tree trunk hed almost grabbed from it protruded needlesharp thorns each about two inches long its a honey locust most dangerous tree in the forest theyre illegal to plant in a lot of places one of those thornsd go right through your hand peopleve died from infections lord i never looked there more of em around here oh yeah if theres one theres others and over there see that graham pointed to a stubby trunk herculesclub hard to see in the dark but theyve got thorns too and with the woods thinning that means more sun and more blackberryyou know bramblesand wild roses blackberry thornsll break off in your skin and you dont get em out right away theyll get infected in a big way damn land mines munce muttered then he froze and foregoing the cryptic hand signals he whispered way down there a flash you see anything graham noddeda faint dot of bluish light maybe a flashlight or a reflection of the moonlight on metal or glass it was about threequarters of a mile away munce undid the thong that covered his black pistol and gestured to graham to follow him hart was looking down at the gps which had survived the van crash in better condition than he had nothing broken just sorebut everyplace was sore and the bullet wound in his arm had started to bleed again thank you michelle thank you brynn a wave of anger seared him and for a moment he didnt give a damn about craftsmanship he wanted to get even he wanted to pay them both back in a big way sweet bloody revenge maybe compton lewis was onto something they were standing on the banks of the snake river which ambled out of the flatter forests east on their right and flowed into the compressed gorge west hed lost the map in the crash but theyd gotten here by using the gps which wasnt as detailed but was good enough way i figure it his voice faded as he glanced at lewis you okay yeah the other man was standing with his hands at his sides holding the shotgun apart from his natural slump he looked like a soldier on guard duty bothered you killing that woman right didnt think it would butseeing her eyes you know thats hard hart said he was thinking maybe the first one then you dont even notice it he was replaying the scene at the camper lewis starting the fire beneath the winnebago then returning to the other side two men had rushed out the front door a fat one and a thinner one with a beard carrying a fire extinguisher a woman hurried out the back door looking frantically around screaming hart had shot the men quickly before the fat one could even reach for his gun lewis in the rear had the shotgun trained on the woman but hed done nothing at first hart was going to do lewis a favor and shoot her too but he heard the bang as the shotgun went off as if by itself lewis seemed surprised as the heavy woman flew backward her chest and neck rippled then started to bleed she dropped to her knees and began to crawl toward lewis the second time he actually aimed and fired she fell backward kicked some then died that was unpleasant hart said lewis nodded i was telling you they were tweakers probably slamming their own stuff nobody cooks meth without using it maybe not at first but they get addicted it eats their souls yeah lewis said softly then he came back to earth hart could see in his eyes hart continued way i figure it is this he showed him the gps on the blackberry its nearly six miles to point of rocks going that way upstream he pointed right then he indicated the gorge to their left but that way up that hill theyll be at the interstate in forty minutes an hour and thats where theyre going youre sure pretty sure she told me she was when we were in the van but shes the trickster remember she knew there was a chance id survive the crash which meant that she had to give me information thatd lead me in a different direction shed said the interstate thinking id believe it was really point of rocks you think she was playing that game hart put away the blackberry and strode up and down the riverbank hey lewis whats that look like to you he shone the flashlight on the ground like i dont know somebody was sweeping covering up footprints yeah it does he walked to the base of the steep hill okay here we go he found a broken branch heres her broom they did come this way and look at that he pointed out a tiny set of shoe prints that little girl in the camper she mustve got out lewis had gone quiet again and he rubbed his tattoothe cross on his neckcompulsively hart said im not inclined to kill children well take care of the women but let the girl be but funny lewis was bothered by something else one thing i want to say i shouldve before but go on comp that robbery i told you about the robbery the bank in the snow hart remembered where hed traded shots with the bank guard who was a former cop yeah wasnt quite honest with you that right somethings been eating at me hart he was no longer the sarcastic my friend and hadnt been for hours he said go ahead comp what is it truth iswe didnt get away with fifty thousand or whatever i said was closer tookay it was closer to three really two and some change and okay it wasnt a bank was a guard refilling the atm outsideand i only fired to scare him he dropped his gun and peed his pants i think he didnt have any backup piece either i boost things up sometimes exaggerate you know got into the habit around my brother kind of had to growing upgot disrespected a lot so there you have it thats it the confession guess so hell comp i wouldnt want to work with somebody didnt have a healthy ego way you can look at it you made two thousand bucks for what two minutes work bout that thats about sixty thousand an hour and he peed his pants hell that made it worth it right there hart laughed lewis asked shyly you still interested in doing a heist together you and me you bet i am sooner were done here the sooner we can start planning some jobs that dont crash and burn one hundred ten percent repressing a grin lewis tapped his cigarettes again like a good catholic blessing himself the trek was much harder than shed anticipated the hillside was so steep in places that it couldnt be climbed at least not with a nineyearold in tow brynn frequently had to find alternative routes how about there brynn glanced at the place where michelle was pointing it seemed to be a fairly level path between a rock ledge and a dense cluster of trees brynn considered it but that way would leave them completely exposed from below with no escape routes they had to bypass the path taking precious minutes to find a way around brynn wasnt entirely confident that hart had bought the ploy about point of rocks she was beginning to feel an itching sensation on the back of her neck as if the men were drawing close the women continued upward looping around a formation of limestone twenty feet high brynn could see that rock climbers had been here metal spikes had been pounded into the cracks tonight the hobby struck her as pure madness something joey would try but she put her son out of her head concentrate she told herself a brief respite as they traversed a fairly level trail then upward again gasping for breath all three of them the sound of the snake running through the gorge on their right grew softer as they moved higher brynn guessed they were now sixty feet or so above the river oh no michelle whispered brynn too stopped their level plain suddenly ended in a sheer rock wall a dead end to the right the ground extended to a steep dropoff into the gorge brynn walked toward it slowly dizzy uncomfortable with the height she didnt get to the edge itself but returned quickly we cant go that way she sighed in frustration the men couldnt be more than a half mile from the interstate but the hike was taking forever to go back and find a way around the wall would add another ten minutes brynn looked back then surveyed the wall it was about twenty feet high and not completely vertical the slope was probably seventy degrees in most places and the surface was cracked and craggy she asked michelle can you do it damn right i can brynn smiled said to amy you remember when you were little amy you and ill climb together well play piggyback i guess rudy wants me to ride piggyback sometimes i dont like it he smells bad brynn shot a glance to michelle who grimaced in disgust but brynn smiled at amy well i probably dont smell too good either but itll be fun come on lets go brynn turned around she whispered to michelle ill go up first if something happens i drop her try to break her fall dont worry about me michelle nodded and boosted the girl up whispering can you handle her no choice brynn gasped the theme for the evening though the burden wasnt as great as it could be she was thinking how thin the little girl wasand about the sad fate that had landed her squarely in such neglect they started up the cliff a foot at a time heart slamming legs burning brynn slowly climbed about fifteen feet from the ground the muscles in her legs began quivering more from fear than from effort how she hated heights she paused frequently amy with her arms around brynns neck was holding on very tightly making it hard for brynn to breathe but shed rather the child kept a solid grip her rubber legs propelled her another five feet then ten grasping handholds harder than she needed to fingers cramping even her toes curled as if she were climbing barefoot finally an eternity her head was over the edge and she was looking at a flatter plain in front of her was a huge tangle of forsythia not daring to look down she grabbed all the vines within arms length in her right hand tested them and with a deep breath let go of the rock she pulled herself halfway over the edge and then said amy go over my head put your knees on my shoulders and climb when youre on the top stop just stand there brynn was about to offer more reassurance but the girl said quickly okay and climbed off and stood motionless at attention a child used to doing exactly as she was told brynn then pulled herself the rest of the way over the top and sat down breathing hard she looked over the sidedisappointingly it seemed much less intimidating from this end as if the effort and fear had been wasted she beckoned michelle up the young woman climbed quickly despite her bad anklethanks to youth and that fancy buttfirming health club of hers brynn helped her over the edge and the three sat together in a huddle catching their breath brynn oriented herself and looking around found what seemed to be a path that led upward they started walking again michelle eased close to brynn whatll happen to her if she doesnt have kin a foster home thats sad she should be with a family the systems pretty good in kennesha they check on the families real well just nice if she could go to somebody who really wanted her id love her maybe one of the problems between michelle and her husband had to do with children he might not have wanted any adoptionsre possible i dont know how that works brynn touched her cheek it hurt like hell she saw michelles eyes focused on amy so youd like kids oh theyre the best i just love them the way you guide them teach them things and what they teach you theyre always a challenge children make you i dont know whole youre not a complete person without them you sound like an expert youll be a good mother michelle gave a laugh i intend to be for the moment at least thoughts of unfaithful husbands and marriages in shambles had faded and the woman seemed to be looking at a brighter future and what about me brynn thought keep going she told herself keep going lewis had made an improvised sling for the shotgun and was carrying the weapon on his back the men were going straight up the slope as best they could hart figuring that the women would be taking an easier route because of the girl hart thought of the professional couples and their kids he saw at the rockclimbing walls at recreation areas and sports stores near where he lived hed wondered if any of the parents actually had jobs that required them to climb like this but no of course they didnt they were paper pushers they made ten times what he did their lives were never endangered they never felt the pain that hart was experiencing yet he would never dream of swapping lives with them for any money theyre nothing but dead bodies brynn sitting around upset angry about something they saw on tv doesnt mean a single thing to them personally going to their jobs coming home talking stuff they dont know or care about they came to a flat stretch and paused looking around carefully he wasnt going to forget that both women had attempted to kill them tonight and he had no reason to think theyd given up trying sure they wanted to escape but he couldnt get brynns eyes out of his mind both in the driveway of the feldmans house and then in the van just before she released the brake risking her own death to stop him you have the right to remain silent you have the right to an attorney hart had to smile at that moment a faint scream sounded in the distance ahead of them a high squeal the hells that lewis looked alarmed fucking blair witch project hart laughed thats the girl the little girl shes as good as your gps hart and they broke into a run an animal munce asked in a whisper graham cocked his head listening to the keening howl somewhere nearby to their left it seemed carried on the breeze hed seen an animala coyote or feral dog maybe even a wolfon a ridge looking their way was that the source of the sound he knew plants he knew soil and silt and rock he didnt know animals or their habits could be i dont know it hadnt sounded like a womans voice it had almost seemed like a child but that couldnt be maybe the wind munce offered though thered been a sense of alarm an uneasiness about it fear more than pain now silence wind bird animalplease let it be one of those down there munce said right below us graham was frowning at the daunting sweep of trees that disappeared away from them theyd come about a quarter mile picking their way slowly through the dense woodland it was a much longer trek than expected owing to detours around brush thick as scouring pads and steep cliffs that couldnt be negotiated without rappelling gearwhich munce had announced he wished theyd had and graham was grateful they didnt they started down the hillside using trees as handholds once again then they found themselves stymiedin a funnel of rock i think thats our only option munce said pointing down a chute descending away from them it was about six feet wide and at a fortyfivedegree slope littered with shale and gravel and dirt slippery as ice and if you fell youd slide along the rugged stone surface for a good fifty feet to a precipice they couldnt see what lay beyond or we go back and try to make our way around just then another wail filled the night the men looked at each other eyes wide there was no doubt the sound had come from a human throat we go graham said torn between a frantic need to find the source of the screams and fear that if they lost their footing here theyd find themselves tumbling off a cliffor sliding into a grove of deadly honey locust wheres my mother amy shrieked again please honey brynn said to the little girl held her finger to her lips please be quiet exhausted emotionally drained the little girl was losing it no she wailed her face was bright red eyes and nose streaming noooo those men will hurt us amy we have to be quiet mommy they were on a relatively flat stretch of ground in a thick forest the trees only a yard or two apart theyd been moving along well when suddenly amy had become hysterical wheres my mommy i want to go back to mommy forcing a smile onto her face brynn knelt down and took the girl by the shoulders please honey we have to be quiet were playing that game remember we need to be quiet i dont want to play any game i want to go back i want mommy the girls age was close to ten but once again brynn thought she was acting more like a fiveor sixyearoldmaybe a reaction to this terrible evening maybe a harrowing insight about her upbringing please nooo the volume of the accompanying squeal was astonishing let me try michelle said kneeling in front of amy and setting down the spear she handed the girl her stuffed toy amy flung it to the ground brynn said ill check behind us if theyre nearby they had tove heard her she jogged back twenty feet and climbed a small hillock gazed back the girls screaming seemed like a siren brynn squinted through the night oh no she was dismayed but not surprised to see two hundred yards away the men making their way in this direction they paused and looked around trying to find the source of the commotion thank goodness though just at that moment amy fell silent the men continued to look around them for a moment and then started walking again they vanished behind a stone wall brynn returned to michelle and amy the little girl though still unhappy had stopped crying and was clutching her toy once more howd you do that michelle shrugged grimacing whispered wasnt such a great idea i told her we were on our way to see her mommy couldnt think of what else to say well it didnt matter the girl would learn the truth sooner or later but for now they sure couldnt afford the screaming brynn whispered theyre back there what hart and his partner a nod how hart of course brynn said reversereverse psychology two hundred yards or so back weve got to move they headed toward the gorge the ground being flatter then north again toward the interstate they knew the direction because the river was on their right but with the landscape more open as they rose higher they were forced to zigzagnow seeking out brush and trees for cover it was taking too long brynn reflected feeling harts presence growing closer she led michelle and amy back into the thicker woods and they continued north suddenly faint light streaked from left to right a truck or car on the interstate a half mile maybe less brynn and michelle shared a smile and started forward again which is when they heard a snap of a footstep to their left somewhere in a thick pine forest the sound was close brynn looked at the little girl whose gaunt face warned of another outburst another snap closer footsteps definitely hart and his partner must have moved faster than brynn had expected closing the two hundred yards in only fifteen minutes theyd probably found a smooth trail the women had missed brynn pointed to the ground the three of them went prone behind a fallen tree amy started to cry again but michelle pulled her close and worked her magic once more brynn picked up handfuls of leaves and as quietly as she could spread them on top of the other two then she also lay down and camouflaged herself the footsteps grew closer then were lost in the rustling wind then brynn gasped she believed she heard somebody whispering her name her imagination of course it was just the breeze which was blowing steadily swirling leaves and hissing through branches but then she heard it again yes definitely brynn in a faint whisper her jaw quivered in shock hart eerie as if he had a sixth sense she was nearby again though the name was indistinct lost in the sounds of the forest in her exhaustion and pain she almost thought the voice sounded like grahams but that was impossible of course her husband was home asleep now or perhaps not home and asleep brynn she touched her finger to her lips michelle nodded reaching into her jacket for the knife the steps began again very close it seemed and heading directly toward the fallen tree they hid beneath times to fight and times to run time to hide too thinking of the men with their loud loud guns another memory came back to her again her first husband eyes wide in shock and agony stumbling back under the nearly pointblank impact of the slug as brynns service weapon clattered to their kitchen floor after the discharge was some sort of justice at work here a divine or spiritual payback would her fate now be similar to keiths the footsteps grew closer silently brynn sprinkled more leaves over the threesome and closed her eyes recalling that when he was younger joey believed that doing this would make you disappear brynn graham called again as loud as he dared but still in a whisper listening nothing as theyd approached this portion of the woods the screaming had stopped and theyd seen no one but as they continued their trek graham was convinced hed heard a womans voice whispering and some rustling of leaves very close by he couldnt tell where though and risked saying his wifes name no response but he heard more rustling and theyd headed for the sound munce with his shotgun ready brynn now the men were next to the trunk of a large fallen oak looking around in all directions graham frowned and touched his ear munce shook his head but then the deputy stiffened pointing to a field of rocks and brush graham caught a glimpse of a figure about a hundred yards away holding a rifle or shotgun moving from right to left the killers they were here graham pointed down at the deputys radio which was off but munce shook his head and pointed again to his own ear meaning presumably that to turn it on would result in a telltale crackle munce hurried along a path graham hadnt seen before he realized the deputy was going to flank the man with the gun he thought what the hell am i doing here and lost himself entirely in this mad pursuit the footsteps receded from the oak tree finally brynn lifted her head gingerly worried about the noise the leaves would make but when she peered over the tree trunk she saw the shadowy forms moving away into the earlymorning murkiness the men had been just a few feet away from where theyd hidden if amy had made a single whimper all three of them would be dead now brynns hands were shivering the men vanished into a wall of trees come on she whispered theyre headed away from us looks like theyre going back down the hill lets move fast were not far from the highway they rose shedding leaves and started uphill again that was close michelle said whyd they go on past maybe heard something a deer brynn wondered if their guardian angel their wolf had distracted the men she looked at amy im proud of you honey you stayed quiet real nice the girl clutched chester and said nothing remaining sullen and redeyed her expression echoed exactly how brynn felt they wound their way up several long slopes michelle gave a smile and pointed to the horizon brynn saw another flash of headlights the glow of heaven she assessed the last obstacle a tall rocky hill to the right of which was a hundredfoot drop into the gorge to the left was a dense thicket of brambles that extended some distance to more tall rocky outcroppings they couldnt climb the hill itself the face was a sheer ascent that rose forty or fifty feet above their heads but on the left side of the rise above the brush a narrow ledge ran upward and appeared to lead directly to a field and beyond that the interstate the ledge was steep but could be hiked it was apparently a popular starting point for rock climbers the stone face above it like the ones shed seen earlier was peppered with metal spikes brynn was wary of the ledge for two reasons it would completely expose them to the men for the five or so minutes it would take to traverse also it was very narrowtheyd have to go single fileand a fall though not far would land them in a tangle of bushes that included barberries she remembered these from grahams nursery they were popular with customers having striking berries and brilliant color in the autumn but evolution had armed them with thin brittle needles after the winters dieback these beds were now barren of foliage and the needles along the entire lengths of the branches were vicious spikes but she decided theyd have to chance it there wasnt time to look for alternative routes besides she recalled after coming so close to the oak tree where the women had been hiding hart and his partner had turned the other way moving back down the hillside time to go home brynn murmured and they began to climb graham and munce moving cautiously in silence were getting close to where theyd seen the man with the shotgun disappear into the bushes munce motioned for them to stop the deputy cocked his head and scanned the landscape the muzzle of the scattergun following the course of his gaze graham wished hed insisted on a weapon the buck knife in his pocket seemed pointless he thought about asking for the deputys pistol but he didnt dare make a sound now ahead no more than thirty feet came a rustle of branches and dry leaves as the invisible suspect pushed through brush a snap of a footstep another grahams heart pounded he forced himself to breathe quietly his jaw was trembling munce on the other hand looked completely in his element confident making economical movements like hed done this a thousand times he crouched and pointed to the crook of a large rock meaning graham understood to wait the landscaper nodded the deputy touched his pistol once as if to orient himself as to its exact location and gripping the shotgun in both hands moved forward slowly keeping his head up looking around but sensing leaves and branches and avoiding them perfectly more footfalls on the other side of the bushes graham looked closely but could see no one the sound was clear though the man was stalking through the woods pausing occasionally munce moved toward the killer in complete silence he paused about twenty feet from the line of brush cocked his head listening they heard the footsteps again on the far side of the foliage the men not trying to be silent they were ignorant that they were no longer hunters but were themselves prey munce stepped forward silently it was then that the man with the shotgun stepped out from behind a tree no more than six feet behind munce and shot him in the back the deputy gave a cry as he was blown forward onto his belly the weapon flying from his hand graham eyes wide in horror gasped jesus ohjesus the attacker hadnt said a word no warning no instruction no shout to give up hed just appeared and pulled the trigger eric munce lay on his stomach his lower back shredded and black with blood his feet danced a bit one arm moved a hand clenched and unclenched hart i got him the shooter called to someone else whispering another man came running up from behind the hedge breathing hard holding a pistol he looked down at the deputy who was barely conscious rolled him over graham realized that this other onehart apparentlyhad been in the bushes making the noise of footsteps to distract munce horrified graham eased back into the crevice of basalt as far as he could go he was only twenty feet from them hidden by saplings and a dozen brown husks of last years ferns he looked out through the plants shit hart its another cop looking around theres gotta be more of them you see anybody else no but we can ask him i aimed low coulda killed him but i shot low to keep him alive that was good thinking comp hart knelt beside munce where are the others graham pressed against the rock hard as if it could swallow him up his hands shaking he could barely control his breathing he thought he might be sick where are the otherswhat he lowered his head i cant hear you talk louder tell me and well get you help whatd he say hart he said there werent any he came by here on his own to look for some women escaped from two burglars he telling the truth i dont know waithes saying something else hart listened and stood in an unemotional voice he said just we can go fuck ourselves the one called comp said to munce well sir youre pretty much the one fucked here hart paused he knelt again then stood hes gone graham stared at the limp form of the deputy he wanted to sob then he saw ten feet away munces shotgun lying where it had landed when the deputy had flown to the ground it was half covered with leaves graham thought please dont look that way leave it i want that gun i want it so bad i can taste it he realized how easily he could kill right now shoot them both in the back give them the same chance theyd given the deputy please while the man whod killed munce stood guard his gun ready hart searched him and pulled the radio off the deputys belt he clicked it on graham heard staticky transmissions hart said to comp theres a search party but everybodys over at six eightytwo and lake mondac itself i think maybe this boy was telling the truth he mustve come over here on a hunch hart shone a flashlight on the front of the deputys uniform read his nametag then stood up and spoke into the radio thiss eric over a clattery response graham couldnt hear bad reception here over more static real bad i cant find any trace of anybody over here you copy over say again eric where are you a voice asked carrying through the air to grahams ears repeat bad reception nobodys here over where are you hart shrugged im north no sign of anybody hows it looking at the lake nothing around the lake so far were still looking divers havent found any bodies thats good ill let you know if i find anything out out graham was staring at the shotgun as if he could will it to become invisible hart said why isnt anybody over here except him though i dont get it theyre not as smart as you hart thats why we better get a move on take his glock his extra clips graham shrank back against the rock leave the shotgun please leave the shotgun footsteps sounded on the crinkly leaves were they coming his way graham couldnt tell then the steps stopped the men were very close hart asked you want the cops scattergun naw not really dont need two dont want anybody else finding it you want to pitch it into the river sure thing no more footsteps then a grunt of somebody throwing a heavy object there she goes after a delay graham heard a clatter the men resumed walking they were closer yet to where graham huddled between earth and stone if they went to their left around the boulder theyd miss him to the right theyd trip over him he unfolded his knife it clicked open graham recalled that the last time hed used it was to cut a graft for a rosebush at the sound of the gunshotit was closemichelle had gasped and spun around letting go of amys hand the girl panicked again hurried back down the ledge whimpering no brynn called amy she eased past michelle staring at the thorny bushes below and then trotted after amy the girl saw her coming though and just as brynn approached she dropped to the ledge squirming away no she squealed she dropped chester who tumbled over the side the girl lunged for the toy and went over the edge herself pitching for the barberries brynns hand shot out and caught amy by the sweatshirt luckily she was facing downward had she been upright the skinny girl would have slipped out of the garment and fallen into the mass of thorns the girl screamed in fear and pain and for the loss of her toy quiet please brynn cried michelle ran back reached down grabbed the girls leg and together the women wrestled her onto the ledge the girl was going to scream again but michelle leaned close and whispered something stroking her head amy once again fell silent brynn thought why cant i do that i promised her wed come back and get chester michelle whispered as they started moving up the ledge again goddamn it if we get out of here i will personally wade through those thorns and get him brynn said thanks they had another two hundred feet to go before they reached the top please let there be a truck when we get there ill get em to stop if i have to strip naked to do it what was that shooting michelle asked who was oh no brynn muttered looking back hart and his partner were breaking from the same bushes where brynn had paused to consider whether to climb the ledge five minutes ago they paused hart looked up and his eyes met brynns he grabbed his partners arm and pointed directly at the women on the ledge the partner worked the shotgun ejecting one spent shell and chambering a new one and both men began to sprint forward take your shot hart called to lewis they were both breathless gasping his heart was pounding too hard to use the pistol but his partner might be able with the shotgun to hit the one who was last going up the rocky ledge michelle good kill the bitch lewis stopped took a deep breath and fired a round it was closehart could see from the dust on the rockbut the pellets missed and just then the trio vanished as they leapt off the ledge at the top into what seemed to be a field theyll be making straight for the highwaythrough the clearing and into the woods theyve got the kid we can beat them if we move the men were winded but lewis nodded gamely and they started up the ledge graham boyd flinched as the gunshot sounded no more than a quarter mile away he was in a precarious position perched on the edge of a cliff of sandstone the snake river churning past nearly a hundred feet below he was staring down and in the dim light he believed he could see the shotgun that eric munces murderer had flung over the edge it was about fifteen feet below him on a jutting rock oh did he want that gun the men had passed by him on the other side of the rock and vanished into the tangle of the woods when he could no longer hear them graham had risen and crouching made his way to the edge of the gorge could he make the climb down and retrieve the weapon well goddamn it he was sure going to try he was burning with fury hed never wanted anything more in his life than to get his hands on that gun he squinted and studying the rock face found what seemed to be enough handand footholds to climb down to a ledge and from there grab the shotgun hurry get going breathing hard he turned his back to the gorge and eased over the side he began feeling his way down five feet eight then ten he moved as fast as he dared if he fell hed bounce off the outcropping and tumble down the steep incline of the gorge wallsvertical in placesinto the rocky water far below streaks of white foam trailing downstream were evidence that boulders were plentiful twelve feet he glanced down yes there was the shotgun it was balanced unsteadily right on the edge of the outcropping he felt a panicked urgency to grab the gun fast before a gust of wind tipped it over the side he continued down getting as close as he could finally he was level with the weapon though it was still four or five feet to his right graham had thought there was some way to ease sideways toward it but what seemed like the shadows of footholds were just dark rock inhaling hard pressing his face against a cold smooth muddy rock go for it he told himself angrily youve come this far gripping a thin sapling growing from a crack in the cliff he reached for the gun he came within eight inches of the barrelthe black disk of the muzzle was pointed directly at him below the water raged graham sighed in frustration just a few inches more now he slid his hand farther along the sapling and swung out with his right again more forcefully this time two inches from the gun extending his grip once more he tried a third time yes he got his fingers around the barrel now just the sapling snapped under his weight and he slipped sideways a foot or so held in place only by a strand of slick wood and bark crying out graham tried to keep a grip on the shotgun but it slipped from his sweatslick fingers and tumbled over the side striking another outcropping ten feet below and cartwheeling into the river eighty feet below no he watched miserably as the weapon vanished into the black water but he had no time to mourn its fate the sapling gave way completely and graham grabbed the outcropping though he was able to keep his grip for merely ten seconds before his fingers slipped and he began to fall almost in the same trajectory as the shotgun hed so dearly desired theyd never make it to the highway in time brynn realized she gasped in dismay just as the shotgun fired theyd leapt off the rocky shelf and into the field but shed misjudged the distance to the trees the strip of forest next to the interstate was an easy three hundred yards away the ground was flat filled with reed canary grass heather and a few saplings and scorched trunks she recalled that this had been the site of a forest fire a year ago it would take them ten minutes to cross and the men would be here in far less time than that they were probably already on the ledge brynn looked at amy her terrified face ruddy with tears and streaked with dirt what can we possibly do it was michelle leaning against the spear gasping who supplied the answer no more running its time to fight brynn held her eye were way outgunned here i dont care its a long shot you know my lifes been nothing but sure things treadmills and lunch at the ritz and nail salons im sick of it they shared a smile then brynn looked around and saw that they could turn to the right and climb up a steep incline to the top of the cliff which was above the ledge the men were on now up there come on brynn led the way then amy then michelle they looked down to see the men moving cautiously along the trail a third of the way into it hart was in the lead they assessed their pathetic weapons the spear and the knife but brynn wanted to keep those for the last minute she pointed to the rocks littering the area some were too big to budge but others could with some difficulty be rolled or lifted also there were plenty of logs and thick branches brynn growled lets send em into the thorns michelle nodded then brynn had an idea she took the compass bottle from her pocket with the knife she cut off a long strip of cloth from her ski parka and tied it around the bottle she gripped the candle lighter michelle pointed out its just water they dont know that as far as they know its full of alcohol itll stop em long enough for us to get some rocks down on them brynn peered down the men were almost directly below them she whispered you ready you bet i am michelle said she lit the stripthe nylon burned bright and sizzling brynn leaned over the edge judged the distance and let the bottle fall from her hand it landed on the ledge about five feet in front of hart and bounced but stayed put what hart gasped shit its alcohol its going to blow get back where are they up there someplace the shotgun fired and a few pellets struck the rock face near the women amy huddled nearby began to scream but brynn didnt care somehow screaming and howling seemed just right at the moment they werent a deputy and a dilettante actress they were warriors queens of the jungle she wanted to give one of her wolf cries at the moment herself together they rolled the biggest rock they couldit mustve weighed forty or fifty poundstoward the edge of the cliff they muscled it up and brynn rolled it into space then looked down the aim was perfect but fate intervened the rock wall wasnt completely vertical the missile hit a small outcropping and bounced outward missing harts head by inches the rock did however crack apart the formation it struck and showered the men with fragments they backed up ten feet along the ledge the partner fired again but the pellets hissed past the women and upward we cant stop brynn called gasping in a whisper hit them with everything we can pick up they pitched a log two boulders and a dozen smaller rocks they heard a cry hart my hand broke my fucking hand brynn risked a peek the partner had dropped his shotgun into the brambles yes hart was gazing upward he saw brynn and fired two shots from his glock one spattered the cliff nearby but she dodged before the shrapnel hit her she heard hart call comp the fuses out look get that rubble off the path kick it off hell hart theyre going to break our skulls go ahead ill cover you brynn was nodding at a log about five feet long and a foot in diameter with several sharp spiky limbs a few inches long that yes michelle smiled together the women got onto their knees and pushed the trunk parallel to the cliffs edge gasping from the effort they collapsed against it brynn held up a finger when i tell you to throw a rock behind them michelle nodded brynn grabbed the spear she thought of joey she thought of graham for some reason her first husbands image made an appearance then she nodded michelle pitched a rock down the ledge brynn stood she saw hart looking behind him toward the clatter of the rock and giving an otherworldly howl she flung the spear at the partners back as he bent down to muscle some debris off the ledge comp hart cried looking up at just that moment the man spun around and danced back from the spear which missed him by inches digging into the stone at his feet with a burst of sparks he slipped and rolled off the ledge all that kept him from falling was his lefthanded grip on a crack in the rock his feet dangled above the vicious thorns hurrying to him hart glanced up and fired but brynn was out of his line of sight and helping michelle push the deadly log closer to the edge brynn took another fast lookhart was bent over his back to her gripping his partner by the jacket and struggling to pull him up they were thirty feet below in a direct line and the rock face here was smooth the impact of the log would shatter bones if not kill outright one of them at least would be knocked into the sea of thorns no hesitation now brynn got a good grip on her side of the log and michelle on hers go brynn whispered the log was twelve inches from the edge of the cliff more six inches which was when a sharp crack sounded on the cliff face only feet below brynn and michelle and a shower of dust and stone chips blew into the night a moment later the distant boom of a rifle shot filled the air the women dropped to their stomachs brynn crawled to amy and pulled the hysterical girl to the ground cradling her another shot more rock exploded who michelle gasped that wasnt from them theres somebody else out there shooting at us brynn stared into the distant woods a muzzle flash from a long way off get down she ducked and another highvelocity rifle round slammed into the log theyd been pushing forward brynn risked a fast look downward hart had pulled his partner back onto the ledge but they too were crouching not sure of what was going on it seemed the shooter was focusing on the women but the men were probably wondering if they themselves were the targets the two men completely exposed apparently decided to retreat back down the ledge brynn said theyre leaving lets get out of here who the hell is it michelle muttered we almost had them come on hurry they couldnt return to the clearing where theyd be easy targets for whoever was shooting so they crawled closer to the gorge away from the sniper they were soon safe on the other side of the hill though nearby was a sheer drop into the gorge brynn eyed it warily and kept as far away as she could she asked amy honey did rudy and your mommy have other friends who stayed with you somebody who wasnt at the camper tonight sometimes that was probably it a partner of gandy and rudy whod seen the carnage at the meth lab and had somehow trailed them here the silence was interrupted by the beckoning sound of a big tractortrailer downshifting as it came to the bridge brynn looked along the edge of the gorge they could walk that way to the interstate under pretty good cover the sky was now growing lighterdawn couldnt be too far offand they could easily pick their way through the paths toward the highway brynn hugged michelle we almost had em not smiling michelle said next time brynn hesitated well lets hope there isnt one though it seemed from her fierce expression that the young woman wasnt hoping for that at all another cop lewis asked referring to the shooter he was flexing his hand it wasnt broken but the rock had jammed his thumb the man was mostly upset hed lost his shotgun in the bramble patch and his anger at the women had grown exponentially as they hunkered down behind a boulder at the foot of the ledge hart listened to the dead deputys radio routine transmissions about search parties nobody had even heard the shots nothing about any other cops in the area more meth people ill bet on the way to the camper hart turned on his gps he had to tame his anger they were so close to their prey but they couldnt go after them the ledge was the only way and theyd be sitting ducks well go around to the left through the woods its longer but well have good cover right to the highway what time is it lewis asked what does it matter i just want to know how long weve been doing this shit way too long hart said holding the bushmaster rifle james jasons looked at the rock face hed just been firing at hed done the best he could considering there was virtually no light and he was more than two hundred yards away from the target he waited scanning the area with his nightvision binoculars but saw no signs of the men or the women there would have been quite a story about how the caveman confrontationthe two men dodging rocks and logshad come about for ten minutes he scanned the field and forest around him where were they the men had fled back down the rocky ledge since they had apparently lost their car theyd be making for the interstateto flag down a ride but there were a lot of different routes they could take to get to the highway from the ledge the odds were that theyd be coming in this general direction it was wildly overgrown but possibly jasons could find them on the other hand they might have gone around to the far side of the hill after the women it seemed like a much steeper climb and would have to be made without cover but who knew maybe the men were pissed off about the attack and hellbent on getting their prey still jasons didnt want to do anything too quickly he looked over the brush scanning with the nightvision binoculars much of the vegetation moved but that seemed due to the breeze not escaping humans he saw movement not far away he blinked and gave a gasp as he focused his binoculars he was looking at a wild animal of some kind a coyote or wolf the nightvision system gave it a ghostly greengray color its face was lean and the teeth white and perfect visible through the slightly bared lips and jowls he was glad the creature was some distance away it was magnificent but fierce the animal lifted its head sniffed and in an instant was gone im a long long way from home james jasons thought hed tell robert an edited version of the story in which the animal though not the gunfire would figure he continued to scan the nearby field and forest but saw no sign of emma feldmans killers they could easily have been here but it was impossible to tell with the dense vegetation and what about graham and the deputy the gunshot hed heard before the killers arrived at the rock ledge hinted at their fate it was a shamebut you cant get in over your head just cant do it jasons waited another ten minutes and decided it was time to get back to the interstate he slung the canvas bag over his shoulder and without disassembling the rifle melted into the forest they continued along the ridge of the gorge and toward the highway the snake river pounding over rocks far below brynn didnt dare look to her right where ten feet away the world ended a sheer cliff she held amys hand and stared directly ahead at the path in front of them she paused once looking back michelle was hobbling along well enough though clearly exhausted the little girl appeared almost catatonic the time was still very early and from what they could hear there wasnt much traffic on the road yet but an occasional semi or sedan would cruise by and all they needed was one the bridge suddenly loomed ahead and to the right they plunged into a band of trees and emerged into a strip of grass about thirty feet wide beyond that were the shoulder of the interstate and the beautiful strips of graying asphalt but brynn held up her hand for them to stop there were no cars or trucks in sight just yet and theyd come too far to make mistakes now they remained in the tall grass like timid hitchhikers brynn found herself weaving a bit this was about the first smooth level ground shed been on in close to nine or so hours and her inner ears gyroscope was having trouble navigating then she laughed looking down the highway a car was heading around a curve toward them on the shoulder it was a kennesha county sheriffs department car its lights flashing moving slow a driver had heard the shots and called or the state polices brynn raised a hand to the car thinking shed have to call in immediately about the shooter at the ledge the car slowed and swerved onto the shoulder and then eased to a stop between her and the highway the doors opened hart climbed out of the drivers side his partner from the other no michelle gasped brynn exhaled a disgusted sigh she glanced at the car it was eric munces her eyes went wide yeah he didnt make it said the partner the man shed come close to shooting back in the feldmans dining room fell for the oldest trick in the book she briefly closed her eyes in horror eric muncethe cowboy had come out to save her and charged to his own death outmatched hart said nothing he held his black pistol and gazed at the captives the partner continued and how are you michelle emphasizing the name he pulled a womans purse out of his pocket stuffed it back nice to make your acquaintance the woman said nothing just put her arms around the little girl protectively pulled her close you ladies have a nice stroll through the woods tonight good conversation you stop for a tea party hart focused on brynn he nodded she easily held his eye he lowered the gun as a sedan on the far side of the divider cruised past it didnt even slow in the pale dawn light it might have been hard to see the drama unfolding in the grass on the other side of the road soon the car was gone and the highway was empty comp hart asked his eye on brynn the skinny man glanced over kneading his earlobe yeah stay right in front of them here yeah you bet the partner comp apparently said you want me to cover em he started to reach for the silver automatic pistol in his jacket no thats okay hart stepped directly in front of the man facing him comp gave an uncertain smile what is it hart only a moments hesitation then hart lifted the gun to his face smiling uncertainly comp touched the blueandred tattoo of a cross on his neck then his earlobe he shook his head hey whatre you hart shot him twice in the head the man collapsed on his back left knee up amy screamed brynn could only stare as hart turned and keeping his gun on the women and girl stepped backward to his partners body michelles eyes went cold hart bent down and pulled comps sigsauer mm from his waistband and wrapped the dead mans limp fingers around it so this was to be the scenario brynn understood with the mans hand around the sig hed shoot the women leaving telltale gunshot residue on the partners skin hed then stand over brynns body to do the same putting a second gun in her handmunces glock probablyand fire a couple of rounds into the trees the police would reason that the partner had killed the three of them and brynn got off two final shots to take him out before she died and hart would disappear forever a curious feeling having only minutes to live her life wasnt replaying itself but she was thinking of regrets she gazed at the woods the smooth edge of trees and brush severed by the shoulder and highway tamed she nearly expected their wolf friend to stick its head out and look their way before vanishing into the woods again then hart was twisting the dead partners arm up and to the left aiming at brynn first with the sigsauer michelle pulled amy even closer in front of her and was reaching into her leather jacket perhaps for their last chicago cutlery knife she was going to fling it at hart it seemed a final desperate gesture and futile of course joey brynn thought i then came the shout startling them all dont move drop it breathless and limping graham boyd pushed from the woods behind hart holding a small revolver graham brynn cried in astonishment my god drop it now put it down her husbands clothes were streaked with mudand blood too she could now seeand torn in several places his face was bruised and filthy too and through the mask his eyes shone with pure anger shed never seen him like this hart hesitated graham fired a round into the dirt at his feet the killer flinched sighed he set the gun on the ground brynn recognized the pistol it was eric munces backup which he kept strapped to his ankle she remembered mentioning to graham that he kept a second gun there there were mysteries here but at the moment brynn wasnt speculating about how her husband and munce had come to be at the snake river gorge she stepped forward took the pistol from her husband verified that it was loaded still and motioned hart out of the grass and onto the shoulder where hed be more visible and a better target control kneel down hands on the top of your head if a hand comes off your head youll die of course brynn hart complied more vehicles were hissing past now drivers off late shifts or hurrying to early ones if anyone inside the cars or trucks saw the drama unfolding on the shoulder nobody was stopping graham get his glock and the other gun indicating the ostentatious silver sigsauer that comp had been carrying theres one weapon unaccounted for erics search him keith had taught her always to count weapons at scenes graham did and found the deputys service glock he put harts black gun and comps silver one on the grass beside brynn but he kept munces pistol he looked at it closely there are no safeties as such on glocks you just point and shoot graham knew this brynn had instructed him and joey about how to load and fire hers just in case he fired a shot into the ground presumably to make sure it was loaded and cocked graham he ignored his wife in a low threatening tone he asked hart whod i talk to when i called the dead one or you it was me hart said graham turned the square automatic on hart who gazed past the muzzle his gray eyes calm graham she whispered everythings going to be fine now help me honey i need some plastic hand restraints look in the glove compartment her husband continued to stare into harts eyes the gun pointed unwaveringly at his head the trigger poundage was very light a twitch was enough to release a round graham honeyplease there was desperation in her voice if he fired it would be murder please the big man took a deep breath he lowered the gun finally he said where the restraints graham please give me the gun where are they he snapped angrily he kept the pistol brynn noticed hart smiling at her she ignored it and answered her husband the glove compartment he stepped to the car i dont see any try the trunk theyll be in a plastic bag maybe a box but first call it in the radios on the dash just push the button say who you are say tenthirteen and then give the location the engine doesnt have to be on staring at hart graham picked up the microphone and made the call frantic responses came from a half dozen deputies and troopers but bless him he said only what was necessary location and the situation he dropped the mike on the seat and popped the trunk hart kept his eyes on michelle who stared back with pure hatred he smiled you came close michelle real close she said nothing then he turned to brynn and in a voice that only she could hear asked at the camper back there after you crashed the van he nodded at the vastness theyd just come through when i was out of it just lying there you saw me didnt you yes my piece was nearby did you see that too yes why didnt you go for it the little girl was going to fall i went after her instead one of those hard choices he nodded they do present themselves at the worst possible times dont they if they didnt then they wouldnt be hard choices would they he gave a faint laugh at this well say the girl hadnt been there would you have taken my piece and killed me shot me while i was out he cocked his head and said softly tell the truthno lies between us brynn no lies would you have killed me she hesitated you thought about it didnt you he smiled i thought about it you should have you shouldve killed me i wouldve itd been you and you and mewere peas in a pod brynn glanced at graham who couldnt hear the exchange there have to be a few differences between us hart but thats not one of em youre saying you would justve arrested me you forget i already had another smile both his mouth and his gray eyes a truck roared past an occasional car then graham called ive got them which was all hart needed as brynn glanced up he sprang to his feet he wasnt close enough to get to herbrynn had made sure of that but that wasnt his intent he jumped over the body of his partner and sprinted the twenty feet to the highway brynns shot missed him by an inch she couldnt fire again because of the oncoming cars not even looking hart sprinted into traffic an act of pure faith he could have been killed instantly he made it to the center lane froze then leapt aside as the driver of a toyota suv swerved in panic the vehicle rolled onto its left side and in a shower of sparks and a hideous screech skidded along the shoulder and right lane missing the women and the child by feet they dove to the ground pure instinct the suv jettisoned plastic and glass and metal bits and finally came to a rest the horn wailing and airbag dust rising from the empty window frames a dozen other cars and trucks skidded to a stop and before brynn could draw another target on hart hed run into the far lane leapt over the hood of a stopped sedan dragged out the drivera man in a suitand climbed in he sped onto the median and accelerated past the stopped cars then into the lane again brynn aimed munces revolver but had only a brief clear targetbetween two good samaritans climbing out of their vehiclesand she wouldnt risk injuring them she lowered the gun and ran to the highlander to help the occupants a witness to the carnage james jasons crouched in fragrant bushes a hundred yards down the highway from where the suv lay on its side sirens sounded in the distance he believed he saw graham boyd helping some of the injured the absence of the uniformed deputy munce might explain the gunshot hed heard earlier from deep within the forest the sirens grew closer as he dismantled his gun and put it in the canvas bag the traffic on this side of the highway was at a standstill on the other side the cars and trucks were still moving but slowly as voyeurs strained to see what had happened as if there was an explanation for these bizarre events one of the killers apparently lay deadhis body now covered by a tarpand the other had escaped but there seemed to be no other serious injuries jasons had been partially successful there was nothing to do but leave with his cap low over his eyes he walked through the stopped line of traffic and onto the median it took a bit more dancing but the gawkers let him through three lanes without his even having to run though once on the other side he moved quickly into the woods to make sure none of the law enforcers noticed him he sprinted to his lexus jasons started it up and eased out onto the shoulder then accelerated to the speed of trafficit was only about thirty miles an hourand merged he pulled the satellite phone from the bag which was now on the seat next to him and scrolled through speed dial he went past his partners name and then his mothers and pushed the third button on the list even though it was very early in the morning stanley mankewitz answered on the second ring no id brynn glanced up from the back step of the ambulance where she sat next to graham tom dahl was referring to comp the man shot and killed by hart his partner of all the horrors that night perhaps the worst was the look of betrayal in the young mans face just before hart pulled the trigger we got money a couple boxes of ammo cigarettes gloves seiko watch thats it theyd recovered michelles purse too which might contain the mens fingerprints dahl would send officers to find comps shotgun in the brambles and eric munces which graham explained was in the river brynns husband had told the story of how hed tried to retrieve it but had fallen in the process hed landed on a shelf of rock bruised and scraped but otherwise unhurt hed then climbed up the cliff face and was walking back past eric munces body when he recalled that the man was wearing an ankle holster with a backup revolver in it hed taken the gun and hurried toward where hed heard the gunshot what was his name the sheriff asked looking at the mans body covered by a green tarp and lying nearby comp brynn said something like that a medical technician had daubed brynns cheek with brown betadine and lanocaine and was now easing a massive bandage onto it he was going to stitch it she said no a needle and thread would make a bigger scar and the thought of two facial deformities was too much for her he put a tight butterfly bandage on and told her to see a doctor later that day dentist too that busted toothll start to bother your tongue pretty soon start to she told him she would brynn was staring at comps body she simply couldnt understand why hart had killed him this was the man hart had risked his own life to save just a half hour earlier on the ledgenearly getting crushed by a log in fact to pull the man to safety and hart had told him to stand still then shot himcasual as could be she looked around the circus of flashing lights heard voices shouting the crackle of radios in addition to dahl there were other deputies from the kennesha county sheriffs department and a bakers dozen of state troopers two fbi agents too whod tossed off their suit jackets were helping out however they could including stringing crime scene tape no egos were present theyd show up later head down michelle sat on the grass her back against a tree cradling sleeping amy both wrapped in blankets the medics had looked them over and neither was badly injured michelles ankle turned out to be just a pulled muscle somber michelle clutched the girl tightly and brynn supposed she was mourning for them bothtwo people who had lost someone close to them so violently on this terrible night two people who had left an innocence behind dead or dying in the tangled woods brynn rose from the ambulance and stiffly walked over the grass to michelle did you get through to them brynn asked michelle was going to call her brother and his wife who lived north of chicago to come pick her up theyre on their way then her voice faded and she gave a stoic smile never got a message from my husband did you call him she shook her head and her body language said she wanted to be alone she brushed amys hair gently the child was snoring softly brynn tested her wounded face wincing despite the topical anesthetic cream then joined dahl and the fbi agents she fought through her fuzzy mindonce the pursuit had stopped disorientation had flooded into the vacuum with a smackand gave them a synopsis of everything that had happened from her arrival at lake mondac the escape the portable meth lab the surprise gunshots fired at them when they were on the rock ledge one of rudy hamiltons people an fbi agent said hearing brynns opinion as to the identity of the sniper by the ledge i dont know he seemed doubtful rudy said somebody named fletcher might be in the area the agent nodded kevin fletcher sure meth and crack bigwig but no evidence he operates around here he sticks close to green bay makes ten times as much up there no im still betting the shooter was some muscle mankewitz sent drove down here to protect his hit men im guessing the other said of course they were eager to pin anything on mankewitz short of the kennedy assassination still brynn didnt disagree it would make sense and the shooter had saved hart and comp from crushed skulls or a fall into the barbwire thorns you get a look at him nope dont even know where he was the agent looked out over the woods thats not going to be an easy crime scene and then they all grew silent as a recovery team carried eric munces body from the woods the bag was dark green the men started to set it near the body of the other killer but hesitated and out of respect set it farther away on the grass not the shoulder ive seen those bags a dozen times brynn said softly to dahl but never with one of ours inside the driver of the suv and his girlfriend were sitting dazed on the ground near the ambulance their seat belts had kept them from any damage other than bruising the man whod been pulled from his car by hart was uninjured but his fear or ego kept prompting him to mutter about lawsuits until somebody suggested he could sell his story to people or us it was meant sarcastically to shut him up but he seemed to like the idea and he did shut up brynn walked up to her husband and he put his arm around her she asked dahl erics wife a sigh im going by there now in person no calls graham looked at the body bag containing the deputy well he said as if it hurt to take enough breath to speak brynn rested her head against his shoulder she was still astonished that hed driven all this way to try to find her dahl wasnt happy that he and munce had tried an end run particularly as it had resulted in the deputys death still if they hadnt brynn michelle and amy would be dead now and they wouldnt have stopped at least one of the killers and collected good evidence that might lead to hart and ultimately the man who had hired them deputies pete gibbs and big howie prescott breathing hard came out of the forest with several state troopers they were carrying clear plastic bags inside were shell casings and an empty ammunition clip they placed comps personal effects into another bag michelles purse and harts map went into others brynn looked over the evidence thinking hart who the hell are you tom did cs do a prelim dusting at the lake mondac house sure found about five hundred prints mostly the feldmans none of the others set off alarms the stolen ford had about sixty and they were negative too those boys wore gloves the whole time smartern our criminals round here what about the spent brass and shells found a ton of it yours theirs went over the whole place with a metal detector even fished some out of that creek beside the garage but no prints on a single shell none brynn asked dismayed they wore gloves loading their weapons looks like it yep smarter than our criminals then she jabbed a finger at one of the evidence bags tom thiss our chance maybe therere no prints on the brasshartd expect to leave that but hes taken his weapon apart to clean and load it theres a print on one of those clips i guarantee it and the map and they were carting around michelles purse they mustve opened it im taking the evidence up there myselfto the lab in gardener you dahl scoffed dont be nuts brynn the state folk can handle that get some rest ill get some sleep in the car on the way home grab a shower and head over there dahl nodded at the troopers half these boysre stationed in gardener theyll drop everything off at the lab she whispered and everythingll sit gathering dust for two weeks i want that guy a nod up the highway where peering over the ribbed pistol barrel shed last seen hart in the jacked car speeding away im going to stand over the tech like a school teacher till i get some names from aifis i want that man bad dahl looked at her grim determined expression all right brynn locked the bags in the glove compartment of grahams truck which hed collected a quarter mile down the road she noticed ripe green azaleas in the back bed they were just starting to bud pink and white she leaned her head against her husbands shoulder again oh honey what a night he looked up you came you came to find me i did yes he gave her a distracted smile he was clearly shakenwho wouldnt behaving seen and experienced what he had tonight lets get home i called anna but theyll want to see you joey didnt take this whole thing too well he was going to say something else she sensed but didnt then another state police car pulled up and a trooper and a short woman in a suit latina climbed out she was from child protective services brynn joined them introduced herself and explained what had happened the trooper who was solid squarejawed and looked like an exsoldier registered some shock at the news the social worker her face calm and observant apparently had heard it all before she nodded matteroffactly and jotted some notes my office has lined up an emergency foster couple theyre good people i know them well well stop by the doctor get her checked out and ill take her over there now brynn whispered can you imagine meth cookers for parents and they had her helping them and look at her neck shed noticed sausage red marks from where her mother or gandyor maybe that disgusting rudyhad grabbed amy by her throat a threat or punishment they didnt seem serious but brynn still shivered with anger and for a troubling moment felt a dark satisfaction that hart had killed them they joined michelle whose face was as pale as the cloudy dawn sky overhead she was clutching amy possessively the girl was now awake the social worker nodded at michelle and then crouched down hi amy im consuela you can call me connie if you want the girl blinked were going to take you for a ride to see some nice people wheres mommy these are some very nice people youll like them i dont like mommys friends no theyre not friends of hers wheres chester well get chester for you brynn said thats a promise the social worker put her arm around amy and helped her to her feet then wrapped the blanket tighter around the girl lets go for a ride the girl gazed absently at michelle and nodded the young woman watched her go with such a look of affection that one might have thought she was the girls mother there was silence for a moment i know all youve been through but i have something else to ask michelle glanced at her itll be a couple of hours before your brother gets here i guess i know this is hard i know you dont want to but will you come back to my house for a little while were not too far away i can get you a change of clothes something to eat and drink brynn graham said he was shaking his head no she glanced his way but continued speaking to the young woman i need you to tell me everything you can remember about hart anything he mentioned or any mannerisms or anything emma mightve said about her case while its fresh in your mind absolutely she needs rest graham said nodding at michelle she has to wait somewhere no its okay really michelle said to graham i dont want him to hurt anybody else im not sure what i can do but ill help her voice was firm the medical examiners van headed off the two bodies in the back brynn noted that it was her husband who seemed the most upset of any of them as they watched the departure of the boxy vehicle sickly yellowgreen the sky was now light the color of diluted egg yolk and the traffic was thicker easing through the one open lane gawkers taking in the overturned suv the dark puddles on the highway brynn explained to tom dahl about interviewing michelle she can wait at my house until her brother arrives annall look after her while im at the state lab the sheriff nodded then said and well need to talk to you graham about what happened with eric can you come down to the station graham looked at his watch i should get joey to his english tutor brynn said he can stay home today well both be too busy i think he should go not today brynn said graham shrugged then turned to the sheriff and said that hed call the station and arrange a time dahl then extended his hand to her she blinked at the solemn gesture she took it awkwardly i owe you more than a half day brynn a lot more sure she took michelles arm and they followed graham to his truck mom like where were you shit what happened to your face just an accident watch your language my god anna cried its all right its not all right its all black and blue and yellow and i cant even see whats under the bandage brynn recalled that shed have to make an appointment for a new molar she touched the gap with her tongue the pain had vanished her mouth just felt weird what happened mom joey was wideeyed i fell brynn hugged her son tripped you know how clumsy i am her mother eyed the bandage and said no more michelle walked into the living room the tape on her ankleand the painkillershad done the trick she was no longer limping mom this is michelle brynn said hello dear the young woman nodded politely joey you go upstairs ill call your tutor graham and ill be busy today youre staying home graham said really i can drop him off please honey itll be better you two are a mess anna announced what happened brynn glanced at the tv off at the moment her mother would find out soon enough but she was glad the local news wasnt on ill tell you in a bit joey youve had breakfast yeah upstairs work on your history project all right the boy trooped off with a glance back at michelle graham went into the kitchen in her deputy voice her calm voice brynn said mom michelles friends were killed that was the case i was on tonight oh no shocked anna stepped close and took michelles hand im so sorry dear thank you her brothers on his way shell be here for a little while until he gets here you come over here and sit down anna indicated the green couch in the family room where graham and brynn sat together in the evenings if tv was on the agenda it was perpendicular to annas rocker michelle said id really like to take a shower if i could of course theres a bathroom down that hall there brynn pointed ill bring you some clothes unless youd rather not thinking of the womans earlier aversion to wearing emma feldmans boots michelle was smiling id love some thanks anything youve got ill hang them on the door brynn said thinking that at last shed have a use for her skinnygirl jeans which she hadnt worn in two years but hadnt quite been able to throw out anna said therere bath towels in the closet ive got coffee do you want tea ill make you some food thanks if its not too much trouble brynn noted that the womans last complaint about her blood sugar had been eons ago anna led her to the bathroom and returned ill give you the details later mom they tried to kill her too she found the bodies no annas hand went to her mouth nowhats the poor thing going to do should i call reverend jack he could be here in ten minutes lets ask her might be a good idea but i dont know shes had so much coming at her and one of our deputies was killed no who eric that cute boy with the brunet wife brynn sighed she nodded with the brunet wife and a young baby did you get shot anna asked abruptly collateral injury like a ricochet but you were shot she nodded what on earth happened brynns calm broke like pond ice cracking some really bad things mom anna hugged her and brynn felt her frail body shaking as was her own im sorry honey im sorry but everythings going to be fine now her mother stepped away turning quickly wiping her eyes ill get breakfast going for you too you need something a smile thanks mom brynn watched her go and then called into the kitchen wheres graham was here i dont know out back i guess water began to flow in the front bathroom the pipes squealed brynn went upstairs to get some clothes for michelle in the bedroom she looked at her matted hair the cuts and bruises the white bandage with its aureole of yellow and purple she replayed comps horrific death the look on his face as he gazed at hart revealing pure betrayal then the image of harts face looking back at her as he sped away in the stolen sedan the image frozen over the bead sight of the pistol she held firmly you shouldve killed me she wanted a shower badly but shed get clothes for michelle first shed interview the young woman then call tom dahl and the state police and fbi with any new information about emma feldman or hart or his partner that michelle could recallsomething that might lead to mankewitz then shed speed up to gardener and bully the evidence through the crime lab brynn found a tshirt sweats the jeans socks and a pair of running shoes shed get a garbage bag for michelle to put her dirty clothes in she supposed the designer items would have to be dry cleaned she whiffed smelled her own sweat powerful smelled rusty blood too mixed with the perfume of antiseptic in the kitchen the tea kettle started whistling then stopped listening to the whining pipes in the firstfloor bathroom brynn rested her forehead against the cool glass of the window looking out at grahams truck she was thinking of the evidence in the glove compartment wondering how long it would take to get answers from the state police lab in gardener fingerprints could be done quickly now thanks to the fbis integrated identification system ballistics would take longer but wisconsin had a good database that might be able to trace one of the slugs in harts or comps pistols to prior crimes which might in turn lead to a full identificationor at least to somebody who could be pressured to dime hart out not a single print on the brassshe sighed shaking her head a thought occurred to her brynn sat down on the edge of the bed absently poked her tummy as she often did and called tom dahl how you doing he asked exhausted betcha not yet waiting for it to hit got a question sure thing about the scene at lake mondac go ahead you said arlens crime scene folks searched the house with a metal detector and all they recovered was brass right yep fancy thing not like what the tourists use looking for arrowheads and no firearms just brass and spent shells you said they searched the streams yep found some brass there too it was everywhere place was a turkey shoot as i well know now michelle said she picked up one of their guns she shot hart with it and then the tires she used up all the ammo and threw it in the stream wonder why nobody found it maybe it was one of those other creeks id love to get my hands on it and i dont like the idea of unaccountedfor firearms anybody over at the house still pete gibbss there and arlen has a couple of his boys might be somebody from crime scene too thanks tom wish youd get some rest all in good time she hung up and pulled on sweats then called gibbs at the feldman house pete its me oh hey brynn how you doing ugh i hear that she asked if any crime scene people were still there yep a couple of em do me a favor see if anybodys recovered any pistols sure hold on after a moment he came back on the line and reported that all theyd found were a few more shell casings thatd been missed last night no weapons she sighed again thanks how you doing he sounded shaken she assumed it was munces death but there was another source kind of an unpleasant thing happened he said ruefully i had to break the news to one of the feldmans friends she hadnt heard man i hate doing that she broke down went totally bonkers a friend yeah took her nearly a hour to calm down though she was one lucky lady ill tell you she was supposed to come up last night but something happened at work she couldnt get on the road till this morning imagine if that hadnt happened whered she drive up from chicago you get her number no didnt think to should i have ill call you back brynn sat back on the bed considering this a second houseguest was coming to visit last night another woman and also from chicago wasnt impossible but wouldnt michelle have mentioned her and why wouldnt the two women drive up here together an absurd thought began unraveling embarrassingly absurd yet brynn couldnt quite dismiss it all right shed been assuming all night that michelle was the feldmans houseguest but when she considered the question now she realized that she had no evidence that she actually was in fact brynn thought what if she was a stranger who wanted to pretend she knew them i gave her all the information shed need to play the role are you their friend from chicago i asked her whats your name which told her i didnt know anything about her did you practice law with emma im an actress but no this was crazy what would her motive be for lying brynn gasped as another thought occurred to her answering that question with horrifying clarity on the interstateat the snake river bridgeshed recovered handguns from the men harts glock and comps sigsauer with the weapon that michelle claimed to have found that meant the two men had brought three semiauto pistols and a shotgun even for professional hit men that seemed excessive and why had crime scene found all that brass with the metal detector but not the missing pistol my lord what if the gun wasnt harts or comps but michelles but why would she bring a gun with her one answer because shed been hired by stanley mankewitz to kill emma feldman and had brought along hart and comp intending to kill them at the scene and leave their bodies behind the fall guys then brynn recalled michelle reaching into her jacket at the interstate she wasnt reaching for the knife she was going for the gun shed been carrying with her all night which meant she still had it on the first floor the pipes stopped squealing as michelle shut off the water with a grimace toward the empty gun lockbox brynn ran into the hallway and stepped into joeys room and took him by the shoulders mom whats wrong his eyes were wide listen to me honey we have a problem you know how i tell you never to lock your door uhhuh well todays different i want you to lock your door and not open it for any reason unless its me or your stepdad or grams mom you look funny im scared itll be okay just do what i tell you sure what just do it brynn closed the door she ran down the stairs as quietly as she could intending to get to the only guns nearby the ones in grahams truck sealed in evidence bags on the secondtothebottom step brynn stopped the bathroom door was open no sign of michelle go for the truck or not teall be ready in just a moment anna called brynn stepped into the groundfloor hall just as michelle walked through an archway four feet away in her hand was a small black automatic pistol it was known as a baby glock their eyes met as the killer spun toward her brynn snagged a picture off the wall a large family photo and flung it at her it missed but as she dodged brynn launched herself forward the women collided hard both grunting brynn fiercely gripped michelles right wrist digging her short nails into the womans skin as hard as she could michelle cried out striking brynns head with her free hand the gun discharged once then as michelle lowered it toward the deputys body it fired three times more all the slugs missed anna screamed and called for graham brynn slammed a fist into michelles face she blinked in pain and spit flew eyebrows narrowed her mouth a taut grimace michelle kicked brynns groin and elbowed her in the belly but brynn wasnt letting go of the gun nothing could make her do that the anger of the terrible evening fueled by this betrayaland her own gullibilityburned within her she flailed and kicked and growled the way she had when the wolf approached them in the woods the women grappled knocking over furniture michelle fought furiouslyno longer the helpless dilettante in the thousanddollar boots she was crazed fighting for survival the gun fired again then several times more brynn was counting the rounds baby glocks held ten bullets another sharp crackand the weapon was empty the slide locking back automatically awaiting a fresh clip of ammunition the women went down on the floor brynn pounding the womans head aiming for her throat michelle fought back just as fiercely thoughmuscles toned at a health club if that story was true and backed by pure desperation still there was no doubt in brynns mind that she was going to stop this woman kill her if she had to no doubt whatsoever using hands and teeth and feete she was pure rage pure animal you shouldve killed me well this time i wont make the same mistake her fingers found michelles throat jesus brynn a man ran through the door and for a tiny portion of a second brynn thought it was hart but by the time she realized it was her husband the distraction had had its effect michelle broke free and slammed the gun into brynns wounded cheek the pain was so intense her vision clouded and she retched michelle hit the lock on the gun and the receiver snapped shut though the gun was empty it appeared loaded and ready to fire she aimed at graham keys to your truck what are you what emmy emmy brynn muttered clutching her face clawing futilely at michelle ill kill her shoving the gun into brynns neck the fucking keys no no here take them please just leave emmy michelle grabbed the keys and ran outside graham dropped to his knees pulling his cell phone out and dialed he cradled brynn who pulled away and climbed to her feet she started to black out swayed against the stair rail emmy whos emmy she forced herself to speak clearly through the pain empty the gun was empty shit graham ran to the door as his truck skidded down the street and vanished brynn rose then heard a soft voice from nearby could somebody both brynn and graham turned toward the kitchen door where anna stood her hands covered with blood please could somebodylook look at this and she spiraled to the floor rows of orange plastic chairs in the corner of the brightly lit room walls and tiles scuffed graham sat across from brynn knees close but not touching their eyes were focused mostly on the linoleum and they looked up only from time to time when the double doors swung open but the doctors and employees pushing through them were dealing with matters unrelated to anna mckenzies life twining her fingers together brynn stared at her untouched coffee sick with horror sick with exhaustion her phone quivered she looked at the screen and muted the ringer because she didnt want to take the call not because of the no cell phone use sign nearby a patient walked from the admitting window into the waiting area sat down squeezed his arm and winced he glanced once at brynn and returned to his waiting state of numb silence been an hour graham said nearly long time but thats not necessarily bad no silence again broken by cryptic announcements over the hospital pa then brynns phone was vibrating again this call she took tom brynn hows your mother we dont know yet what do you have okay michelle got through the roadblocks somehow they havent found your husbands truck brynn hunched forward and pressed her injured cheek as if the pain were payment for her misjudgment dahl continued you were right we found that friend who drove up from chicago this morning she was the only one coming to visit michelle we guess is a hit man well hit woman hired by mankewitz or one of his people what theyre figuring dahl said so hart and comp were supposed to be the bodies left behind the what the bodies left behind she was going to make it look like they were the only killers and they got into a fight between themselves after the feldmans were dead so we wouldnt bother to look further but it went bad hart reacted too fast or her gun jammed who knows she had to run then i found her in the woods brynn pinched the bridge of her nose her laugh was bitter and rescued her another doctor came out through the double doors brynn stopped talking the physician wearing blue scrubs kept going brynn was reflecting on the look that passed between hart and the young woman at the interstate you came close michelle real close harts words to her by the highway had a whole different meaning now that brynn knew the truth and she recalled michelles shocked reaction when brynn told her about meeting hart in the van beside the meth cookers camper the woman would have been terrified that hart had mentioned michelles real identity and somebody from mankewitzs crew was probably going to come pick her up when it was over hell thats who was taking shots at us when we were on that cliff brynn was aware that graham was staring at her taking in the conversation she continued to the sheriff she needed the evidence id brought with methe guns and clips the map the boxes of ammunition her purse thats why she was so willing to come back with us to our house something probably had her prints on them or trace evidence that might lead us to her shed planned to collect it at lake mondac after shed killed hart and his friend wait tom what about her shoes a pair of womens shoes at the feldmans house in the yard any prints recovered them but no prints none looks like they were wiped off like the ford wiped off with windex a faint laugh she did that when i went for the canoe brother did she have me fooled brynn rubbed a knuckle against a faint bump on her rebuilt jaw as she often did when thoughtful or upset the betrayal stung her deeply and she said in a soft voice i was supposed to be one too what a body left behind she was using me as bait she didnt have a sprained ankle at all she was moving slow to draw the men close and she tried to keep them following in our direction all night she broke the mercedes window to set off the alarmprobably as the men were heading toward the highway and complained about putting on those boots made a big deal of it she was stalling trying to get them closer to us and who knows what else she had some crackers ill bet she dropped those brynn laughed sourly shaking her head once she had this outburst screamed like a banshee it was to let them know where we were she was waiting for them to catch up then shed shoot them in the woods me too well brynn why didnt she you know just shoot you right up front dahl asked she needed me for insurance maybe or to help her get out of the area most likely use me to help her kill them aware that graham had fallen silent his jaw set large hands clasped together brynn told tom shed better go and asked him to call her if they found anything at all they disconnected and she turned to her husband to give him a summary of what had happened he closed his eyes and rocked back thats okay he said cutting her off i got enough she touched his leg he didnt respond after a few minutes she lifted her fingers away and called the neighbor where joey was staying she talked to her son for some moments telling him the truththat they didnt know anything yet about his grandmother she let him ramble on about a video game hed been playing brynn told him she loved him and hung up husband and wife sat in silence brynn looked at her husband once then shifted her gaze down at the floor finally after an eternity he rested his hand on her knee they remained that way motionless for some minutesuntil a doctor came out of the double door he looked at the man with the hurt arm and then walked directly toward brynn and graham hart got rid of the car hed hijacked on the interstate he did this as efficiently as he knew how he parked it in the avenues west area of milwaukee with the doors locked but the keys in the ignition some kids wouldnt notice and some would notice but think it was a sting and somein the quickly redeveloping areawould notice but would do the right thing and pass the car by the car however would still be gone within one hour and harvested for parts in twelve head down exhausted and in agony from the gunshot and the other trauma of the night hart walked quickly away from the vehicle it was a cool morning the sky clear the smell of fires from construction site scrap teased his nose his instincts were still running the show and were directing him underground as fast as possible walking along the sparsely populated streets he found the brewline hotel though it was nowhere near the brewline it was the sort of place that thrived on business by the hour or by the week but rarely by the day he paid for one week in advance with a bonus for a private bath and was given a remote control and a set of sheets the overweight woman clerk took no notice of his physical condition or absence of luggage he trooped up the two flights of stairs and into room he locked the door stripped and dumped his fetid clothes into a pile that reminded him very much of brynn mckenzies soaked uniform at the second house on lake view drive he pictured her stripping the image aroused him for a few minutes until the throbbing in his arm tipped him out of the mood he examined the wound closely hart had taken paramedic training coursesbecause his job often involved physical injuries he now assessed the wound and concluded that he didnt need a doctor he knew several medicos whod lost their tickets and would stitch him up no questions asked or gunshots reported for a thousand bucks but the bleeding had stopped the bone was intact and though his bruise was impressive the infection was minor hed start on antibiotics later today hart showered under a stuttering stream of water doing his best to keep his arm dry he returned to the bed naked and lay down he wanted to consider the night to try to make sense of it he thought back several weeksto a starbucks in kenosha where he was meeting with a guy hed worked with a few times in wisconsin gordon potts was a big hulking man not brilliant but decent and someone you could trust and he could hook you up with dependable labor when you needed it potts had said hed been approached by a woman in milwaukee who was smart tough and pretty he vouched for her hart now realized that michelle had bought the credentials with a blow job or two hart was interested he was between jobs and bored there was a deal going down in chicago but that wasnt until midmay he wanted something now needed some action adrenaline the same way that the tweaker hart had killed in the state park last night needed to slam meth besides the job was a lark potts told him a few days later potts had hooked him up with brendathe fake name michelle had offeredin a coffee shop in the broadway district of green bay she said so hart how you doing she shook his hand firmly good you im okay listen im interested in hiring somebody you interested in some work i dont know maybe so how do you know gordon potts you go back a long ways not so long howd you meet him a mutual friend whod that be freddy lancaster freddy sure hows his wife doing michelle had laughed thatd be tough to find out hart she died two years ago and hart had laughed too oh thats right bad memory how does freddy like st paul st paul he lives in milwaukee this memory of mine the dance after his first meeting with brendamichelle hart had made phone calls to both gordon potts and freddy lancaster to verify times dates and places down to the tenth decimal a dozen other calls too after which he was confident that nobody was working for the law brenda jennings was a petty thief with no history of informing on her partnersand was also hart now knew an identity michelle had stolen so he arranged another meeting to discuss the job itself michelle had explained shed heard that steven feldman had been making inquiries about swapping old bills silver certificates for newer federal reserve notes shed looked into the situation and learned about some meatpacking executive whod hidden cash in his summer home in the s a million bucks she gave hart the details thats a lot of money yeah it is hart so youre interested keep going heres a map of the area thats a private road lake view drive and there thats a state park all of it hardly any people around heres a diagram of the house okaythis a dirt road or paved dirthart they tell me youre good are you good i hear youre a craftsman thats what they say as hed studied the map hed asked absently whos they people well yeah im a craftsman hart had been aware of her studying him closely he looked back into her eyes she said can i ask you a question a lifted eyebrow yeah im curious whyre you in this line of work it suits me hart was somebody who didnt believe in psychoanalysis or spending too much time contemplating your soul he believed you felt in harmony or you didnt and if you bucked that feeling you were making a big mistake god doesnt the boredom just kill them it would me i need more brynn dont you michelle had nodded as if she understood exactly what he meant and had been hoping for just that answer she said it looks like it does he got tired of talking about himself okay whats the threat situation the what how riskys the job going to be how many people up there weapons police nearby its a lake houseare the other houses on lake view occupied itll be a piece of cake hart hardly any risk at all the other placesll be vacant and only the two of them up there the feldmans and no rangers in the park or cops around for miles they have weapons are you kidding theyre city people shes a lawyer hes a social worker just the feldmans nobody else itll make a big difference thats my information and its solid just the two of them and nobody gets hurt absolutely not she had said i wouldnt do this if there was a chance anybodyd get hurt brendamichelle had smiled reassuringly lots of money nobody hurt sounded good still hed said ill get back to you hart had driven home and researched what shed told him sitting at his computer hed laughed out loud sure enough it was all true and he was confident that no cops in the world would come up with a sting like this they offered drugs perped merchandise funny money but they didnt suggest a caper out of a nicholas cage movie then came the big day theyd driven up to lake mondac in the stolen ford together he compton lewis and michelle the two men had broken in and while they held the feldmans at gunpoint michelle was supposed to come into the kitchen tape up their hands and start interrogating them about the money instead of the duct tape though she was carrying a mm subcompact glock shed walked past hart and shot the couple pointblank in the ringing silence that followed she turned around and walked into the living room like nothing had happened hart had stared at her trying to figure it out the fuck did you do gasped lewis whod been poking around in the fridge for food rather than where he shouldve beenwatching the front of the house dont worry i know what im doing shed started going through the briefcase and backpack the men had been staring in shock at the bodies whiletheyd assumedshe was looking for a key to a secret room or lockbox or something hart himself had been frantically tallying up the offenses theyd just bought into felony murder being number one then he saw her reflectionshe was coming up behind him lifting the gun he leapt sideways instinctively crack the tug on his arm then returning fire as she escaped lying in the spongy bed now hart knew exactly what had happened there was no hidden treasure michelle had been hired to kill the feldmansbrynn had suggested as much as theyd sat in the van beside the meth cookers camper her plan was to leave hart and lewis in the feldmans house the fall guys and hart couldnt help but laugh now hed hired compton lewis for exactly the same reason michelle had hired hart an insurance policy a fall guy in case the robbery went bad and people ended up dead hart had been going to kill lewis and set him up to look like the sole perp that was why hed gotten a loser hed had no previous connection with that scenario had nearly played out on the interstate with michelle brynn and the little girl togetherand hart had the squad car to escape byit was time to conclude the evening he killed lewis and was about to kill the others with the sig when who shows up but brynns husband i was thinking with my contacts guys in my crew and your you know the way you plan things and think wed be a good team oh you sad bastard hart thought you really did believe that didnt you and here you were percent dead from the first time we sat down together you tugging your green earring and scoffing about why were we in a faggot place like this that only sold coffee and not a real bar with sleep closing in he pictured michelle of all the people hed worked with and fordangerous jamaican drug lords south side gangstas and oc bosses throughout the midwestthe petite young redhead was the most deadly the cloak of sweet the cloak of helpless the cloak of harmlesshiding a scorpion he speculated about the two women together last night what on earth had they talked about brynn mckenzie was not a woman easily fooled and yet michelle had been the consummate actress he thought of those surreal moments in the van with brynn so michelle was a friend of the family is that how she got mixed up in this whole thing wrong time and wrong place you might say a lot of that going around tonight the trickster in the feldmans house hed glanced quickly at a credit card in her purse and gotten her name michelle s kepler he believed maybe michelle a thered probably been a drivers license but he hadnt bothered to look for it then hed have to find herbefore the police did of course shed give him up in a minute oh he had some work to do in the next few days but then like compton lewis michelle faded from his thoughts and he fell asleep with only one image in his mind the calm confident eyes of deputy brynn mckenzie sitting beside him in the front seat of the van you have the right to remain silent they returned from the hospital at pm brynn and graham picked up joey from the neighbors house and they drove home brynn got out of the car first and went up to the deputy jimmy barnes the one whose birthday was today the balding ruddyfaced man was parked on the shoulder in front of their house all grim and quietthe way everybody was in the kennesha county sheriffs department because of munce in fact the way a lot of people throughout the town of humboldt were nobodys come by brynn he waved to graham made the rounds a few times thanks she suspected that michelle whoever she was would be long gone but the woman seemed frighteningly obsessed and she reflected hart too knew her last name crime scenes got what they need i locked up after they say anything nope you know the state boys itd be against the laws of nature for the brass and the slugs from lake mondac not to match those collected in her house barnes asked wasnt her friends she was making all that up thats right and your mom heard shell be okay shell live whered she get hit the leg hospital another day or two therapy sorry about that brynn shrugged lot of people dont make it round to see therapy lucky if your daughter bringing an armed killer into your house is luck then i guess night now somebodyll make the rounds off and on thanks jimmy ill see you tomorrow youll be in yep you have a package for me oh yeah barnes reached into the back and handed her a heavy paper bag she looked inside at a wellworn department glock and two extra clips along with a box of winchester mm hollow points he then lifted a clipboard she signed for the weapon you got a clip loaded thirteen none in the bedroom thanks get some rest brynn night and happy birthday as he drove off she checked the clip anyway and chambered a round the family walked inside the house upstairs she put the gun in the lockbox and returned to the kitchen joey had eaten pizza at the neighbors he walked around staring at the bullet holes in the walls until brynn told him not to brynn took a long shower the water hot as she could stand and tied her hair back after toweldrying it didnt want the noise of the dryer she changed the bandage on her face threw on sweats and went downstairs where graham was heating up spaghetti from last night she wasnt hungry but felt shed abused her system enough in the past twentyfour hours and was expecting it to go on strike if she didnt start to pamper soon they went into the dining room and ate for a while in silence she sat back looked at the label on her beer she wondered what exactly hops were then she asked graham what is it hmm there was something you wanted to say at the hospital dont remember you sure i think you might maybe something but not now its late i think now is good she was chiding but serious too joey came downstairs and was channel surfing in the family room sitting on the green couch graham stuck his head in the door joey go upstairs and read no tv just ten min brynn started to speak graham continued into the family room he said something that brynn couldnt hear the tv shut off and she caught a glimpse of her sullen son climbing the stairs what was that about her husband sat down at the table come on graham they rarely used each others name what is it tell me her husband sat forward and she saw he was lost in debate eventually he said do you know how joey hurt himself yesterday the skateboard at school it wasnt at school and it wasnt just three steps in the parking lot he was phalting you know what that is i know phalting sure but joey wouldnt do that why why do you say that you dont have any idea she blinked he was phalting he was doing close to forty or fifty on the back of a truck down elden street the highway yes and hed been doing it all day impossible why do you say that a teacher saw him his section teacher called mr raditzky joey skipped school and he forged your name to a note with yesterdays horror less immediate this news was shocking forged went in in the morning left and never came back was this true she looked at the ceiling a black dot of a bullet hole was in the corner small as a fly the slug had come all the way through here i had no idea ill talk to him i tried he wouldnt listen he gets that way in a harsh voice graham said but he cant get that way thats not an excuse he kept lying to me and i told him no skateboarding for a month are you sure her initial reaction was to defend her son to question mr raditzkys credibility to ask who the witness was to crossexamine she fell silent graham was tense shoulders forward more was coming but fair enough shed asked for this and the fight brynn last year you told me it was a pushing match mr raditzky told me what really happened he was a bully he was just taunting joey talking to him is all but joey hurt him bad we almost got sued you never told me that she fell silent then said i didnt want word to get around i pulled some strings it wasnt all on the upandup but i had to do it i wanted to protect him hes not going to break brynn you spoil him his bedroom looks like a best buy i pay for everything i bought him myself she instantly regretted the barbed words seeing the grimace on grahams face this had nothing to do with money of course i dont think its good for him all that indulgence you dont have to be mean but have to say no sometimes and punish him if he doesnt listen to you i do no you dont its like you owe him like youre guilty about something and paying back this debt whats it all about brynn youre making it into something more than it is way more she gave a faint laugh though she felt her heart chillthe way her skin had when the cold black water rushed into her car at lake mondac his fight at schoolit was just something between joey and me oh brynn thats the problem see thats what this is all about its never been us its always you and joey im along for the ride thats not true isnt it whats this all about he waved his hand around the house is it about us the three of us a family or is it about you you and your son its about us graham really she tried holding his eye but couldnt no lies between us brynn but that was hart and it was keith graham was different this is so wrong she thought being honest with bad men while the good ones get lied to and neglected he stretched she noticed that both their beers were exactly threequarters full he said forget it lets go to bed we need sleep she asked when when what are you leaving brynn this is enough for tonight a laugh we never talk not about anything serious and now we cant stop tonight of all nights were exhausted lets just get some rest when she repeated he rubbed his eyes first one then both he lowered his hands looked at a deep scratch inflicted at some point last night in the woods a tear in the skin from a thorn or rock he seemed surprised he said i dont know a month a week i dont know she sighed ive seen it coming he looked perplexed seen it coming how i didnt know it till last night what did he mean by that she asked who is she she you know who that woman youre seeing im not seeing anybody he sounded put out as if shed delivered a cheap insult she debated but kept to the course she said harshly jjs poker games sometimes you go sometimes you dont youve been spying on me you lied to me i could tell i do this for a living remember hes no good at deception unlike me anger now but more troubling he sounded disgusted whatd you do put a bug in the car have somebody from the department tail me i saw you once by coincidence outside the motel on albemarle and yeah i followed you later you said you were going to the game but you went there again she snapped why are you laughing it broke my heart graham to break somebodys heart you need to own a bit of it and i dont i dont have an ounce of yours i dont think i ever did thats not true theres no excuse for cheating he was nodding slowly cheating ahdid you ask me about it did you sit down and say honey we have a problem im concerned lets talk about it get it worked out i you know your mother told me about what keith did to your face you know my first reaction oh my god that explains so much how could i be mad at you but then i realized that hell yes i could be mad i should be mad and you should have told me i deserved to be told brynn had considered telling him a hundred times yet shed made up a bullshit story about a car crash she thought now but how could i tell him that somebody flew into a rage and hit me that i cried off and on for months afterward that i cringed at the sound of his voice that i broke into a hundred pieces like a child i was ashamed that i didnt leave him just bundle joey up and walk out the door that i was afraid that i was weak and that my delaying would have even more horrific consequences keith but even now she couldnt tell him exactly what had happened and here she understood was a clue to the crime shed committed against graham against the two of them her silence this inability to talk yet she felt that whatever the clue led to even if she managed to figure it out the solution would come too late it was like finding conclusive evidence as to a killers identity only to discover that the perp had already died of natural causes im sorry she said but you still her voice faded as she watched him pulling his wallet from his slacks fishing in it she watched obsessively touching the bandage on her cheek jesus was it his lovers picture she wondered he handed her a small white card brynn squinted the cheek wound made reading difficult out of her right her stronger eye she stared at the raised type sandra weinstein md llc albemarle avenue ste humboldt wisconsin handwritten at the bottom was friday april brynn began shes a therapist psychiatristshrink you you saw us near the motel brynn but not at the motel shes in the professional building next door im usually her last patient at night sometimes we leave the office at the same time thats probably when you saw us brynn flicked the card call her go see her ill give her permission to tell you all about it please go talk to her help me figure out why you love the job more than me why youd rather be in your squad car than at home help me figure out how to be a father to a son you wont let me near why you got married to me in the first place maybe you two can figure it out i sure cant brynn offered lamely but why didnt you tell me ask me to go with you to counseling i would have she meant this he lowered his head and she realized shed touched a painful spotlike her tongue probing the gum where her tooth had once been i should have sandra keeps suggesting it i almost asked you a dozen times i couldnt but why afraid of what youd do give up on us think i was being too demanding walk out the door or take control and id get lost in the shufflemake it seem like there was no problem at all he shrugged i should have asked you i couldnt but look brynn the time for that has passed youre you im me apples and oranges were so different its best for both of us but its not too late dont judge by last night this wasthis was a nightmare then astonishing her he snapped he shoved the chair back and leapt to his feet the beer bottle fell spewing foam over the plates the easygoing man was now enraged brynn froze inside replaying those nights with keith her hand rose to her jaw she knew that graham wouldnt hurt her still she couldnt help the defensive gesture she blinked up at him and saw the wolf hovering nearby in the state park yet she realized the rage wasnt at her it was she believed directed purely at himself but i have to judge by last night thats what did it brynn last night what hed said before he wasnt planning on leaving until then what did he mean i dont understand he inhaled deeply eric eric munce hes dead because of me you no no we all knew he was reckless whatever happened didnt have anything to do with you yes it did it had everything to do with me whatre you talking about i used him his own jaw square and perfect was trembling i know you all thought he was a cowboy last night nobody was going to look for you at the interstate but i knew youd go that way so i told eric if he wanted to see some action he ought to come with me thats where the killers were headed graham shook his head i threw that out like it was a hunting dogs favorite treat and hes dead because of me because i went someplace i had no business going and i have to live with that forever she leaned forward he recoiled from her hand she sat back and asked why graham why did you come then he gave a cold laugh oh brynn i plant trees and flowers for a living you carry a gun and do highspeed chases i want to watch tv at night you want to study the latest drugtesting kits i cant compete with your life i sure cant in joeys eyeslast night i dont know what the hell i was thinking maybe that there was some gunfighter deep inside me i could prove myself but that was a joke all i did was get another human being killed no goddamn business going out there and i have no business here you dont want me brynn you sure dont need me no honey no yes he whispered then held up a hand the gesture meant enough no more he gripped her arm and squeezed softly lets get some sleep as graham went upstairs brynn absently daubed at the spilled beer until the paper napkins disintegrated she got a dish towel and finished the job with another she tried to stanch the tears she heard his footsteps coming downstairs again he was carrying a pillow and blanket without a glance her way he walked to the green couch made up a bed and closed the family room door all done maam brynn peered over at the painter who was gesturing toward the living room and its repaired ceiling and walls what do i owe you she peered around as if a checkbook floated nearby samll send you a bill youre good for it we trust you he gestured at her uniform smiled then stopped the funerals tomorrow deputy munce thats right im sorry about what happened my son painted his garage the deputy was very civil to him some people arent they gave him an iced tea im sorry a nod after the painter left she continued to stare at the blank walls no trace of the mm holes remained she thought she should put up the pictures once more but she didnt have the energy the house was completely silent she looked over a list of things she had to docalls to return evidence to follow up on interviews to conduct someone named andrew sheridan had called twicehe had some business connection with emma feldman and was asking about the files recovered from the house in lake mondac she wondered what that was about and somebody from the states attorneys office had heard from the couple injured when their suv overturned on the interstate they were suing the owner of the house at lake view had made a claim too the ammonia had ruined the floor bullet holes too of course she needed to file a report shed delay that as long as she could she heard footsteps on the front porch grahams a knock on the wooden frame she rose the bells out i think tom dahl said hey come on in the sheriff walked inside he noticed the smooth walls didnt comment on them hows your mother doing shell be okay feisty you know she tilted her head toward the closed family room door we made her up a bedroom downstairs shes sleeping now oh ill keep my voice down with the meds shes on shed sleep through a party the sheriff sat and massaged his leg i liked the way you phrased it about those two killers the bodies left behind described it pretty good anything at all tom ill tell you up front theres not much that fellow got himself shot was compton lewis lived in milwaukee compton was his first name ask his mother or father fellow was just a punk a wannabe did construction around the lakefront and ran some petty scams smashandgrab at gas stations and convenience stores biggest thing was he and some folks tried to rob a guard refilling an atm outside of madison last year they think lewis was supposedly the getaway driver but he dropped his keys in the snow his buddies ran off and he got busted did six months dahl shook his head only kin i could track down was lewiss older brother the only one still in the state the man took the news hard ill tell you started crying like a baby had to hang up and called me back a half hour laterdidnt have much to say but heres his number if you want to talk to him he handed her a postit note how about hart shed checked every criminal database in five states all the nicknames all the mug shots for everybody named hart heart harte hartman hartingnothing no leads at all that manhes good look at the fingerprints didnt leave a one anywhere and digging the bullet with his dna out of the woodwork he knows what hes doing and michelle she wouldve given hart and lewis a fake name but id guess michelle is real hart and lewis found her purse and probably looked through it and shedve told the truth to mebecause id be dead by morning dahl said theyre more concerned about her cause the fbis sure its mankewitz who hired her and they want to prove him or one of his people hired her but so far the snitches havent come up with anything concrete are they taking the composite picture of her i did to acting schools and health clubs brynn was pretty sure the biography michelle had told that night was a lie its purpose to elicit sympathy from brynn but the young woman had been so credible it was worth checking out i think theyre working from the top down more going for a mankewitz connection first he went on to say that hed opened files on the four meth cookers killed by hart and lewis they were murder charges like em or not drug dealers have a right not to be killed too if the mysterious shooter near the ledge in marquette state park in the early hours of april had any connection to the methamphetamine industry in wisconsin or to mankewitz nobodyd been able to find it the state police had found the probable location of the shooters nest but theyd recovered no physical evidence whatsoever hed collected all his brass and obscured his shoeprints everybodys a damn pro dahl muttered then asked hows that little girl doing amy no other family that child protective services can find sad not really tom at least shell have a chance for a decent life now she wouldntve survived there with gandy and his wife and i have to say shes looking okay pretty happy you saw her this morning i bought her a new chester and took it up a new toy i dont know what donkeymonkey or something i was planning on going back to the park and getting the original just didnt have the heart thatd be above and beyond brynn physically shes okay well nobodyd gone south thank god for that but the marks on her neck brynn grimaced angrily the doctor who looked her over that night said theyd been made in the past few hours few hours you mean it was michelle did that yep brynn sighed amy was making some noise and hart and lewis were nearby michelle pulled her aside to talk to her and she was quiet after that half strangled the poor kid ive got a feeling lord what a witch and amy was terrified for the rest of the night i never connected it poor thing good you went to see her she asked that fbi fellow whos checking on mankewitz hell call us or are they thinking were bumpkins never knew where that word came from brynn lifted an eyebrow they think were bumpkins but they said theyd let us know dahl said still give me his number ill call just to say hello snickering dahl dug through his wallet and found a card showed it to brynn and she wrote down the information you look tired i owe you that time off and im insisting you take it thats from your boss kick back let graham take care of things for a while a man oughta know his way around the kitchen and grocery store and laundry lord knows i do caroles whipped me into shape brynn laughed and dahl missed the mournful tone well i will promise but not just yet weve got open homicides and even if mankewitz is behind it and the us attorney comes in on rico or conspiracy counts its still a state crime happened in our county whatre you planning to do dahl asked go where the leads take me here milwaukee wherever she at least would follow up on some of the acting school and health club connections anything else she could think of maybe gun clubs the woman certainly knew how to use a firearm and it wont do any good saying no you can fire me he chuckled brynn sighed and this all ended up in our lap usually you know you cant pick the bullet that hits you usually you cant even hear it coming whatre you and carole doing this weekend maybe a movie only if her mother comes to babysit these teenagers they charge you ten dollars an hour and you have to feed them i mean something hot what do you pay graham and i dont go out much better that way stay home have dinner no need to go out especially with cable best be going say hi to carole for me will do and regards to your mom wish her well she watched him go and she stood looking over the first item on her list ii may sitting in a diner in downtown milwaukee big broad stanley mankewitz noted his reflection in the glass intensified because of the dark gray afternoon light the date was may but the weather had been borrowed from march this was an important date in mankewitzs life international workers day picked by worldwide labor movements in the late s to honor common workers that particular date was selected largely to commemorate the martyrs of the haymarket massacre in which both police and workers were killed in may in chicago following rallies by the federation of organized trade and labor unions in support of an eighthour workday may day meant two things to mankewitz one it honored working peoplewhich he had been and which he now represented with all his heartalong with their brothers and sisters throughout the world two it stood as a testament to the fact that sacrifices sometimes had to be made for the greater good he had above his desk a quotation the final words of one of the men sentenced to hang for his role in the haymarket massacre august spies who like all the defendants scholars believed was probably innocent spies had said the time will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voices you strangle today sacrifices reflecting now on that momentous day mankewitz gazed at his image observing not his rotund physique which pestered him occasionally but his exhausted demeanor he deduced this from his posture since he couldnt see his facial features clearly though they surely would have added to the overall profile he took a bite of his club sandwich noted the american instead of the swiss cheese which hed ordered and too much mayo in the coleslaw they always do that he fretted why do i eat here the hobbit detective had been proving scarce lately which mankewitz cleverly punned to james jasons really meant he was proving scared life had turned into a nightmare after the death of emma feldman hed been invited to the bureau and the states attorneys office he went with his lawyer answered some questions not others and they left without receiving anything other than a chilly goodbye his lawyer hadnt been able to read the signs then hed heard that the law firm where the feldman woman worked was considering a suit against him for wrongful deathand their loss of earnings his lawyer told him this was bullshit since there was no legally recognized cause of action for that sort of thing more fucking harrassment mankewitz snapped maybe its also bullshit because nobodys proved i killed her yeah of course stan that goes without saying without saying he looked up from his lopsided sandwich and saw james jasons approach the thin man sat down when the waitress arrived he asked for a diet coke you dont eat mankewitz said depends which means what mankewitz wondered ive got some updates go on first i called the sheriff up there tom dahl well i called as the friend of the feldmansthe aggrieved friend ari paskell i put on the pressure how come you havent found the killers yet et cetera okay im convinced he believed im who i said i was whatd he say about the case jasons blinked well nothing but he wouldnt i was just making sure he wasnt suspicious about my trip up there mankewitz nodded trusting the mans judgment whats up with our girlfriend referring to the deputy kristen brynn mckenzie right after the events of april and jasons had looked into who was leading the investigation into the deaths of the feldmans there was that prick of an fbi agent brindle and a couple of milwaukee cops but it was the smalltown woman who was really pushing the case shes unstoppable shes running with it like a bulldog mankewitz didnt think bulldogs ran much but he didnt say anything shes better than the bureau and milwaukee pd combined i doubt that well shes working harder than they are shes been to milwaukee four times since the murders following up on leads she have jurisdiction i dont think thats an issue anybodys worried about what with all the shit that went down in kennesha county and the dead lawyer why do i end up in the crock pot slight james jasons had no response to that nor should he offer one the union boss reflected besides the answer was obvious because i think immigrants who work hard ought to be let into the country to take the jobs of people whore too lazy to work oh and because i say it in public so ms mckenzies not going to stop until she gets to the bottom of what happened up there shes not going to stop jasons echoed out to make a name for herself his man considered this frowning its not like she wants a notch in her gun or career advancement anything like that whats her point then putting bad people in jail jasons reminded mankewitz again about being in the forest that night in aprilan unarmed brynn mckenzie on top of a cliff launching rocks and logs down onto the men pursuing her while they fired back with a shotgun and automatic pistol she had only vanished when jasons himself began firing with the bushmaster mankewitz knew without a doubt he wouldnt like deputy mckenzie but he had to respect her whats she found exactly i dont know shes been on the lakefront avenues west the brewline over to madison down to kenosha went to minneapolis for the day shes not stopping the running bulldog anything i can use anything at all speaking from memoryhe never seemed to need notesjasons said there is one thing go ahead shes got a secret give me the gist okay six seven years agomarried to her first husband he was a state trooper decorated popular guy also had a temper had hit her in the past prick hitting women well turns out he gets shot shot in his own kitchen theres an inquest accidental discharge unfortunate accident okay wheres this going it wasnt an accident at all intentional shooting there was a coverup mightve gone all the way to madison the kind of coverup where peoplell lose their jobs if it comes to light lose their jobs and probably go to jail this just rumors jasons opened his briefcase he removed a limp file folder proof for a little runt the man sure did produce hope its helpful mankewitz opened the folder he read lifting an eyebrow i think its very helpful he looked up and said sincerely thanks oh and by the way happy may day he liked this town at least he liked it well enough as a temporary home green bay was flatter than the state park around lake mondac less picturesque in that sense but the bay itself was idyllic and the fox river impressive in that hard industrial way that had always appealed to hart his father used to take him to the steel mill where the man worked in the payroll office and the son was always excited beyond words to don a hard hat and tour the floor which stank of smoke and coal and liquid metal and rubber his rental house here was on one of the numbered streets workingclass not so great but functional and cheap his big problem was that he was bored biding time never worked for hart but biding time was what he had to do no choice there none at all if he got too bored hed go for a drive to the forest preserve which he found comforting especially since to get there hed take lakeview drivethe name similar to the private road at lake mondac he would go for walks or sit in the car and work he had several prepaid mobile phones and would make calls about forthcoming jobs today in fact he was just finishing one of these walks and noticed a maypole set up in one of the clearings the children were running in a circle making a barber pole then they sat down to their picnic lunch a school bus was nearby a yellow stain on the otherwise pretty green hart returned to his rental house drove around the block just to be sure then went inside he checked messages and made some calls on a new prepaid mobile then he went into the garage where hed set up a small woodworking shop a tiny one hed been working on a project of his own design it started out being just an hour or two a day now he was up to about four hours nothing relaxed him like working with wood as he sanded by hand he thought back to that night in the woods recalling all the trees thereoak ash maple walnut all the hardwoods that made up the medium for his craft what he purchased as smooth precisely cut lumber with perfect angles at the corners had begun as a huge imposing even forbidding creature towering a hundred or so feet in the air in one way it troubled him that the trees were cut down in another though he believed he was honoring the wood by transforming it into something else something to be appreciated he now looked over the project hed been working on an inlaid box he was pleased with the progress it might be a present for someone he wasnt sure yet at eight that night he drove to downtown green bay to a woody dark bar that served pretty good chili and had a bowl and a beer sitting at the bar he got another beer when he finished the first and went into the back room where there was a basketball game on he watched it sipping the beer it was a west coast game and the hour was later here pretty soon the other patrons began to check their watches then stand and head home the score was well into the second half and whatever interest had existed before the halftime show had evaporated anyway it was just basketball not the packers he glanced at the walls they were covered with old signs from wisconsins breweries of the past famous ones he supposed though hed never heard of them loaf and stein heileman foxhead an ominous tusked boar stared at him from a hibernia brewing logo a picture of a tv screen on which two women looked out at the audience penned below it was hey there from laverne and shirley hart asked for his check as the waitress passed by she was polite but cool having given up flirting with him when it wasnt reciprocated the first time a week or so ago in bars like this one once is enough he paid left and drove to another bar not far away in the broadway district he stepped out of the car and into the shadows of a nearby alley when the man came out of the bar at am which hed done virtually every night for the past week hart grabbed him pushed a pistol into his back and dragged him into the alley it took freddy lancaster about fifteen seconds to decide that the impending threat from hart was worse than the equally dangerous but less immediate threat of michelle kepler he told hart everything he knew about her one glance out of the alley and one single muted gunshot later hart returned to his car he drove back to his house thinking about his next steps he had believed freddy when hed said that neither he nor gordon potts knew exactly where michelle lived but the man had disgorged enough information to allow hart to start closing in on her which hed do soon but for now hed do what hed been obsessing about for the past several weeks he yawned and reflected that at least he could get a good nights sleep he wouldnt need an early start humboldt wisconsin was only a threehour drive away at pm on monday may kristen brynn mckenzie was in the bar area of a restaurant in milwaukee having chicken soup and a diet soda shed just left appointments with an mpd detective and an fbi agent where theyd compared notes about their respective investigations into the killings of the feldmans and the meth dealers in kennesha county in april the meetings had proven to be unhelpful the goal of the city and the federal investigations it seemed was to find a link to mankewitz rather than capture those individuals who had slaughtered an innocent husband and wife and left their bodies ignominiously on a cold kitchen floor a fact that brynn pointed out to both the detective and the feebie neither of whom was moved by her assessment to do more than curl his lips sympathetically and with some irritation shed left the second appointment in a bad mood and decided to grab some belated lunch and head home in the past few weeks brynn mckenzie had logged miles in her own investigation she was now driving a used camryvery used the waterlogged honda had died in the line of duty according to the insurance company thus excluding it from her personal auto policy shed paid for the car herself from her savings which hurt particularly since she wasnt sure about her financial future graham had moved out theyd discussed the situation several times again after april but graham remained badly shaken by eric munces death for which he still blamed himselfthough not brynn not at all what a difference between him and keith graham had been gone only a few days moving into a rental unit twenty minutes away she found herself sad and troubledbut in some way relieved there was also a large numbness factor of course domestics were her specialty and she knew it was far too early to say for certain where their lives were headed he was still paying his share of the billsmore than his share actually picking up all of annas medical expenses that the insurance company wasnt but their lifestyle had been based on two incomes and brynn was suddenly much more conscious of finances she ate a bit more of the cooling soup her phone buzzed joey was calling and she picked up immediately it was just a checkin and she made cheerful comments as he told her a few things about gym and science then hung up to hurry off to his final class after allowing that graham might have been accurate in his comments about the boyand about her rearing of himshed done some investigating and interrogating and learned that the reports of joeys phalting were true hed hitched rides on trucks a number of times only by the grace of god had he been saved from serious injury the class cutting too had occurred shed had several difficult talks with the boyprodded largely by her mother which had surprised her brynn had swooped into her sons life like a tactical officer from a helicopter he was only allowed to board at a local freestyle course when she was there with him and he had to wear his helmet no ski hats mom like come on are you kidding thats your only option and i keep your board locked up in my room hed sighed exaggeratedly but agreed she also required him to call in regularly and to be home within twenty minutes of the end of school she was amused to see his reaction when she reminded him that the police have an arrangement with the local phone company that allows them to track the whereabouts of cell phones even when theyre not in use this was true though what she didnt share was that it would be illegal for her to use the system to electronically check up on him but if she was getting the rebellious behavior under control there seemed to be nothing she could do with his moods about grahams departure although her husband stayed in regular touch with his stepson joey wasnt happy at the breakup and she didnt know how to do anything about that after all she wasnt the one whod walked out the door shed fix it though at the moment she didnt have a clue how she pushed the soup away reflecting that so much had changed since that night that night the phrase had become an icon in her life it meant a lot more than a chronological reference she was single again had an injured mother in her care and a troubled son to keep an eye on still nothing in the world would stop her from finding michelle and hart and bringing them in she was in fact wondering if there was anything she could salvage from the meetings shed just had with the detective and fbi agent when she realized the bar was deathly quiet empty the waiter busboy and bartender were gone and then she had a memory seeing a slight man walking behind her on the way from the police station here she hadnt thought anything of it but now realized that shed stopped at one point to look in a store window hed stopped as well to make a phone call or to pretend to alarmed she started to rise but felt the breeze of a door opening and sensed people behind her at least two it seemed she froze her gun was under her suit jacket and a raincoat shed be dead before she undid two buttons there was nothing to do but turn around she did so half expecting to see harts gray eyes as he steadied the gun to kill her the heavier of the two a man in his sixties said detective im stanley mankewitz she nodded its deputy the other man skinny and boyish was the one shed seen earlier following her he had a faint smile but humor was not its source he remained silent mankewitz sat on the stool next to hers may i youre bordering on kidnapping here he seemed surprised oh youre free to leave any time deputy mckenzie kidnapping he nodded to his associate who went to a nearby table the bartender had returned he looked at mankewitz just coffee a diet coke for my friend he nodded at the table the bartender delivered the coffee to the bar and the soda to mankewitzs associate anything else he asked brynn as if saying want some cheesecake for your last meal she shook her head just the check mankewitz prepared the coffee carefully just the right amount of cream a sugar packet and a splenda he said i heard you had quite an evening a few weeks ago that night and how would you know that i watch the news he gave off an aura of confidence that she found reassuring in one sensethat she was in no physical danger at the momentbut also troubling as if he had another weapon like knowing something that could destroy her life without resorting to violence he seemed completely in control in this way he reminded her of hart the union boss continued very important to be informed when i was growing up before your time we had an hour of local newsfive pmand then national and international walter cronkite huntley and brinkleyjust a half hour me that wasnt enough i like all the information i can get cnn i love it its the home page on my blackberry that doesnt answer the question of how you happen to be here when i just decided to come in on a whim unless youd somehow found out i had an appointment at milwaukee pd he hesitated only a momentshed obviously touched something close to home he said or maybe ive just been shadowing you i know he has she snapped nodding at his slim associate mankewitz smiled sipped the coffee and looked with regret at the rotating dessert display we have a mutual interest here deputy and what would that be finding emma feldmans killer im not watching him drink very bad coffee two feet away from me right now it is bad coffee howd you know smell he nodded at the can of soda by her plate you and my friend and that diet pop thats whats not good for you you know and no youre not in the company of her killer she looked behind her the other fellow was sipping his soda while he looked over his own blackberry what was his home page dont imagine you work many murders in kennesha county mankewitz said not like this one not like these she corrected several people were killed now that she was alive and the bartender was a witness even a bribable one shed started feeling cocky if not ornery of course he nodded brynn mused what kind of cases do we run domestic knifings a gun goes off accidental during a eleven or gas station heist a meth deal goes bad bad stuff that drug very bad tell me about it she said if youve seen cops you know what we do april seventeenth was a whole different ball game he sipped the bad coffee anyway you in a union a police union no not in kennesha i believe in unions maam i believe in working and i believe in giving everybody a fair shake to climb up the ladder like education schools an equalizer a unions the same youre in a union we give you the basics you might be happy with that take your hourly wage and god bless but you can use it like a diving board you want to go higher in life diving board maybe thats a bad choice im not so creative you know what im accused of not the details a scam involving illegal immigrants what im accused of is giving people forged documentation thats better than what they can buy on the street they get jobs in open shops and vote to go union is that true no he smiled thosere the accusations now you know how the authorities tipped to my alleged crimes that lawyer emma feldman was doing some business deal for a client and she found a large number of legal immigrants were union membersproportionately a lot higher than in most locals around the country from that somebody started the rumor that i was selling them forged papers all their green cards though were legit issued by the us government brynn considered this he seemed credible but who knew why to break the union thats why pure and simple the rumors start going around that im corrupt that local fouroheight is a front for terrorists that im encouraging foreigners to take our jobsbang everybody votes to drop out and go open shop he was worked up let me explain exactly why im being persecuted here why people want stanley mankewitz out of the picture because i dont hate immigrants i am all in favor of them id rather employ a dozen mexicans or chinese or bulgarians who come to this countrylegally ill addto work hard than a hundred lazy bornhere citizens any day so im caught right in the middle the employers hate me because im union my own membership hates me because i promote people who arent amurican he drawled the last word a good ole boy so theres a conspiracy to set me up brynn sighed having lost all interest in her soup and the soda which had been flat to start with probably as bad as the coffee though it didnt stink mankewitz lowered his voice did you know i saved your life on april seventeenth her attention swung fully to him now a frown she didnt want to show any emotion but couldnt help herself mankewitz said i sent mr jasons there to protect my interest i knew i didnt kill emma feldman and her husband i wanted to find out who really did that could lead me to who was trying to set me up please she said giving him a skeptical glance her cheek stung and she rearranged her expression mankewitz looked over her shoulder james jasons joined them at the bar toting a briefcase he said i was in the forest near that ledge you and that woman and little girl were on i had a bushmaster rifle you were throwing rocks and logs down on those men she asked in a whisper that was you jasons didnt look like he could even hold a gun shooting at us near you not at only to break up the fighting another sip of soda i drove to the house at the lake i said i was a friend of steve feldman i followed your husband and that other deputy into the woods i wasnt there to kill anybody just the opposite my orders were to keep everyone alive find out who they were i broke up the fight but i couldnt track them down to interrogate them mankewitz said we have reason to believe that the rumors about my alleged illegal involvement came from someone in a company called great lakes intermodal container service mr jasons here managed to find some documents find some documents that suggest that the president of the company was in bad financial shape and trying desperately to kick out the union so he could cut wages and benefits the head lawyer of great lakes provided us with some documents that prove the president was behind the rumors did you tell the prosecutor unfortunately this documentation it was stolen well lets say it isnt discoverable under the federal rules of evidence now heres the situation since i have never sold any illegal papers nobody can prove that i did so eventually the charges will be dismissed but rumors can cause as much damage as convictions thats what the great lakes containers and the other union shops are hoping forto ruin me by destroying my reputation and break the union so i need to stop as many of those rumors as i can and my number one priority is convincing you that i didnt kill emma feldman in police school they teach us not to give up when a suspect says really i didnt do it mankewitz pushed the coffee away deputy mckenzie i know about the shooting seven years ago brynn froze your husband he looked at jasons who said keith marshall mankewitz continued the official report was accidental discharge but everybody believed you shot him because he attacked you again like he did when he broke your jaw but since he was wearing his body armor and survived he could testify that it was accidental look but i know the truth i know it was your son not you who shot keith trying to save you no nobrynns hands were shaking another nod toward jasons a file appeared it was old limp she looked at it kennesha county board of education archives whats this she gasped mankewitz pointed to a name on the folder dr r germain it took her a moment to recognize it he was joeys counselor in the third grade joeyd been having trouble in school aggression refusing to do homework and had seen the man several times a week the boy had been further traumatized when the counselor had died of a massive heart attack the night after a session where did you get it without waiting for an answer she ripped it open with sweating hands oh my god theyd assumed joey just five at the time of the shooting had forgotten or blocked out that terrible night when his parents had fought grappling on the kitchen floor the boy had run to his parents screaming keith had pushed him away and gone to hit brynn in the face again joey had pulled her weapon from the holster on her hip and shot his father in the chest dead center theyd pulled in every favor they could and brynn took the hit for an accidental discharge which alone nearly ended her career everybody figured that shed shot keith on purposehe was known for his temperbut no one suspected joey as she now learned from the report the boy had given dr germain a coherent and detailed account of what happened that night brynn had no idea that joey recalled the event with such clarity apparently she realized now the only thing that had saved him from going into foster careand if a witch hunt had ensued having brynn and keith criminally investigated for endangering a child because of the weaponwas germains death and the file vanishing unread into the school archives mankewitz added the fbi and milwaukee pd were close to finding this what why because they want you off the case their investigation is meant to nail me yours is to find out what really happened at lake mondac the assistant added theyve been looking into every aspect of your life theyd use this for leverage to discredit you a glance at the file maybe even get you prosecuted and anybody who helped in the coverup about keiths shooting her jaw trembled as badly as on that night when shed climbed from the pungent waters of lake mondac theyd take her son away from her her career would be over tom dahl would be investigated too for abetting the coverup people at the state police would also come under investigation mankewitz looked into her eyes now swimming with tears hey relax she glanced at him he tapped the file with a thick finger mr jasons here assures me that this is the only file there were no copies made nobody except you keith and your son knows what happened that night you do now she muttered the only thing im doing with that file is giving it to you what shred it no do what i do shred it then burn it youre not deputy mckenzie im not here to blackmail im not here to leverage you into dropping the investigation im giving this to you as a show of good faith im innocent i dont want you off the case i want you to keep investigating until you find out who really did kill those people up there brynn clutched the file it seemed to give off radiation she slipped it into her backpack thank you with a trembling hand she drank some soda she considered what hed told her but then who wanted emma feldman dead what would the motive be nobody else seems to have one has anybody looked for one true she admitted everybodyd been assuming all along that mankewitz was behind the crimes the union boss looked away his shoulders slumped weve drawn a blank too though there were some other cases emma was working on that might have been sensitive enough to motivate somebody to kill her one was a trustandestate matter for a state representative the one who killed himself brynn remembered the story the man had tried to cut his wife and children out of his will and leave all his money to a twentytwoyearold gay prostitute the media had broken the story and the politician killed himself then the labor boss continued she had another case that was curious a glance at jasons the king of information and sources apparently he said a products liability case involving a new hybrid car a driver was electrocuted the mans family sued emma feldmans client a company in kenosha they made the generator or electrical system or something she was hard at work on the case but then all the files were pulled and nobody heard anything more about it a dangerously defective hybrid something you didnt hear about much in fact never thered certainly be big money involved shed found something she shouldntve maybe and kenosha rang a bell shed have to look at her notes from the past few weeks a call to be returned somebody was interested in some of emma feldmans files somebody named sheridan mankewitz continued but we couldnt come up with any particular leads youre on your own now he waved for the check paid nodding at brynns unfinished soup i didnt pay for that appearance of impropriety you know he pulled his coat on the associate remained sitting but he fished a business card from his pocket it contained only a name and phone number she wondered if the name was real he said if you need me for anything if i can be of any more help please call its a voice mail only but ill get right back to you brynn nodded thank you she said again to both men tapping her backpack think about what i told you mankewitz said seems like you and the fbi and everybody elses been looking in the wrong place or the skinny man said sipping from his glass as if the soda were a vintage wine looking for the wrong who the police line bunting on the front porch had come undone it wagged like a bony yellow finger in the breeze brynn hadnt been back to the feldmans vacation house on lake view drive since that night now almost three weeks ago oddly in the afternoon daylight the house looked starker than it had then the paint was uneven and peeling in many places the angles sharp the shutters and trim unpleasing black she walked to the place where shed stood beside her car nearly hyperventilating with terror in a shooting stance waiting for hart to rise from the bushes and present a target from that memory her thoughts slipped back naturally to the school counselors report that mankewitz had given her now indeed both shredded and burned in the backyard barbecue the counselor had transcribed the incident pretty much the way it happened the night was also in april curiously she pictured herself blinking in horror as keith just home from a long day of patrol sat at the kitchen table and his anger slowly unraveled she didnt know what had sparked the outburst often she couldnt remember something about their taxes and money maybe shed misplaced some receipts small it was usually something small but the incident had escalated fast keith getting that crazed look in his eyes so terrifying possessed his voice was low at first then cracking rising to a scream brynn had said the worst thing she could calm down its no big deal im the one whos been working on it all day whereve you been handing out parking tickets calm down shed snapped back even as her heart stuttered and she found her hand protecting her jaw then hed snapped hed leapt up kicking the table over tax forms and receipts flying through the air and charged her beer bottle in hand shed pushed him away hard and hed grabbed her by the hair and muscled her to the floor theyd grappled knocking chairs aside hed dragged her toward him balling his fist up screaming crying no no no seeing his massive hand rearing back and then joey was charging into them sobbing himself joey get back keith raged intoxicatedthough as usual not from alcohol but anger he was completely out of control drawing back his huge fist she tried to twist away so the terrible blow wouldnt shatter her jaw again trying to protect joey who was stuck in the middle screaming right along with his mother dont hurt mommy then crack the bullet struck keith directly in the center of the chest and the boy began screaming once more the fiveyearold had slipped his mothers glock from her holster probably meaning just to threaten but the weapon has no traditional safety catch just gripping the trigger could cause it to go off the gun spun to the floor as mother father son were frozen in a horrible tableau keith blinking had stumbled back then dropped to his knees and vomited he passed out brynn had gasped sped to him and ripped his shirt open seeing the disk of hot copper and lead fall from the kevlar vest ambulances and statements and negotiations and of course the indelible horror of the incident itself yet mankewitz and that skinny fellow jasons didnt know the worst part the part that she regretted every minute of her life after that night life got better in fact it became perfect keith found a good psychiatrist and went into angermanagement and twelvestep programs they went to couples therapy joey too went into counseling and never again was there a harsh word between them let alone a touch not motivated by affection or passion they became the most normal of couples attending joeys events and church anna and her husband warily returned to their daughters life having distanced themselves because of keith no more big blowups no harsh words he became a model husband and nine months later she asked him for a divorce and he had reluctantly agreed why had she asked for one shed spent hours days wondering was it the aftershock of that terrible night the accumulation of the mans moods or that she wasnt programmed to live a calm normal life i wouldnt trade the life i lead for anything look at most of the rest of the worldthe walking dead theyre nothing but dead bodies brynn sitting around upset angry about something they saw on tv doesnt mean a single thing to them personally she thought back to that night after she and graham had returned from the hospital after anna had been shot what hed said to her oh graham youre right so right but i do owe my son i owe him big i put him in a situation where he actually used a weapon to try to save his mother when i should have taken him out of that household years before and then i left after everything got better i took joey away from a man who moved heaven and earth to turn his life around how can i help but spoil the boy protect him and hope for his forgiveness touching her jaw she now climbed onto the porch of the feldmans house the scene had been released but a state police lockbox was still on the door she worked the combination took the key and stepped inside the place smelled of sweet cleanser and fireplace smoke lured out by the damp air she saw bullet holesfrom harts from lewiss shotgun from michelles from brynns own weapon as well in the kitchen the floor had been scrubbed clean not a trace of blood remained there were companies that did this cleaning up after crimes and accidental deaths brynn had always thought that would be a good murdermystery novel a killer who works for one of those companies and cleans the scene so completely the police cant find any clues in the kitchen she saw a half dozen battered cookbooks several of which she herself owned she pulled down an old joy of cooking she opened it up to the page where the red ribbon marked a recipe chicken fricassee she laughed shed made this very dish in the corner was written in pencil hours and the words vermouth instead brynn put the book back she wondered what would happen to the house now abandoned for another generation she supposed whod want to be up here anyway imposing harsh woods no grocery stores or restaurants nearby and that lake cold and dark like an old bullet hole but then she cut all of these reflections loose pushed them away just like she and michelle had shoved the canoe into the black stream and gone on their urgent way with a glance at where the bodies had lainwhere she had almost joined them in deathbrynn returned to the living room we have to leave okay joey replied to his mother and trooped down the stairs wearing an old west costume that anna had made man that woman knew her way around singer sewing machines brynn thought always had some people are born to the skill brynn had spent the past several days in milwaukee and kenosha running down leads some successful and some not but shed made a point of returning in time that evening to get to joeys pageant brynn called mom are you okay in there from the family room anna said im fine joey i wish i could come but ill come to your party when schools over ill be fine by then whore you playing im this frontier scout i lead people over the mountains its not about the donner party is it anna asked whats that joey wondered aloud like the democrats in a way mother brynn scoffed hobbling into the doorway anna said turn around my look at that you look like alan ladd who a famous actor like johnny depp the boy asked heaven help us joey wrinkled his face i dont want to put that makeup on its all greasy brynn said you have to wear it onstage people can see you better besides it makes you look so handsome he gave an exaggerated sigh anna said honey i think graham might like to go yeah the boy said fast mom can he i dont know brynn said uncertainly angry that her mother hadtactically it seemedasked this in front of joey her mother held her eye and gave her one of her patented ironclad smiles oh give him a call what can it hurt brynn didnt know the answer to that and therefore she didnt want to ask him hed like the show mom come on its short notice in which case hell say he has other plans thank you very much for the invitation or hell say yes she glanced back anna had been supportive emotionally after the breakup but hadnt offered any opinion about it brynn assumed she was being her typical uninvolved self but she wondered now if the pleasant smilethe smile of a spokeswoman for aarp on a television adhid a carefully planned strategy about her daughters life id rather not brynn said evenly ah the smile faltered mom joey said he was angry her mothers eyes slipped for a split second to her grandson and she said nothing else joey muttered i dont know why he moved out all the way over to hendricks hills howd you know he was there graham had just moved into a new rental yesterday he told me you talked to him he called you didnt tell me he called me the boy said defiantly to say hi you know brynn wasnt sure how to react to this he didnt leave a message naw he tugged at his costume whyd he move there its a nice neighborhood i mean whyd he move at all i told you we had a different way of seeing things joey didnt know what that meant but neither did brynn well cant he come to the play no honey she smiled not this time maybe later the boy walked to the window and gazed outside he seemed disappointed brynn frowned whats that i thought maybe he was here why you know he comes by sometimes he does to see you no he just sits outside for a while then drives off i saw him at school too he was parked outside after class brynn kept her voice steady as she asked youre sure it was graham i guess i couldnt see him real good he had sunglasses on but it had to be him who else would it be looking at her mother who was clearly surprised at this news but it might not have been him joey shrugged he had dark hair and he was big like graham what kind of car was he in i dont know something kind of blue looked neat like a sports car dark blue i couldnt see too good when he called he told me they never found his truck so he got a new one i figured that was it whats wrong mom nothing she smiled come on cant you call him not today honey ill call him later brynn scanned the empty road for a moment then turned and smiling againone of her mothers stoic smilessaid hey mom you are looking better maybe you should come to the play after all anna was going to scoldshed been after brynn to let her come to the play all alongbut she caught on love to brynn continued well go to tgi fridays after ill help you throw something on ill be there in a minute she walked to the front door locked it and went upstairs she opened the lockbox and clipped her holster containing the glock to the back of her skirt waistband pulled on a jacket staring out the window at the empty road in front of the house she called tom dahl need a favor fast sure brynn you okay i dont know go on graham i need to know what cars are registered in his name everything even the company cars he causing you trouble no no its not him im worried about just hold on a minute ill get into the dmv database less than sixty seconds later the sheriffs easy voice came back on the line rolling hills landscapings got three fortyfoot flatbeds two f pickups and an f graham himself has a taurus hes leasing through his insurance companycausa that woman stealing his pickup last month id imagine the taurus its dark blue white okay she was thinking back to that night you should have you shouldve killed me tom i need somebody to watch the house again whats going on brynn somebody was outside parked checking out the place joey saw him you know kids mightve been nothing but i dont want to take any chances sure we can do that brynn anything on thursday may brynn was sitting in her cubicle clutching a cup of hot chocolate really hot this had become a recent addiction though shed given up her muchloved saltines and brie sandwiches in compensation she could drink three cups of cocoa a day she wondered if this was because shed been so chilled on that night probably not swiss miss made a really good product she reflected that she and graham had sipped hot chocolate at the humboldt diner at the end of their first date the beverages had started out near degrees when theyd begun talking and the cups had been cold when theyd finished she was reading through her noteshundreds of jottings setting out the conversations shed had after her meeting with stanley mankewitz shed never worked so hard in her life looking for the wrong who her office phone rang she took a last sip and set the cup down deputy mckenzie hello asked a latina voice with the reserve most people displayed when calling the police the caller explained she was the manager of the harborside inn in milwaukee how can i help you hearing milwaukee brynn sat forward quickly tense the most likely reason for someone from that city to call was the feldman murder case that was indeed the purpose and brynn grew more and more interested as she listened the hotel manager said shed seen on tv a composite picture of the man wanted in connection with the killings at lake mondac a man possibly going by the name or nickname of hart or harte someone looking very similar had checked into the inn there on april the manager had called the local police and they referred her to the kennesha county sheriffs department the name of the guest was william harding hardinghart is it true hes a killer the woman asked uneasily thats our understanding what was the address on the register brynn snapped her fingers at todd jackson who appeared instantly at her cubicle as the manager recited an address in minneapolis brynn transcribed it and told the young deputy check this out fast asked about phone calls and visitors the woman said there were no outgoing calls but the guest harding met in the coffee shop with a skinny man with a crew cut who the manager thought was rude and a pretty woman in her twenties with short red hair she looked a bit like the woman in the other composite picture the manager had seen getting better and better then the woman added the thing is he never checked out hes still there she asked no officer he checked in for three days went out the afternoon of the seventeenth and then never came back i tried to call but directory assistance doesnt have anybody listed in minneapolis or st paul by that name at that address she wasnt surprised when jackson slipped her a piece of paper that read fake a parking lot no name in mn wi ncic or vicap she nodded whispering tell tom weve got something here jackson disappeared as brynn was scanning through her notes flipping pages what about a credit card she asked the manager paid cash but the reason i called he left a suitcase here if you want to pick it up its yours really ill tell you id like to drive down there and look through it let me rearrange a few things and give you a call back after they disconnected brynn slouched back in her chair you okay tom dahl asked stepping into her cubicle looking cautiously at her eyes which she supposed reflected a certain gleam im more than okay weve got ourselves a lead michelle alison kepler now brunet and severely collagenedsat in the bedroom of a ritzy house in a ritzy neighborhood of milwaukee she was painting her nails dark plum their color on that terrible night in april she was reflecting on a truth that shed learned over the years that people heard what they wanted to hear saw what they wanted believed what they wanted but to exploit that weakness you had to be sharp had to recognize their desires and expectations then subtly and cleverly feed them enough crumbs to make them think they were satisfied hard to do but for people like michelle it was necessary a survival skill michelle was thinking in particular of her companion that night deputy brynn mckenzie youre their friendfrom chicagoi heard you and emma worked together are you a lawyer too my god what a straight man you were brynn michelle had found herself in a tough situation back there at the house the feldmans were dead shed found the files shed been after and destroyed them which meant she no longer needed hart and lewis but then hart had reacted like a catand the evening went to hell the escape into the woods then finding deputy brynn mckenzie she knew instinctively just what role to play a role that the country hick deputy could understand rich spoiled girl not very likeable but with just the right touch of selfquestioning doubt a woman whod been dumped by her husband for being exactly who that husband encouraged her to be brynn would be irritated at first but sympathetic too which is just how we feel about most people we meet under difficult circumstances we never like victimsuntil we get to know them and recognize something of them within us besides the role would keep brynn from wondering why she didnt quite seem like your typical houseguest mourning the deaths of her host and hostess murders shed just committed i wasnt lying when i said i was an actress brynn i just dont act onstage or in front of the camera but now it was three weeks later and things were turning around about time she sure deserved a break after all the outrageous unfair crap shed been through on april and afterward shed earned some good luck stuffing cotton balls between the toes of her left foot she continued painting yep god or fate was back on her side shed finally managed to track down harts full name and addresshe lived in chicago as it turned out shed learned though that he wasnt spending a lot of time there lately he was frequently in wisconsin which was sobering but expected of course he was looking for her as diligently as she was looking for him he was looking for a few other people too and apparently hed found one freddy lancaster had stopped returning phone calls and text messages gordon potts would also be on harts list though he was hiding way out in eau claire michelle was cautious but not panicked shed cut nearly all ties between herself and the events of april hart knew her real namehe knew it from looking through her purse that nightbut locating michelle kepler wouldnt be easy she always made sure of that ever since her teens michelle had been an expert at working her way into other peoples lives finagling them into taking care of her playing helpless playing lost playing sexy with men mostly but with women too when necessary she was presently living with sam rolfe a rich businessman in milwaukee nobody saw heard or believed what he wanted to better than sam her drivers license listed an old address and her mail went to a post office box which shed changed first thing on april no forwarding as for the evidence implicating her in the lake mondac crimeswell there wasnt much shed stolen from poor grahams truck everything that contained her fingerprintsthe map shed given hart and her purse and when shed swapped boots with her poor dead friend michelle had wiped down her ferragamos with glass cleaner brynn leaving italian leather god i hate you now the evidence from lake mondac was no longer a threat but one very real risk remained it needed to be disposed of and that would happen today michelle dried her toenails with a hair dryer pleased with the results though irritated that she hadnt been able to get to the salon with hart loose she had to limit her trips out she left the luxurious bedroom and stepped into the living room where rolfe sat on the couch with her daughter tory five and her son bradford a skinny boy of seven who didnt smile much but had a wad of blond hair you just could not resist ruffling she couldnt look at her children without her heart swelling with a mothers love rolfe had a pleasant face and lips that werent too disgusting on the negative side he needed to lose about forty pounds and his hair smelled of lilac which was gross she hated his tattoo michelle had nothing against tats in general but he had a star on his groin a big star the pubic hair grew through part of it and his belly covered up another part depending on how he sat oh please but michelle was no complainer if the script didnt call for complaining rolfe had plenty of money from his trucking company and she could put up with making her sculpted body frequently available to him in exchange forwell just about anything she wanted michelle was an expert at spotting the sam rolfes of the worldmen who heard saw and believed if god gives you a lazy streak a slow mind for school or a trade expensive tastes a pretty face and better body then you damn well better be able to sniff out men like that the way a snake senses a confused mouse of course you had to be watchful always now seeing her son and rolfe laugh at something the tv judge was saying looking like father and son michelle was enraged with jealousy she had a momentary urge to tell rolfe to go fuck himself and to walk out the door with her children but she pulled back however angry she became which was usually redhot angry she was usually able to control it survival she did this now and smiled though she also thought with some glee no blow jobs tonight dear she wondered if hed been talking about her to the children she sensed he had been shed interrogate the boy later something wrong he asked nothing she said and ushered her son off the couch and ordered him to get her a soda from the kitchen she watched brad wander off and the jealousy switched finger snap to overwhelming love unable to have children despite trying since she was sixteen michelle kepler had been lucky enough to befriend a single mother in milwaukees netherworld on the pretext of volunteering with a nonprofit organization to help the disadvantaged hivpositive from sex or drugs or both blanche was often sick and would leave her son and daughter in michelles care despite her prescriptiondrug cocktails to keep aids at bay the poor womans condition worsened fastbut she could take some solace in her written agreement to name michelle as the custodian of the children if anything happened to her which was fortunate because the woman died much sooner than expected a sad event not long after which michelle spent some time flushing down the toilet the six months worth of prescription aids medicines shed withheld from blanche substituting tylenol prylosec and childrens vitamins which thriftily she also gave to the kids now these two children were hers she loved them with all her being doing what they were told adoring her andas the therapist told her in a courtordered session years agovalidating an otherwise unremarkable life but fuck the therapists michelle knew what she wanted always had in fact one of the tragedies of that night in aprilthanks to the unexpected appearance of brynns husband with a gunwas michelles loss of amy another girl she could have brought into her family after killing brynn and hart lewis too if hart hadnt done that for her shed have slipped away with her new daughter but that hadnt worked out add one more offense to brynn mckenzies charge sheet michelle now glanced at tory who was showing a picture shed drawn to rolfe michelle thought the fat pigs not your daddy dont you dare ever think he is it was then that her phone rang she noted caller id said to rolfe i better get this he nodded complacently complimented the little girl on the picture and turned back to the tv brad brought the soda for his mother he held it out do i look like im on the phone michelle snapped then stepped into the bedroom in a latina accent she answered harborside inn can i help you hi yes thiss deputy mckenzie from kennesha county you called about a half hour ago oh sure deputy about that guest the one with the suitcase right ive checked my schedule i can be in milwaukee about five lets seecould we make it fivethirty we have a staff meeting at five michelle was pleased at her performance im really an actress sure i can do that she gave brynn the address ill see you then michelle hung up closed her eyes god or fatethank you she walked to the closet and took out a locked suitcase opened it she removed her compact glock put it in her coach purse she stared out the window for a moment feeling both nervous and exhilarated then she returned to the living room she said to rolfe that was the nursing home my aunts taken a bad turn she shook her head god that poor woman it hurts me to the bone what shes going through im so sorry sweetie he said looking at her tormented face michelle hated the endearment she winced and said i have to go see her you betcha he frowned who is she again cool eyes turned his way meaning are you accusing me of something or have you forgotten my relatives either way you lose sorry he said fast obviously reading her expression haddie right thats her name hey ill drive you michelle smiled thats okay id rather it was brad and me ive got to deal with it with family you understand well you betcha its okay for brad to see her you think she looked at the boy you want to see your auntie dont you he damn well better not say that he didnt have an auntie she held his eyes as she took the soda from his tiny hand and sipped it he nodded i thought you did good brynn mckenzie gathered up her backpack and pitched out her second cocoa cup of the day thought again about graham and their first date then about the last time theyd been out together aloneat a woodsy club on route dancing until midnight it was one week before shed found out he was cheating why didnt you ask me to go with you and why hadnt he invited her to a therapy session hey b a womans voice interrupted how bout bennigans later jane styles another senior deputy continued im meeting reggie oh and that cute guy from state farms going to be there one i told you about brynn whispered im not divorced jane the words not yet tagged along at the end of the sentence i just said he was cute thats only information im not calling the caterer he sells insurance we need insurance nothing wrong with that thanks but ive got something going on buy a policy for me funny thinking of hart thinking of the harborside inn in milwaukee brynn mckenzie walked down a corridor shed been up and down so often that she tended not even to see it on the walls were pictures of deputies killed in the line of duty there were four over the past eightyseven years though eric munces portrait wasnt up yet the county had the photos mounted in expensive frames the first fatality was a deputy with a handlebar mustache hed been shot by a man involved in the northfield minnesota train robbery she passed a map of the county too a big one pausing and glancing at the azure blemish of lake mondac she asked herself so is what im about to do now a good idea or a bad idea then she laughed why bother to ask the question it doesnt matter ive already made the decision she fished the keys out of her pocket and pushed outside into a beautiful clear afternoon is it true hes a killer thats our understanding driving through a gritty neighborhood of milwaukee toward lake michigan michelle kepler was saying to her son what youre going to do is go up to this woman and say youre lost shell be parked and when she gets out of her car you go up to her and say im lost say it im lost good ill point her out to you and make sure you look you know upset can you do that you know how to look upset uhhuh said brad she snapped dont say you know something when you dont now do you know how to look upset no upset is what i look like when youve done something wrong and you disappoint me you understand he nodded quickly this he got good she smiled in downtown milwaukee michelle drove past the harborside inn then around the block returned to the hotel the parking lot was half full it was pm brynn mckenzie wasnt due for another half hour better work what mommy shhh she circled once more then pulled into a space on the street twenty feet from the parking lot what were going to do is when the woman drives in shell park somewhere there seegood and then you and me both get out im going to go around that way behind you go up to her and knock on the window closest to her tell her youre lost and scared shell get out of the car what are you going to tell her im lost and scared and what do you look like upset good she rewarded him with another big smile tousling his hair then mommys going to come up andtalk to her for a minute then we both run back to the car and drive home and see sam do you like sam yeah hes fun you like him more than you like mommy the hesitation was like a hot iron against her skin no she pushed the jealousy away as best she could time to concentrate michelle studied the area cars passed occasionally a customer would come out of a tavern across the street or an elderly local would amble along the sidewalk but other than that the neighborhood was deserted now be quiet and shut the radio off her phone buzzed she read the text message frowned it was from a friend in milwaukee the words were sobering the man had just heard about twenty minutes ago that gordon potts had been killed in eau claire freek accdt it reported michelles face tightened bullshit about the accident it was harts work but it was good news for michelle shed been uneasy being out in public here in milwaukee with hart still loose now at least she knew he wasnt in town at the moment god or fate smiling on her then right on the dot she saw the kennesha county sheriffs department car pull into the parking lot of the harborside inn her palms began sweating god or fate okay brad michelle popped the locks and stepped out her son got out of the other side mommys going to go around there she whispered and ill walk up behind that woman dont look at me pretend im not there you understand that he nodded do not look at me when i come up to the car say it i wont look at you because if you look at me that woman will take you away and put you in jail shes that kind of woman i love you so much that i dont want that to happen thats why im doing this for you you know all the trouble i go to for you and your sister yes she hugged him okay now go tell her what i said and remember upset as the boy walked toward the car michelle crouching slipped around a row of parked cars she pulled the glock from the pocket of her leather jacket a new one bought by sam rolfe to replace her favorite a really beautiful number from neiman marcus which had been totally ruined on their walk through the woods that cold night in april as he drove along the road in humboldt toward brynn mckenzies house sheriff tom dahl was thinking about her years in the department the job had been tough on her especially taking on the worst assignments the hurt kids the domestics been tough too thanks to her fellow deputies attitudes because she was the overachiever always had been the girl in the front row raising her hand because she knew every answer nobody liked that but hell shed gotten results look at what shed done that night at lake mondac he didnt know another deputy who wouldve pushed as hard as she had he didnt know another deputy who would have survived dahl massaged his game leg he parked in front of the small house they all were on kendall road brynns was a neat place trim and well kept up and thanks to graham it had the hell landscaped out of it a lot different from the others here he got out of the car stood and stretched a joint snapped somewhere hed given up worrying where such sounds originated or what they meant tugging on his hat a habit dahl walked slowly through the gate and then up the serpentine sidewalk bordered by more kinds of plants than he knew existed at the door he hesitated only a moment and then rang the bell a double chime sounded the door opened hey sheriff brynns son stood there seemed hed grown another eight inches since theyd been together last a department christmas party hi joey beyond him in the living room anna mckenzie was moving toward the kitchen with a cane anna she nodded cautiously and behind her in the kitchen brynn was taking the temperature of a roasting chicken as she stood beside the stove he thought she didnt cook or even knew how the chicken looked pretty good she turned and lifted an eyebrow we got her brynn we got her they sat in the family room sheriff and deputy iced tea courtesy of anna sat between them brynn said took longer than i thought been on pins and needles which didnt begin to describe her anxiety waiting for the news sheriff dahl explained there was a complication the teams were in place around rolfes house but when she came outside she had her son with her she took her boy to the harborside inn she what she even sent him up to the car the decoy was in while she moved around back to shoot you well her from behind oh my god the tactical team didnt want to move in while michelle and the kid were together they were afraid shed use him as a hostage they waited till they separated at the parking lot the boys fine hes in cps with his sister thank you brynn prayed silently thank you she was going to use her own child as a diversion and then shoot me right in front of him brynn could hardly believe it looks that way whats the boyfriends story rolfe theyre questioning him now but looks like he was in the dark if he should be arrested for anything its bad judgment in women his cell phone rang he looked at the caller id better take this sthe mayor were holding a press conference about the whole thing gotta get some notes he rose and stepped outside walking stiffly to his car brynn sat back on the couch staring at the ceiling silently thanking stanley mankewitz and his slim assistantjames jasons shed learnedfor leading her to michelle kepler maybe youre looking for the wrong who after their gettogether in the badcoffee restaurant brynn had looked into other motives for murdering emma feldman specifically the ones suggested by mankewitz suicidal state politicians and the kenosha company making dangerous hybrid car parts some of her other cases too but none of them had panned out she then considered jasonss comment and wondered what if the wrong who could mean not who wanted to kill herbut who was the intended victim as soon as brynn began to consider that michelle had wanted steven feldman dead not emma the case fell into place feldman was a caseworker for the citys social services department part of whose job function was checking out child abuse complaints and in extreme cases placing victims in foster homes recalling how the young woman had silenced poor amy that night in marquette state park brynn had wondered if hed been investigating michelle with an eye toward placing children she might have there was no record of a file involving anyone named michelle but brynn had recalled that at the lake house that night stevens backpack was empty while a number of emmas files were scattered on the floor had michelle thrown his files including the one about her own children into the fireplace when shed returned to lake mondac brynn had taken samples of ash from the fireplace she intimidated the state lab in gardener into analyzing it asap and learned that it was identical to ash produced by burning the manila folders issued to city workers she also found the coiled bindings of steno pads which feldman had used to take notes during field interviews eventually by talking to his colleagues and friends and reviewing scraps of notes and logs of phone calls brynn had discovered that some neighbors of a businessman named samuel rolfe had complained about his new girlfriends treatment of her young children the girlfriends name was michelle kepler bingo the milwaukee police had set up surveillance around rolfes house but before they could get a warrant to move in brynn had gotten the phone call from the purported manager of the harborside inn it struck her as suspicious and after hanging up shed checked the incoming number a prepaid mobile she was sure the clerk was michelle setting her up to be shot tom dahl called milwaukee pd and they put together a tactical team to collar the woman as soon as she left rolfes elegant house only one question remained did brynn want to arrest michelle in person the debate ragedoh how badly she wanted to but she finally decided no a detective from the milwaukee police department dressed in a kennesha county sheriffs department uniform and using a department squad car drove to the rendezvous at the harborside inn brynn mckenzie went home the bell rang againtom dahl ever properand joey let the sheriff back into the house he was grinning as he stood in the doorway to the family room get this theyve got reporters everywhere he laughed fox cbs and im not talking the local affiliates even cnn the mayors wondering if everybody who works theres blond brynn laughed thats the way they grow em in atlanta the sheriff continued michelles being transported to our lockup tonight youll want to interview her i assume you bet but not tonight i told you i have plans so is what im about to do now a good idea or a bad ideawhy even bother to ask the question it doesnt matter ive already made the decision shed done what she needed to capture the feldmans killers now it was time to begin reassembling her life or trying to she rose and walked him to the front door stepping outside he said so whats going on thats so important im making dinner for anna and joey and then were watching american idol dahl chuckled its a rerun i can tell you who wins night tom see you in the office bright and early at am on a stormy friday michelle alison kepler sat in one of the two interrogation rooms in the kennesha county sheriffs office originally for storage the rooms had been stripped of shelves and boxes and set up with fiberboard tables and plastic chairs along with a sony video recorder from best buy one of the deputies had installed a mirror hed bought at home depot but it was for effect only any experienced perp could see it wasnt twoway but in kennesha county pinching pennies was part of law enforcing minus her gun armed only with pen and paper brynn sat down across from michelle she looked over at the woman who had lied to her so ruthlessly yet brynn was oddly calm sure shed felt some sting of betrayal at the deception thinking that theyd begun that night as survivors then become allies and finally friends but kristen brynn mckenzie was a cop of course she was used to being lied to she had a goal here information to gather and it was time to get to work michelle confident as ever demanded wheres my son and daughter theyre being well taken care of brynn pleasethey need me theyll go crazy without me really this is a problem you took your son to milwaukee to help kill me brynns voice couldnt quite hide astonishment michelles face blossomed in horror no no we were just going to talk to you i wanted to apologize hes seven and you took him with you with a gun its for protection milwaukees a dangerous town i have a permit but i lost it brynn nodded her face neutral okay can i see brad hes miserable without me he could get sick he inherited my low blood sugar wasnt he adopted michelle blinked then said he needs me hes being well taken care of hes fine now youve been arrested for murder and attempted murder and assault youve been advised of your rights you can withdraw from this interview at any time and speak to an attorney do you understand what im saying michelle glanced at the red light on the video recorder and said yes do you wish to have an attorney present no ill talk to you brynn she gave a laugh after all weve been throughwhy were sisters dont you feel that i shared with you you told me about your problems at home she glanced at the camera with a sympathetic wince your son your husband were like soul mates thats pretty rare brynn really so youre waiving your right to an attorney absolutely this is all a misunderstanding i can explain everything her voice was soft reflecting the burden of the injustice that had befallen her now why were here brynn began wed like a statement from you telling the truth about what happened that night itll be much easier on you on your family what about my family she snapped you didnt talk to them did you my parents yes you didnt have any right to do that then she calmed and gave a hurt smile whyd you do that they hate me they lied to you whatever they said theyre jealous of me i was on my own from day one i made a success of my life theyre losers brynns research had revealed that this was a woman whose background appeared normal and stable but whose personality was not shed grown up in a middleclass family in madison wisconsin her parents still lived there mother fiftyseven father ten years older according to them theyd tried hard but had thrown up their hands at what michelles mother called the vindictive little thing her father called her dangerous the couple horrified at what their daughter was accused of though not completely surprised explained how michelle had made a career out of jumping from man to manand in two cases a womanliving off them then picking fights and scaring the hell out of her lovers with her enraged vengeful behavior ultimately they were grateful to see her go then shed be onto someone elsebut only if she had that someone else all lined up ahead of time shed been arrested for assault twiceattacking boyfriends whod dumped her shed stalked several men and had three restraining orders in force michelle now said you cant trust anything my family says i was abused you know theres no record of that hows there going to be a record you think my father would admit it and they threw out my complaint my father and the local police chief they were in on it together all i could do was get away i had to fend for myself it was hard for me so hard nobody ever helped me itll be easier brynn continued deflecting the womans sob story if you cooperate therere still a few things wed like to know i wasnt going to hurt you she whined i just wanted to talk you pretended to be the hotel clerk you changed your voice to sound hispanic because you wouldnt understand nobody understands me if id been me somebody would have arrested me and id never have the chance to explain i need you to understand brynn its important to me you had a weapon those men at the housethey tried to kill me i was scared ive been the victim of attacks before my father a couple of boyfriends i have restraining orders out shed filed complaints against several lovers for domestic assault but the magistrates had rejected them when the police determined that the men had solid alibis and concluded that michelle had filed out of spite you have three orders against you she smiled thats how the system works they believe the abuser they dont believe the victim lets talk about the night of april seventeenth oh i can explain that go ahead i was scheduled to have a meeting with steven feldman the caseworker i suspected brad had been abused by one of his teachers okay was this reported anywhere thats what i was going to meet with mr feldman about i took the afternoon off work and went to see him but there was a problem with the buses and by the time i got to his office hed left for the night i knew it was important and i found out he was going to his place in lake mondac he told me to come see him anytime to talk about brad he gave me his address so i asked this guy i knew hart to drive me up there that was my mistake she shook her head whats his full name thats it he only goes by hart anyway he brought his friend along compton lewis disgustinggross i shouldve said no right there but i really wanted to see steve so we all drove up to the house together i was going to talk to steven and then we were going to leave but as were driving up there they start getting weirder and weirder theyre like bet theres some nice shit in these houses and gotta be some rich people here next thing i know they see the mercedes and they pull out guns and im like shit oh no they go inside and start shooting i tried to stop them i grabbed this gun that compact glock in your possession was stolen from a gun show a half mile from where you lived with sam rolfe it was their gun michelle raised her hands to her face crying or pretending to would you like some coffee a soda some crackers for your low blood sugarlike the ones you scattered behind to lead hart and his partner after us brynn kept a completely neutral face michelle looked up eyes red face dry it reminded brynn of how shed looked throughout much of that april night im an actress brother what i bought into michelle continued i was devastated i couldnt breathe i felt so terrible here it was my fault id brought those men up there i cant tell you how bad i felt i panicked sure i lied a little but who wouldnt i was scared and then i see you in the wilderness sure i had the gun but i didnt know who you were maybe you were with them you had your uniform on but you could have been part of it i didnt know what was going on i was just scared i had to lie my life has always been about survival and what i feel worst abouti couldnt believe i did it at your house i had a panic attack i was so scared it was posttraumatic stress ive always suffered from that i thought hart was in the house you scared me the gun went off it was an accident ill live with that forever hurting your mother by accident brynn crossed her legs and looked at the waifish beautiful woman whose eyes now filled with tears an academy award performance the evidence and witnesses tell a little different story michelle and she gave the woman a synopsis of how theyd come to learn her identity and what they knew of her plan the ballistics the ash in the fireplace steven feldmans phone records the reports of her children being abused i talked to social services myself michelle steven feldmans supervisor and to the witnesses and to your sons teacher brad regularly had bruises on his arms and legs your daughter tory had marks too oh they have an accident or two you take a child into the emergency room and right away youre an abusive parent ive never beaten him oh what a politically correct world this is she snapped everybody swats their kids dont you no well you should she was smiling cruelly maybe you wouldnt be having so much trouble with joey like you were telling me and you let him get away with it my son wont get run over by a car or break his neck skateboarding children need direction they dont respect you if youre not firm and they want to respect their parents brynn now said michelle let me run through the case that weve got against you she rattled off summaries of expert testimony witness statements and forensic evidence it was overwhelming the woman began to cry its not my fault it isnt brynn reached over and shut off the camera the woman looked up cautiously she dried her eyes michelle brynn said softly heres the situation you heard the case against you you will be convicted there is no doubt in anyones mind about that if you dont cooperate youll go into a tenbyfour cell solitary confinement forever but if you do cooperate youll stay out of a superprison probably go to medium security you may have the chance to see life outside before youre too old to appreciate it can i see my children ill agree if i can see my children no brynn said firmly thats not in their interest this troubled michelle for a moment but then she asked brightly a nicer cell ill get a nicer cell yes and all i have to do is confess well thats part of it replied brynn as michelle stared at the place on the camera where the glowing red eye had been brynn mckenzie sat in the lunchroom of the kennesha county sheriffs department opposite tom dahl who was reading through the transcript of the interview the chairs were small almost like the chairs at joeys school dahls body overhung his considerably brynns did not her issue was tummy not thigh brynn was looking over her upsidedown notes and the transcript dahl startled her by slapping the transcript and looking up well you got yourself a confession good job and wont cost us much in terms of a plea shell go into sanford mediumsec no furloughs though she sees the kids only if the social worker okays it and twentyfive minimum no parole dahl ate some macaroni youre not hungry no what about hart she say anything about him hardly a word maybe hes just gone away she laughed i dont think people like him do that they may hide out for a while but they dont beam themselves off the planet like star wars that was star trek tv show before your time brynn said well too bad he cant somebody better find him fast the fbi or minneapolis pd or somebody for his own sake whys that apparently hes on a few lists hes done work for a lot of people who dont want him caughtprofessional hits and robberies extortion now the words out that he might get collared for the lake mondac thing theyre afraid hell roll over and compton lewiss family arent real happy either about what happened to their kin dahl looked at her notes she studied his baby skin his face looks younger than mine even subtracting the broken jaw and the buckshot wound wheres the justice in life whyd a pro like hart get involved in something small like this with the kepler woman dahl asked money sex that woman wasnt ugly you dont think so the sheriff laughed brynn said dont think either of those wouldve swayed him you want my opinion he was bored bored he was between jobs it came along he wanted a rush dahl nodded and wasnt smiling when he said you pointing a dramatic finger at her she blinked me just like you the sheriff waved his arm around the department well you dont exactly do this for the money you like the excitement dontcha i do it cause i love my boss heh so whats next youre going after hart i assume i need to beg the county supervisor for a budget increase nope im leaving the whole thing to the state police to follow up on dahl stopped the massage you are weve got enough going on here am i hearing this right they find hart ill interview him you bet i will but ive done my bit anyway you need somebody on the ground in the perps turf its local contacts that solve cases you just wanted to say that on the ground okay ship everything to the state boys youre sure about this i am a deputy stuck his head into the lunchroom hey brynn sorry to bother your lunch yeah we just brought that guy in the one hanging around the schools you want to talk to him you said you did sure whatd you get him for fly was undone he waive his rights yep he has an explanation dahl guffawed sure hes got an explanationhes a goddamn pervert brynn told him ill be right there the tall man with broad shoulders and a crew cut was standing on the ladder leaning against the old but wellmaintained colonial house in a pretty neighborhood south of humboldt it was a clear cool saturday morning and tasks like this were being replayed at thousands and thousands of homes around the country the man was painting the shutters dark green funny brynn reflected in her ten years of living here shed always thought that green would be a pleasant color for the trim but never wondered why now she understood the house was set against a verdant pine forest a shining example of the word evergreen shed seen the trees every day but had never really been aware of them glancing over his shoulder as the camry approached he hesitated caught in midbrushstroke then slowly climbed down off the ladder he set the paint bucket on the worktable he had set up and wrapped the brush in plastic so the latex enamel wouldnt dry on the bristles keith marshall was forever meticulous brynn braked to a stop in front of the garage joey climbed out and grabbed his suitcase from the backseat hi dad keith hugged his son who tolerated the gesture and charged into the house bye mom ill pick you up after school on monday dont forget the cookies her exhusband started to say something but seemed to forget what it was as brynn shut the engine off and climbed out in the past two years shed never spent more than sixty seconds here when dropping joey off for a visit with his father hello she said keith nodded his hair was flecked with a bit of gray but he hadnt gained a pound in the past ten years what a metabolism that man had well there were the sports too he strode over to her gave her a brief hug not too hard not too soft and she was reminded of his good side of which there was much he was a cowboy of course but in the classic sense of a movie hero not like poor eric munce whose idea of policing wasnt confidence and quiet but hardware and drama so howve you been she asked not bad busy get you anything she shook her head looked up at the side of the house good color had a sale at home depot whatre you two up to this weekend fishing then were going over to the bogles barbecue tonight joey likes clay hes a good boy yeah he is his fathers got some lacrosse gear were going to try it out is there a sport that boy doesnt like brynn smiled you playing too thought i might try it im riding again are you when i can once a week or so she and keith had gone to a nearby stable a few times he wasnt though a natural equestrian i took joey last time he was good hates the helmet thats joey ill make sure he wears oneand the face guardat lacrosse keith then looked away were just going on our own us two boys after all these years divorced and the past buried if not wholly dust keith still seemed guilty about dating she found this amusing and charming hows the state police same old same old i heard they got that woman the one you saved that night the one i savedthats one way to put it she took a plea was it as bad as the rumors as soon as hed heard about the events at lake mondac keith had called to find out if brynn was all right graham had answered while she was out and though the men were always civil to each other keith had kept the conversation short content to learn that she was safe the rest of the information he would have gotten from the news or lawenforcement contacts as they leaned against the front porch railing she now gave him the details some of them at least he lifted an eyebrow he was most interested curiously not in the gunplay the bolos or the spear but in the compass you made that yep he gave one of his rare smiles and wanted to know the details there was silence for a time heavy and hot when it was obvious she wasnt getting into the car and leaving as usual keith said i put a new deck on joey told me want to see it sure he led her around to the back of the house the last weekend of may hart walked into a tavern in old town in chicago near north avenue on wells the neighborhood was different from when hed first moved here in the seventies safer but a lot less atmospheric professionals had pushed out the oldtime locals the transient hotel dwellers the folk singers and jazz musicians drunks and prostitutes fancy wine and cheese shops and organic groceries had replaced the iga and package stores the earl of old town the great folk club was gone though the comedy venue second city was still here and probably would be forever the bar hart was now striding into was born after the folk era but was still antique dating to the disco craze the time was just past twothirty saturday afternoon and there were five people inside three at the bar with one stool between them protocol among drinking strangers the other two were at a table a couple in their sixties the wife wore a brimmed red hat and was missing a front tooth living underground for a month and a half hart had grown lonely for his neighborhood and his city he also missed working but now that michelle kepler was in jail and his contact told him shed given up trying to have him killed he was comfortable surfacing and getting back to his life apparently to his shock she hadnt dimed him out during her interrogations hart dropped down heavily on a stool my god terry hart the round bartender shook his hand been a month of sundays since you been in here away on some work whereabouts what do you want smirnie and grapefruit and a burger medium no fries you got it so where new england then a while in florida the bartender got the drink and carried the square of greasy green paper with harts order to a window into the kitchen hung it up and rang a bell a dark brown hand appeared grabbed the slip then vanished the bartender returned florida last time i was there the wife and i went we sat on the deck all day long didnt go to the beach till the last day i liked the deck better we went out to eat a lot crab love those crabs where were you some place you know near miami us too miami beach you didnt get much of a tan terry never do that not good for you he drained the liquor right you are ill have another he pushed the glass toward the bartender looked around the place he sipped the new drink it was strong afternoon pours were big a few minutes later the bell rang again and his burger appeared he ate part of it slowly so ben everything good around town yeah i guess anybody come in here asking about me ha what ha like a line out of some movie james garner or some detective you know a pi hart smiled sipped his drink then ate more with his left hand he was using that arm the shot one for everything he could the muscle had atrophied but was coming back just that day hed finished with the triple steel wool on the box hed started up in wisconsin using his left hand for most of the work it was really beautiful he was proud of it the bartender said nobody while i was here expecting somebody i never know what to expect a grin hows that for a pi line you got a haircut it was much shorter a businessmans trim looks good hart grunted the man went off to refill somebody elses drink hart was thinking if people drink liquor during the day its usually vodka and mixed with something else sweet or sour nobody drinks martinis in the afternoon why is that he wondered if brynn mckenzie was eating lunch at that moment did she generally or did she wait for dinner a family dinner which put him in mind of her husband graham boyd hart wondered if theyd talked about getting back together he doubted it grahams place a nice townhouse about four miles from brynns didnt look very temporary not like harts apartment when hed broken up with his wife hed just crashed and hadnt gotten around to fixing up the place for months he thought back to being with brynn in that van next to the meth cookers camper hed never answered her question the implicit one when shed glanced at his hand are you married never answered it directly felt bad in a funny way no lies between us the bartenderd said something what that okay terry done right yeah thanks no problem espn was on the tube sports highlights hart finished his lunch the bartender collected the plate and silverware so you seeing anybody terry he asked making bartender conversation looking at the tv hart said yeah i have been surprising himself no shit who this woman i met in april he didnt know why he was saying this he supposed because it made him feel good bring her in here sometime ah think were breaking up how come she doesnt live around here the bartender grimaced yeah i hear that long distance i had a stint in the reserves and ellie and me were apart for six months that was tough wed just started going out and the fucking governor calls me up when youre married its one thing you can be away but just going out with somebodyit sucks to commute sure does where is she wisconsin the bartender paused sensing a joke for real a nod i mean its not like were talking la or samoa terry therere other problems man and woman therere always other problems hart was thinking why do so many bartenders say things in a way that sounds like its the final word on a subject were like romeo and juliet the bartender lowered his voice he understood shes jewish huh hart laughed no not religion its her job more keeps her too busy right never gets home you ask me thats bullshit women oughta stay home im not saying after the kids are grown she cant go back parttime but its the way god meant it to be yeah hart said thinking how brynn mckenzie would respond to that so thats it between you guys his chest thudded probably yeah the bartender looked away as if hed seen something troubling in harts eyeseither scary or sad hart wondered which well youll meet somebody else terry the man lifted his soda which had some rum accidentally spilled into it hart offered his own bartenderism one way or the other life goes on doesnt it i theres no answer ben im just talking hart gave a grin gotta finish packing whats the damage here the bartender tallied it up hart paid anybody comes around asking for me let me know heres a number he jotted down a prepaid mobile he used for voice mail only pocketing the twentydollar tip ben said pis huh hart smiled again he looked around the place and then headed out the door eased shut behind him as he stepped onto the sidewalk the late may sky brilliant the wind usually didnt blow in from lake michigan but hart thought he could smell the ripe scent of water on the cool breeze he pulled on sunglasses thinking back to that night in april thinking about the absence of light in marquette state park there was no such thing as a single darkness hed learned there there were hundreds of different shadesand textures and shapes too grays and blacks there werent even words to describe darkness as plentiful as types of woods and with as many different grains he supposed that if the first bullet struck him in his back high and right it exited spattering his cheek with blood and tissue he gasped more startled than hurt and looked down at the mess of the wound in his chest the second entered the back of his head the third sailed inches over him as he dropped and cracked obliquely into the window of the tavern the glass began to cascade toward the ground limp hart collided hard but silently with the sidewalk window shards flowed around him one of the bigger sheets cut his ear nearly off another sliced through his neck and the blood began to flow in earnest morning tom dahl said he was standing in brynns cubicle holding his coffee mug in one hand and two doughnuts in the other cheryl from reception had brought them they rotated the duty every monday somebody brought pastry to take the sting out of coming back to work maybe or maybe it was one of those traditions that had started for no reason and kept going because there was no reason to stop it she nodded how was your weekend the sheriff asked good she said joey was with his dad mom and i met rita and megan for brunch after church we went to brightons the buffet yep they do a good spread there dahl said reverently was nice sos the one at the marriott they have an ice statue swan gotta get there early it melts down to a duck by two ill keep that in mind brynn said you guys do anything fun not really inlaws over that father of hersman is skinny as your pencil had three helpings of chicken and before we were done he was dunking his bread in the mushroom soup at the bottom of caroles green bean casserole i mean for pitys sake thats a good casserole said brynn whod had it several times god made serving spoons for a reason dahl glanced down at the doughnut balancing on a paper plate atop his coffee mug krispy kreme today i myself am partial to the ones you bring dunkin donuts right they dont make em with that little knob anymore do they i dont know tom i just ask for three dozen they mix em up for me she kept waiting he said so you heard didnt you heard he frowned milwaukee pd called that detective working on the lake mondac case nobody called me she lifted an eyebrow hart was killed what looked gangland shot in the back of the head north side of chicago thats where he lived it turned out well how bout that brynn sat back eyed her own coffee shed seen the doughnuts but hadnt given in you were right man had some enemy or another any leads not many they find out anything about him dahl told her what chicago pd had relayed to milwaukee terrance hart was a security consultant with an office in chicago he made last year he would provide risk assessments to warehouse and manufacturing companies and arrange for security guards never been arrested never been the subject of any criminal investigation paid his taxes on time man traveled a lot though a lot the sheriff said this as if that alone was a cause for suspicion dahl added that hed been married briefly no kids marriage doesnt suit me does it suit you brynn his parents lived in pennsylvania he had one younger sibling a brother who was now a doctor a doctor brynn frowned yeah the family was pretty normal which you wouldnt expect but hart himself was always living on the edge in trouble at school a lot but like i said no arrests kept up a good front his companys done okay and get this he was a woodworker i mean highclass stuff furniture not just the bookshelves i hammer together had this sign above his workbench what a teacher of mine told me measure twice cut once not your typical hit man what was the story with the shooting pretty simple hed moved back to his townhouse from green bay where hed been hiding out but with michelle away there was no reason not to go home he went to one of his old hangouts for lunch on saturday afternoon walked out and somebody got him from behind any witnesses not really everybody in the bar hit the deck as soon as the gunplay started chicago after all nobody could tell the cops anything concrete street was deserted a few cars took off fast no tag or ids he paused theres a connection here here brynn asked watching him take a bite of the fried dough as crumbs parachuted to the faded carpet well wisconsin the ballistics on the slugs match a weapon mightve been used in a shooting in that gas station thing over in smith about six months ago exxon the clerk nearly got killed i dont remember the state police handled it nobody here was involved the same gun they think but who knows that ballistics stuff not as easy as csi makes it look brynn said so the perp here ditched the gun and somebody found it and it got sold on the street guess so recycling at its worst amen brynn sat back made a bridge across the top of her coffee mug with a skinny wood stirrer what else tom looks like theres more dahl hesitated guess i should say hart had your name in a notebook in his pocket and your address too and in the apartment they found some other things pictures pictures digital ones hed printed out of the outside of the house taken recent you could see the spring buds the pictures were in this wooden boxa fancy one looks like he made it himself well a long sigh and i have to say there were some of joeys school too no of joey just the school i was thinking he mightve been staking it out to get a feel for your schedule in his apartment he had a suitcase being packed inside was a weapon and a sound suppressor ive never see one of those except in the movies i thought they were called silencers but the detective called them a suppressor she was nodding slowly kept stirring coffee that didnt need it well take your house off the special patrol route if youre comfortable with that sure sounds like everythings accounted for tom it is case closed i dont think i ever said that not in fourteen years clutching his breakfast he wandered back to his office chestnut hair pinned up a concession to a surprise wisconsin heat wave kristen brynn mckenzie was walking past a dozen pines round and richly green sweat blossomed under the arms of her tan uniform blouse and trickled down her spine she was looking at the plants studying them closely they werent much taller than she was as she moved along she lowered her hand and let it drag across the threeinch needles they yielded without prickling she paused and looked at them recalling of course april shed been thinking a lot about those twelve hours in marquette state park remembering with odd clarity the sights and smells and feel of the trees and plants that had saved her life and that had nearly ended it why she wondered gazing at the pines would they have evolved this way these shapes and shades some the color of green jello some the shade of home depot shutters why were these needles long and soft and why had barberry brambles where amys toy chester was probably still entombed developed those terrible thorns thinking of the foliage the trees the leaves wood alive and wood dead and decaying brynn continued on found herself next to several huge camellias the blossoms widely unfolded from their tight pods cradled in waxy green leaves the petals were red the color of bright blood and her heart tapped a bit at that she kept walking now past azaleas and ligustrum and crepe myrtle ferns hibiscus wisteria then she turned the corner and a short darkcomplexioned man holding a hose blinked in surprise and said buenos dias mrs mckenzie morning juan where is he i saw his truck in the shed she walked past several piles of mulch fifteen feet high a worker in a bobcat was stirring it to prevent spontaneous combustion it could actually smolder up a storm of smoke if you didnt the rich smell surrounded her she continued on to the shed really a small barn and walked through the open door ill be with you in a second graham boyd said looking up from a workbench he was wearing safety goggles and she realized seeing only her silhouette hed be thinking she was a customer he returned to his task she noted that the carpentry was part of an expansion project and he seemed to be doing the work himself that was graham even after hed moved the last of his things out of their house hed returned to finish the kitchen tiling and had done a damn good job of it then he was looking up again realizing who she was he set the board down and took the goggles off hi she nodded he frowned everything okay with joey oh sure fine he joined her they didnt embrace he squinted looking at her cheek you had that surgery vanity you cant see a thing hows it feel insides tender have to watch what i eat she looked around the building youre expanding just doing what shouldve been done a long time ago anna says shes doing better i called she said more houseridden than she needs to be the doctors want her to walk more i want her out more too she laughed and joeys been off skateboards without a cop present hmm grandma gave me a report thats a capital

milwaukee they said theyd arrested her you didnt even get mentioned not by name i didnt go along for the party i was off that night you she nodded didnt they interview you at least the reporters what do i need publicity for brynn was suddenly awkward her face burned like that of a middleschool girl alone at a dance she thought back to her very first traffic stop shed been so nervous shed returned to her squad car without handing the driver his copy of the ticket hed politely called her back and asked for it nervous now nervous all last nightafter her mother had said shed run into graham at the senior center and brynn had stopped her cold so come on mom what is this a campaign to get us back together hell yes and its one i aim to win its not that easy not that simple whenve you ever wanted easy your brother and sister yes not you okay i was thinking about going to see him tomorrow im not ready tomorrow a worker stuck his head in and asked graham a question he answered in spanish all brynn caught were the words for in the middle he turned back said nothing okay now just wondering she said im on break youve been up since six ill bet and ive been up since six just wondered if you wanted to get coffee or something and she was thinking to spend some time talking telling him more about what happened that night in april and telling him a lot of other things too whatever hed listen to shed tell him just like a few weeks ago when shed sat in the backyard with keith and done the same part confession part apology part just plain talking her ex though cautious at first had been pleased to listen she wondered if her present husband would she surely hoped so several heartbeats of pause sure he said let me finish this board okay ill be at the diner graham turned away and then stopped he looked back at her shook his head frowning brynn mckenzie found herself nodding she understood understood completely graham boyd had been flustered at first seeing her just appear like this hed agreed impulsively not knowing what to make of her invitation now reality had returned he was recalling his own anger and pain from that night in april and from the months leading up to it he had no interest in whatever she was up to here ah well she couldnt blame him one bit the moment for conversations of the sort she had planned had come and gone long ago flawed jaw set and fixed cheek taut brynn gave a wan smile but before she could say thats okay graham was explaining im not really into the diner much anymore theres a new place in the mall opened up coffees a lot better pretty good hot chocolate too she blinked where is it downstairs next to sears ill be ten minutes about the author a former journalist folksinger and attorney jeffery deaver is an international number one bestselling
