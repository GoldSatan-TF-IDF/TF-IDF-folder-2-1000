michael connelly the brass verdict things are finally looking up for defense attorney mickey haller after two years of wrong turns haller is back in the courtroom when hollywood lawyer jerry vincent is murdered haller inherits his biggest case yet the defense of walter elliott a prominent studio executive accused of murdering his wife and her lover but as haller prepares for the case that could launch him into the big time he learns that vincents killer may be coming for him next enter harry bosch determined to find vincents killer he is not opposed to using haller as bait but as danger mounts and the stakes rise these two loners realize their only choice is to work together bringing together michael connellys two most popular characters the brass verdict is sure to be his biggest book yet book in the harry bosch series in memory of terry hansen and frank morgan part one rope a dope one everybody lies cops lie lawyers lie witnesses lie the victims lie a trial is a contest of lies and everybody in the courtroom knows this the judge knows this even the jury knows this they come into the building knowing they will be lied to they take their seats in the box and agree to be lied to the trick if you are sitting at the defense table is to be patient to wait not for just any lie but for the one you can grab on to and forge like hot iron into a sharpened blade you then use that blade to rip the case open and spill its guts out on the floor thats my job to forge the blade to sharpen it to use it without mercy or conscience to be the truth in a place where everybody lies two i was in the fourth day of trial in department in the downtown criminal courts building when i got the lie that became the blade that ripped the case open my client barnett woodson was riding two murder charges all the way to the steelgray room in san quentin where they serve you jesus juice direct through the arm woodson a twentysevenyearold drug dealer from compton was accused of robbing and killing two college students from westwood they had wanted to buy cocaine from him he decided instead to take their money and kill them both with a sawedoff shotgun or so the prosecution said it was a blackonwhite crime and that made things bad enough for woodson especially coming just four months after the riots that had torn the city apart but what made his situation even worse was that the killer had attempted to hide the crime by weighing down the two bodies and dropping them into the hollywood reservoir they stayed down for four days before popping to the surface like apples in a barrel rotten apples the idea of dead bodies moldering in the reservoir that was a primary source of the citys drinking water caused a collective twist in the communitys guts when woodson was linked by phone records to the dead men and arrested the public outrage directed toward him was almost palpable the district attorneys office promptly announced it would seek the death penalty the case against woodson however wasnt all that palpable it was constructed largely of circumstantial evidence the phone records and the testimony of witnesses who were criminals themselves and states witness ronald torrance sat front and center in this group he claimed that woodson confessed the killings to him torrance had been housed on the same floor of the mens central jail as woodson both men were kept in a highpower module that contained sixteen singleprisoner cells on two tiers that opened onto a dayroom at the time all sixteen prisoners in the module were black following the routine but questionable jail procedure of segregating for safety which entailed dividing prisoners according to race and gang affiliation to avoid confrontations and violence torrance was awaiting trial on robbery and aggravated assault charges stemming from his involvement in looting during the riots highpower detainees had six am to six pm access to the dayroom where they ate and played cards at tables and otherwise interacted under the watchful eyes of guards in an overhead glass booth according to torrance it was at one of these tables that my client had confessed to killing the two westside boys the prosecution went out of its way to make torrance presentable and believable to the jury which had only three black members he was given a shave his hair was taken out of cornrows and trimmed short and he was dressed in a pale blue suit with no tie when he arrived in court on the fourth day of woodsons trial in direct testimony elicited by jerry vincent the prosecutor torrance described the conversation he allegedly had with woodson one morning at one of the picnic tables woodson not only confessed to the killings he said but furnished torrance with many of the telling details of the murders the point made clear to the jury was that these were details that only the true killer would know during the testimony vincent kept torrance on a tight leash with long questions designed to elicit short answers the questions were overloaded to the point of being leading but i didnt bother objecting even when judge companioni looked at me with raised eyebrows practically begging me to jump in but i didnt object because i wanted the counterpoint i wanted the jury to see what the prosecution was doing when it was my turn i was going to let torrance run with his answers while i hung back and waited for the blade vincent finished his direct at eleven am and the judge asked me if i wanted to take an early lunch before i began my cross i told him no i didnt need or want a break i said it like i was disgusted and couldnt wait another hour to get at the man on the stand i stood up and took a big thick file and a legal pad with me to the lectern mr torrance my name is michael haller i work for the public defenders office and represent barnett woodson have we met before no sir i didnt think so but you and the defendant mr woodson you two go back a long way correct torrance gave an aw shucks smile but i had done the due diligence on him and i knew exactly who i was dealing with he was thirtytwo years old and had spent a third of his life in jails and prisons his schooling had ended in the fourth grade when he stopped going to school and no parent seemed to notice or care under the states threestrike law he was facing the lifetime achievement award if convicted of charges he robbed and pistolwhipped the female manager of a coin laundry the crime had been committed during three days of rioting and looting that ripped through the city after the notguilty verdicts were announced in the trial of four police officers accused of the excessive beating of rodney king a black motorist pulled over for driving erratically in short torrance had good reason to help the state take down barnett woodson well we go back a few months is all torrance said to highpower did you say higher power i asked playing dumb are you talking about a church or some sort of religious connection no highpower module in county so youre talking about jail correct thats right so youre telling me that you didnt know barnett woodson before that i asked the question with surprise in my voice no sir we met for the first time in the jail i made a note on the legal pad as if this were an important concession so then lets do the math mr torrance barnett woodson was transferred into the highpower module where you were already residing on the fifth of september earlier this year do you remember that yeah i remember him coming in yeah and why were you there in highpower vincent stood and objected saying i was covering ground he had already trod in direct testimony i argued that i was looking for a fuller explanation of torrance s incarceration and judge companioni allowed me the leeway he told torrance to answer the question like i said i got a count of assault and one of robbery and these alleged crimes took place during the riots is that correct with the antipolice climate permeating the citys minority communities since even before the riots i had fought during jury selection to get as many blacks and browns on the panel as i could but here was a chance to work on the five white jurors the prosecution had been able to get by me i wanted them to know that the man the prosecution was hanging so much of its case on was one of those responsible for the images they saw on their television sets back in may yeah i was out there like everybody else torrance answered cops get away with too much in this town you ask me i nodded like i agreed and your response to the injustice of the verdicts in the rodney king beating case was to go out and rob a sixtytwoyearold woman and knock her unconscious with a steel trash can is that correct sir torrance looked over at the prosecution table and then past vincent to his own lawyer sitting in the first row of the gallery whether or not they had earlier rehearsed a response to this question his legal team couldnt help torrance now he was on his own i didnt do that he finally said youre innocent of the crime you are charged with thats right what about looting you committed no crimes during the riots after a pause and another glance at his attorney torrance said i take the fifth on that as expected i then took torrance through a series of questions designed so that he had no choice but to incriminate himself or refuse to answer under the protections of the fifth amendment finally after he took the nickel six times the judge grew weary of the point being made over and over and prodded me back to the case at hand i reluctantly complied all right enough about you mr torrance i said lets get back to you and mr woodson you knew the details of this doublemurder case before you even met mr woodson in lockup no sir are you sure it got a lot of attention i been in jail man they dont have television or newspapers in jail i dont read no papers and the modules tv been broke since i got there we made a fuss and they said theyd fix it but they aint fixed shit the judge admonished torrance to check his language and the witness apologized i moved on according to the jails records mr woodson arrived in the highpower module on the fifth of september and according to the states discovery material you contacted the prosecution on october second to report his alleged confession does that sound right to you yeah that sounds right well not to me mr torrance you are telling this jury that a man accused of a double murder and facing the possible death penalty confessed to a man he had known for less than four weeks torrance shrugged before answering thats what happened so you say what will you get from the prosecution if mr woodson is convicted of these crimes i dont know nobody has promised me nothing with your prior record and the charges you currently face you are looking at more than fifteen years in prison if youre convicted correct i dont know about any of that you dont no sir i let my lawyer handle all that he hasnt told you that if you dont do something about this you might go to prison for a long long time he hasnt told me none of that i see what have you asked the prosecutor for in exchange for your testimony nothing i dont want nothing so then you are testifying here because you believe it is your duty as a citizen is that correct the sarcasm in my voice was unmistakable thats right torrance responded indignantly i held the thick file up over the lectern so he could see it do you recognize this file mr torrance no not that i recall i dont you sure you dont remember seeing it in mr woodsons cell never been in his cell are you sure that you didnt sneak in there and look through his discovery file while mr woodson was in the dayroom or in the shower or maybe in court sometime no i did not my client had many of the investigative documents relating to his prosecution in his cell these contained several of the details you testified to this morning you dont think that is suspicious torrance shook his head no all i know is that he sat there at the table and told me what hed done he was feeling poorly about it and opened up to me it aint my fault people open up to me i nodded as if sympathetic to the burden torrance carried as a man others confided in especially when it came to double murders of course not mr torrance now can you tell the jury exactly what he said to you and dont use the shorthand you used when mr vincent was asking the questions i want to hear exactly what my client told you give us his words please torrance paused as if to probe his memory and compose his thoughts well he finally said we were sittin there the both of us by ourselves and he just started talkin about feelin bad about what hed done i asked him whatd you do and he told me about that night he killed the two fellas and how he felt pretty rough about it the truth is short lies are long i wanted to get torrance talking in long form something vincent had successfully avoided jailhouse snitches have something in common with all con men and professional liars they seek to hide the con in misdirection and banter they wrap cotton around their lies but in all of that fluff you often find the key to revealing the big lie vincent objected again saying the witness had already answered the questions i was asking and i was simply badgering him at this point your honor i responded this witness is putting a confession in my clients mouth as far as the defense is concerned this is the case right here the court would be remiss if it did not allow me to fully explore the content and context of such damaging testimony judge companioni was nodding in agreement before i finished the last sentence he overruled vincents objection and told me to proceed i turned my attention back to the witness and spoke with impatience in my voice mr torrance you are still summarizing you claim mr woodson confessed to the murders so then tell the jury what he said to you what were the exact words he said to you when he confessed to this crime torrance nodded as if he were just then realizing what i was asking for the first thing he said to me was man i feel bad and i said for what my brother he said he kept thinking about those two guys i didnt know what he was talking about cause like i said i hadnt heard nothin about the case you know so i said what two guys and he said the two niggers i dumped in the reservoir i asked what it was all about and he told me about blasting them both with a shorty and wrappin them up in chicken wire and such he said i made one bad mistake and i asked him what it was he said i shoulda taken a knife and opened up their bellies so they wouldnt end up floatin to the top the way they did and that was what he told me in my peripheral vision i had seen vincent flinch in the middle of torrances long answer and i knew why i carefully moved in with the blade did mr woodson use that word he called the victims niggers yeah he said that i hesitated as i worked on the phrasing of the next question i knew vincent was waiting to object if i gave him the opening i could not ask torrance to interpret i couldnt use the word why when it came to woodsons meaning or motivation that was objectionable mr torrance in the black community the word nigger could mean different things could it not spose is that a yes yes the defendant is africanamerican correct torrance laughed looks like it to me as are you correct sir torrance started to laugh again since i was born he said the judge tapped his gavel once and looked at me mr haller is this really necessary i apologize your honor please move on mr torrance when mr woodson used that word as you say he did did it shock you torrance rubbed his chin as he thought about the question then he shook his head not really why werent you shocked mr torrance i guess its cause i hear it all a time man from other black men thats right i heard it from white folks too well when fellow black men use that word like you say mr woodson did who are they talking about vincent objected saying that torrance could not speak for what other men were talking about companioni sustained the objection and i took a moment to rework the path to the answer i wanted okay mr torrance i finally said lets talk only about you then okay do you use that word on occasion i think i have all right and when you have used it who were you referring to torrance shrugged other fellas other black men thats right have you ever on occasion referred to white men as niggers torrance shook his head no okay so then what did you take the meaning to be when barnett woodson described the two men who were dumped in the reservoir as niggers vincent moved in his seat going through the body language of making an objection but not verbally following through with it he must have known it would be useless i had led torrance down the path and he was mine torrance answered the question i took it that they were black and he killed em both now vincents body language changed again he sank a little bit in his seat because he knew his gamble in putting a jailhouse snitch on the witness stand had just come up snake eyes i looked up at judge companioni he knew what was coming as well your honor may i approach the witness you may the judge said i walked to the witness stand and put the file down in front of torrance it was legal size well worn and faded orange a color used by county jailers to denote private legal documents that an inmate is authorized to possess okay mr torrance i have placed before you a file in which mr woodson keeps discovery documents provided to him in jail by his attorneys i ask you once again if you recognize it i seen a lotta orange files in highpower it dont mean i seen that one you are saying you never saw mr woodson with his file i dont rightly remember mr torrance you were with mr woodson in the same module for thirtytwo days you testified he confided in you and confessed to you are you saying you never saw him with that file he didnt answer at first i had backed him into a nowin corner i waited if he continued to claim he had never seen the file then his claim of a confession from woodson would be suspect in the eyes of the jury if he finally conceded that he was familiar with the file then he opened a big door for me whatm saying is that i seen him with his file but i never looked at what was in it bang i had him then ill ask you to open the file and inspect it the witness followed the instruction and looked from side to side at the open file i went back to the lectern checking on vincent on my way his eyes were downcast and his face was pale what do you see when you open the file mr torrance one sides got photos of two bodies on the ground theyre stapled in there the photos i mean and the other side is a bunch of documents and reports and such could you read from the first document there on the right side just read the first line of the summary no i cant read you cant read at all not really i didnt get the schooling can you read any of the words that are next to the boxes that are checked at the top of the summary torrance looked down at the file and his eyebrows came together in concentration i knew that his reading skills had been tested during his last stint in prison and were determined to be at the lowest measurable level below secondgrade skills not really he said i cant read i quickly walked over to the defense table and grabbed another file and a sharpie pen out of my briefcase i went back to the lectern and quickly printed the word caucasian on the outside of the file in large block letters i held the file up so that torrance as well as the jury could see it mr torrance this is one of the words checked on the summary can you read this word vincent immediately stood but torrance was already shaking his head and looking thoroughly humiliated vincent objected to the demonstration without proper foundation and companioni sustained i expected him to i was just laying the groundwork for my next move with the jury and i was sure most of them had seen the witness shake his head okay mr torrance i said lets move to the other side of the file could you describe the bodies in the photos um two men it looks like they opened up some chicken wire and some tarps and theyre laying there a bunch a police is there investigatin and takin pictures what race are the men on the tarps theyre black have you ever seen those photographs before mr torrance vincent stood to object to my question as having previously been asked and answered but it was like holding up a hand to stop a bullet the judge sternly told him he could take his seat it was his way of telling the prosecutor he was going to have to just sit back and take what was coming you put the liar on the stand you take the fall with him you may answer the question mr torrance i said after vincent sat down have you ever seen those photographs before no sir not before right now would you agree that the pictures portray what you described to us earlier that being the bodies of two slain black men thats what it looks like but i aint seen the picture before just what he tell me are you sure something like these i wouldnt forget youve told us mr woodson confessed to killing two black men but he is on trial for killing two white men wouldnt you agree that it appears that he didnt confess to you at all no he confessed he told me he killed those two i looked up at the judge your honor the defense asks that the file in front of mr torrance be admitted into evidence as defense exhibit one vincent made a lackoffoundation objection but companioni overruled it will be admitted and well let the jury decide whether mr torrance has or hasnt seen the photographs and contents of the file i was on a roll and decided to go all in thank you i said your honor now might also be a good time for the prosecutor to reacquaint his witness with the penalties for perjury it was a dramatic move made for the benefit of the jury i was expecting i would have to continue with torrance and eviscerate him with the blade of his own lie but vincent stood and asked the judge to recess the trial while he conferred with opposing counsel this told me i had just saved barnett woodsons life the defense has no objection i told the judge three after the jury filed out of the box i returned to the defense table as the courtroom deputy was moving in to cuff my client and take him back to the courtroom holding cell that guys a lying sack of shit woodson whispered to me i didnt kill two black guys they were white my hope was that the deputy hadnt heard that why dont you shut the fuck up i whispered right back and next time you see that lying sack of shit in lockup you ought to shake his hand because of his lies the prosecutors about to come off of the death penalty and float a deal ill be back there to tell you about it as soon as i get it woodson shook his head dramatically yeah well maybe i dont want no deal now they put a goddamn liar on the stand man this whole case should go down the toilet we can win this motherfucker haller dont take no deal i stared at woodson for a moment i had just saved his life but he wanted more he felt entitled because the state hadnt played fair never mind responsibility for the two kids he had just admitted to killing dont get greedy barnett i told him ill be back with the news as soon as i get it the deputy took him through the steel door that led to the holding cells attached to the courtroom i watched him go i had no false conceptions about barnett woodson i had never directly asked him but i knew he had killed those two westside boys that wasnt my concern my job was to test the states case against him with the best of my skills thats how the system worked i had done that and had been given the blade i would now use it to improve his situation significantly but woodsons dream of walking away from those two bodies that had turned black in the water was not in the cards he might not have understood this but his underpaid and underappreciated public defender certainly did after the courtroom cleared vincent and i were left looking at each other from our respective tables so i said vincent shook his head first of all he said i want to make it clear that obviously i didnt know torrance was lying sure why would i sabotage my own case like this i waved off the mea culpa look jerry dont bother i told you in pretrial that the guy had copped the discovery my client had in his cell its common sense my guy wouldnt have said shit to your guy a perfect stranger and everybody knew it except you vincent emphatically shook his head i did not know it haller he came forward was vetted by one of our best investigators and there was no indication of a lie no matter how improbable it would seem that your client talked to him i laughed that off in an unfriendly way not talked to him jerry confessed to him a little difference there so you better check with this prized investigator of yours because he isnt worth the county paycheck look he told me the guy couldnt read so there was no way he could have gotten what he knew out of the discovery he didnt mention the photos exactly and thats why you should find yourself a new investigator and ill tell you what jerry im usually pretty reasonable about this sort of stuff i try to go along to get along with the das office but i gave you fair warning about this guy so after the break im going to gut him right there on the stand and all youre going to be able to do is sit there and watch i was in full outrage now and a lot of it was real its called rope a dope but when im done with torrance hes not the only one whos going to look like a dope that jurys going to know that you either knew this guy was a liar or you were too dumb to realize it either way youre not coming off too good vincent looked down blankly at the prosecution table and calmly straightened the case files stacked in front of him he spoke in a quiet voice i dont want you going forward with the cross he said fine then cut the denials and the bullshit and give me a dispo i can ill drop the death penalty twentyfive to life without i shook my head without hesitation thats not going to do it the last thing woodson said before they took him back was that he was willing to roll the dice to be exact he said we can win this motherfucker and i think he could be right then what do you want haller ill go fifteen max i think i can sell that to him vincent emphatically shook his head no way theyll send me back to filing buybusts if i give you that for two coldblooded murders my best offer is twentyfive with parole thats it under current guidelines he could be out in sixteen seventeen years not bad for what he did killing two kids like that i looked at him trying to read his face looking for the tell i decided i believed it was going to be the best he would do and he was right it wasnt a bad deal for what barnett woodson had done i dont know i said i think hell say roll the dice vincent shook his head and looked at me then youll have to sell it to him haller because i cant go lower and if you continue the cross then my career in the das office is probably finished now i hesitated before responding wait a minute what are you saying jerry that i have to clean your mess up for you i catch you with your pants around your ankles and its my client that has to take it in the ass im saying its a fair offer to a man who is guilty as sin more than fair go talk to him and work your magic mick convince him we both know youre not long for the public defenders office you might need a favor from me someday when youre out there in the big bad world with no steady paycheck coming in i just stared back at him registering the quid pro quo of the offer i help him and somewhere down the line he helps me and barnett woodson does an extra couple of years in stir hell be lucky to last five years in there let alone twenty vincent said whats the difference to him but you and i were going places mickey we can help each other here i nodded slowly vincent was only a few years older than me but was trying to act like some kind of wise old sage the thing is jerry if i did what you suggest then id never be able to look another client in the eye again i think id end up being the dope that got roped i stood up and gathered my files my plan was to go back and tell barnett woodson to roll the dice and let me see what i could do ill see you after the break i said and then i walked away part two suitcase city four it was a little early in the week for lorna taylor to be calling and checking on me usually she waited until at least thursday never tuesday i picked up the phone thinking it was more than a checkin call lorna mickey whereve you been ive been calling all morning i went for my run i just got out of the shower you okay im fine are you sure what is you got a forthwith from judge holder she wants to see you like an hour ago this gave me pause about what i dont know all i know is first michaela called then the judge herself called that usually doesnt happen she wanted to know why you werent responding i knew that michaela was michaela gill the judges clerk and mary townes holder was the chief judge of the los angeles superior court the fact that she had called personally didnt make it sound like they were inviting me to the annual justice ball mary townes holder didnt call lawyers without a good reason what did you tell her i just said you didnt have court today and you might be out on the golf course i dont play golf lorna look i couldnt think of anything its all right ill call the judge give me the number mickey dont call just go the judge wants to see you in chambers she was very clear about that and she wouldnt tell me why so just go okay im going i have to get dressed mickey what how are you really doing i knew her code i knew what she was asking she didnt want me appearing in front of a judge if i wasnt ready for it you dont have to worry lorna im fine ill be fine okay call me and let me know what is going on as soon as you can dont worry i will i hung up the phone feeling like i was being bossed around by my wife not my exwife five as the chief judge of the los angeles superior court judge mary townes holder did most of her work behind closed doors her courtroom was used on occasion for emergency hearings on motions but rarely used for trials her work was done out of the view of the public in chambers her job largely pertained to the administration of the justice system in los angeles county more than two hundred fifty judgeships and forty courthouses fell under her purview every jury summons that went into the mail had her name on it and every assigned parking space in a courthouse garage had her approval she assigned judges by both geography and designation of law criminal civil juvenile and family when judges were newly elected to the bench it was judge holder who decided whether they sat in beverly hills or compton and whether they heard highstakes financial cases in civil court or souldraining divorce cases in family court i had dressed quickly in what i considered my lucky suit it was an italian import from corneliani that i used to wear on verdict days since i hadnt been in court for a year or heard a verdict for even longer i had to take it out of a plastic bag hanging in the back of the closet after that i sped downtown without delay thinking that i might be headed toward some sort of verdict on myself as i drove my mind raced over the cases and clients i had left behind a year earlier as far as i knew nothing had been left open or on the table but maybe there had been a complaint or the judge had picked up on some courthouse gossip and was running her own inquiry regardless i entered holders courtroom with a lot of trepidation a summons from any judge was usually not good news a summons from the chief judge was even worse the courtroom was dark and the clerks pod next to the bench was empty i walked through the gate and was heading toward the door to the back hallway when it opened and the clerk stepped through it michaela gill was a pleasantlooking woman who reminded me of my thirdgrade teacher but she wasnt expecting to find a man approaching the other side of the door when she opened it she startled and nearly let out a shriek i quickly identified myself before she could make a run for the panic button on the judges bench she caught her breath and then ushered me back without delay i walked down the hallway and found the judge alone in her chambers working at a massive desk made of dark wood her black robe was hanging on a hat rack in the corner she was dressed in a maroon suit with a conservative cut she was attractive and neat midfifties with a slim build and brown hair kept in a short nononsense style i had never met judge holder before but i knew about her she had put twenty years in as a prosecutor before being appointed to the bench by a conservative governor she presided over criminal cases had a few of the big ones and was known for handing out maximum sentences consequently she had been easily retained by the electorate after her first term she had been elected chief judge four years later and had held the position ever since mr haller thank you for coming she said im glad your secretary finally found you there was an impatient if not imperious tone to her voice shes not actually my secretary judge but she found me sorry it took so long well youre here i dont believe we have met before have we i dont think so well this will betray my age but i actually opposed your father in a trial once one of his last cases i believe i had to readjust my estimate of her age she would have to be at least sixty if she had ever been in a courtroom with my father i was actually third chair on a case just out of usc law and green as can be they were trying to give me some trial exposure it was a murder case and they let me handle one witness i prepared a week for my examination and your father destroyed the man on cross in ten minutes we won the case but i never forgot the lesson be prepared for anything i nodded over the years i had met several older lawyers who had mickey haller sr stories to share i had very few of my own before i could ask the judge about the case on which shed met him she pressed on but thats not why i called you here she said i didnt think so judge it sounded like you have something kind of urgent i do did you know jerry vincent i was immediately thrown by her use of the past tense jerry yes i know jerry what about him hes dead dead murdered actually when last night im sorry my eyes dropped and i looked at the nameplate on her desk honorable m t holder was carved in script into a twodimensional wooden display that held a ceremonial gavel and a fountain pen and inkwell how close were you she asked it was a good question and i didnt really know the answer i kept my eyes down as i spoke we had cases against each other when he was with the da and i was at the pd we both left for private practice around the same time and both of us had oneman shops over the years we worked some cases together a couple of drug trials and we sort of covered for each other when it was needed he threw me a case occasionally when it was something he didnt want to handle i had had a professional relationship with jerry vincent every now and then we clicked glasses at four green fields or saw each other at a ball game at dodger stadium but for me to say we were close would have been an exaggeration i knew little about him outside of the world of law i had heard about a divorce a while back on the courthouse gossip line but had never even asked him about it that was personal information and i didnt need to know it you seem to forget mr haller but i was with the da back when mr vincent was a young upandcomer but then he lost a big case and his star faded that was when he left for private practice i looked at the judge but said nothing and i seem to recall that you were the defense attorney on that case she added i nodded barnett woodson i got an acquittal on a double murder he walked out of the courtroom and sarcastically apologized to the media for getting away with murder he had to rub the das face in it and that pretty much ended jerrys career as a prosecutor then why would he ever work with you or throw you cases because judge by ending his career as a prosecutor i started his career as a defense attorney i left it at that but it wasnt enough for her and and a couple of years later he was making about five times what he had made with the da he called me up one day and thanked me for showing him the light the judge nodded knowingly it came down to money he wanted the money i shrugged like i was uncomfortable answering for a dead man and didnt respond what happened to your client the judge asked what became of the man who got away with murder he wouldve been better off taking a conviction woodson got killed in a driveby about two months after the acquittal the judge nodded again this time as if to say end of story justice served i tried to put the focus back on jerry vincent i cant believe this about jerry do you know what happened thats not clear he was apparently found late last night in his car in the garage at his office he had been shot to death i am told that the police are still there at the crime scene and there have been no arrests all of this comes from a times reporter who called my chambers to make an inquiry about what will happen now with mr vincents clients especially walter elliot i nodded for the last twelve months i had been in a vacuum but it wasnt so airtight that i hadnt heard about the movie mogul murder case it was just one in a string of bigtime cases vincent had scored over the years despite the woodson fiasco his pedigree as a high profile prosecutor had set him up from the start as an upperechelon criminal defense attorney he didnt have to go looking for clients they came looking for him and usually they were clients who could pay or had something to say meaning they had at least one of three attributes they could pay top dollar for legal representation they were demonstrably innocent of the charges lodged against them or they were clearly guilty but had public opinion and sentiment on their side these were clients he could get behind and forthrightly defend no matter what they were accused of clients who didnt make him feel greasy at the end of the day and walter elliot qualified for at least one of those attributes he was the chairmanowner of archway pictures and a very powerful man in hollywood he had been charged with murdering his wife and her lover in a fit of rage after discovering them together in a malibu beach house the case had all sorts of connections to sex and celebrity and was drawing wide media attention it had been a publicity machine for vincent and now it would go up for grabs the judge broke through my reverie are you familiar with rpc twothreehundred she asked i involuntarily gave myself away by squinting my eyes at the question uh not exactly let me refresh your memory it is the section of the california bars rules of professional conduct referring to the transfer or sale of a law practice we of course are talking about a transfer in this case mr vincent apparently named you as his second in his standard contract of representation this allowed you to cover for him when he needed it and included you if necessary in the attorneyclient relationship additionally i have found that he filed a motion with the court ten years ago that allowed for the transfer of his practice to you should he become incapacitated or deceased the motion has never been altered or updated but its clear what his intentions were i just stared at her i knew about the clause in vincents standard contract i had the same in mine naming him but what i realized was that the judge was telling me that i now had jerrys cases all of them walter elliot included this of course did not mean i would keep all of the cases each client would be free to move on to another attorney of their choosing once apprised of vincents demise but it meant that i would have the first shot at them i started thinking about things i hadnt had a client in a year and the plan was to start back slow not with a full caseload like the one i had apparently just inherited however the judge said before you get too excited about this proposition i must tell you that i would be remiss in my role as chief judge if i did not make every effort to ensure that mr vincents clients were transferred to a replacement counsel of good standing and competent skill now i understood she had called me in to explain why i would not be appointed to vincents clients she was going to go against the dead lawyers wishes and appoint somebody else most likely one of the highdollar contributors to her last reelection campaign last i had checked id contributed exactly nothing to her coffers over the years but then the judge surprised me ive checked with some of the judges she said and i am aware that you have not been practicing law for almost a year i have found no explanation for this before i issue the order appointing you replacement counsel in this matter i need to be assured that i am not turning mr vincents clients over to the wrong man i nodded in agreement hoping it would buy me a little time before i had to respond judge youre right i sort of took myself out of the game for a while but i just started taking steps to get back in why did you take yourself out she asked it bluntly her eyes holding mine and looking for anything that would indicate evasion of the truth in my answer i spoke very carefully judge i had a case a couple years ago the clients name was louis roulet he was i remember the case mr haller you got shot but as you say that was a couple years ago i seem to remember you practicing law for some time after that i remember the news stories about you coming back to the job well i said what happened is i came back too soon i had been gut shot judge and i shouldve taken my time instead i hurried back and the next thing i knew i started having pain and the doctors said i had a hernia so i had an operation for that and there were complications they did it wrong there was even more pain and another operation and well to make a long story short it knocked me down for a while i decided the second time not to come back until i was sure i was ready the judge nodded sympathetically i guessed i had been right to leave out the part about my addiction to pain pills and the stint in rehab money wasnt an issue i said i had some savings and i also got a settlement from the insurance company so i took my time coming back but im ready i was just about to take the back cover of the yellow pages then i guess inheriting an entire practice is quite convenient isnt it she said i didnt know what to say to her question or the smarmy tone in which she said it all i can tell you judge is that i would take good care of jerry vincents clients the judge nodded but she didnt look at me as she did so i knew the tell she knew something and it bothered her maybe she knew about the rehab according to bar records youve been disciplined several times she said here we were again she was back to throwing the cases to another lawyer probably some campaign contributor from century city who couldnt find his way around a criminal proceeding if his riviera membership depended on it all of it ancient history judge all of it technicalities im in good standing with the bar if you called them today then im sure you were told that she stared at me for a long moment before dropping her eyes to the document in front of her on the desk very well then she said she scribbled a signature on the last page of the document i felt the flutter of excitement begin to build in my chest here is an order transferring the practice to you the judge said you might need it when you go to his office and let me tell you this i am going to be monitoring you i want an updated inventory of cases by the beginning of next week the status of every case on the client list i want to know which clients will work with you and which will find other representation after that i want biweekly status updates on all cases in which you remain counsel am i being clear perfectly clear judge for how long what for how long do you want me to give you biweekly updates she stared at me and her face hardened until i tell you to stop she handed me the order you can go now mr haller and if i were you i would get over there and protect my new clients from any unlawful search and seizure of their files by the police if you have any problem you can always call on me i have put my afterhours number on the order yes your honor thank you good luck mr haller i stood up and headed out of the room when i got to the doorway of her chambers i glanced back at her she had her head down and was working on the next court order out in the courthouse hallway i read the twopage document the judge had given me confirming that what had just happened was real it was the document i held appointed me substitute counsel at least temporarily on all of jerry vincents cases it granted me immediate access to the fallen attorneys office files and bank accounts into which client advances had been deposited i pulled out my cell phone and called lorna taylor i asked her to look up the address of jerry vincents office she gave it to me and i told her to meet me there and to pick up two sandwiches on her way why she asked because i havent had lunch no why are we going to jerry vincents office because were back in business six i was in my lincoln driving toward jerry vincents office when i thought of something and called lorna taylor back when she didnt answer i called her cell and caught her in her car im going to need an investigator how would you feel if i called cisco there was a hesitation before she answered cisco was dennis wojciechowski her significant other as of the past year i was the one who had introduced them when i used him on a case last i heard they were now living together well i have no problem working with cisco but i wish you would tell me what this is all about lorna knew jerry vincent as a voice on the phone it was she who would take his calls when he was checking to see if i could stand in on a sentence or babysit a client through an arraignment i couldnt remember if they had ever met in person i had wanted to tell her the news in person but things were moving too quickly for that jerry vincent is dead what he was murdered last night and im getting first shot at all of his cases including walter elliot she was silent for a long moment before responding my god how he was such a nice man i couldnt remember if you had ever met him lorna worked out of her condo in west hollywood all my calls and billing went through her if there was a brickandmortar office for the law firm of michael haller and associates then her place was it but there werent any associates and when i worked my office was the backseat of my car this left few occasions for lorna to meet facetoface with any of the people i represented or associated with he came to our wedding dont you remember thats right i forgot i cant believe this what happened i dont know holder said he was shot in the garage at his office maybe ill find out something when i get there did he have a family i think he was divorced but i dont know if there were kids or what i dont think so lorna didnt say anything we both had our own thoughts occupying us let me go so i can call cisco i finally said do you know what hes doing today no he didnt say all right ill see what kind of sandwich do you want which way you coming sunset stop at dustys and get me one of those turkey sandwiches with cranberry sauce its been almost a year since ive had one of those you got it and get something for cisco in case hes hungry all right i hung up and looked up the number for dennis wojciechowski in the address book i keep in the center console compartment i had his cell phone when he answered i heard a mixture of wind and exhaust blast in the phone he was on his bike and even though i knew his helmet was set up with an earpiece and mike attached to his cell i had to yell its mickey haller pull over i waited and heard him cut the engine on his sixtythree panhead whats up mick he asked when it finally got quiet havent heard from you in a long time you gotta put the baffles back in your pipes man or youll be deaf before youre forty and then you wont be hearing from anybody im already past forty and i hear you just fine whats going on wojciechowski was a freelance defense investigator i had used on a few cases that was how he had met lorna collecting his pay but i had known him for more than ten years before that because of his association with the road saints motorcycle club a group for which i served as a de facto house counsel for several years dennis never flew rsmc colors but was considered an associate member the group even bestowed a nickname on him largely because there was already a dennis in the membership known of course as dennis the menace and his last name wojciechowski was intolerably difficult to pronounce riffing off his dark looks and mustache they christened him the cisco kid it didnt matter that he was one hundred percent polish out of the south side of milwaukee cisco was a big imposing man but he kept his nose clean while riding with the saints he never caught an arrest record and that paid off when he later applied to the state for his private investigators license now many years later the long hair was gone and the mustache was trimmed and going gray but the name cisco and the penchant for riding classic harleys built in his hometown had stuck for life cisco was a thorough and thoughtful investigator and he had another value as well he was big and strong and could be physically intimidating when necessary that attribute could be highly useful when tracking down and dealing with people who fluttered around the edges of a criminal case first of all where are you i asked burbank you on a case no just a ride why you got something for me you taking on a case finally a lot of cases and im going to need an investigator i gave him the address of vincents office and told him to meet me there as soon as he could i knew that vincent would have used either a stable of investigators or just one in particular and that there might be a loss of time as cisco got up to speed on the cases but all of that was okay with me i wanted an investigator i could trust and already had a working relationship with i was also going to need cisco to immediately start work by running down the locations of my new clients my experience with criminal defendants is that they are not always found at the addresses they put down on the client info sheet when they first sign up for legal representation after closing the phone i realized i had driven right by the building where vincents office was located it was on broadway near third street and there was too much traffic with cars and pedestrians for me to attempt a uturn i wasted ten minutes working my way back to it catching red lights at every corner by the time i got to the right place i was so frustrated that i resolved to hire a driver again as soon as possible so that i could concentrate on cases instead of addresses vincents office was in a sixstory structure called simply the legal center being so close to the main downtown courthouses both criminal and civil meant it was a building full of trial lawyers just the kind of place most cops and doctors lawyer haters probably wished would implode every time there was an earthquake i saw the opening for the parking garage next door and pulled in as i was taking the ticket out of the machine a uniformed police officer approached my car he was carrying a clipboard sir do you have business in the building here thats why im parking here sir could you state your business what business is it of yours officer sir we are conducting a crime scene investigation in the garage and i need to know your business before i can allow you in my office is in the building i said will that do it wasnt exactly a lie i had judge holders court order in my coat pocket that gave me an office in the building the answer seemed to work the cop asked to see my id and i couldve argued that he had no right to request my identification but decided that there was no need to make a federal case out of it i pulled my wallet and gave him the id and he wrote my name and drivers license number down on his clipboard then he let me through at the moment theres no parking on the second level he said they havent cleared the scene i waved and headed up the ramp when i reached the second floor i saw that it was empty of vehicles except for two patrol cars and a black bmw coupe that was being hauled onto the bed of a truck from the police garage jerry vincents car i assumed two other uniformed cops were just beginning to pull down the yellow crime scene tape that had been used to cordon off the parking level one of them signaled for me to keep going i saw no detectives around but the police werent giving up the murder scene just yet i kept going up and didnt find a space i could fit the lincoln into until i got to the fifth floor one more reason i needed to get a driver again the office i was looking for was on the second floor at the front of the building the opaque glass door was closed but not locked i entered a reception room with an empty sitting area and a nearby counter behind which sat a woman whose eyes were red from crying she was on the phone but when she saw me she put it down on the counter without so much as a hold on to whomever she was talking to are you with the police she asked no im not i replied then im sorry the office is closed today i approached the counter pulling the court order from judge holder out of the inside pocket of my suit coat not for me i said as i handed it to her she unfolded the document and stared at it but didnt seem to be reading it i noticed that in one of her hands she clutched a wad of tissues what is this she asked thats a court order i said my name is michael haller and judge holder has appointed me replacement counsel in regard to jerry vincents clients that means well be working together you can call me mickey she shook her head as if warding off some invisible threat my name usually didnt carry that sort of power you cant do this mr vincent wouldnt want this i took the court papers out of her hand and refolded them i started putting the document back into my pocket actually i can the chief judge of los angeles superior court has directed me to do this and if you look closely at the contracts of representation that mr vincent had his clients sign you will find my name already on them listed as associate counsel so what you think mr vincent would have wanted is immaterial at this point because he did in fact file the papers that named me his replacement should he become incapacitated or dead the woman had a dazed look on her face her mascara was heavy and running beneath one eye it gave her an uneven almost comical look for some reason a vision of liza minnelli jumped to my mind if you want you can call judge holders clerk and talk about it with her i said meantime i really need to get started here i know this has been a very difficult day for you its been difficult for me i knew jerry going back to his days at the da so you have my sympathy i nodded and looked at her and waited for a response but i still wasnt getting one i pressed on im going to need some things to get started here first of all his calendar i want to put together a list of all the active cases jerry was handling then im going to need you to pull the files for those its gone she said abruptly whats gone his laptop the police told me whoever did this took his briefcase out of the car he kept everything on his laptop you mean his calendar he didnt keep a hard copy thats gone too they took his portfolio that was in the briefcase her eyes were staring blankly ahead i tapped the top of the computer screen on her desk what about this computer i asked didnt he back up his calendar anywhere she didnt say anything so i asked again did jerry back up his calendar anywhere else is there any way to access it she finally looked up at me and seemed to take pleasure in responding i didnt keep the calendar he did he kept it all on his laptop and he kept a hard copy in the old portfolio he carried but theyre both gone the police made me look everywhere in here but theyre gone i nodded the missing calendar was going to be a problem but it wasnt insurmountable what about files did he have any in the briefcase i dont think so he kept all the files here okay good what were going to have to do is pull all the active cases and rebuild the calendar from the files ill also need to see any ledgers or checkbooks pertaining to the trust and operating accounts she looked up at me sharply youre not going to take his money its not i stopped took a deep breath and then started again in a calm but direct tone first of all i apologize i did this backwards i dont even know your name lets start over what is your name wren wren wren what wren williams okay wren let me explain something its not his money its his clients money and until they say otherwise his clients are now my clients do you understand now i have told you that i am aware of the emotional upheaval of the day and the shock you are experiencing im experiencing some of it myself but you need to decide right now if you are with me or against me wren because if you are with me i need you to get me the things i asked for and im going to need you to work with my case manager when she gets here if you are against me then i need you just to go home right now she slowly shook her head the detectives told me i had to stay until they were finished what detectives there were only a couple uniforms left out there when i drove in the detectives in mr vincents office you let i didnt finish i stepped around the counter and headed toward two separate doors on the back wall i picked the one on the left and opened it i walked into jerry vincents office it was large and opulent and empty i turned in a full circle until i found myself staring into the bugged eyes of a large fish mounted on the wall over a dark wood credenza next to the door i had come through the fish was a beautiful green with a white underbelly its body was arched as if it had frozen solid just at the moment it had jumped out of the water its mouth was open so wide i could have put my fist in it mounted on the wall beneath the fish was a brass plate it said if id kept my mouth shut i wouldnt be here words to live by i thought most criminal defendants talk their way into prison few talk their way out the best single piece of advice i have ever given a client is to just keep your mouth shut talk to no one about your case not even your own wife you keep close counsel with yourself you take the nickel and you live to fight another day the unmistakable sound of a metal drawer being rolled and then banged closed spun me back around on the other side of the room were two more doors both were open about a foot and through one i could see a darkened bathroom through the other i could see light i approached the lighted room quickly and pushed the door all the way open it was the file room a large windowless walkin closet with rows of steel filing cabinets going down both sides a small worktable was set up against the back wall there were two men sitting at the worktable one old one young probably one to teach and one to learn they had their jackets off and draped over the chairs i saw their guns and holsters and their badges clipped to their belts what are you doing i asked gruffly the men looked up from their reading i saw a stack of files on the table between them the older detectives eyes momentarily widened in surprise when he saw me lapd he said and i guess i should ask you the same question those are my files and youre going to have to put them down right now the older man stood up and came toward me i started pulling the court order from my jacket again my name is i know who you are the detective said but i still dont know what youre doing here i handed him the court order then this should explain it ive been appointed by the chief judge of the superior court as replacement counsel to jerry vincents clients that means his cases are now my cases and you have no right to be in here looking through files that is a clear violation of my clients right to protection against unlawful search and seizure these files contain privileged attorneyclient communications and information the detective didnt bother looking at the paperwork he quickly flipped through it to the signature and seal on the last page he didnt seem all that impressed vincents been murdered he said the motive could be sitting in one of these files the identity of the killer could be in one of them we have to no you dont what you have to do is get out of this file room right now the detective didnt move a muscle i consider this part of a crime scene he said its you who has to leave read the order detective im not going anywhere your crime scene is out in the garage and no judge in la would let you extend it to this office and these files its time for you to leave and for me to take care of my clients he made no move to read the court order or to vacate the premises if i leave he said im going to shut this place down and seal it i hated getting into pissing matches with cops but sometimes there was no choice you do that and ill have it unsealed in an hour and youll be standing in front of the chief judge of the superior court explaining how you trampled on the rights of every one of vincents clients you know depending on how many clients were talking about that might be a record even for the lapd the detective smiled at me like he was mildly amused by my threats he held up the court order you say this gives you all of these cases thats right for now the entire law practice yes but each client will decide whether to stick with me or find someone else well i guess that puts you on our list what list our suspect list thats ridiculous why would i be on it you just told us why you inherited all of the victims clients thats got to amount to some sort of a financial windfall doesnt it hes dead and you get the whole business think thats enough motivation for murder care to tell us where you were last night between eight and midnight he grinned at me again without any warmth giving me that cops practiced smile of judgment his brown eyes were so dark i couldnt see the line between iris and pupil like shark eyes they didnt seem to carry or reflect any light im not even going to begin to explain how ludicrous that is i said but for starters you can check with the judge and youll find out that i didnt even know i was in line for this so you say but dont worry well be checking you out completely good now please leave this room or i make the call to the judge the detective stepped back to the table and took his jacket off the chair he carried it rather than put it on he picked a file up off the table and brought it toward me he shoved it into my chest until i took it from him heres one of your new files back counselor dont choke on it he stepped through the door and his partner went with him i followed them out into the office and decided to take a shot at reducing the tension i had a feeling it wouldnt be the last time i saw them look detectives im sorry its like this i try to have a good relationship with the police and i am sure we can work something out but at the moment my obligation is to the clients i dont even know what i have here give me some time to we dont have time the older man said we lose momentum and we lose the case do you understand what youre getting yourself into here counselor i looked at him for a moment trying to understand the meaning behind his question i think so detective ive only been working cases for about eighteen years but im not talking about your experience im talking about what happened in that garage whoever killed vincent was waiting for him out there they knew where he was and just how to get to him he was ambushed i nodded like i understood if i were you the detective said id watch myself with those new clients of yours jerry vincent knew his killer what about when he was a prosecutor he put people in prison maybe one of well check into it but that was a long time ago i think the person were looking for is in those files with that he and his partner started moving toward the door wait i said you have a card give me a card the detectives stopped and turned back the older one pulled a card out of his pocket and gave it to me thats got all my numbers let me just get the lay of the land here and then ill call and set something up theres got to be a way for us to cooperate and still not trample on anybodys rights whatever you say youre the lawyer i nodded and looked down at the name on the card harry bosch i was sure i had never met the man before yet he had started the confrontation by saying he knew who i was look detective bosch i said jerry vincent was a colleague we werent that close but we were friends and and good luck you know with the case i hope you crack it bosch nodded and there was something familiar about the physical gesture maybe we did know each other he turned to follow his partner out of the office detective bosch once more turned back to me did we ever cross paths on a case before i think i recognize you bosch smiled glibly and shook his head no he said if wed been on a case youd remember me seven an hour later i was behind jerry vincents desk with lorna taylor and dennis wojciechowski sitting across from me we were eating our sandwiches and about to go over what we had put together from a very preliminary survey of the office and the cases the food was good but nobody had much of an appetite considering where we were sitting and what had happened to the offices predecessor i had sent wren williams home early she had been unable to stop crying or objecting to my taking control of her dead bosss cases i decided to remove the barricade rather than have to keep walking around it the last thing she asked before i escorted her through the door was whether i was going to fire her i told her the jury was still out on that question but that she should report for work as usual the next day with jerry vincent dead and wren williams gone wed been left stumbling around in the dark until lorna figured out the filing system and started pulling the active case files from calendar notations in each file shed been able to start to put together a master calendar the key component in any trial lawyers professional life once we had worked up a rudimentary calendar i began to breathe a little easier and wed broken for lunch and opened the sandwich cartons lorna had brought from dustys the calendar was light a few case hearings here and there but for the most part it was obvious that vincent was keeping things clear in advance of the walter elliot trial which was scheduled to begin with jury selection in nine days so lets start i said my mouth still full with my last bite according to the calendar weve pieced together ive got a sentencing in fortyfive minutes so i was thinking we could have a preliminary discussion now and then i could leave you two here while i go to court then ill come back and see how much farther weve gotten before cisco and i go out and start knocking on doors they both nodded their mouths still working on their sandwiches as well cisco had cranberry in his mustache but didnt know it lorna was as neat and as beautiful as ever she was a stunner with blonde hair and eyes that somehow made you think you were the center of the universe when she was looking at you i never got tired of that i had kept her on salary the whole year i was out i could afford it with the insurance settlement and i didnt want to run the risk that shed be working for another lawyer when it was time for me to come back to work lets start with the money i said lorna nodded as soon as she had gotten the active files together and placed them in front of me she had moved on to the bank books perhaps the only thing as important as the case calendar the bank books would tell us more than just how much money vincents firm had in its coffers they would give us an insight into how he ran his oneman shop all right good and bad news on the money she said hes got thirtyeight thousand in the operating account and a hundred twentynine thousand in the trust account i whistled that was a lot of cash to keep in the trust account money taken in from clients goes into the trust account as work for each client proceeds the trust account is billed and the money transferred to the operating account i always want more money in the operating account than in the trust account because once its moved into the operating account the moneys mine theres a reason why its so lopsided lorna said picking up on my surprise he just took in a check for a hundred thousand dollars from walter elliot he deposited it friday i nodded and tapped the makeshift calendar i had on the table in front of me it was drawn on a legal pad lorna would have to go out and buy a real calendar when she got the chance she would also input all of the court appointments on my computer and on an online calendar lastly and as jerry vincent had not done she would back it all up on an offsite datastorage account the elliot trial is scheduled to start thursday next week i said he took the hundred up front saying the obvious prompted a sudden realization as soon as were done here call the bank i told lorna see if the check has cleared if not try to push it through as soon as elliot hears that vincents dead hell probably try to put a stoppayment on it got it what else on the money if a hundred of its from elliot whos the rest for lorna opened one of the accounting books she had on her lap each dollar in a trust fund must be accounted for with regard to which client it is being held for at any time an attorney must be able to determine how much of a clients advance has been transferred to the operating fund and used and how much is still on reserve in trust a hundred thousand of vincents trust account was earmarked for the walter elliot trial that left only twentynine thousand received for the rest of the active cases that wasnt a lot considering the stack of files we had pulled together while going through the filing cabinets looking for live cases thats the bad news lorna said it looks like there are only five or six other cases with trust deposits with the rest of the active cases the moneys already been moved into operating or been spent or the clients owe the firm i nodded it wasnt good news it was beginning to look like jerry vincent was running ahead of his cases meaning hed been on a treadmill bringing in new cases to keep money flowing and paying for existing cases walter elliot must have been the getwell client as soon as his hundred thousand cleared vincent would have been able to turn the treadmill off and catch his breath for a while at least but he never got the chance how many clients with payment plans i asked lorna once again referred to the records on her lap hes got two on pretrial payments both are well behind what are the names it took her a moment to answer as she looked through the records uh samuels is one and henson is the other theyre both about five thousand behind and thats why we take credit cards and dont put out paper i was talking about my own business routine i had long ago stopped providing credit services i took nonrefundable cash payments i also took plastic but not until lorna had run the card and gotten purchase approval i looked down at the notes i had kept while conducting a quick review of the calendar and the active files both samuels and henson were on a sub list i had drawn up while reviewing the actives it was a list of cases i was going to cut loose if i could this was based on my quick review of the charges and facts of the cases if there was something i didnt like about a case for any reason then it went on the sub list no problem i said well cut em loose samuels was a manslaughter dui case and henson was a felony grand theft and drug possession henson momentarily held my interest because vincent was going to build a defense around the clients addiction to prescription painkillers he was going to roll sympathy and deflection defenses into one he would lay out a case in which the doctor who overprescribed the drugs to henson was the one most responsible for the consequences of the addiction he created patrick henson vincent would argue was a victim not a criminal i was intimately familiar with this defense because i had employed it repeatedly over the past two years to try to absolve myself of the many infractions i had committed in my roles as father exhusband and friend to people in my life but i put henson into what i called the dog pile because i knew at heart the defense didnt hold up at least not for me and i wasnt ready to go into court with it for him either lorna nodded and made notes about the two cases on a pad of paper so what is the score on that she asked how many cases are you putting in the dog pile we came up with thirtyone active cases i said of those im thinking only seven look like dogs so that means weve got a lot of cases where theres no money in the till ill either have to get new money or theyll go in the dog pile too i wasnt worried about having to go and get money out of the clients skill number one in criminal defense is getting the money i was good at it and lorna was even better it was getting paying clients in the first place that was the trick and wed just had two dozen of them dropped into our laps you think the judge is just going to let you drop some of these she asked nope but ill figure something out on that maybe i could claim conflict of interest the conflict being that i like to be paid for my work and the clients dont like to pay no one laughed no one even cracked a smile i moved on anything else on the money i asked lorna shook her head thats about it when youre in court im going to call the bank and get that started you want us both to be signers on the accounts yeah just like with my accounts i hadnt considered the potential difficulty of getting my hands on the money that was in the vincent accounts that was what i had lorna for she was good on the business end in ways i wasnt some days she was so good i wished we had either never gotten married or never gotten divorced see if wren williams can sign checks i said if shes on there take her off for now i want just you and me on the accounts will do you may have to go back to judge holder for a court order for the bank thatll be no problem my watch said i had ten minutes before i had to get going to court i turned my attention to wojciechowski cisco whaddaya got i had told him earlier to work his contacts and to monitor the investigation of vincents murder as closely as possible i wanted to know what moves the detectives were making because it appeared from what bosch had said that the investigation was going to be entwined with the cases i had just inherited not much cisco said the detectives havent even gotten back to parker center yet i called a guy i know in forensics and theyre still processing everything not a lot of info on what they do have but he told me about something they dont vincent was shot at least two times that they could tell at the scene and there were no shells the shooter cleaned up there was something telling in that the killer had either used a revolver or had had the presence of mind after killing a man to pick up the bullet casings ejected from his gun cisco continued his report i called another contact in communications and she told me the first call came in at twelve fortythree theyll narrow down time of death at autopsy is there a general idea of what happened it looks like vincent worked late which was apparently his routine on mondays he worked late every monday preparing for the week ahead when he was finished he packed his briefcase locked up and left he goes to the garage gets in his car and gets popped through the drivers side window when they found him the car was in park the ignition on the window was down it was in the low sixties last night he couldve put the window down because he liked the chill or he couldve lowered it for somebody coming to the car somebody he knew thats one possibility i thought about this and what detective bosch had said nobody was working in the garage no the attendant leaves at six you have to put your money in the machine after that or use your monthly pass vincent had a monthly cameras only cameras are where you drive in and out theyre license plate cameras so if somebody says they lost their ticket they can tell when the car went in that sort of thing but from what i hear from my guy in forensics there was nothing on tape that was useful the killer didnt drive into the garage he walked in either through the building or through one of the pedestrian entrances who found jerry the security guard they got one guard for the building and the garage he hits the garage a couple times a night and noticed vincents car on his second sweep the lights were on and it was running so he checked it out he thought vincent was sleeping at first then he saw the blood i nodded thinking about the scenario and how it had gone down the killer was either incredibly careless and lucky or he knew the garage had no cameras and he would be able to intercept jerry vincent there on a monday night when the space was almost deserted okay stay on it what about harry potter who the detective not potter i mean bosch harry bosch im working on that too supposedly hes one of the best retired a few years ago and the police chief himself recruited him back or so the story goes cisco referred to some notes on a pad full name is hieronymus bosch he has a total of thirtythree years on the job and you know what that means no what does it mean well under the lapds pension program you max out at thirty years meaning that you are eligible for retirement with full pension and no matter how long you stay on the job after thirty years your pension doesnt grow so it makes no economic sense to stay unless youre a man on a mission cisco nodded exactly anybody who stays past thirty isnt staying for the money or the job its more than a job wait a second i said you said hieronymus bosch like the painter the second question confused him i dont know anything about any painter but thats his name rhymes with anonymous i was told weird name if you ask me no weirder than wojciechowski if you ask me cisco was about to defend his name and heritage when lorna cut in i thought you said you didnt know him mickey i looked over at her and shook my head i never met him before today but the name i know the name you mean from the paintings i didnt want to get into a discussion of past history so distant i couldnt be sure about it never mind i said its nothing and ive got to get going i stood up cisco stay on the case and find out what you can about bosch i want to know how much i can trust the guy youre not going to let him look at the files are you lorna asked this wasnt a random crime theres a killer out there who knew how to get to jerry vincent ill feel a lot better about things if our man with a mission can figure it out and bring the bad guy in i stepped around the desk and headed toward the door ill be in judge champagnes court im taking a bunch of the active files with me to read while im waiting ill walk you out lorna said i saw her throw a look and nod at cisco so that he would stay behind we walked out to the reception area i knew what lorna was going to say but i let her say it mickey are you sure youre ready for this absolutely this wasnt the plan you were going to come back slowly remember take a couple cases and build from there instead youre taking on an entire practice im not practicing look be serious i am and im ready dont you see that this is better than the plan the elliot case not only brings in all that money but its going to be like having a billboard on top of the ccb that says im back in big neon letters yeah thats great and the elliot case alone is going to put so much pressure on you that she didnt finish but she didnt have to lorna im done with all of that im fine im over it and im ready for this i thought youd be happy about this weve got money coming in for the first time in a year i dont care about that i want to make sure you are okay im more than okay im excited i feel like in one day ive suddenly got my mojo back dont drag me down okay she stared at me and i stared back and finally a reluctant smile peeked through her stern expression all right she said then go get em dont worry i will eight despite the assurances i had given lorna thoughts about all the cases and all the setup work that needed to be done played in my mind as i walked down the hallway to the bridge that linked the office building with the garage i had forgotten that i had parked on the fifth level and ended up walking up three ramps before i found the lincoln i popped the trunk and put the thick stack of files i was carrying into my bag the bag was a hybrid i had picked up at a store called suitcase city while i was plotting my comeback it was a backpack with straps i could put over my shoulders on the days i was strong it also had a handle so i could carry it like a briefcase if i wanted and it had two wheels and a telescoping handle so i could just roll it behind me on the days i was weak lately the strong days far outnumbered the weak and i probably could have gotten by with the traditional lawyers leather briefcase but i liked the bag and was going to keep using it it had a logo on it a mountain ridgeline with the words suitcase city printed across it like the hollywood sign above it skylights swept the horizon completing the dream image of desire and hope i think that logo was the real reason i liked the bag because i knew suitcase city wasnt a store it was a place it was los angeles los angeles was the kind of place where everybody was from somewhere else and nobody really dropped anchor it was a transient place people drawn by the dream people running from the nightmare twelve million people and all of them ready to make a break for it if necessary figuratively literally metaphorically any way you want to look at it everybody in la keeps a bag packed just in case as i closed the trunk i was startled to see a man standing between my car and the one parked next to it the open trunk lid had blocked my view of his approach he was a stranger to me but i could tell he knew who i was boschs warning about vincents killer shot through my mind and the fightorflight instinct gripped me mr haller can i talk to you who the hell are you and what are you doing sneaking around peoples cars i wasnt sneaking around i saw you and cut between the other cars thats all i work for the times and was wondering if i could talk to you about jerry vincent i shook my head and blew out my breath you scared the shit out of me dont you know he got killed in this garage by somebody who came up to his car look im sorry i was just forget it i dont know anything about the case and i have to get to court but youre taking over his cases arent you signaling him out of the way i moved to the door of my car who told you that our court reporter got a copy of the order from judge holder why did mr vincent pick you were you two good friends or something i opened the door look whats your name jack mcevoy i work the police beat good for you jack but i cant talk about this right now you want to give me a card ill call you when i can talk he made no move to give me a card or to indicate hed understood what i said he just asked another question has the judge put a gag order on you no she hasnt put out a gag order i cant talk to you because i dont know anything okay when i have something to say ill say it well could you tell me why you are taking over vincents cases you already know the answer to that i was appointed by the judge i have to get to court now i ducked into the car but left the door open as i turned the key mcevoy put his elbow on the roof and leaned in to continue to try to talk me into an interview look i said ive got to go so could you stand back so i can close my door and back this tank up i was hoping we could make a deal he said quickly deal what deal what are you talking about you know information ive got the police department wired and youve got the courthouse wired it would be a twoway street you tell me what youre hearing and ill tell you what im hearing i have a feeling this is going to be a big case i need any information i can get i turned and looked up at him for a moment but wont the information youd be giving me just end up in the paper the next day i could just wait and read it not all of it will be in there some stuff you cant print even if you know its true he looked at me as though he were passing on a great piece of wisdom i have a feeling youll be hearing things before i do i said ill take my chances deal you got a card this time he took a card out of his pocket and handed it to me i held it between my fingers and draped my hand over the steering wheel i held the card up and looked at it again i figured it wouldnt hurt to get a line on inside information on the case okay deal i signaled him away again and pulled the door closed then started the car he was still there i lowered the window what i asked just remember i dont want to see your name in the other papers or on the tv saying stuff i dont have dont worry i know how it works good i dropped it into reverse but thought of something and kept my foot on the brake let me ask you a question how tight are you with bosch the lead investigator on the case i know him but nobodys really tight with him not even his own partner whats his story i dont know i never asked well is he any good at it at clearing cases yes hes very good i think hes considered one of the best i nodded and thought about bosch the man on a mission watch your toes i backed the lincoln out mcevoy called out to me just as i put the car in drive hey haller love the plate i waved a hand out the window as i drove down the ramp i tried to remember which of my lincolns i was driving and what the plate said i have a fleet of three town cars left over from my days when i carried a full case load but i had been using the cars so infrequently in the last year that i had put all three into a rotation to keep the engines in tune and the dust out of the pipes part of my comeback strategy i guess the cars were exact duplicates except for the license plates and i wasnt sure which one i was driving when i got down to the parking attendants booth and handed in my stub i saw a small video screen next to the cash register it showed the view from a camera located a few feet behind my car it was the camera cisco had told me about designed to pick up an angle on the rear bumper and license plate on the screen i could see my vanity plate iwalkem i smirked i walk em all right i was heading to court to meet one of jerry vincents clients for the first time i was going to shake his hand and then walk him right into prison nine judge judith champagne was on the bench and hearing motions when i walked into her courtroom with five minutes to spare there were eight other lawyers cooling their heels waiting their turn i parked my roller bag against the rail and whispered to the courtroom deputy explaining that i was there to handle the sentencing of edgar reese for jerry vincent he told me the judges motions calendar was running long but reese would be first out for his sentencing as soon as the motions were cleared i asked if i could see reese and the deputy got up and led me through the steel door behind his desk to the courtside holding cell there were three prisoners in the cell edgar reese i said a small powerfully built white man came over to the bars i saw prison tattoos climbing up his neck and felt relieved reese was heading back to a place he already knew i wasnt going to be holding the hand of a wideeyed prison virgin it would make things easier for me my names michael haller im filling in for your attorney today i didnt think there was much point in explaining to this guy what had happened to vincent it would only make reese ask me a bunch of questions i didnt have the time or knowledge to answer wheres jerry reese asked couldnt make it you ready to do this like i got a choice did jerry go over the sentence when you pled out yeah he told me five years in state out in three if i behave it was more like four but i wasnt going to mess with it okay well the judge is finishing some stuff up out there and then theyll bring you out the prosecutor will read you a bunch of legalese you answer yes that you understand it and then the judge will enter the sentence fifteen minutes in and out i dont care how long it takes i aint got nowhere to go i nodded and left him there i tapped lightly on the metal door so the deputy bailiffs in la county are sheriffs deputies in the courtroom would hear it but hopefully not the judge he let me out and i sat in the first row of the gallery i opened up my case and pulled out most of the files putting them down on the bench next to me the top file was the edgar reese file i had already reviewed this one in preparation for the sentencing reese was one of vincents repeat clients it was a gardenvariety drug case a seller who used his own product reese was set up on a buybust by a customer working as a confidential informant according to the background information in the file the ci zeroed in on reese because he held a grudge against him he had previously bought cocaine from reese and found it had been hit too hard with baby laxative this was a frequent mistake made by dealers who were also users they cut the product too hard thereby increasing the amount kept for their own personal use but diluting the charge delivered by the powder they sold it was a bad business practice because it bred enemies a user trying to work off a charge by cooperating as a ci is more inclined to set up a dealer he doesnt like than a dealer he does this was the business lesson edgar reese would have to think about for the next five years in state prison i put the file back in my bag and looked at what was next on the stack the file on top belonged to patrick henson the painkiller case i had told lorna i would be dropping i leaned over to put the file back in the bag when i suddenly sat back against the bench and held it on my lap i flapped it against my thigh a couple times as i reconsidered things and then opened it henson was a twentyfouryearold surfer from malibu by way of florida he was a professional but at the low end of the spectrum with limited endorsements and winnings from the pro tour in a competition on maui hed wiped out in a wave that drove him down hard into the lava bottom of pehei it crimped his shoulder and after surgery to scrape it out the doctor prescribed oxycodone eighteen months later henson was a fullblown addict chasing pills to chase the pain he lost his sponsors and was too weak to compete anymore he finally hit bottom when he stole a diamond necklace from a home in malibu to which hed been invited by a female friend according to the sheriffs report the necklace belonged to his friends mother and contained eight diamonds representing her three children and five grandchildren it was listed on the report as worth but henson hocked it for and went down to mexico to buy two hundred tabs of oxy over the counter henson was easy to connect to the caper the diamond necklace was recovered from the pawnshop and the film from the security camera showed him pawning it because of the high value of the necklace he was hit with a full deck dealing in stolen property and grand theft along with illegal drug possession it also didnt help that the lady he stole the necklace from was married to a wellconnected doctor who had contributed liberally to the reelection of several members of the county board of supervisors when vincent took henson on as a client the surfer made the initial advance payment in trade vincent took all twelve of his custommade trick henson boards and sold them through his liquidator to collectors and on ebay henson was also placed on the amonth payment plan but had never made a single payment because he had gone into rehab the day after being bailed out of jail by his mother who lived back in melbourne florida the file said henson had successfully completed rehab and was working parttime at a surf camp for kids on the beach in santa monica he was barely making enough to live on let alone pay a month to vincent his mother meanwhile had been tapped out by his bail and the cost of his stay in rehab the file was replete with motions to continue and other filings as delay tactics undertaken by vincent while he waited for henson to come across with more cash this was standard practice get your money up front especially when the case is probably a dog the prosecutor had henson on tape selling the stolen merchandise it meant the case was worse than a dog it was roadkill there was a phone number in the file for henson one thing every lawyer drilled into nonincarcerated clients was the need to maintain a method of contact those facing criminal charges and the likelihood of prison often had unstable home lives they moved around sometimes were completely homeless but a lawyer had to be able to reach them at a moments notice the number was listed in the file as hensons cell and if it was still good i could call him right now the question was did i want to i looked up at the bench the judge was still in the middle of oral arguments on a bail motion there were still three other lawyers waiting their turn at other motions and no sign of the prosecutor who was assigned to the edgar reese case i got up and whispered to the deputy again im going out into the hallway to make a call ill be close he nodded if youre not back when its time ill come grab you he said just make sure you turn that phone off before coming back in the judge doesnt like cell phones he didnt have to tell me that i already knew firsthand that the judge didnt like cell phones in her court my lesson was learned when i was making an appearance before her and my phone started playing the william tell overture my daughters ringtone choice not mine the judge slapped me with a dollar fine and had taken to referring to me ever since as the lone ranger that last part i didnt mind so much i sometimes felt like i was the lone ranger i just rode in a black lincoln town car instead of on a white horse i left my case and the other files on the bench in the gallery and walked out into the hallway with only the henson file i found a reasonably quiet spot in the crowded hallway and called the number it was answered after two rings this is trick patrick henson yeah whos this im your new lawyer my name is mi whoa wait a minute what happened to my old lawyer i gave that guy vincent hes dead patrick he passed away last night nooooo yes patrick im sorry about that i waited a moment to see if he had anything else to say about it then started in as perfunctorily as a bureaucrat my name is michael haller and im taking over jerry vincents cases ive been reviewing your file here and i see you havent made a single payment on the schedule mr vincent put you on ah man this is the deal ive been concentrating on getting right and staying right and ive got no fucking money okay i already gave that guy vincent all my boards he counted it as five grand but i know he got more a couple of those long boards were worth at least a grand apiece he told me that he got enough to get started but all hes been doing is delaying things i cant get back to shit until this thing is all over are you staying right patrick are you clean as a fucking whistle man vincent told me it was the only way id have a shot at staying out of jail i looked up and down the hallway it was crowded with lawyers and defendants and witnesses and the families of those victimized or accused it was a football field long and everybody in it was hoping for one thing a break for the clouds to open and something to go their way just this one time jerry was right patrick you have to stay clean im doing it you got a job man dont you guys see no ones going to give a guy like me a job nobodys going to hire me im waiting on this case and i might be in jail before its all over i mean i teach water babies parttime on the beach but it dont pay me jack im living out of my damn car sleeping on a lifeguard stand at hermosa beach this time two years ago i was in a suite at the four seasons in maui yeah i know life sucks you still have a drivers license thats about all i got left i made a decision okay you know where jerry vincents office is you ever been there yeah i delivered the boards there and my fish your fish he took a sixtypound tarpon i caught when i was a kid back in florida said he was going to put it on the wall and pretend like he caught it or something yeah well your fish is still there anyway be at the office at nine sharp tomorrow morning and ill interview you for a job if it goes right then youll start right away doing what driving me ill pay you fifteen bucks an hour to drive and another fifteen toward your fees hows that there was a moment of silence before henson responded in an accommodating voice thats good man i can be there for that good see you then just remember something patrick you gotta stay clean if youre not ill know believe me ill know dont worry man i will never go back to that shit that shit fucked my life up for good okay patrick ill see you tomorrow hey man why are you doing this i hesitated before answering you know i dont really know i closed the phone and made sure to turn it off i went back into the courtroom wondering if i was doing something good or making the kind of mistake that would catch up and bite me on the ass it was perfect timing the judge finished with the last motion as i came back in i saw that a deputy district attorney named don pierce was sitting at the prosecution table ready to go with the sentencing he was an exnavy guy who kept the crew cut going and was one of the regulars at cocktail hour at four green fields i quickly packed all the files back into my bag and wheeled it through the gate to the defense table well the judge said i see the lone ranger rides again she said it with a smile and i smiled back at her yes your honor nice to see you i havent seen you in quite a while mr haller open court was not the place to tell her where i had been i kept my responses short i spread my hands as if presenting the new me all i can say is im back now judge im glad to see that now you are here in place of mr vincent is that correct it was said in a routine tone i could tell she did not know about vincents demise i knew i could keep the secret and get through the sentencing with it but then she would hear the story and wonder why i hadnt brought it up and told her it was not a good way to keep a judge on your side unfortunately your honor i said mr vincent passed away last night the judges eyebrows arched in shock she had been a longtime prosecutor before being a longtime judge she was wired into the legal community and most likely knew jerry vincent well i had just hit her with a major jolt oh my he was so young she exclaimed what happened i shook my head like i didnt know it wasnt a natural death your honor the police are investigating it and i dont really know a lot about it other than that he was found in his car last night at his office judge holder called me in today and appointed me replacement counsel thats why i am here for mr reese the judge looked down and took a moment to get over her shock i felt bad about being the messenger i bent down and pulled the edgar reese file out of my bag im very sorry to hear this the judge finally said i nodded in agreement and waited very well the judge said after another long moment lets bring the defendant out jerry vincent garnered no further delay whether the judge had suspicions about jerry or the life he led she didnt say but life would move on in the criminal courts building the wheels of justice would grind without him ten the message from lorna taylor was short and to the point i got it the moment i turned my phone on after leaving the courtroom and seeing edgar reese get his five years she told me she had just been in touch with judge holders clerk about obtaining the court order the bank was requiring before putting lornas and my names on the vincent bank accounts the judge had agreed to draw up the order and i could just walk down the hallway to her chambers to pick it up the courtroom was once again dark but the judges clerk was in her pod next to the bench she still reminded me of my thirdgrade teacher mrs gill i said im supposed to pick up an order from the judge yes i think she still has it with her in chambers ill go check any chance i could get in there and talk to her for a few minutes too well she has someone with her at the moment but i will check she got up and went down the hallway located behind the clerks station at the end was the door to the judges chambers and i watched her knock once before being summoned to enter when she opened the door i could see a man sitting in the same chair i had sat in a few hours earlier i recognized him as judge holders husband a personalinjury attorney named mitch lester i recognized him from the photograph on his ad back when he was doing criminal defense we had once shared the back of the yellow pages my ad taking the top half and his the bottom he hadnt worked criminal cases in a long time a few minutes later mrs gill came out carrying the court order i needed i thought this meant i wasnt going to get in to see the judge but mrs gill told me i would be allowed back as soon as the judge finished up with her visitor it wasnt enough time to continue my review of the files in my roller bag so i wandered the courtroom looking around and thinking about what i was going to say to the judge at the empty bailiffs desk i looked down and scanned a calendar sheet from the week before i knew the names of several of the attorneys who were listed and had been scheduled for emergency hearings and motions one of them was jerry vincent on behalf of walter elliot it had probably been one of jerrys last appearances in court after three minutes i heard a bell tone at the clerks station and mrs gill said i was free to go back to the judges chambers when i knocked on the door it was mitch lester who opened it he smiled and bid me entrance we shook hands and he remarked that he had just heard about jerry vincent its a scary world out there he said it can be i said if you need any help with anything let me know he left the office and i took his seat in front of the judges desk what can i do for you mr haller you got the order for the bank yes i got the order your honor thank you for that i wanted to update you a little bit and ask a question about something she took off a pair of reading glasses and put them down on her blotter please go ahead then well on the update things are going a bit slowly because we started without a calendar both jerry vincents laptop computer and his hardcopy calendar were stolen after he was killed we had to build a new calendar after pulling the active files we think we have that under control and in fact i just came from a sentencing in judge champagnes in regard to one of the cases so we havent missed anything the judge seemed unimpressed by the efforts made by my staff and me how many active cases are we talking about she asked uh it looks like there are thirtyone active cases well thirty now that i handled that sentencing that case is done then i would say you inherited quite a thriving practice what is the problem im not sure there is a problem judge so far ive had a conversation with only one of the active clients and it looks like i will be continuing as his lawyer was that walter elliot uh no i have not talked to him yet i plan to try to do that later today the person i talked to was involved in something a little less serious a felony theft actually okay she was growing impatient so i moved to the point of the meeting what i wanted to ask about was the police you were right this morning when you warned me about guarding against police intrusion when i got over to the office after leaving here i found a couple of detectives going through the files jerrys receptionist was there but she hadnt tried to stop them the judges face grew hard well i hope you did those officers should have known better than to start going through files willynilly yes your honor they backed off once i got there and objected in fact i threatened to make a complaint to you thats when they backed off she nodded her face showing pride in the power the mention of her name had then why are you here well im wondering now whether i should let them back in i dont understand you mr haller let the police back in the detective in charge of the investigation made a good point he said the evidence suggests that jerry vincent knew his killer and probably even allowed him to get close enough to you know shoot him he said that makes it a good bet that it was one of his own clients so they were going through the files looking for potential suspects when i walked in on them the judge waved one of her hands in a gesture of dismissal of course they were and they were trampling on those clients rights as they were doing it they were in the file room and were looking through old cases closed cases doesnt matter open or closed it still constitutes a violation of the attorneyclient privilege i understand that judge but after they were gone i saw they had left behind a stack of files on the table these were the files they were either going to take or wanted to look more closely at i looked them over and there were threats in those files threats against mr vincent yes they were cases in which his clients werent happy about the outcome whether it was the verdict or the disposition or the terms of imprisonment there were threats and in each of the cases he took the threats seriously enough to make a detailed record of exactly what was said and who said it that was what the detectives were pulling together the judge leaned back and clasped her hands her elbows on the arms of her leather chair she thought about the situation i had described and then brought her eyes to mine you believe we are inhibiting the investigation by not allowing the police to do their job i nodded i was wondering if there was a way to sort of serve both sides i said limit the harm to the clients but let the police follow the investigation wherever it goes the judge considered this in silence again then sighed i wish my husband had stayed she finally said i value his opinion greatly well i had an idea of course you did what is it i was thinking that i could vet the files myself and draw up a list of the people who threatened jerry then i could pass it on to detective bosch and give him some of the details of the threats as well this way he would have what he needs but he wouldnt have the files themselves hes happy im happy bosch is the lead detective yes harry bosch hes with robberyhomicide i cant remember his partners name you have to understand mr haller that even if you just give this man bosch the names you are still breaching client confidentiality you could be disbarred for this well i was thinking about that and i believe theres a way out one of the mechanisms of relief from the client confidentiality bond is in the case of threat to safety if jerry vincent knew a client was coming to kill him last night he could have called the police and given that clients name to them there wouldve been no breach in that yes but what you are considering here is completely different its different judge but not completely ive been directly told by the lead detective on the case that it is highly likely that the identity of jerry vincents killer is contained in jerrys own files those files are now mine so that information constitutes a threat to me when i go out and start meeting these clients i could shake hands with the killer and not even know it you add that up any way and i feel i am in some jeopardy here judge and that qualifies for relief she nodded her head again and put her glasses back on she reached over and picked up a glass of water that had been hidden from my view by her desktop computer after drinking deeply from the glass she spoke all right mr haller i believe that if you vet the files as you have suggested then you will be acting in an appropriate and acceptable manner i would like you to file a motion with this court that explains your actions and the feeling of threat you are under i will sign it and seal it and with any good luck it will be something that never sees the light of day thank you your honor anything else i think that is it then have a good day yes your honor thank you i got up and headed toward the door but then remembered something and turned back to stand in front of the judges desk judge i forgot something i saw your calendar from last week out there and noticed that jerry vincent came in on the elliot matter i havent thoroughly reviewed the case file yet but do you mind my asking what the hearing was about the judge had to think for a moment to recall the hearing it was an emergency motion mr vincent came in because judge stanton had revoked bail and ordered mr elliot remanded to custody i stayed the revocation why was it revoked mr elliot had traveled to a film festival in new york without getting permission it was one of the qualifiers of bail when mr golantz the prosecutor saw a picture of elliot at the festival in people magazine he asked judge stanton to revoke bail he obviously wasnt happy that bail had been allowed in the first place judge stanton revoked and then mr vincent came to me for an emergency stay of his clients arrest and incarceration i decided to give mr elliot a second chance and to modify his freedom by making him wear an ankle monitor but i can assure you that mr elliot will not receive a third chance keep that in mind if you should retain him as a client i understand judge thank you i nodded and left the chambers thanking mrs gill as i walked out through the courtroom harry boschs card was still in my pocket i dug it out while i was going down in the elevator i had parked in a pay lot by the kyoto grand hotel and had a threeblock walk that would take me right by parker center i called boschs cell phone as i headed to the courthouse exit this is bosch its mickey haller there was a hesitation i thought that maybe he didnt recognize my name what can i do for you he finally asked hows the investigation going its going but nothing i can talk to you about then ill just get to the point are you in parker center right now thats right why im heading over from the courthouse meet me out front by the memorial look haller im busy can you just tell me what this is about not on the phone but i think it will be worth your while if youre not there when i go by then ill know youve passed on the opportunity and i wont bother you with it again i closed the phone before he could respond it took me five minutes to get over to parker center by foot the place was in its last years of life its replacement being built a block over on spring street i saw bosch standing next to the fountain that was part of the memorial for officers killed in the line of duty i saw thin white wires leading from his ears to his jacket pocket i walked up and didnt bother with a handshake or any other greeting he pulled the earbuds out and shoved them into his pocket shutting the world out detective helps me concentrate is there a purpose to this meeting after you left the office today i looked at the files you had stacked on the table in the file room and and i understand what you are trying to do i want to help you but i want you to understand my position i understand you counselor you have to protect those files and the possible killer hiding in them because those are the rules i shook my head this guy didnt want to make it easy for me to help him ill tell you what detective bosch come back by the office at eight oclock tomorrow morning and i will give you what i can i think the offer surprised him he had no response youll be there i asked whats the catch he asked right back no catch just dont be late ive got an interview at nine and after that ill probably be on the road for client conferences ill be there at eight okay then i was ready to walk away but it looked like he wasnt what is it i was going to ask you something what did vincent have any federal cases i thought for a moment going over what i knew of the files i shook my head were still reviewing everything but i dont think so he was like me liked to stay in state court its a numbers game more cases more fuckups more holes to slip through the feds kind of like to stack the deck they dont like to lose i thought he might take the slight personally but he had moved past it and was putting something in place he nodded okay thats it thats all you wanted to ask thats it i waited for further explanation but none came okay detective i clumsily put out my hand he shook it and appeared to feel just as awkward about it i decided to ask a question i had been holding back on hey there was something i was meaning to ask you too whats that it doesnt say it on your card but i heard that your full name is hieronymus bosch is that true what about it i was just wondering whered you get a name like that my mother gave it to me your mother well what did your father think about it i never asked him i have to get back to the investigation now counselor is there anything else no that was it i was just curious ill see you tomorrow at eight ill be there i left him standing there at the memorial and walked away i headed down the block thinking the whole time about why he had asked if jerry vincent had had any federal cases when i turned left at the corner i glanced back and saw bosch still standing by the fountain he was watching me he didnt look away but i did and i kept walking eleven cisco and lorna were still at work in jerry vincents office when i got back i handed the court order for the bank over to lorna and told her about the two early appointments i had set for the next day i thought you put patrick henson into the dog pile lorna said i did but now i moved him back she put her eyebrows together the way she did whenever i confounded her which was a lot i didnt want to explain things moving on i asked if anything new had developed while i had gone to court a couple things lorna said first of all the check from walter elliot cleared if he heard about jerry its too late to stop payment good it gets better i found the contracts file and took a look at jerrys deal with elliot that hundred thousand deposited friday for trial was only a partial payment she was right it was getting better how much i asked according to the deal she said vincent took two fifty up front that was five months ago and it looks like that is all gone but he was going to get another two fifty for the trial nonrefundable the hundred was only the first part of that the rest is due on the first day of testimony i nodded with satisfaction vincent had made a great deal i had never had a case with that kind of money involved but i wondered how he had blown through the first so quickly lorna would have to study the ins and outs of the accounts to get that answer okay all of thats real good if we get elliot otherwise it doesnt matter what else do we have lorna looked disappointed that i didnt want to linger over the money and celebrate her discovery she had lost sight of the fact that i still had to nail elliot down technically he was a free agent i would get the first shot at him but i still had to secure him as a client before i could consider what it would be like to get a trial fee lorna answered my question in a monotone we had a series of visitors while you were in court who first one of the investigators jerry used came by after hearing the news he took one look at cisco and almost got into it with him then he got smart and backed down who was it bruce carlin jerry hired him to work the elliot case i nodded bruce carlin was a former lapd bull who had crossed to the dark side and did defense work now a lot of attorneys used him because of his insiders knowledge of how things worked in the cop shop i had used him on a case once and thought he was living off an undeserved reputation i never hired him again call him back i said set up a time for him to come back in why mick youve got cisco i know ive got cisco but carlin was doing work on elliot and i doubt its all in the files you know how it is if you keep it out of the file you keep it out of discovery so bring him in cisco can sit down with him and find out what hes got pay him for his time whatever his hourly rate is and then cut him loose when hes no longer useful what else who else came in a real losers parade carney andrews waltzed in thinking she was going to just pick the elliot case up off the pile and waltz back out with it i sent her away emptyhanded i then looked through the p and os in the operating account and saw she was hired five months ago as associate counsel on elliot a month later she was dropped i nodded and understood vincent had been judge shopping for elliot carney andrews was an untalented attorney and weasel but she was married to a superior court judge named bryce andrews he had spent twentyfive years as a prosecutor before being appointed to the bench in the view of most criminal defense attorneys who worked in the ccb he had never left the das office he was believed to be one of the toughest judges in the building one who at times acted in concert with if not as a direct arm of the prosecutors office this created a cottage industry in which his wife made a very comfortable living by being hired as cocounsel on cases in her husbands court thereby creating a conflict of interest that would require the reassignment of the cases to other hopefully more lenient judges it worked like a charm and the best part was that carney andrews never really had to practice law she just had to sign on to a case make an appearance as cocounsel in court and then wait until it was reassigned from her husbands calendar she could then collect a substantial fee and move on to the next case i didnt have to even look into the elliot file to see what had happened i knew case assignments were generated by random selection in the chief judges office the elliot case had obviously been initially assigned to bryce andrewss court and vincent didnt like his chances there for starters andrews would never allow bail on a doublemurder case let alone the hard line he would take against the defendant when it got to trial so vincent hired the judges wife as cocounsel and the problem went away the case was then randomly reassigned to judge james p stanton whose reputation was completely the opposite of andrewss the bottom line was that whatever vincent had paid carney it had been worth it did you check i asked lorna how much did he pay her she took ten percent of the initial advance i whistled twentyfive thousand dollars for nothing that at least explained where some of the first quarter million went nice work if you can get it i said but then youd have to sleep at night with bryce andrews lorna said im not sure that would be worth it cisco laughed i didnt but lorna did have a point bryce andrews had at least twenty years and almost two hundred pounds on his wife it wasnt a pretty picture that it on the visitors i asked no lorna said we also had a couple of clients drop by to ask for their files after they heard on the radio about jerrys death and we stalled them i told them that only you could turn over a file and that you would get back to them within twentyfour hours it looked like they wanted to argue about it but with cisco here they decided it would be better to wait she smiled at cisco and the big man bowed as if to say at your service lorna handed me a slip of paper those are the names theres contact info too i looked at the names one was in the dog pile so i would be happily turning the file over the other was a public indecency case that i thought i could do something with the woman was charged when a sheriffs deputy ordered her out of the water on a malibu beach she was swimming nude but this was not apparent until the deputy ordered her out of the water because the charge was a misdemeanor the deputy had to witness the crime to make an arrest but by ordering her out of the water he created the crime he arrested her for that wouldnt fly in court it was a case i knew i could get dismissed ill go see these two tonight i said in fact i want to hit the road with all of the cases soon starting with a stop at archway pictures im going to take cisco with me and lorna i want you to gather up whatever you need from here and head on home i dont want you being here by yourself she nodded but then said are you sure cisco should go with you i was surprised she had asked the question in front of him she was referring to his size and appearance the tattoos the earring the boots leather vest and so on the overall menace his appearance projected her concern was that he might scare away more clients than he would help lock down yeah i said he should go when i want to be subtle he can just wait in the car besides i want him driving so i can look at the files i looked at cisco he nodded and seemed fine with the arrangement he might look foolish in his bike vest behind the wheel of a lincoln but he wasnt complaining yet speaking of the files i said we have nothing in federal court right lorna shook her head not that i know of i nodded it confirmed what i had indicated to bosch and made me more curious about why he had asked about federal cases i was beginning to get an idea about it and planned to bring it up when i saw him the next morning okay i said i guess its time for me to be a lincoln lawyer again lets hit the road twelve in the last decade archway pictures had grown from a movie industry fringe dweller to a major force this was because of the one thing that had always ruled hollywood money as the cost of producing films grew exponentially at the same time the industry focused on the most expensive kinds of films to make the major studios began increasingly to look for partners to share the cost and risk this is where walter elliot and archway pictures came in archway was previously an overrun lot it was on melrose avenue just a few blocks from the behemoth that was paramount studios archway was built to act as the remora fish does with the great white shark it would hover near the mouth of the bigger fish and take whatever torn scraps somehow missed being sucked into the giant maw archway offered production facilities and soundstages for rent when everything was booked at the big studios it leased office space to wouldbe and has been producers who werent up to the standards of or didnt have the same deals as onlot producers it nurtured independent films the movies that were less expensive to make but more risky and supposedly less likely to be hits than their studiobred counterparts walter elliot and archway pictures limped along in this fashion for a decade until luck and lightning struck twice in a space of only three years elliot hit gold with two of the independent films hed backed by providing soundstages equipment and production facilities in exchange for a piece of the action the films went on to defy hollywood expectations and became huge hits critically and financially one even took home the academy award as best picture walter and his stepchild studio suddenly basked in the glow of huge success more than one hundred million people heard walter being personally thanked on the academy awards broadcast and more important archways worldwide cut from the two films was more than a hundred million dollars apiece walter did a wise thing with that newfound money he fed it to the sharks cofinancing a number of productions in which the big studios were looking for risk partners there were some misses of course the business after all was hollywood but there were enough hits to keep the nest egg growing over the next decade walter elliot doubled and then tripled his stake and along the way became a player who made regular appearances on the power lists in industry minds and magazines elliot had taken archway from being an address associated with hollywood pariahs to a place where there was a threeyear wait for a windowless office all the while elliots personal wealth grew commensurately though he had come west twentyfive years before as the rich scion of a florida phosphate family that money was nothing like the riches provided by hollywood like many on those power lists elliot traded in his wife for a newer model and together they started accumulating houses first in the canyons then down in the beverly hills flats and then on out to malibu and up to santa barbara according to the information in the files i had walter elliot and his wife owned seven different homes and two ranches in or around los angeles never mind how often they used each place real estate was a way of keeping score in hollywood all those properties and top lists came in handy when elliot was charged with double murder the studio boss flexed his political and financial muscles and pulled off something rarely accomplished in a murder case he got bail with the prosecution objecting all the way bail was set at million and elliot quickly ponied it up in real estate hed been out of jail and awaiting trial ever since his brief flirtation with bail revocation the week before notwithstanding one of the properties elliot put up as collateral for bail was the house where the murders took place it was a waterfront weekender on a secluded cove on the bail escrow its value was listed at million it was there that thirtynineyearold mitzi elliot was murdered along with her lover in a twelvehundredsquarefoot bedroom with a glass wall that looked out on the big blue pacific the discovery file was replete with forensic reports and color copies of the crime scene photographs the death room was completely white walls carpet furniture and bedding two naked bodies were sprawled on the bed and floor mitzi elliot and johan rilz the scene was red on white two large bullet holes in the mans chest two in the womans chest and one in her forehead he by the bedroom door she on the bed red on white it was not a clean scene the wounds were large though the murder weapon was missing an accompanying report said that slugs had been identified through ballistic markings as coming from a smith amp wesson model a magnum revolver fired at close quarters it was overkill walter elliot had been suspicious about his wife she had announced her intentions to divorce him and he believed there was another man involved he told the sheriffs homicide investigators that he had gone to the malibu beach house because his wife had told him she was going to meet with the interior designer elliot thought that was a lie and timed his approach so that he would be able to confront her with a paramour he loved her and wanted her back he was willing to fight for her he had gone to confront he repeated not to kill he didnt own a magnum he told them he didnt own any guns according to the statement he gave investigators when elliot got to malibu he found his wife and her lover naked and already dead it turned out that the lover was in fact the interior designer johan rilz a german national elliot had always thought was gay elliot left the house and got back in his car he started to drive away but then thought better of it he decided to do the right thing he turned around and pulled back into the driveway he called and waited out front for the deputies to arrive the chronology and details of how the investigation proceeded from that point would be important in mounting a defense according to the reports in the file elliot gave investigators an initial account of his discovery of the two bodies he was then transported by two detectives to the malibu substation so he would be out of the way while the investigation of the crime scene proceeded he was not under arrest at this time he was placed in an unlocked interview room where he waited three long hours for the two lead detectives to finally clear the crime scene and come to the substation a videotaped interview was then conducted but according to the transcript i reviewed quickly crossed the line into interrogation at this point elliot was finally advised of his rights and asked if he wanted to continue to answer questions elliot wisely chose to stop talking and to ask for an attorney it was a decision made better late than never but elliot would have been better off if he had never said word one to the investigators he shouldve just taken the nickel and kept his mouth shut while investigators had been working the crime scene and elliot was cooling his heels in the substation interview room a homicide investigator working in the sheriffs headquarters in whittier drew up several search warrants that were faxed to a superior court judge and signed these allowed investigators to search throughout the beach house and elliots car and permitted them to conduct a gunshot residue test on elliots hands and clothes to determine if there were gas nitrates and microscopic particles of burned gunpowder on them after elliot refused further cooperation his hands were bagged in plastic at the substation and he was transported to sheriffs headquarters where a criminalist conducted the gsr test in the crime lab this consisted of wiping chemically treated disks on elliots hands and clothing when the disks were processed by a lab technician those that had been wiped on his hands and sleeves tested positive for high levels of gunshot residue at that point elliot was formally arrested on suspicion of murder with his one phone call he contacted his personal lawyer who in turn called in jerry vincent whom he had attended law school with elliot was eventually transported to the county jail and booked on two counts of murder the sheriffs investigators then called the departments media office and suggested that a press conference should be set up they had just bagged a big one i closed the file as cisco stopped the lincoln in front of archway studios there were a number of picketers walking the sidewalk they were writers on strike holding up redandwhite signs that said we want a fair share and writers united some signs showed a fist holding a pen another said your favorite line a writer wrote it anchored on the sidewalk was a large blowup figure of a pig smoking a cigar with the word producer branded on its rear end the pig and most of the signs were wellworn clichés and i would have thought that with the protesters being writers they would have come up with something better but maybe that kind of creativity happened only when they were getting paid i had ridden in the backseat for the sake of appearances on this first stop i was hoping that elliot might catch a glimpse of me through his office window and take me for an attorney of great means and skill but the writers saw a lincoln with a rider in the back and thought i was a producer as we turned into the studio they descended on the car with their signs and started chanting greedy bastard greedy bastard cisco gunned it and plowed through a few of the hapless scribes dodging the fenders careful i barked all i need is to run over an outofwork writer dont worry cisco replied calmly they always scatter not this time when he got up to the guardhouse cisco pulled forward enough that my window was even with the door i checked to make sure none of the writers had followed us onto studio property and then lowered the glass so i could speak to the man who stepped out his uniform was a beige color with a dark brown tie and matching epaulets it looked ridiculous can i help you im walter elliots attorney i dont have an appointment but i need to see him right away can i see your drivers license i got it out and handed it through the window i am handling this for jerry vincent thats the name mr elliots secretary will recognize the guard went into the booth and slid the door closed i didnt know if this was to keep the airconditioning from escaping or to prevent me from hearing what was said when he picked up the phone whatever the reason he soon slid the door back open and extended the phone to me his hand covering the mouthpiece mrs albrecht is mr elliots executive assistant she wants to speak to you i took the phone hello mr haller is it what is this all about mr elliot has dealt exclusively with mr vincent on this matter and there is no appointment on his calendar this matter it was a strange way of referring to double charges of murder mrs albrecht id rather not talk about this at the front gate as you can imagine its quite a delicate matter to use your word can i come to the office and see mr elliot i turned in my seat and looked out the back window there were two cars in the guardhouse queue behind my lincoln they must not have been producers the writers had let them through unmolested im afraid thats not good enough mr haller can i place you on hold while i call mr vincent you wont get through to him hell take a call from mr elliot i am sure i am sure he wont mrs albrecht jerry vincents dead thats why im here i looked at ciscos reflection in the rearview mirror and shrugged as though to say i had no choice but to hit her with the news the plan had been to finesse my way through the arch and then be the one to personally tell elliot his lawyer was dead excuse me mr haller did you say mr vincent is dead thats what i said and im his courtappointed replacement can i come in now yes of course i handed the phone back and soon the gate opened thirteen we were assigned to a prime parking space in the executive lot i told cisco to wait in the car and went in alone carrying the two thick files vincent had put together on the case one contained discovery materials turned over so far by the prosecution including the important investigative documents and interview transcripts and the other contained documents and other work product generated by vincent during the five months he had handled the case between the two files i was able to get a good handle on what the prosecution had and didnt have and the direction in which the prosecutor wanted to take the trial there was still work to be done and pieces were missing from the defenses case and strategy perhaps those pieces had been carried in jerry vincents head or in his laptop or on the legal pad in his portfolio but unless the cops arrested a suspect and recovered the stolen property whatever was there would be of no help to me i followed a sidewalk across a beautifully manicured lawn on the way to elliots office my plan for the meeting was threefold the first order of business was to secure elliot as a client that done i would ask his approval in delaying the trial to give me time to get up to speed and prepare for it the last part of the plan would be to see if elliot had any of the pieces missing from the defense case parts two and three obviously didnt matter if i was unsuccessful with part one walter elliots office was in bungalow one on the far reaches of the archway lot bungalows sounded small but they were big in hollywood a sign of status it was like having your own private home on the lot and as in any private home activities inside could be kept secret a spanishtiled entranceway led to a stepdown living room with a fireplace blowing gas flames on one wall and a mahogany wood bar set up in an opposite corner i stepped into the middle of the room and looked around and waited i looked at the painting over the fireplace it depicted an armored knight on a white steed the knight had reached up and flipped open the visor on his helmet and his eyes stared out intently i took a few steps further into the room and realized the eyes had been painted so that they stared at the viewer of the painting from any angle in the room they followed me mr haller i turned as i recognized the voice from the guardhouse phone elliots gatekeeper mrs albrecht had stepped into the room from some unseen entrance elegance was the word that came to mind she was an aging beauty who appeared to take the process in stride gray streaked through her undyed hair and tiny wrinkles were working their way toward her eyes and mouth seemingly unchecked by injection or incision mrs albrecht looked like a woman who liked her own skin in my experience this was a rare thing in hollywood mr elliot will see you now i followed her around a corner and down a short hallway to a reception office she passed an empty desk hers i assumed and pushed open a large door to walter elliots office elliot was an overly tanned man with more gray hair sprouting from his open shirt collar than from the top of his head he sat behind a large glass worktable no drawers beneath it and no computer on top of it though paperwork and scripts were spread across it it didnt matter that he was facing two counts of murder he was staying busy he was working and running archway the way he always did maybe it was on the advice of some hollywood selfhelp guru but it wasnt an unusual behavior or philosophy for the accused act like you are innocent and you will be perceived as innocent finally you will become innocent there was a sitting area to the right but he chose to remain behind the worktable he had dark piercing eyes that seemed familiar and then i realized i had just been looking at them the knight on the steed out in the living room was elliot mr elliot this is mr haller mrs albrecht said she signaled me to the chair across the table from elliot after i sat down elliot made a dismissive gesture without looking at mrs albrecht and she left the room without another word over the years i had represented and been in the company of a couple dozen killers the one rule is that there are no rules they come in all sizes and shapes rich and poor humble and arrogant regretful and cold to the bone the percentages told me that it was most likely elliot was a killer that he had calmly dispatched his wife and her lover and arrogantly thought he could and would get away with it but there was nothing about him on first meeting that told me one way or the other for sure and thats the way it always was what happened to my lawyer he asked well for a detailed explanation i would have to refer you to the police the shorthand is that somebody killed him last night in his car and where does that leave me im on trial for my life in a week that was a slight exaggeration jury selection was scheduled in nine days and the das office had not announced that it would seek the death penalty but it didnt hurt that he was thinking in such terms thats why im here mr elliot at the moment you are left with me and who are you ive never heard of you you havent heard of me because i make it a practice not to be heard of celebrity lawyers bring too much attention to their clients they feed their own celebrity by offering up their clients i dont operate that way he pursed his lips and nodded i could tell i had just scored a point and youre taking over vincents practice he asked let me explain it mr elliot jerry vincent had a oneman shop just like i do on occasion one of us would need help with a case or need another attorney to fill in here and there we filled that role for each other if you look at the contract of representation you signed with him you will find my name in a paragraph with language that allowed jerry to discuss your case with me and to include me within the bonds of the attorneyclient relationship in other words jerry trusted me with his cases and now that he is gone i am prepared to carry on in his stead earlier today the chief judge of the superior court issued an order placing me in custody of jerrys cases of course you ultimately get to choose who represents you at trial i am very familiar with your case and prepared to continue your legal representation without so much as a hiccup but as i said you must make the choice im only here to tell you your options elliot shook his head i really cant believe this we were set for trial next week and im not pushing it back ive been waiting five months to clear my name do you have any idea what it is like for an innocent man to have to wait and wait and wait for justice to read all the innuendo and bullshit in the media to have a prosecutor with his nose up my ass waiting for me to make the move that gets my bail pulled look at this he stretched out a leg and pulled his left pant leg up to reveal the gps monitor judge holder had ordered him to wear i want this over i nodded in a consoling manner and knew that if i told him i wanted to delay his case i would be looking at a quick dismissal from consideration i decided i would bring that up in a strategy session after i closed the deal if i closed the deal ive dealt with many clients wrongly accused i lied the wait for justice can be almost intolerable but it also makes the vindication all the more meaningful elliot didnt respond and i didnt let the silence last long i spent most of the afternoon reviewing the files and evidence in your case im confident you wont have to delay the trial mr elliot i would be more than prepared to proceed another attorney maybe not but i would be ready there it was my best pitch to him most of it lies and exaggerations but i didnt stop there ive studied the trial strategy mr vincent outlined i wouldnt change it but i believe i can improve on it and id be ready to go next week if need be i think a delay can always be useful but it wont be necessary elliot nodded and rubbed a finger across his mouth i would have to think about this he said i need to talk to some people and have you checked out just like i had vincent checked out before i went with him i decided to gamble and to try to force elliot into a quick decision i didnt want him checking me out and possibly discovering i had disappeared for a year that would raise too many questions its a good idea i said take your time but dont take too much time the longer you wait to decide the greater the chance that the judge will find it necessary to push the trial back i know you dont want that but in the absence of mr vincent or any attorney of record the judge is probably already getting nervous and considering it if you choose me i will try to get before the judge as soon as possible and tell him were still good to go i stood up and reached into my coat pocket for a card i put it down on the glass those are all my numbers call anytime i hoped he would tell me to sit back down and wed start planning for trial but elliot just reached over and picked up the card he seemed to be studying it when i left him before i reached the door to the office it opened from the outside and mrs albrecht stood there she smiled warmly im sure we will be in touch she said i had a feeling that shed heard every word that had been spoken between me and her boss thank you mrs albrecht i said i certainly hope so fourteen i found cisco leaning against the lincoln smoking a cigarette that was fast he said i opened the back door in case there were cameras in the parking lot and elliot was watching me look at you with the encouraging word i got in and he did the same im just saying that it seemed kind of quick he said howd it go i gave it my best shot well probably know something soon you think he did it probably but it doesnt matter weve got other things to worry about it was hard to go from thinking about a quartermilliondollar fee to some of the alsorans on vincents client list but that was the job i opened my bag and pulled out the other active files it was time to decide where our next stop was going to be cisco backed out of the space and started heading toward the arch lornas waiting to hear he said i looked up at him in the mirror what lorna called me while you were inside she really wants to know what happened with elliot dont worry ill call her first let me figure out where were going the address of each client at least the address given upon signing for vincents services was printed neatly on the outside of each file i quickly checked through the files looking for addresses in hollywood i finally came across the file belonging to the woman charged with indecent exposure the client who had come to vincents office earlier to ask for the return of her file here we go i said when you get out of here head down melrose to la brea we ve got a client right there one of the ones who came in today for her file got it after that stop ill ride in the front seat dont want you to feel too much like a chauffeur it aint a bad gig i think i could get used to it i got out my phone hey mick i gotta tell you something cisco said i took my thumb off the speeddial button for lorna yeah what i just wanted to tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else me and lorna were gonna get married i had figured that they were headed in that direction lorna and i had been friends for fifteen years before we were married for one it had been a rebound marriage for me and as illadvised as anything i had ever done we ended it when we realized the mistake and somehow managed to remain close there was no one i trusted more in the world we were no longer in love but i still loved her and would always protect her that okay with you mick i looked at cisco in the rearview im not part of the equation cisco i know but i want to know if its okay with you know what i mean i looked out the window and thought a moment before answering then i looked back at him in the mirror yes its all right with me but ill tell you something cisco shes one of the four most important people in my life you have maybe seventyfive pounds on me and granted all of them in muscle but if you hurt her im going to find a way to hurt you back that okay with you he looked away from the mirror to the road ahead we were in the exit line moving slowly the striking writers were massing out on the sidewalk and delaying the people trying to leave the studio yeah mick im okay with that we were silent for a while after that as we inched along cisco kept glancing at me in the mirror what i finally asked well i got your daughter that makes one and then lorna i was wondering who the other two were before i could answer the electronic version of the william tell overture started to play in my hand i looked down at my phone it said private caller on the screen i opened it up haller please hold for walter elliot mrs albrecht said not much time went by before i heard the familiar voice mr haller im here what can i do for you i felt the stirring of anxiety in my gut he had decided have you noticed something about my case mr haller the question caught me off guard how do you mean one lawyer i have one lawyer mr haller you see i not only must win this case in court but i must also win it in the court of public opinion i see i said though i didnt quite understand the point in the last ten years ive picked a lot of winners im talking about films in which i invested my money i picked winners because i believe i have an accurate sense of public opinion and taste i know what people like because i know what they are thinking im sure you do sir and i think that the public believes that the more guilty you are the more lawyers you need he wasnt wrong about that so the first thing i said to mr vincent when i hired him was no dream team just you we had a second lawyer on board early on but that was temporary she served a purpose and was gone one lawyer mr haller thats how i want it the best one lawyer i can get i under ive decided mr haller you impressed me when you were in here i would like to engage your services for trial you will be my one lawyer i had to calm my voice before answering im glad to hear that call me mickey and you can call me walter but i insist on one condition before we agree to this arrangement what is that no delay we go to trial on schedule i want to hear you say it i hesitated i wanted a delay but i wanted the case more we wont delay i said well be ready to go next thursday then welcome aboard what do we do next well im still on the lot i could turn around and come back im afraid i have meetings until seven and then a screening of our film for the awards season i thought that his trial and freedom would have trumped his meetings and movies but i let it go i would educate walter elliot and bring him to reality the next time i saw him okay then for now you give me a fax number and ill have my assistant send over a contract it will have the same fee structure as you had with jerry vincent there was silence and i waited if he was going to try to knock down the fee this is when he would do it but instead he repeated a fax number i could hear mrs albrecht giving him i wrote it down on the outside of one of the files whats tomorrow look like walter tomorrow yes if not tonight then tomorrow we need to get started you dont want a delay i want to be even more prepared than i am now we need to talk and go over things there are a few gaps in the defense case and i think you can help me fill them in i could come back to the studio or meet you anywhere else in the afternoon i heard muffled voices as he conferred with mrs albrecht i have a four oclock open he finally said here at the bungalow okay ill be there and cancel whatever you have at five were going to need at least a couple hours to start elliot agreed to the two hours and we were about to end the conversation when i thought of something else walter i want to see the crime scene can i get into the house in malibu tomorrow sometime before we meet again there was a pause when you tell me what will work again he covered the phone and i heard his muffled conversation with mrs albrecht then he came back on the line with me how about eleven ill have someone meet you there to let you in thatll work see you tomorrow walter i closed the phone and looked at cisco in the mirror we got him cisco hit the lincolns horn in celebration it was a long blast that made the driver in front of us hold up a fist and send us back the finger out in the street the striking writers took the blast as a sign of support from inside the hated studio i heard a loud cheer go up from the masses fifteen bosch arrived early the next morning he was alone his peace offering was the extra cup of coffee he carried and handed over to me i dont drink coffee anymore trying to avoid any addiction in my life but i took it from him anyway thinking that maybe the smell of caffeine would get me going it was only but i had been in jerry vincents office for more than two hours already i led bosch back into the file room he looked more tired than i felt and i was pretty sure he was in the same suit hed been wearing when i saw him the day before long night i asked oh yeah chasing leads or chasing tail it was a question i had once heard one detective ask another in a courthouse hallway i guess it was a question reserved for brothers of the badge because it didnt go over so well with bosch he made some sort of guttural noise and didnt answer in the file room i told him to have a seat at the small table there was a yellow legal tablet on the table but no files i took the other seat and put my coffee down so i said picking up the legal pad so bosch said when i offered nothing else so i met with judge holder in chambers yesterday and worked out a plan by which we can give you what you need from the files without actually giving you the files bosch shook his head whats wrong i asked you shouldve told me this yesterday at parker center he said i wouldnt have wasted my time i thought youd appreciate this its not going to work how do you know that how can you be sure how many homicides have you investigated haller and how many have you cleared all right point taken youre the homicide guy but i am certainly capable of reviewing files and discerning what constituted a legitimate threat to jerry vincent possibly because of my experience as a criminal defense attorney i could even perceive a threat that you would miss in your capacity as a detective so you say yeah i say look all im pointing out here is the obvious im the detective im the one who should look through the files because i know what i am looking for no offense but you are an amateur at this so im in a position here where i have to take what an amateur is giving me and trust that im getting everything there is to get from the files it doesnt work that way i dont trust the evidence unless i find it myself again your point is well taken detective but this is the way it is this is the only method judge holder approved and i gotta tell you that youre lucky to get this much she wasnt interested in helping you out at all so youre saying you went to bat for me he said it in a disbelieving sarcastic tone as if it were some sort of a mathematical impossibility for a defense attorney to help a police detective thats right i said defiantly i went to bat for you i told you yesterday jerry vincent was a friend id like to see you take down the person who took him down youre probably worried about your own ass too im not denying that if i were you i would be look do you want the list or not i held the legal pad up as if i were teasing a dog with a toy he reached for it and i pulled it back immediately regretting the move i quickly handed it to him it was an awkward exchange like shaking hands had been the day before there are eleven names on that list with a brief summary of the threat each made to jerry vincent we were lucky that jerry thought it was important to memorialize an account of each threat he received ive never done that bosch didnt respond he was reading the first page of the legal pad i prioritized them i said bosch looked at me and i knew he was ready to step on me again for assuming the role of detective i raised a hand to stop him not from the standpoint of your investigation from the standpoint of being a lawyer of putting myself in jerry vincents shoes and looking at these things and determining which ones would concern me the most like the first one on that list james demarco the guy goes away on weapons charges and thinks jerry fucked up the case a guy like that can get a gun as soon as he gets out bosch nodded and dropped his eyes back to the legal pad he spoke without looking up from it what else do you have for me what do you mean he looked at me and waved the pad up and down as if it were as light as a feather and the information on it was equally so ill run these names and see where these guys are at now maybe your gunrunner is out and about and looking for revenge but these are dead cases most likely if these threats were legit they wouldve been carried out long ago same with any threats he got when he was a prosecutor so this is just busywork youre giving me counselor busywork some of those guys threatened him when they were being led off to prison maybe some of them are out maybe one just got out and made good on the threat maybe they contracted it out from prison there are a lot of possibilities and they shouldnt be dismissed as just busywork i dont understand your attitude on this bosch smiled and shook his head i remembered my father doing the same thing when he was about to tell me as a fiveyearold that i had misunderstood something i dont really care what you think about my attitude he said well check your leads out but im looking for something a little more current something from vincents open cases well i cant help you there sure you can you have all the cases now i assume you are reviewing them and meeting all your new clients youre going to come across something or see something or hear something that doesnt fit that doesnt seem right that maybe scares you a little bit thats when you call me i stared at him without answering you never know he said it might save you from he shrugged and didnt finish but the message was clear he was trying to scare me into cooperating far more than judge holder was allowing or than i felt comfortable with its one thing sharing threat information from closed cases i said its another thing entirely to do it with active cases and besides that i know you are asking for more than just threats you think jerry stumbled across something or had some knowledge that got him killed bosch kept his eyes on me and slowly nodded i was the first to look away what about it being a twoway street detective what do you know that you arent telling me what was in the laptop that was so important what was in the portfolio i cant talk to you about an active investigation you could yesterday when you asked about the fbi he looked at me and squinted his dark eyes i didnt ask you about the fbi come on detective you asked if he had any federal cases why would you do that unless you have some sort of federal connection im guessing it was the fbi bosch hesitated i had a feeling i had guessed right and now he was in a corner my mentioning the bureau would make him think i knew something now he would have to give in order to get this time you go first i prompted he nodded okay the killer took jerry vincents cell phone either off his body or it was in his briefcase okay i got the call records yesterday right before i saw you on the day he was killed he got three calls from the bureau four days before that there were two he was talking to somebody over there or they were talking to him who i cant tell all outgoing calls from over there register on the main number all i know is he got calls from the bureau no names how long were the calls bosch hesitated unsure what to divulge he looked down at the tablet in his hand and i saw him grudgingly decide to share more he was going to get angry when i had nothing to share back they were all short calls how short none of them over a minute then maybe they were just wrong numbers he shook his head thats too many wrong numbers they wanted something from him anybody from there check in on the homicide investigation not yet i thought about this and shrugged well maybe they will and then youll know yeah and maybe they wont its not their style if you know what i mean now your turn what do you have thats federal nothing i confirmed that vincent had no federal cases i watched bosch do a slow burn as he realized i had played him youre telling me you have found no federal connections not even a bureau business card in that office thats right nothing theres been a rumor going around about a federal grand jury looking into corruption in the state courts you know anything about that i shook my head ive been on the shelf for a year thanks for the help look detective i dont get this why cant you just call over there and ask who was calling your victim isnt that how an investigation should proceed bosch smiled like he was dealing with a child if they want me to know something theyll come to me if i call them theyli just shine me on if this was part of a corruption probe or theyve got something else going the chances of them talking to a local cop are between slim and none if theyre the ones who got him killed then make it none how would they get him killed i told you they kept calling they wanted something they were pressuring him maybe someone else knew about it and thought he was a risk thats a lot of conjecture about five calls that dont even add up to five minutes bosch held up the yellow pad no more conjecture than this list what about the laptop what about it is that what this is all about something in his computer you tell me how can i tell you when i have no idea what was in it bosch nodded the point and stood up have a good day counselor he walked out carrying the legal pad at his side i was left wondering whether he had been warning me or playing me the whole time he had been in the room sixteen lorna and cisco arrived together fifteen minutes after boschs departure and we convened in vincents office i took a seat behind the dead lawyers desk and they sat side by side in front of it it was another scorekeeping session in which we went over cases what had been accomplished the previous night and what still needed to be done with cisco driving i had visited eleven of vincents clients the night before signing up eight of them and giving back files to the remaining three these were the priority cases potential clients i hoped to keep because they could pay or their cases had garnered some form of merit in my review they were cases i could win or be challenged by so it had not been a bad night i had even convinced the woman charged with indecent exposure to keep me on as her attorney and of course bagging walter elliot was the icing on the cake lorna reported that she had faxed him a representation contract and it had already been signed and returned we were in good shape there i could start chipping away at the hundred thousand in the trust account we next set the plan for the day i told lorna that i wanted her and wren if she showed up to run down the remaining clients apprise them of jerry vincents demise and set up appointments for me to discuss the options of legal representation i also wanted lorna to continue building the calendar and familiarizing herself with vincents files and financial records i told cisco i wanted him to focus his attention on the elliot case with particular emphasis on witness maintenance this meant that he had to take the preliminary defense witness list which had already been compiled by jerry vincent and prepare subpoenas for the law enforcement officers and other witnesses who might be considered hostile to the defenses cause for the paid expert witness and others who were willingly going to testify at trial for the defense he had to make contact and assure them that the trial was moving forward as scheduled with me replacing vincent at the helm got it cisco said what about the vincent investigation you still want me monitoring yes keep tabs on that and let me know what you find out i found out that they spent last night sweating somebody but kicked him loose this morning who i dont know yet a suspect they cut him loose so whoever it was is cleared for now i nodded as i thought about this no wonder bosch looked like he had been up all night what are you going to be doing today lorna asked my priority starting today is elliot there are a few things on these other cases that ill need to pay some attention to but for the most part im going to be on elliot from here on out weve got jury selection in eight days today i want to start at the crime scene i should go with you cisco said no i just want to get a feel for the place you can get in there with a camera and tape measure later mick isnt there any way you can convince elliot to delay lorna asked doesnt he realize that you need time to study and understand the case i told him that but hes not interested he made it a condition of my hire i had to agree to go to trial next week or hed find another lawyer who could he says hes innocent and doesnt want to wait a single day longer to prove it do you believe him i shrugged doesnt matter he believes it and hes got this strange confidence in it all turning out his way like the monday morning box office so i either get ready to go to trial at the end of next week or i lose the client just then the door to the office swung open and revealed wren williams standing tentatively in the doorway excuse me she said hello wren i said glad youre here could you wait out there in reception and lorna will be right out to work with you no problem you also have one of the clients waiting out here patrick henson he was already waiting when i came in i looked at my watch it was five of nine it was a good sign in regard to patrick henson then send him in a young man walked in patrick henson was smaller than i thought he would be but maybe it was the low center of gravity that made him a good surfer he had the requisite hardened tan but his hair was cropped short no earrings no white shell necklace or sharks tooth no tattoos that i could see he wore black cargo pants and what probably passed as his best shirt it had a collar patrick we spoke on the phone yesterday im mickey haller and this is my case manager lorna taylor this big guy is cisco my investigator he stepped toward the desk and shook our hands his grip was firm im glad you decided to come in is that your fish on the wall back there without moving his feet henson swiveled at the hips as if on a surfboard and looked at the fish hanging on the wall yeah thats betty you gave a stuffed fish a name lorna asked what was it a pet henson smiled more to himself than to us no i caught it a long time ago back in florida we hung it by the front door in the place i was sharing in malibu my roommates and me wed always say hellooo betty to it when we came home it was kind of stupid he swiveled back and looked at me speaking of names do we call you trick nah that was just the name my agent came up with i dont have him anymore you can just call me patrick okay and you told me you had a valid drivers license sure do he reached into a front pocket and removed a thick nylon wallet he pulled his license out and handed it to me i studied it for a moment and then handed it to cisco he studied it a little longer and then nodded giving it his official approval okay patrick i need a driver i said i provide the car and gas and insurance and you show up here every morning at nine to drive me wherever i need to go i told you the pay schedule yesterday you still interested im interested are you a safe driver lorna asked ive never had an accident patrick said i nodded my approval they say an addict is best suited for spotting another addict i was looking for signs that he was still using heavy eyelids slow speech avoidance of eye contact but i didnt pick up on anything when can you start he shrugged i dont have anything i mean whenever you want i guess how about we start right now today will be a testdrive well see how you do and we can talk about it at the end of the day sounds good to me okay well were going to get out of here and hit the road and ill explain in the car how i like things to work cool he hooked his thumbs in his pockets and awaited the next move or instruction he looked like he was about thirty but that was because of what the sun had done to his skin i knew from the file that he was only twentyfour and still had a lot to learn today the plan was to take him back to school seventeen we took the out of downtown and headed west toward malibu i sat in the back and opened my computer on the folddown table while i waited for it to boot up i told patrick henson how it all worked patrick i havent had an office since i left the public defenders office twelve years ago my car is my office ive got two other lincolns just like this one i keep them in rotation each ones got a printer a fax and ive got a wireless card in my computer anything i have to do in an office i can do back here while im on the road to the next place there are more than forty courthouses spread across la county being mobile is the best way to do business cool patrick said i wouldnt want to be in an office either damn right i said too claustrophobic my computer was ready i went to the file where i kept generic forms and motions and began to customize a pretrial motion to examine evidence im working on your case right now patrick he looked at me in the mirror what do you mean well i reviewed your file and theres something mr vincent hadnt done that i think we need to do that may help whats that get an independent appraisal of the necklace you took they list the value as twentyfive thousand and that bumps you up to a felony theft category but it doesnt look like anybody ever challenged that you mean like if the diamonds are bogus theres no felony it could work out like that but i was thinking of something else too what i pulled his file out of my bag so i could check a name let me ask you a few questions first patrick i said what were you doing in that house where you took the necklace he shrugged his shoulders i was dating the old ladys youngest daughter i met her on the beach and was sort of teaching her to surf we went out a few times and hung out one time there was a birthday party at the house and i was invited and the mother was given the necklace as a gift thats when you learned its value yeah the father said they were diamonds when he gave it to her he was real proud of em so then the next time you were there at the house you stole the necklace he didnt respond it wasnt a question patrick its a fact im your lawyer now and we need to discuss the facts of the case just dont ever lie to me or i wont be your lawyer anymore okay so the next time you were in the house you stole the necklace yeah tell me about it we were there alone using the pool and i said i had to go to the can only i really just wanted to check the medicine cabinet for pills i was hurting there werent any in the bathroom downstairs so i went upstairs and looked around i looked in the old ladys jewelry box and saw the necklace i just took it he shook his head and i knew why he was thoroughly embarrassed and defeated by the actions his addiction had made him take i had been there myself and knew that looking back from sobriety was almost as scary as looking forward its all right patrick thank you for being honest what did the guy say when you pawned it he said hed only give me four bills because the chain was gold but he didnt think the diamonds were legit i told him he was full of shit but what could i do i took the money and went down to tj i needed the tabs and so i took what he was giving i was so messed up on the stuff i didnt care whats the name of the girl its not in the file mandolin like the instrument her parents call her mandy have you talked to her since you were arrested no man were done now the eyes in the mirror looked sad and humiliated stupid henson said the whole thing was stupid i thought about things for a moment and then reached into my jacket pocket and pulled out a polaroid photograph i handed it over the seat and tapped patrick on the shoulder with it take a look at that he took the photo and held it on top of the steering wheel while he looked at it what the hell happened to you he asked i tripped over a curb and did a nice face plant in front of my house broke a tooth and my nose opened up my forehead pretty good too they took that picture for me in the er to carry around as a reminder of what i had just gotten out of my car after driving my elevenyearold daughter home to her mother by then i was up to three hundred twenty milligrams of oxycontin a day crushing and snorting first thing in the morning except for me the mornings were the afternoon i let him register that for a few moments before continuing so patrick you think what you did was stupid i was driving my little girl around on three hundred twenty migs of hillbilly heroin now i shook my head theres nothing you can do about the past patrick except keep it there he was staring directly at me in the mirror im going to help you get through the legal stuff i said its up to you to do the rest and the rest is the hard part but you already know that he nodded anyway i see a ray of light here patrick something jerry vincent didnt see what is it the victims husband gave her that necklace his name is roger vogler and hes a big supporter of lots of elected people in the county yeah hes big into politics mandolin told me that they hold fundraisers and stuff at the house well if the diamonds on that necklace are phony hes not going to want that coming up in court especially if his wife doesnt know but hows he gonna stop it hes a contributor patrick his contributions helped elect at least four members of the county board of supervisors the county supervisors control the budget of the district attorneys office the da is prosecuting you its a food chain if dr vogler wants to send a message believe me it will be sent henson nodded he was beginning to see the light the motion im going to file requests that we be allowed to independently examine and appraise the evidence to wit the diamond necklace you never know that word appraise may stir things up well just have to sit back and see what happens do we go to court to file it no im going to write this thing up right now and send it to the court in an email thats cool the beauty of the internet thanks mr haller youre welcome patrick can i have my picture back now he handed it over the seat and i took a look at it i had a marble under my lip and my nose was pointing in the wrong direction there was also a bloody friction abrasion on my forehead the eyes were the toughest part to study dazed and lost staring unsteadily at the camera this was me at my lowest point i put the photo back in my pocket for safekeeping we drove in silence for the next fifteen minutes while i finished the motion went online and sent it it was definitely a shot across the prosecutions bow and it felt good the lincoln lawyer was back on the beat the lone ranger was riding again i made sure i looked up from the computer when we hit the tunnel that marks the end of the freeway and dumps out onto the pacific coast highway i cracked the window open i always loved the feeling i got when id swing out of the tunnel and see and smell the ocean we followed the pch as it took us north to malibu it was hard for me to go back to the computer when i had the blue pacific right outside my office window i finally gave up lowered the window all the way and just rode once we got past the mouth of topanga canyon i started seeing packs of surfers on the swells i checked patrick and saw him taking glances out toward the water it said in the file you did your rehab at crossroads in antigua i said yeah the place eric clapton started nice as far as those places go i suppose true any waves there none to speak of i didnt get much of a chance to use a board anyway did you do rehab yeah in laurel canyon that place all the stars go to it was close to home yeah well i went the other way i was as far from my friends and my home as possible it worked you thinking about going back into surfing he glanced out the window before answering a dozen surfers in wet suits were straddling their boards out there waiting on the next set i dont think so at least not on a professional level my shoulders shot i was about to ask what he needed his shoulder for when he continued his answer the paddlings one thing but the key thing is getting up i lost my move when i fucked up my shoulder excuse the language thats okay besides im taking things one day at a time they taught you that in laurel canyon didnt they they did but surfings a onedayatatime onewaveatatime sort of thing isnt it he nodded and i watched his eyes they kept tripping to the mirror and looking back at me what do you want to ask me patrick um yeah i had a question you know how vincent kept my fish and put it on the wall yeah well i was uh wondering if he kept any of my boards somewhere i opened his file again and looked through it until i found the liquidators report it listed twelve surfboards and the prices obtained for them you gave him twelve boards right yeah all of them well he gave them to his liquidator whats that its a guy he used when he took assets from clients you know jewelry property cars mostly and would turn them into cash to be applied toward his fee according to the report here the liquidator sold all twelve of them took twenty percent and gave vincent fortyeight hundred dollars patrick nodded his head but didnt say anything i watched him for a few moments and then looked back at the liquidators inventory sheet i remembered that patrick had said in that first phone call that the two long boards were the most valuable on the inventory there were two boards described as ten feet long both were made by one world in sarasota florida one sold for to a collector and the other for on ebay the online auction site the disparity between the two sales made me think the ebay sale was bogus the liquidator had probably sold the board to himself cheap he would then turn around and sell it at a profit hed keep for himself everybodys got an angle including me i knew that if he hadnt resold the board yet then i still had a shot at it what if i could get you one of the long boards back i asked that would be awesome i just wish i had kept one you know no promises but ill see what i can do i decided to pursue it later by putting my investigator on it cisco showing up and asking questions would probably make the liquidator more accommodating patrick and i didnt speak for the rest of the ride in another twenty minutes we pulled into the driveway of walter elliots house it was of moorish design with white stone and dark brown shutters the center facade rose into a tower silhouetted against the blue sky a silver midlevel mercedes was parked on the cobblestone pavers we parked next to it you want me to wait here patrick asked yeah i dont think ill take too long i know this house its all glass in the back i tried to surf behind it a couple times but it closes out on the inside and the rips really bad pop the trunk for me i got out and went to the back to retrieve my digital camera i turned it on to make sure i had some battery power and took a quick shot of the front of the house the camera was working and i was good to go i walked to the entrance and the front door opened before i could push the bell mrs albrecht stood there looking as lovely as i had seen her the day before eighteen when walter elliot had told me he would have someone meet me at the house in malibu i hadnt expected it to be his executive assistant mrs albrecht how are you today very well i just got here and thought maybe i had missed you nope i just got here too come in please the house had a twostory entry area below the tower i looked up and saw a wroughtiron chandelier hanging in the atrium there were cobwebs on it and i wondered if they had formed because the house had gone unused since the murders or because the chandelier was too high up and too hard to get to with a duster this way mrs albrecht said i followed her into the great room which was larger than my entire home it was a complete entertainment area with a glass wall on the western exposure that brought the pacific right into the house beautiful i said it is indeed do you want to see the bedroom ignoring the question i turned the camera on and took a few shots of the living room and its view do you know who has been in here since the sheriffs department relinquished control of it i asked mrs albrecht thought for a moment before answering very few people i do not believe that mr elliot has been out here but of course mr vincent came out once and his investigator came out a couple of times i believe and the sheriffs department has come back twice since turning the property back over to mr elliot they had search warrants copies of the search warrants were in the case file both times they were looking for only one thing the murder weapon the case against elliot was all circumstantial even with the gunshot residue on his hands they needed the murder weapon to ice the case but they didnt have it the notes in the file said that divers had searched the waters behind the house for two days after the murders but had also failed to come up with the gun what about cleaners i asked did someone come in and clean the place up no no one like that we were told by mr vincent to leave things as they were in case he needed to use the place during the trial there was no mention in the case files of vincent possibly using the house in any way during the trial i wasnt sure what the thinking would have been there my instinctive response upon seeing the place was that i wouldnt want a jury anywhere near it the view and sheer opulence of the property would underline elliots wealth and serve to disconnect him from the jurors they would understand that they werent really a jury of his peers they would know that he was from a completely different planet wheres the master suite i asked it comprises the entire top floor then lets go up as we went up a winding white staircase with an oceanblue banister i asked mrs albrecht what her first name was i told her i felt uncomfortable being so formal with her especially when her boss and i were on a firstname basis my name is nina you can call me that if you want good and you can call me mickey the stairs led to a door that opened into a bedroom suite the size of some courtrooms i had been in it was so big it had twin fireplaces on the north and south walls there was a sitting area a sleeping area and hisandher bathrooms nina albrecht pushed a button near the door and the curtains covering the west view silently began to split and reveal a wall of glass that looked out over the sea the custommade bed was double the size of a regular king it had been stripped of the top mattress and all linens and pillows and i assumed these had been taken for forensic analysis in two locations in the room sixfootsquare segments of carpet had been cut out again i believed for the collection and analysis of blood evidence on the wall next to the door there were bloodspatter marks that had been circled and marked with letter codes by investigators there were no other signs of the violence that had occurred in the room i walked to the corner by the glass wall and looked back into the room i raised the camera and took a few shots from different angles nina walked into the shot a couple times but it didnt matter the photos werent for court i would use them to refresh my memory of the place while i was working out the trial strategy a murder scene is a map if you know how to read it you can sometimes find your way the lay of the land the repose of victims in death the angle of views and light and blood the spatial restrictions and geometric differentiations were all elements of the map you cant always get all of that from a police photo sometimes you have to see it for yourself this is why i had come to the house in malibu for the map for the geography of murder when i understood it i would be ready to go to trial from the corner i looked at the square cut out of the white carpet near the bedroom door this is where the male victim johan rilz had been shot down my eyes traveled to the bed where mitzi elliot had been shot her naked body sprawled diagonally across it the investigative summary in the file suggested that the naked couple had heard an intruder in the house rilz went to the bedroom door and opened it only to be immediately surprised by the killer rilz was shot down in the doorway and the killer stepped over his body and into the room mitzi elliot jumped up from the bed and stood frozen by its side clutching a pillow in front of her naked body the state believed that the elements of the crime suggested that she knew her killer she might have pleaded for her life or might have known her death could not be stopped she was shot twice through the pillow from a distance estimated at three feet and knocked back onto the bed the pillow she had used as a shield fell to the floor the killer then stepped forward to the bed and pressed the barrel of the gun against her forehead for the kill shot that was the official version anyway standing there in the corner of the room i knew there were enough unfounded assumptions built into it that i would have no trouble slicing and dicing it at trial i looked at the glass doors that led out to a deck overlooking the pacific there had been nothing in the files about whether the curtain and doors had been open at the time of the murders i was not sure it meant anything one way or the other but it was a detail i wouldve liked to know i walked over to the glass doors and found them locked i had a hard time figuring out how to open them nina finally came over and helped me holding her finger down on a safety lever while turning the bolt with her other hand the doors opened outward and brought in the sounds of the crashing surf i immediately knew that if the doors had been open at the time of the murders then the sound of the surf could have easily drowned out any noise an intruder might have made in the house this would contradict the states theory that rilz was killed at the bedroom door because he had gone to the door after hearing an intruder it would then raise a new question about what rilz was doing naked at the door but that didnt matter to the defense i only needed to raise questions and point out discrepancies to plant the seed of doubt in a jurors mind it took only one doubt in one jurors mind for me to be successful it was the distortordestroy method of criminal defense i stepped out onto the deck i didnt know if it was high or low tide but suspected it was somewhere in between the water was close the waves were coming in and washing right up to the piers on which the house was built there were sixfoot swells but no surfers out there i remembered what patrick had said about attempting to surf in the cove i walked back inside and as soon as i reentered the bedroom i realized my phone was ringing but i had been unable to hear it because of the ocean noise i checked to see who it was but it said private caller on the screen i knew that most people in law enforcement blocked their id nina i have to take this do you mind going out to my car and asking my driver to come in no problem thank you i took the call hello its me im just checking to see when youre coming by me was my first exwife maggie mcpherson under the recently revamped custody agreement i got to be with my daughter on wednesday nights and every other weekend only it was a long way from the shared custody wed once had but i had blown that along with the second chance id had with maggie probably around seven thirty i have a meeting with a client this afternoon and it might run a little late there was silence and i sensed i had given the wrong answer what youve got a date i asked what time you want me there im supposed to leave at seven thirty then ill be there before that whos the lucky guy that wouldnt be any of your business but speaking of lucky i heard you got jerry vincents whole practice nina albrecht and patrick henson entered the bedroom i saw patrick looking at the missing square in the carpet i covered the phone and asked them to go back downstairs and wait for me i then went back to the phone conversation my exwife was a deputy district attorney assigned to the van nuys courthouse this put her in a position to hear things about me thats right i said im his replacement but i dont know how lucky that makes me you should get a good ride on the elliot case im standing in the murder house right now nice view well good luck in getting him off if anyone can its certainly you she said it with a prosecutors sneer i guess i wont respond to that i know how you would anyway one other thing youre not going to have company over tonight are you what are you talking about im talking about two weeks ago hayley said a woman was there i believe her name was lanie she felt very awkward about it dont worry she wont be there tonight shes just a friend and she used the guest room but for the record i can have anybody i want over at my house at any time because its my house and you are free to do the same at your house and im also free to go to the judge and say youre exposing our daughter to people who are drug addicts i took a deep breath before responding as calmly as i could how would you know who i am exposing hayley to because your daughter isnt stupid and her hearing is perfect she told me a little bit of what was said and it was quite easy to figure out that your friend is from rehab and so thats a crime consorting with people from rehab its not a crime michael i just dont think it is best for hayley to be exposed to a parade of addicts when she stays with you now its a parade i guess the one addict youre most concerned with is me well if the shoe fits i almost lost it but once again calmed myself by gulping down some of the fresh sea air when i spoke i was calm i knew that showing anger would only hurt me in the long run when it came time to readdress the custody arrangement maggie this is our daughter were talking about here dont hurt her by trying to hurt me she needs her father and i need my daughter and thats my point you are doing well hooking up with an addict is not a good idea i was squeezing my phone so hard i thought it might break i could feel the scarlet burn of embarrassment on my cheeks and neck i have to go my words came out strangled by my own failures and so do i ill tell hayley youll be there by seven thirty she always did that ended the call with inferences that i would disappoint my daughter if i was late or couldnt make a scheduled pickup she hung up before i could respond the living room downstairs was empty but then i saw patrick and nina out on the lower deck i stepped out and over to the railing where patrick stood staring at the waves i tried to put the upset from the conversation with my exwife out of my head patrick you said you tried surfing here but the rip was too strong thats right are you talking about a riptide yeah its tough out here the shape of the cove creates it the energy of the waves coming in on the north side is redirected under the surface and sort of ricochets south it follows the contour of the cove and carries it all the way down and then out i got caught in that pipeline a couple times man it took me all the way out past those rocks at the south end i studied the cove as he described what was happening beneath the surface if he was right and there was a riptide on the day of the murders then the sheriffs divers had probably searched in the wrong place for the murder weapon and now it was too late if the killer had thrown the gun into the surf it could have been carried in the underwater pipeline completely out of the cove and out to sea i began to feel confident that the murder weapon would not be making a surprise appearance at trial as far as my client was concerned that was a good thing i stared out at the waves and thought about how beneath the beautiful surface a hidden power never stopped moving nineteen the writers had taken the day off or moved their picket line to another protest location at archway studios we made it through the security checkpoint without any of the delay of the day before it helped that nina albrecht was in the car in front of us and had smoothed the way it was late and the studio was emptying out for the day patrick was able to get a parking spot right in front of elliots bungalow patrick was excited because he had never been inside the gates of a movie studio i told him he was free to look around but to keep his phone handy because i was unsure how long the meeting with my client would last and i needed to stick to a schedule for picking up my daughter as i followed nina in i asked her if there was a place for me to meet with elliot other than his office i said i had paperwork to spread out and that the table we had sat at the day before was too small she said she would take me to the executive boardroom and i could set up there while she went to get her boss and bring him to the meeting i said that would be fine but the truth was i wasnt going to spread documents out i just wanted to meet with elliot in a neutral spot if i was sitting across from him at his worktable he would have command of the meeting that was made clear during our first encounter elliot was a forceful personality but i needed to be the one in charge from here on out it was a big room with twelve black leather chairs around the polished oval table there was an overhead projector and a long box on the far wall containing the dropdown screen the other walls were hung with framed posters of the movies that had been made on the lot i assumed that these were the films that had made the studio money i took a seat and pulled the case files out of my bag twentyfive minutes later i was looking through the states discovery documents when the door opened and elliot finally walked in i didnt bother to get up or extend my hand i tried to look annoyed as i pointed him to a chair across the table from me nina trailed him into the room to see what she could get us for refreshment nothing nina i said before elliot could respond were going to be fine and we need to get started well let you know if we need anything she seemed momentarily taken aback by the issuance of orders from someone other than elliot she looked to him for clarification and he simply nodded she left closing the double doors behind her elliot sat down in the chair i had pointed him to i looked across the table at my client for a long moment before speaking i cant figure you out walter what do you mean whats to figure out well for starters you spend a lot of time protesting your innocence but i dont think you are taking this that seriously youre wrong about that am i you understand that if you lose this trial you are going to prison and there wont be any bail on a doublemurder conviction while you appeal you get a bad verdict and theyll cuff you in the courtroom and take you away elliot leaned a few inches toward me before responding again i understand exactly the position i am in so dont dare tell me i am not taking it seriously okay then when we set a meeting lets be on time for it there is a lot of ground to cover and not a lot of time to cover it i know you have a studio to run but that is no longer the priority for the next two weeks you have one priority this case now he looked at me for a long moment before responding it may have been the first time in his life he had been chided for being late and then told what to do finally he nodded fair enough he said i nodded back our positions were now understood we were in his boardroom and on his studio lot but i was the alpha dog now his future depended on me good i said now the first thing i need to ask is whether we are speaking privately in here of course we are well we werent yesterday it was pretty clear that ninas got your office wired that may be fine for your movie meetings but its not fine when were discussing your case im your lawyer and no one should hear our discussion no one nina has no privilege she could be subpoenaed to testify against you in fact it wont surprise me if she ends up on the prosecutions witness list elliot leaned back in his padded chair and raised his face toward the ceiling nina he said mute the feed if i need anything i will call you on the line he looked at me and opened his hands i nodded that i was satisfied thank you walter now lets get to work i have a question first sure is this the meeting where i tell you i didnt do it and then you tell me that it doesnt matter to you whether i did it or not i nodded whether you did it or not is irrelevant walter its what the state can prove beyond a no he slammed an open palm down on the table it sounded like a shot i was startled but hoped i didnt show it i am tired of that legal bullshit that it doesnt matter whether i did it only what can be proved it does matter dont you see it does matter i need to be believed goddamnit i need you to believe me i dont care what the evidence is against me i did not do this do you understand me do you believe me if my own lawyer doesnt believe me or care then i dont have a chance i was sure nina was going to come charging in to see if everything was all right i leaned back in my padded chair and waited for her and to make sure elliot was finished as expected one of the doors opened and nina was about to step in but elliot dismissed her with a wave of his hand and a harsh command not to bother us the door closed again and he locked eyes with me i held my hand up to stop him from speaking it was my turn walter there are two things i have to concern myself with i said calmly whether i understand the states case and whether i can knock it down i tapped a finger on the discovery file as i spoke at the moment i do understand the states case its straightforward prosecution oneohone the state believes that they have motive and opportunity in spades lets go with motive first your wife was having an affair and that made you angry not only that but the prenuptial agreement she signed twelve years before had vested and the only way you could get rid of her without splitting everything up was to kill her next is opportunity they have the time your car left through the gate at archway that morning theyve made the run and timed it again and again and say you couldve easily been at the malibu house at the time of the killings that is opportunity and what the state is counting on is motive and opportunity being enough to sway the jury and win the day while the actual evidence against you is quite thin and very circumstantial so my job is to figure out a way of making the jury understand that there is a lot of smoke here but no real fire if i do that then you walk away i still want to know if you believe i am innocent i smiled and shook my head walter im telling you it doesnt matter it does to me one way or the other i need to know i relented and held my hands up in surrender all right then ill tell you what i think walter i have studied the file forwards and backwards ive read everything in here at least twice and most of it three times i have now been out to the beach house where this unfortunate event happened and studied the geography of these murders i have done all of that and i can see the very real possibility that you are innocent of these charges does that mean that i believe that you are an innocent man no walter it doesnt im sorry but i have been doing this too long and the reality is i havent seen too many innocent clients so the best i can tell you is that i dont know if thats not good enough for you then i am sure you will have no trouble finding a lawyer who will tell you exactly what you want to hear whether he believes it or not i rocked back in my chair while awaiting his response he clasped his hands together on the table in front of him while he chewed on my words and then he finally nodded then i guess that is the best i can ask for he said i tried to let out my breath without his noticing i still had the case for the moment but you know what i do believe walter what do you believe that youre holding out on me holding out what are you talking about theres something i dont know about this case and you are holding back on it with me i dont know what you are talking about you are too confident walter its like you know you are going to walk i am going to walk im innocent being innocent is not enough innocent men sometimes get convicted and deep down everybody knows it thats why ive never met a truly innocent man who wasnt scared scared that the system wont work right that its built to find guilty people guilty and not innocent people innocent thats what youre missing walter youre not scared i dont know what youre talking about why should i be scared i stared across the table at him trying to read him i knew my instincts were right there was something i didnt know something that i had missed in the files or that vincent had carried in his head instead of his files whatever it was elliot wasnt sharing it with me yet for now that was okay sometimes you dont want to know what your client knows because once the smoke comes out of the bottle you cant put it back in all right walter i said to be continued meantime lets go to work without waiting for a reply i opened the defense file and looked at the notes i had written on the inside flap i think were set in terms of witnesses and strategy when it comes to the states case what i have not found in the file is a solid strategy for putting forth your defense what do you mean elliot asked jerry told me we were ready maybe not walter i know its not something you want to see or hear but i found this in the file i slid a twopage document across the polished table to him he glanced at it but didnt really look at it what is it that is a motion for a continuance jerry drew it up but hadnt filed it but it seems clear that he wanted to delay the trial the coding on the motion indicates he printed it out monday just a few hours before he was killed elliot shook his head and shoved the document back across the table no we talked about it and he agreed with me to move forward on schedule that was monday yes monday the last time i talked to him i nodded that covered one of the questions i had vincent kept billing records in each of his files and i had noted in the elliot file that he had billed an hour on the day of his murder was that a conference at his office or yours it was a phone call monday afternoon hed left a message earlier and i called him back nina can get you the exact time if you need it he has it down here at three he talked to you about a delay thats right but i told him no delay vincent had billed an hour i wondered how long he and elliot had sparred over the delay why did he want a continuance i asked he just wanted more time to prepare and maybe pad his bill i told him we were ready like im telling you we are ready i sort of laughed and shook my head the thing is youre not the lawyer here walter i am and thats what im trying to tell you im not seeing much here in terms of a defense strategy i think thats why jerry wanted to delay the trial he didnt have a case no its the prosecution that doesnt have the case i was growing tired of elliot and his insistence on calling the legal shots let me explain how this works i said wearily and forgive me if you know all of this walter its going to be a twopart trial okay the prosecutor goes first and he lays out his case we get a chance to attack it as he goes then we get our shot and thats when we put up our evidence and alternate theories of the crime okay and what i can tell from my study of the files is that jerry vincent was relying more on the prosecutions case than on a defense case there are how so what im saying is that hes locked and loaded on the prosecution side he has counter witnesses and crossexamination plans ready for everything the prosecution is going to put forward but im missing something on the defense side of the equation weve got no alibi no alternate suspects no alternate theories nothing at least nothing in the file and thats what i mean when i say we have no case did he ever discuss with you how he planned to roll out the defense no we were going to have that conversation but then he got killed he told me that he was working all of that out he said he had the magic bullet and the less i knew the better he was going to tell me when we got closer to trial but he never did he never got the chance i knew the term the magic bullet was your getoutofjailandgohome card it was the witness or piece of evidence that you had in your back pocket that was going to either knock all the evidence down like dominoes or firmly and permanently fix reasonable doubt in the mind of every juror on the panel if vincent had a magic bullet he hadnt noted it in the case file and if he had a magic bullet why was he talking about a delay on monday you have no idea what this magic bullet was i asked elliot just what he told me that he found something that was going to blow the state out of the water that doesnt make sense if on monday he was talking about delaying the trial elliot shrugged i told you he just wanted more time to be prepared probably more time to charge me more money but i told him when we make a movie we pick a date and that movie comes out on that date no matter what i told him we were going to trial without delay i nodded my head at elliots nodelay mantra but my mind was on vincents missing laptop was the magic bullet in there had he saved his plan on the computer and not put it into the hard file was the magic bullet the reason for his murder had his discovery been so sensitive or dangerous that someone had killed him for it i decided to move on with elliot while i had him in front of me well walter i dont have the magic bullet but if jerry could find it then so can i i will i checked my watch and tried to give the outward appearance that i was not troubled by not knowing what was assuredly the key element in the case okay lets talk about an alternate theory meaning what meaning that the state has its theory and we should have ours the states theory is that you were upset over your wifes infidelity and what it would cost you to divorce her so you went out to malibu and killed both your wife and her lover you then got rid of the murder weapon in some way either hid it or threw it into the ocean and then called nineoneone to report that you had discovered the murders that theory gives them all they need motive and opportunity but to back it up they have the gsr and almost nothing else gsr gunshot residue their evidentiary case what little there is firmly rests on it that test was a false positive elliot said forcefully i never shot any weapon and jerry told me he was bringing in the top expert in the country to knock it all down a woman from john jay in new york shell testify that the sheriffs lab procedures were sloppy and lax prone to come up with the false positive i nodded i liked the fervor of his denial it could be useful if he testified yes dr arslanian we still have her coming in i said but shes no magic bullet walter the prosecution will counter with their own expert saying exactly the opposite that the lab is well run and that all procedures were followed at best the gsr will be a wash the prosecution will still be leaning heavily on motive and opportunity what motive i loved her and i didnt even know about rilz i thought he was a faggot i held my hands up in a slowitdown gesture look do yourself a favor walter and dont call him that in court or anywhere else if it is appropriate to reference his sexual orientation you say you thought he was gay okay okay now the prosecution will simply say that you did know johan rilz was your wifes lover and theyll trot out evidence and testimony that will indicate that a divorce forced by your wifes infidelity would cost you in excess of a hundred million dollars and possibly dilute your control of the studio they plant all of that in the jurys minds and you start having a pretty good motivation for murder and its all bullshit and ill be able to potshot the hell out of it at trial a lot of their positives can be turned into negatives it will be a dance walter well trade punches well try to distort and destroy but ultimately theyll land more punches than we can block and thats why were the underdog and why its always good for the defense to float an alternate theory we give the jury a plausible explanation for why these two people were killed we throw suspicion away from you and at somebody else like the onearmed man in the fugitive i shook my head not exactly i remembered the movie and the television show before it in both cases there actually was a onearmed man i was talking about a smoke screen an alternate theory concocted by the defense because i wasnt buying into elliots iaminnocent rap at least not yet there was a buzzing sound and elliot took a phone out of his pocket and looked at the screen walter we have work here i said he didnt take the call and reluctantly put the phone away i continued okay during the prosecution phase we are going to use crossexamination to make one thing crystal clear to the jury that is that once that gsr test came back positive on you then false positive whatever the point is once they had what they believed was a positive indication that you had very recently fired a weapon all bets were off a wideopen investigation became very tightly focused on one thing you it went from what they call a fullfield investigation to a full investigation of you so what happened is that they left a lot of stones unturned for example rilz had only been in this country four years not a single investigator went to germany to check on his background and whether he had any enemies back there who wanted him dead thats just one thing they didnt thoroughly background the guy in la either this was a man who was allowed entry into the homes and lives of some of the wealthiest women in this city excuse my bluntness but was he banging other married clients or just your wife were there other important and powerful men he could have angered or just you elliot didnt respond to the crude questions i had asked them that way on purpose to see if it got a rise out of him or any reaction that contradicted his statements of loving his wife but he showed no reaction either way you see what im getting at walter the focus from almost the very start was on you when its the defenses turn were going to put it on rilz and from that well grow doubts like stalks in a cornfield elliot nodded thoughtfully as he looked down at his reflection in the polished tabletop but this cant be the magic bullet jerry told you about i said and there are risks in going after rilz elliot raised his eyes to mine because the prosecutor knows this was a deficiency when the investigators brought in the case hes had five months to anticipate that we might go this way and if he is good as i am sure he is then hes been quietly getting ready for us to go in this direction wouldnt that come out in the discovery material not always there is an art to discovery most of the time its what is not in the discovery file that is important and that you have to watch out for jeffrey golantz is a seasoned pro he knows just what he has to put in and what he can keep for himself you know golantz youve gone to trial against him before i dont know him and have never gone up against him its his reputation i know hes never lost at trial hes something like twentyseven and oh i checked my watch the time had passed quickly and i needed to keep things moving if i was going to pick my daughter up on time okay i said there are a couple other things we need to cover lets talk about whether you testify thats not a question thats a given i want to clear my name the jury will want me to say i did not do this i knew you were going to say that and i appreciate the fervor i see in your denials but your testimony has to be more than that it has to offer an explanation and thats where we can get into trouble i dont care did you kill your wife and her lover no then why did you go out there to the house i was suspicious if she was there with somebody i was going to confront her and throw him out on his ass you expect this jury to believe that a man who runs abilliondollar movie studio took the afternoon off to drive out to malibu to spy on his wife no im no spy i had suspicions and went out there to see for myself and to confront her with a gun elliot opened his mouth to speak but then hesitated and didnt respond you see walter i said you get up there and you open yourself up to anything most of it not good he shook his head i dont care its a given guilty guys dont testify everybody knows it im testifying that i did not do this he poked a finger at me with each syllable of the last sentence i still liked his forcefulness he was believable maybe he could survive on the stand well ultimately it is your decision i said well get you prepared to testify but we wont make the decision until we get into the defense phase of the trial and we see where we stand its decided now im testifying his face began to turn a deep shade of crimson i had to tread lightly here i didnt want him to testify but it was unethical for me to forbid it it was a client decision and if he ever claimed i took it away from him or refused to let him testify i would have the bar swarming me like angry bees look walter i said youre a powerful man you run a studio and make movies and put millions of dollars on the line every day i understand all of that you are used to making decisions with nobody questioning them but when we go into trial im the boss and while it will be you who makes this decision i need to know that you are listening to me and considering my counsel theres no use going further if you dont he rubbed his hand roughly across his face this was hard for him okay i understand we make a final decision on this later he said it grudgingly it was a concession he didnt want to make no man wants to relinquish his power to another okay walter i said i think that puts us on the same page i checked my watch again there were a few more things on my list and i still had some time okay lets move on i said please i want to add a couple people to the defense team they will be ex no i told you the more lawyers a defendant has the guiltier he looks look at barry bonds tell me people dont think hes guilty hes got more lawyers than teammates walter you didnt let me finish these are not lawyers im talking about and when we go to trial i promise it is going to be just you and me sitting at the table then who do you want to add a juryselection consultant and somebody to work with you on image and testimony all of that no jury consultant makes it look like youre trying to rig things look the person i want to hire will be sitting out in the gallery no one will notice her she plays poker for a living and just reads peoples faces and looks for tells little giveaways thats it no i wont pay for that mumbo jumbo are you sure walter i spent five minutes trying to convince him telling him that picking the jury might be the most important part of the trial i stressed that in circumstantial cases the priority had to be in picking jurors with open minds ones who didnt believe that just because the police or prosecution say something its automatically true i told him that i prided myself on my skills in picking a jury but that i could use the help of an expert who knew how to read faces and gestures at the end of my plea elliot simply shook his head mumbo jumbo i will trust your skills i studied him for a moment and decided wed talked enough for the day i would bring up the rest with him the next time i had come to realize that while he was paying lip service to the idea that i was the trial boss there was no doubt that he was firmly in charge of things and i couldnt help but believe it might lead him straight to prison twenty by the time i dropped patrick back at his car in downtown and headed to the valley in heavy evening traffic i knew i was going to be late and would tip off another confrontation with my exwife i called to let her know but she didnt pick up and i left a message when i finally got to her apartment complex in sherman oaks it was almost seven forty and i found mother and daughter out at the curb waiting hayley had her head down and was looking at the sidewalk i noticed she had begun to adopt this posture whenever her parents came into close proximity of one another it was like she was just standing on the transporter circle and waiting to be beamed far away from us i popped the locks as i pulled to a stop and maggie helped hayley into the back with her school backpack and her overnight bag thanks for being on time she said in a flat voice no problem i said just to see if it would put the flares in her eyes must be a hot date if youre waiting out here for me no not really parentteacher conference at the school that got through my defenses and hit me in the jaw you shouldve told me we couldve gotten a babysitter and gone together im not a baby hayley said from behind me we tried that maggie said from my left remember you jumped on the teacher so badly about hayleys math grade the circumstance of which you knew nothing about that they asked me to handle communications with the school the incident sounded only vaguely familiar it had been safely locked away somewhere in my oxycodonecorrupted memory banks but i felt the burn of embarrassment on my face and neck i didnt have a comeback i have to go maggie said quickly hayley i love you be good for your father and ill see you tomorrow okay mom i stared out the window for a moment at my exwife before pulling away give em hell maggie mcfierce i said i pulled away from the curb and put my window up my daughter asked me why her mother was nicknamed maggie mcfierce because when she goes into battle she always knows she is going to win i said what battle any battle we drove silently down ventura boulevard and stopped for dinner at dupars it was my daughters favorite place to eat dinner because i always let her order pancakes somehow the kid thought ordering breakfast for dinner was crossing some line and it made her feel rebellious and brave i ordered a blt with thousand island dressing on it and considering my last cholesterol count figured i was the one being rebellious and brave we did her homework together which was a breeze for her and taxing for me then i asked her what she wanted to do i was willing to do anything a movie the mall whatever she wanted but i was hoping shed just want to go home to my place and hang out maybe pull out some old family scrapbooks and look at the yellowed photos she hesitated in responding and i thought i knew why theres nobody staying at my place if thats what youre worried about hay the lady you met lanie she doesnt visit me anymore you mean like shes not your girlfriend anymore she never was my girlfriend she was a friend remember when i stayed in the hospital last year i met her there and we became friends we try to watch out for each other and every now and then she comes over when she doesnt want to stay home alone it was the shaded truth lanie ross and i had met in rehab during group therapy we continued the relationship after leaving the program but never consummated it as a romance because we were emotionally incapable of it the addiction had cauterized those nerve endings and they were slow to come back we spent time with each other and were there for each other a twoperson support group but once we were back in the real world i began to recognize in lanie a weakness i instinctively knew she wasnt going to go the distance and i couldnt make the journey with her there are three roads that can be taken in recovery there is the clean path of sobriety and there is the road to relapse the third way is the fast out it is when the traveler realizes that relapse is just a slow suicide and there is no reason to wait i didnt know which of those second two roads lanie would go down but i couldnt follow either one we finally went our separate ways the day after hayley had met her you know hayley you can always tell me if you dont like something or theres something i am doing that is bothering you i know good we were silent for a few moments and i thought she wanted to say something else i gave her the time to work up to it hey dad what baby if that lady wasnt your girlfriend does that mean you and mom might get back together the question left me without words for a few moments i could see the hope in hayleys eyes and wanted her to see the same in mine i dont know hay i messed things up pretty good when we tried that last year now the pain entered her eyes like the shadows of clouds on the ocean but im still working on it baby i said quickly we just have to take it one day at a time im trying to show her that we should be a family again she didnt respond she looked down at her plate okay baby okay did you decide what you want to do i think i just want to go home and watch tv good thats what i want to do we packed up her schoolbooks and i put money down on the bill on the drive over the hill she said her mother had told her i had gotten an important new job i was surprised but happy well its sort of a new job im going back to work doing what i always did but i have a lot of new cases and one big one did your mom tell you that she said you had a big case and everybody would be jealous but you would do real good she said that yeah i drove for a while thinking about that and what it might mean maybe i hadnt entirely blown things with maggie she still respected me on some level maybe that meant something um i looked at my daughter in the rearview mirror it was dark out now but i could see her eyes looking out the window and away from mine children are so easy to read sometimes if only grownups were the same whats up hay um i was just wondering sort of why you cant do what mom does what do you mean like putting bad people in jail she said your big case is with a man who killed two people its like youre always working for the bad guys i was quiet for a moment before finding my words the man i am defending is accused of killing two people hayley nobody has proved he did anything wrong right now hes not guilty of anything she didnt respond and her skepticism was almost palpably emanating from the backseat so much for the innocence of children hayley what i do is just as important as what your mother does when somebody is accused of a crime in our country they are entitled to defend themselves what if at school you were accused of cheating and you knew that you didnt cheat wouldnt you want to be able to explain and defend yourself i think so i think so too its like that with the courts if you get accused of a crime you can have a lawyer like me help you explain and defend yourself the laws are very complicated and its hard for someone to do it by themselves when they dont know all the rules of evidence and things like that so i help them it doesnt mean i agree with them or what they have done if they have done it but its part of the system an important part the explanation felt hollow to me as i said it on an intellectual level i understood and believed the argument every word of it but on a fatherdaughter level i felt like one of my clients squirming on the witness stand how could i get her to believe it when i wasnt sure i believed it anymore myself have you helped any innocent people my daughter asked this time i didnt look in the mirror a few yes it was the best i could honestly say moms made a lot of bad people go to jail i nodded yes she has i used to think we were a great balancing act what she did and what i did now there was no need to finish the thought i turned the radio on and hit the preset button that tuned in the disney music channel the last thing i thought about on the drive home was that maybe grownups were just as easy to read as their children twentyone after dropping my daughter off at school thursday morning i drove directly to jerry vincents law offices it was still early and traffic was light when i got into the garage adjoining the legal center i found that i almost had my pick of the place most lawyers dont get into the office until closer to nine when court starts i had all of them beat by at least an hour i drove up to the second level so i could park on the same floor as the office each level of the garage had its own entrance into the building i drove by the spot where jerry vincent had been parked when he was shot to death and parked farther up the ramp as i walked toward the bridge that connected the garage to the legal center i noticed a parked subaru station wagon with surfboard racks on the roof there was a sticker on the back window that showed the silhouette of a surfer riding the nose of a board it said one world on the sticker the back windows on the wagon were darkly tinted and i couldnt see in i moved up to the front and looked into the car through the drivers side window i could see that the backseat had been folded flat half the rear area was cluttered with open cardboard boxes full of clothes and personal belongings the other half served as a bed for patrick henson i knew this because he was lying there asleep his face turned from the light into the folds of a sleeping bag and it was only then that i remembered something he had said during our first phone conversation when i had asked if he was interested in a job as my driver he had told me he was living out of his car and sleeping in a lifeguard stand i raised my fist to knock on the window but then decided to let patrick sleep i wouldnt need him until later in the morning there was no need to roust him i crossed into the office complex made a turn and headed down a hallway toward the door marked with jerry vincents name standing in front of that door was detective bosch he was listening to his music and waiting for me he had his hands in his pockets and looked pensive maybe even a little put out i was pretty sure we had no appointment so i didnt know what he was upset about maybe it was the music he pulled out the earbuds as i approached and put them away what no coffee i said by way of a greeting not today i could tell you didnt want it yesterday he stepped aside so i could use a key to open the door can i ask you something i said if i said no youd ask anyway youre probably right i opened the door so then just ask the question all right well you dont seem like an ipod sort of guy to me who were you listening to there somebody i am sure you never heard of i get it its tony robbins the selfhelp guru bosch shook his head not rising to take the bait frank morgan he said i nodded the saxophone player yeah i know frank bosch looked surprised as we entered the reception area you know him he said in a disbelieving tone yeah i usually drop by and say hello when he plays at the catalina or the jazz bakery my father loved jazz and back in the fifties and sixties he was franks lawyer frank got into a lot of trouble before he got straight ended up playing in san quentin with art pepper youve heard of him right by the time i met frank he didnt need any help from a defense attorney he was doing good it took bosch a moment to recover from my surprise knowledge of frank morgan the obscure heir to charlie parker who for two decades squandered the inheritance on heroin we crossed the reception area and went into the main office so hows the case going i asked its going he said i heard that before you came and saw me yesterday you spent the night in parker center sweating a suspect no arrest though i moved around behind vincents desk and sat down i started pulling the files out of my bag bosch stayed standing who told you that bosch asked there wasnt anything casual about the question it was more of a demand i acted nonchalant about it i dont know i said i mustve heard it somewhere maybe a reporter who was the suspect thats none of your business then what is my business with you detective why are you here i came to see if you had any more names for me what happened to the names i gave you yesterday theyve checked out how could you check them all out already he leaned down and put both hands on the desk because im not working this case alone okay i have help and we checked out every one of your names every one of them is in jail dead or was not worried about jerry vincent anymore we also checked out several of the people he put away as a prosecutor its a dead end i felt a real sense of disappointment and realized that maybe i had put too much hope in the possibility of one of those names from the past belonging to the killer and his arrest being the end of any threat to me what about demarco the gun dealer i took that one myself and it didnt take long to scratch him off the list hes dead haller died two years ago in his cell up at corcoran internal bleeding when they opened him up they found a toothbrush shiv lodged in the anal cavity it was never determined whether hed put it up there for safekeeping himself or somebody else did it for him but it was a good lesson for the rest of the inmates they even put up a sign never put sharp objects up your ass i leaned back in my seat as much repelled by the story as by the loss of a potential suspect i recovered and tried to continue in nonchalant form well what can i tell you detective demarco was my best shot those names were all i had i told you i cant reveal anything about active cases but heres the deal theres nothing to reveal he shook his head in disbelief i mean it detective ive been through all of the active cases there is nothing in any of them that constitutes a threat or reason for vincent to feel threatened there is nothing in any of them that connects to the fbi there is nothing in any of them that indicates jerry vincent stumbled onto something that put him in harms way besides when you find out bad things about your clients theyre protected so theres nothing there i mean he wasnt representing mobsters he wasnt representing drug dealers there wasnt anything in he represents murderers accused murderers and at the time of his death he had only one murder case walter elliot and there isnt anything there believe me ive looked i wasnt so sure i believed it as i said it but bosch didnt seem to notice he finally sat down on the edge of the chair in front of the desk and his face seemed to change there was an almost desperate look to it jerry was divorced i offered did you check out the exwife they got divorced nine years ago shes happily remarried and about to have her second kid i dont think a woman seven months pregnant is going to come gunning for an exhusband she hasnt talked to in nine years any other relatives a mother in pittsburgh the family angle is dry girlfriend he was banging his secretary but there was nothing serious there and her alibi checks out she was also banging his investigator and they were together that night i felt my face turning red that sordid scenario wasnt too far from my own current situation at least lorna cisco and i had been entangled at different times i rubbed my face as if i were tired and hoped it would account for my new coloration thats convenient i said that they alibi each other bosch shook his head it checks out through witnesses they were with friends at a screening at archway that bigshot client of yours got them the invitation i nodded and took an educated guess at something then threw a zinger at bosch the guy you sweated in a room that first night was the investigator bruce carlin who told you that you just did you had a classic love triangle it wouldve been the place to start smart lawyer but like i said it didnt pan out we spent a night on it and in the morning we were still at square one tell me about the money hed thrown a zinger right back at me what money the money in the business accounts i suppose youre going to tell me they are protected territory too actually id probably need to talk to the judge for an opinion on that but i dont need to bother my case manager is one of the best accounts people ive ever run across shes been working with the books and she tells me theyre clean every penny jerry took in is accounted for bosch didnt respond so i continued let me tell you something detective when lawyers get into trouble most of the time its because of the money the books its the one place where there are no gray areas its the one place where the california bar loves to stick its nose in i keep the cleanest books in the business because i dont ever want to give them a reason to come after me so i would know and lorna my case manager would know if there was something in these books that didnt add up but there isnt i think jerry probably paid himself a little too quickly but there is nothing technically wrong with that i saw boschs eyes light on something i had said what whats that mean he paid himself too quickly it means let me just start at the start the way it works is you take on a client and you receive an advance that money goes into the client trust account its their money but you are holding it because you want to make sure you can get it when you earn it you follow yeah you cant trust your clients because theyre criminals so you get the money up front and put it in a trust account then you pay yourself from it as you do the work more or less anyway its in the trust and as you do the work make appearances prepare the case and so forth you take your fees from the trust account you move it into the operating account then from the operating account you pay your own bills and salaries rent secretary investigator car costs and so on and so forth you also pay yourself okay so how did vincent pay himself too quickly well i am not exactly saying he did its a matter of custom and practice but it looks from the books that he liked to keep a low balance in operating he happened to have had a franchise client who paid a large advance up front and that money went through the trust and operating accounts pretty quickly after costs the rest went to jerry vincent in salary boschs body language indicated i was hitting on something that jibed with something else and was important to him he had leaned slightly toward me and seemed to have tightened his shoulders and neck walter elliot he said was he the franchise i cant give out that information but i think its an easy guess to make bosch nodded and i could see that he was working on something inside i waited and he said nothing how does this help you detective i finally asked i cant give out that information but i think its an easy guess to make i nodded hed nailed me back look we both have rules we have to follow i said were flip sides of the same coin im just doing my job and if there is nothing else i can help you with ill get back to it bosch stared at me and seemed to be deciding something who did jerry vincent bribe on the elliot case he finally asked the question came out of left field i wasnt expecting it but in the moments after he asked it i realized that it was the question he had come to ask everything else up until this point had been window dressing what is that from the fbi i havent talked to the fbi then what are you talking about im talking about a payoff to who thats what im asking you i shook my head and smiled look i told you the books are clean theres if you were going to bribe someone with a hundred thousand dollars would you put it in your books i thought about jerry vincent and the time i turned down the subtle quid pro quo on the barnett woodson case i turned him down and ended up hanging a notguilty verdict on him it changed vincents life and he was still thanking me for it from the grave but maybe it didnt change his ways in the years that followed i guess youre right i said to bosch i wouldnt do it that way so what arent you telling me this is in confidence counselor but i need your help and i think you need to know this in order to help me okay then say it say what that you will treat this information in confidence i thought i did i will ill keep it confidential not even your staff just you fine just me tell me you have vincents work accounts i have his private accounts you said he paid himself the money from elliot quickly he i didnt say it was elliot you did whatever the point is that five months ago he accumulated a hundred grand in a personal investment account and a week later called his broker and told him he was cashing out you mean he took a hundred thousand out in cash thats what i just said what happened to it i dont know but you cant just go into a brokers and pick up a hundred grand in cash you have to order that kind of money it took a couple days to put it together and then he went in to pick it up his broker asked a lot of questions to make sure there wasnt a security issue you know like somebody being held hostage while he went and got the money a ransom or something like that vincent said everything was fine that he needed the money to buy a boat and that if he made the deal in cash he would get the best deal and save a lot of money so wheres the boat there is no boat the story was a lie are you sure weve checked all state transactions and asked questions all over marina del rey and san pedro we cant find any boat weve searched his home twice and reviewed his creditcard purchases no receipts or records of boatrelated expenses no photos no keys no fishing poles no coast guard registration required on a transaction that large he didnt buy a boat what about mexico bosch shook his head this guy hadnt left la in nine months he didnt go down to mexico and he didnt go anywhere else im telling you he didnt buy a boat we wouldve found it he bought something else and your client walter elliot probably knows what it was i tracked his logic and could see it coming to the doorway of walter elliot but i wasnt going to open it with bosch looking over my shoulder i think youve got it wrong detective i dont think so counselor well i cant help you i have no idea about this and have seen no indication of it in any of the books or records ive got if you can connect this alleged bribe to my client then arrest him and charge him otherwise ill tell you right now hes off limits hes not talking to you about this or anything else bosch shook his head i wouldnt waste my time trying to talk to him he used his lawyer as cover on this and ill never be able to get past the attorneyclient protection but you should take it as a warning counselor yeah hows that simple his lawyer got killed not him think about it and remember that little trickle on the back of your neck and running down your spine thats the feeling you get when you know you have to look over your shoulder when you know youre in danger i smiled back at him oh is that what that is i thought it was the feeling i get when i know im being bullshitted im only telling you the truth youve been running a game on me for two days spinning bullshit about bribes and the fbi youve been trying to manipulate me and its been a waste of my time you have to go now detective because i have real work to do i stood up and extended a hand toward the door bosch stood up but didnt turn to go dont kid yourself haller dont make a mistake thanks for the advice bosch finally turned and started to leave but then he stopped and came back to the desk pulling something from the inside pocket of his jacket as he approached it was a photograph he put it down on the desk you recognize that man bosch asked i studied the photo it was a grainy still taken off a video it showed a man pushing out through the front door of an office building this is the front entrance of the legal center isnt it do you recognize him the shot was taken at a distance and blown up spreading the pixels of the image and making it unclear the man in the photograph looked to me to be of latin origin he had dark skin and hair and had a poncho villa mustache like cisco used to wear he wore a panama hat and an opencollared shirt beneath what appeared to be a leather sport coat as i looked more closely at the photograph i realized why it was the frame they had chosen to take from the surveillance video the mans jacket had pulled open as hed pushed through the glass door i could see what looked like the top of a pistol tucked into the belt line of his pants is that a gun is this the killer look can you answer one goddamn question without another question do you recognize this man thats all i want to know no i dont detective happy thats another question sorry you sure you havent seen him before not a hundred percent but thats not a great photo youve got there where is it from a street camera on broadway and second it sweeps the street and we got this guy for only a few seconds this is the best we can do i knew that the city had been quietly installing street cameras on main arteries in the last few years streets like hollywood boulevard were completely visually wired broadway would have been a likely candidate it was always crowded during the day with pedestrians and traffic it was also the street used most often for protest marches organized by the underclasses well then i guess its better than having nothing you think the hair and the mustache are a disguise let me ask the questions could this guy be one of your new clients i dont know i havent met them all leave me the photo and ill show it to wren williams shed know better than me if hes a client bosch reached down and took the photo back its my only copy when will she be in in about an hour ill come back later meantime counselor watch yourself he pointed a finger at me like it was a gun then turned and walked out of the room closing the door behind him i sat there thinking about what he had said and staring at the door half expecting him to come back in and drop another ominous warning on me but when the door opened one minute later it was lorna who entered i just saw that detective in the hallway yeah he was here what did he want to scare me and he did a pretty good job twentytwo lorna wanted to convene another staff meeting and update me on things that had happened while i was out of the office visiting malibu and walter elliot the day before she even said i had a court hearing scheduled later on a mystery case that wasnt on the calendar we had worked up but i needed some time to think about what bosch had just revealed and what it meant wheres cisco hes coming he left early to meet one of his sources before he came into the office did he have breakfast not with me okay wait till he gets in and then well go over to the dining car and have breakfast well go over everything then i already ate breakfast then you can do all the talking while we do all the eating she put a phony frown on her face but went out into the reception office and left me alone i got up from behind the desk and started to pace the office hands in my pockets trying to evaluate what the information from bosch meant according to bosch jerry vincent had paid a sizable bribe to a person or persons unknown the fact that the came out of the walter elliot advance would indicate the bribe was somehow linked to the elliot case but this was by no means conclusive vincent could easily have used money from elliot to pay a debt or a bribe relating to another case or something else entirely it could have been a gambling debt he wanted to hide the only fact was that vincent had diverted the k from his account to an unknown destination and had wanted to hide the transaction next to consider was the timing of the transaction and whether it was linked to vincents murder bosch said the money transfer had gone down five months ago vincents murder was just three nights before and elliots trial was set to begin in a week again there was nothing definitive the distance between the transaction and the murder seemed to me to strain any possibility of a link between the two but still i could not push the two apart and the reason for this was walter elliot himself through the filter of boschs information i now began to fill in some answers and to view my client and myself differently i now saw elliots confidence in his innocence and eventual acquittal coming possibly from his belief that it had already been bought and paid for i now saw his unwillingness to consider delaying the trial as a timing issue relating to the bribe and i saw his willingness to quickly allow me to carry the torch for vincent without checking a single reference as a move made so he could get to the trial without delay it had nothing to do with any confidence in my skills and tenacity i had not impressed him i had simply been the one who showed up i was simply a lawyer who would work in the scheme of things in fact i was perfect i was pulled out of the lostandfound bin i had been on the shelf and was hungry and ready i could be dusted off and suited up and sent in to replace vincent no questions asked the reality jolt this sent through me was as uncomfortable as the first night in rehab but i also understood that this selfknowledge could give me an edge i was in the middle of some sort of play but at least now i knew it was a play that was an advantage i could now make it my own play there was a reason for the hurryup to trial and i now thought i knew what it was the fix was in money had been paid for a specific fix and that fix was tied to the trial remaining on schedule the next question in this string was why why must the trial take place as scheduled i didnt have an answer for that yet but i was going to get it i walked over to the windows and split the venetian blinds with my hand out on the street i saw a van from channel parked with two wheels up on the curb a camera crew and a reporter were on the sidewalk and they were getting ready to do a live shot offering their viewers the latest on the vincent case the latest being the exact same report given the morning before no arrests no suspects no news i left the window and stepped back into the middle of the room to continue my pacing the next thing i needed to consider was the man in the photograph bosch showed me there was a contradiction at work here the early indications of evidence were that vincent had known the person who killed him and allowed him to get close but the man in the photograph appeared to be in disguise would jerry have lowered his window for the man in the photograph the fact that bosch had zeroed in on this man didnt make sense when applied to what was known about the crime scene the calls from the fbi to vincents cell phone were also part of the unknown equation what did the bureau know and why had no agent come forward to bosch it might be that the agency was hiding its tracks but i also knew that it might not want to come out of the shadows to reveal an ongoing investigation if this was the case i would need to step more carefully than i had been if i ended up the least bit tainted in a federal corruption probe i would never recover from it the last unknown to consider was the murder itself vincent had paid the bribe and was ready for trial as scheduled why had he become a liability his murder certainly threatened the timetable and was an extreme response why was he killed there were too many questions and too many unknowns for now i needed more information before i could draw any solid conclusions about how to proceed but there was a basic conclusion i couldnt stop myself from reaching it seemed uncomfortably clear that i was being mushroomed by my own client elliot was keeping me in the dark about the interior machinations of the case but that could work both ways i decided that i would do exactly what bosch had asked keep the information the detective had given me confidential i would not share it with my staff and certainly at this point i would not question walter elliot about his knowledge of these things i would keep my head above the dark waters of the case and keep my eyes wide open i shifted focus from my thoughts to what was directly in front of me i was looking at the gaping mouth of patrick hensons fish the door opened and lorna reentered the office to find me standing there staring at the tarpon what are you doing she asked thinking well ciscos here and weve got to go you have a busy court schedule today and i dont want to make you late then lets go im starved i followed her out but not before glancing back at the big beautiful fish hanging on the wall i thought i knew exactly how he felt twentythree i had patrick drive us over to the pacific dining car and cisco and i ordered steak and eggs while lorna had tea and honey the dining car was a place where downtown power brokers liked to gather before a day of fighting it out in the glass towers nearby the food was overpriced but good it instilled confidence made the downtown warrior feel like a heavy hitter as soon as the waiter took our order and left us lorna put her silverware to the side and opened a spiralbound ataglance calendar on the table eat fast she said you have a busy day tell me all right the easy stuff first she flipped a couple of pages back and forth in the calendar then proceeded you have a ten am in chambers with judge holder she wants an updated client inventory she told me i had a week i protested todays thursday yeah well michaela called and said the judge wants an interim update i think she the judge that is saw in the paper that you are continuing on as elliots lawyer shes afraid youre spending all your time on elliot and none on the other clients thats not true i filed a motion for patrick yesterday and tuesday i took the sentencing on reese i mean i havent even met all the clients yet dont worry i have a hardcopy inventory back at the office for you to take with you it shows who youve met who you signed up and calendars on all of them just hit her with the paperwork and she wont be able to complain i smiled lorna was the best case manager in the business great what else then at eleven you have an inchambers with judge stanton on elliot status conference yes he wants to know if you are going to be able to go next thursday no but elliot wont have it any other way well the judge will get to hear elliot say that for himself hes requiring the defendants presence that was unusual most status conferences were routine and quick the fact that stanton wanted elliot there bumped this one up into a more important realm i thought of something and pulled out my cell phone did you let elliot know he might put it away he knows and hell be there i talked to his assistant mrs albrecht this morning and she knows he has to show and that the judge can revoke if he doesnt i nodded it was a smart move threaten elliots freedom as a means of making sure he shows up good i said that it i wanted to get to cisco to ask what else he had been able to find out about the vincent investigation and whether his sources had mentioned anything about the man in the surveillance photo bosch had shown me not by a long shot my friend lorna responded now we get to the mystery case lets hear it we got a call yesterday afternoon from judge friedmans clerk who called vincents office blind to see if there was anyone there taking over the cases when the clerk was informed that you were taking over she asked if you were aware of the hearing scheduled before friedman today at two i checked our new calendar and you didnt have a two oclock on there for today so there is the mystery you have a hearing at two for a case we not only dont have on calendar but dont have a file for either whats the clients name eli wyms it meant nothing to me did wren know the name lorna shook her head in a dismissive way did you check the dead cases maybe it was just misfiled no we checked there is no file anywhere in the office and whats the hearing did you ask the clerk lorna nodded pretrial motions wyms is charged with attempted murder of a peace officer and several other weaponsrelated charges he was arrested may second at a county park in calabasas he was arraigned bound over and sent out to camarillo for ninety days he mustve been found competent because the hearing today is to set a trial date and consider bail i nodded from the shorthand i could read between the lines wyms had gotten into some sort of confrontation involving weapons with the sheriffs department which provided law enforcement services in the unincorporated area known as calabasas he was sent to the states mental evaluation center in camarillo where the shrinks took three months deciding whether he was a crazy man or competent to stand trial on the charges against him the docs determined he was competent meaning he knew right from wrong when he tried to kill a peace officer most likely the sheriffs deputy who confronted him it was a barebones sketch of the trouble eli wyms was in there would be more detail in the file but we had no file is there any reference to wyms in the trust account deposits i asked lorna shook her head i shouldve assumed she would be thorough and check the bank accounts in search of eli wyms okay so it looks like maybe jerry took him on pro bono attorneys occasionally provide legal services free of charge pro bono to indigent or special clients sometimes this is an altruistic endeavor and sometimes its because the client just wont pay up either way the lack of an advance from wyms was understandable the missing file was another story you know what i was thinking lorna said what that jerry had the file with him in his briefcase when he left monday night and it got taken along with his laptop and cell phone by the killer she nodded and i nodded back it made sense he was spending the evening preparing for the week and he had a hearing thursday on wyms maybe he had run out of gas and thrown the file in his briefcase to look at later or maybe he kept the file with him because it was important in a way i couldnt see yet maybe the killer wanted the wyms file and not the laptop or the cell phone whos the prosecutor on the case joanne giorgetti and im way ahead of you i called her yesterday and explained our situation and asked if she wouldnt mind copying the discovery again for us she said no problem you can pick it up after your eleven with judge stanton and then have a couple hours to familiarize yourself with it before the hearing at two joanne giorgetti was a topflight prosecutor who worked in the crimesagainstlawofficers section of the das office she was also a longtime friend of my exwifes and was my daughters basketball coach in the ymca league she had always been cordial and collegial with me even after maggie and i split up it didnt surprise me that she would run off a copy of the discovery materials for me you think of everything lorna i said why dont you just take over vincents practice and run with it you dont need me she smiled at the compliment and i saw her eyes flick in the direction of cisco the read i got was that she wanted him to realize her value to the law firm of michael haller and associates i like working in the background she said ill leave center stage for you our plates were served and i spread a liberal dose of tabasco sauce on both my steak and the eggs sometimes hot sauce was the only way i knew i was still alive i was finally able to hear what cisco had come up with on the vincent investigation but he dug into his meal and i knew better than to try to keep him from his food i decided to wait and asked lorna how things were working out with wren williams she answered in a low voice as if wren were sitting nearby in the restaurant and listening shes not a lot of help mickey she seems to have no idea of how the office worked or where jerry put things shed be lucky to remember where she parked her car this morning if you ask me she was working there for some other reason i could have told her the reason as it had been told to me by bosch but decided to keep it to myself i didnt want to distract lorna with gossip i looked over and saw cisco mopping up the steak juice and hot sauce on his plate with a piece of toast he was good to go what do you have going today cisco im working on rilz and his side of the equation hows that going i think therell be a couple things you can use you want to hear about it not yet ill ask when i need it i didnt want to be given any information about rilz that i might have to turn over to the prosecution in discovery at the moment the less i knew the better cisco understood this and nodded i also have the bruce carlin debriefing this afternoon cisco added he wants two hundred an hour lorna said highway robbery if you ask me i waved off her protest just pay it its a onetime expense and he probably has information we can use and that might save cisco some time dont worry were paying him im just not happy about it hes gouging us because he knows he can technically hes gouging elliot and i dont think hes going to care i turned back to my investigator you have anything new on the vincent case cisco updated me with what he had it consisted mostly of forensic details suggesting that the source he had inside the investigation came from that side of the equation he said vincent had been shot twice both times in the area of the left temple the spread on the entry wounds was less than an inch and powder burns on the skin and hair indicated the weapon was nine to twelve inches away when fired cisco said this indicated that the killer had fired two quick shots and was fairly skilled it was unlikely that an amateur would fire twice quickly and be able to cluster the impacts additionally cisco said the slugs never left the body and were recovered during the autopsy conducted late the day before they were twentyfives he said i had handled countless crossexaminations of tool marks and ballistics experts i knew my bullets and i knew a caliber round came out of a small weapon but could do great damage especially if fired into the cranial vault the slugs would ricochet around inside it would be like putting the victims brain in a blender they know the exact weapon yet i knew that by studying the markings lands and grooves on the slugs they would be able to tell what kind of gun fired the rounds just as with the malibu murders in which the investigators knew what gun had been used even though they didnt have it yeah a twentyfive caliber beretta bobcat nice and small you could almost hide it in your hand a completely different weapon than the one used to kill mitzi elliot and johan rilz so whats all of this tell us its a hitters gun you take it when you know its going to be a head shot i nodded my agreement so this was planned the killer knew just what he was going to do he waits in the garage sees jerry come out and comes right up to the car the window goes down or it was already down and the guy pops jerry twice in the head then reaches in for the briefcase that has the laptop the cell phone the portfolio and we think the eli wyms file exactly okay what about the suspect the guy they sweated the first night no that was carlin they cut him loose cisco looked surprised howd you find out it was carlin bosch told me this morning are you saying they have another suspect i nodded he showed me a photo of a guy coming out of the building at the time of the shooting he had a gun and was wearing an obvious disguise i saw ciscos eyes flare it was a point of professional pride that he provide me with information like that he didnt like it happening the other way around he didnt have a name just the photo i said he wanted to know if i had ever seen the guy before or if it was one of the clients ciscos eyes darkened as he realized that his inside source was holding out on him if id told him about the fbi calls he probably would have picked the table up and thrown it through the window ill see what i can find out he said quietly through a tight jaw i looked at lorna bosch said he was coming back later to show the photo to wren ill tell her make sure you look at it too i want everybody to be on alert for this guy okay mickey i nodded we were finished i put a credit card on the tab and pulled out my cell phone to call patrick calling my driver reminded me of something cisco theres one other thing i want you to try to do today cisco looked at me happy to move on from the idea that i had a better source on the investigation than he did go to vincents liquidator and see if hes sitting on one of patricks surfboards if he is i want it back for patrick cisco nodded i can do that no problem twentyfour waylaid by the slowmoving elevators in the ccb i was four minutes late when i walked into judge holders courtroom and hustled through the clerks corral toward the hallway leading to her chambers i didnt see anyone and the door was closed i knocked lightly and i heard the judge call for me to enter she was behind her desk and wearing her black robe this told me she probably had a hearing in open court scheduled soon and my being late was not a good thing mr haller our meeting was set for ten oclock i believe you were given proper notice of this yes your honor i know im sorry the elevators in this building are all lawyers take the same elevators and most seem to be on time for meetings with me yes your honor did you bring your checkbook i think so yes well we can do this one of two ways the judge said i can hold you in contempt of court fine you and let you explain yourself to the california bar or we can go informal and you take out your checkbook and make a donation to the makeawish foundation its one of my favorite charities they do good things for sick children this was incredible i was being fined for being four minutes late the arrogance of some judges was amazing i somehow was able to swallow my outrage and speak i like the idea of helping out sick children your honor i said how much do i make it out for as much as you want to contribute and i will even send it in for you she pointed to a stack of paperwork on the left side of her desk i saw two other checks most likely stroked out by two other poor bastards who had run afoul of the judge this week i leaned down and rummaged through the front pocket of my backpack until i found my checkbook i wrote a check for to makeawish tore it out and handed it across the desk i watched the judges eyes as she looked at the amount i was donating she nodded approvingly and i knew i was all right thank you mr haller theyll be sending you a receipt for your taxes in the mail it will go to the address on the check like you said they do good work yes they do the judge put the check on top of the two others and then turned her attention back to me now before we go over the cases let me ask you a question she said do you know if the police are making any headway on the investigation of mr vincents death i hesitated a moment wondering what i should be telling the chief judge of the superior court im not really in the loop on that judge i said but i was shown a photograph of a man i assume theyre looking at as a suspect really what kind of photo like a surveillance shot from out on the street a guy and it looks like he has a gun i think they matched it up timewise to the shooting in the garage did you recognize the man i shook my head no the shot was too grainy it looked like he might have had a disguise on anyway when was this the night of the shooting no i mean when was it that you were shown this photo just this morning detective bosch came to the office with it the judge nodded we were quiet for a moment and then the judge got to the point of the meeting okay mr haller why dont we talk about clients and cases now yes your honor i reached down and unzipped my bag taking out the scorecard lorna had prepared for me judge holder kept me at her desk for the next hour while i went over every case and client detailing the status and conversations id had with each by the time she finally let me go i was late for my eleven oclock hearing in judge stantons chambers i left holders court and didnt bother with the elevators i hit the exit stairs and charged up two flights to the floor where stantons courtroom was located i was running eight minutes late and wondered if it was going to cost me another donation to another judges favorite charity the courtroom was empty but stantons clerk was in her corral she pointed with a pen to the open door to the hallway leading to the judges chambers theyre waiting for you she said i quickly moved by her and down the hall the door to the chambers was open and i saw the judge sitting behind his desk to his left rear side was a stenographer and across the desk from him were three chairs walter elliot was sitting in the chair to the right the middle chair was empty and jeffrey golantz was in the third i had never met the prosecutor before but he was recognizable because i had seen his face on tv and in the newspapers in the last few years he had successfully handled a series of highprofile cases and was making a name for himself he was the undefeated upandcomer in the das office i loved going up against undefeated prosecutors their confidence often betrayed them sorry im late your honor i said as i slid into the empty seat judge holder called me into a hearing and she ran long i hoped that mentioning the chief judge as the reason for my tardiness would keep stanton from further assaulting my checkbook and it seemed to work lets go on the record now he said the stenographer leaned forward and put her fingers on the keys of her machine in the matter of california versus walter elliot we are in chambers today for a status conference present is the defendant along with mr golantz for the state and mr haller who is here in the late mr vincents stead the judge had to break there to give the stenographer the proper spellings of all the names he spoke in an authoritative voice that a decade on the bench often gives a jurist the judge was a handsome man with a full head of bristly gray hair he was in good shape the black robe doing little to disguise his welldeveloped shoulders and chest so he then said were scheduled in this matter for voir dire next thursday a week from today and i notice mr haller that i have received no motion from you to continue the matter while you get up to speed on the case we dont want a delay elliot said i reached over and put my hand on my clients forearm and shook my head mr elliot in this session i want you to let your lawyer do the talking the judge said sorry your honor i said but the message is the same whether from me or directly from mr elliot we want no delay i have spent the week getting up to speed and i will be prepared to begin jury selection next thursday the judge squinted his eyes at me you sure about that mr haller absolutely mr vincent was a good lawyer and he kept thorough records i understand the strategy he built and will be ready to go on thursday the case has my full attention that of my staff as well the judge leaned back in his highbacked chair and swiveled side to side as he thought he finally looked at elliot mr elliot it turns out you do get to speak after all i would like to hear directly from you that you are in full agreement with your new attorney here and that you understand the risk you run bringing in a fresh lawyer so close to the start of trial its your freedom at stake here sir lets hear what you have to say about it elliot leaned forward and spoke in a defiant tone judge first of all i am in complete agreement i want to get this thing to trial so i can blow the district attorney here right out of the water i am an innocent man being persecuted and prosecuted for something i did not do i dont want to spend a single extra day as the accused sir i loved my wife and ill miss her forever i didnt kill her and it pierces my heart when i hear the people on tv saying these vile things about me what hurts the most is knowing that the real killer is out there someplace the sooner mr haller gets to prove my innocence to the world the better it was oj but the judge studied elliot and nodded thoughtfully then turned his attention to the prosecutor mr golantz what is the states view of this the deputy district attorney cleared his throat the word to describe him was telegenic he was handsome and dark and his eyes seemed to carry the very wrath of justice in them your honor the state is prepared for trial and has no objection to proceeding on schedule but i would ask that if mr elliot is so sure about proceeding without delay he formally waive any appellate redress in this regard should things not go as he predicts in trial the judge swiveled his chair so that his focus could go back on me what about that mr haller your honor i dont think its necessary for my client to waive any protections that might be afforded to i dont mind elliot said cutting in on me ill waive whatever you damn well please i want to go to trial i looked sharply at him he looked at me and shrugged were going to win this thing he explained you want to take a moment in the corridor mr haller the judge asked thank you judge i got up and signaled elliot up come with me we walked out into the short hallway that led to the courtroom i closed the door behind us elliot spoke before i could underlining the problem look i want this thing over and i shut up i said in a forced whisper what you heard me shut the fuck up you understand i am sure you are quite used to talking whenever you want and having everybody listen to every brilliant word you say but you are not in hollywood anymore walter you arent talking makebelieve movies with this weeks mogulito you understand what im saying this is real life you dont speak unless you are spoken to if you have something to say otherwise then you whisper it into my ear and if i think it is worth repeating then i not you will say it to the judge you got it it took elliot a long time to answer his face turned dark and i understood that i might be about to lose the franchise but in the moment i didnt care what i had said needed to be said it was a welcometomyworld speech that was long overdue yes he finally said i get it good then remember it now lets go back in there and see if we can avoid giving away your right to appeal if you happen to get convicted because i fucked up by being unprepared for trial that wont happen i have faith in you i appreciate that walter but the truth is you have no basis for that faith and whether you do or dont it doesnt mean we have to give anything away lets go back in now and let me do the talking thats why i get the big bucks right i clapped him on the shoulder we went in and sat back down and walter didnt say another word i argued that he shouldnt have to give away his right to appellate review just because he wanted the speedy trial he was entitled to but judge stanton sided with golantz ruling that if elliot declined the offer to delay the trial he couldnt come complaining after a conviction that his attorney hadnt had enough time to prepare faced with the ruling elliot stuck to his guns and declined the delay as i knew he would that was okay with me under the byzantine rules of law almost nothing was safe from appeal i knew that if necessary elliot would still be able to appeal the ruling the judge had just made we moved on to what the judge called housekeeping after that the first order of business was to have both sides sign off on a motion from court tv to be allowed to broadcast segments of the trial live on its daily programming neither i nor golantz objected after all it was free advertising me for new clients golantz to further his political aspirations and as far as walter elliot was concerned he whispered to me that he wanted the cameras there to record his notguilty verdict next the judge outlined the schedule for submitting final discovery and witness lists he gave us until monday on the discovery materials and the witness lists were due the day after that no exceptions gentlemen he said i look dimly on surprise additions after deadline this was not going to be a problem from the defenses side of the aisle vincent had already made two previous discovery filings and there was very little new since then for me to share with the prosecution cisco wojciechowski was doing a good job of keeping me in the dark as to what he was finding out about rilz and what i didnt know i couldnt put in the discovery file when it comes to witnesses my plan was to give golantz the usual runaround i would be submitting a list of potential witnesses naming every law officer and forensic tech mentioned in the sheriffs reports that was standard operating procedure golantz would have to puzzle over who i really would call to testify and who was important to the defenses case all right guys ive probably got a courtroom full of lawyers out there waiting for me stanton finally said are we clear on everything golantz and i nodded our heads i couldnt help but wonder if either the judge or the prosecutor was the recipient of the bribe was i sitting with the man who would turn the case my clients way if so he had done nothing to give himself away i finished the meeting thinking that bosch had it all wrong there was no bribe there was a hundredthousanddollar boat somewhere in a harbor in san diego or cabo and it had jerry vincents name on the title okay then the judge said well get this going next week we can talk about ground rules thursday morning but i want to make it clear right now im going to run this trial like a welloiled machine no surprises no shenanigans no funny stuff again are we clear golantz and i both agreed once more that we were clear but the judge swiveled his chair and looked directly at me he squinted his eyes in suspicion im going to hold you to that he said it seemed to be a message intended only for me a message that would never show on the stenographers record how come i wondered its always the defense attorney who gets the judicial squint twentyfive i got to joanne giorgettis office shortly before the noon break i knew that getting there a minute after twelve would be too late the das offices literally empty during the lunch hour the inhabitants seeking sunlight fresh air and sustenance outside the ccb i told the receptionist i had an appointment with giorgetti and she made a call then she buzzed the door lock and told me to go back giorgetti had a small windowless office with most of the floor space taken up by cardboard file boxes it was the same way in every prosecutors office i had ever been in big or small she was at her desk but was hidden behind a wall of stacked motions and files i carefully reached over the wall to shake her hand hows it going joanne not bad mickey how about you im doing okay you just got a lot of cases i hear yeah quite a few the conversation was stilted i knew she and maggie were tight and there was no telling whether my exwife had opened up to her about my difficulties in the past year so youre here for wyms thats right i didnt even know i had the case till this morning she handed me a file with an inchthick stack of documents in it what do you think happened to jerrys file she asked i think maybe the killer took it she made a cringing face weird why would the killer take this file probably unintended the file was in jerrys briefcase along with his laptop and the killer just took the whole thing hmmm well is there anything unusual about this case anything that would have made jerry a target i dont think so just your usual everyday crazywithagun sort of thing i nodded have you heard anything about a federal grand jury taking a look at the state courts she knitted her eyebrows why would they be looking at this case im not saying they were ive been out of the loop for a while i was wondering what youve heard she shrugged just the usual rumors on the gossip circuit seems like theres always a federal investigation of something yeah i said nothing else hoping she would fill me in on the rumor but she didnt and it was time to move on the hearing today is to set a trial date i asked yes but i assume youll want a continuance so you can get up to speed well let me go look at the file during lunch and ill let you know if thats what the plan is okay mickey but just so you know i wont oppose a continuance considering what happened with jerry thanks cojo she smiled as i used the name her young basketball players called her by at the y you seen maggie lately she asked saw her last night when i went to pick up hayley she seems to be doing okay have you seen her just at basketball practice but she usually sits there with her nose in a file we used to go out after with the girls to hamburger hamlet but maggies been too busy i nodded she and maggie had been foxhole buddies since day one coming up through the ranks of the prosecutors office competitors but not competitive with each other but time goes by and distances work their way into any relationship well ill take this and look it all over i said the hearings with friedman at two right yeah two ill see you then thanks for doing this joanne no problem i left the das office and waited ten minutes to get on an elevator with the lunch crowd the last one on i rode down with my face two inches from the door i hated the elevators more than anything else in the entire criminal courts building hey haller it was a voice from behind me i didnt recognize it but it was too crowded for me to turn around to see who it was what heard you scored all of vincents cases i wasnt going to discuss my business in a crowded elevator i didnt respond we finally hit bottom and the doors spread open i stepped out and looked back for the person who had spoken it was dan daly another defense attorney who was part of a coterie of lawyers who took in dodgers games occasionally and martinis routinely at four green fields i had missed the last season of booze and baseball how ya doin dan we shook hands an indication of how long it had been since wed seen each other so whod you grease he said it with a smile but i could tell there was something behind it maybe a dose of jealousy over my scoring the elliot case every lawyer in town knew it was a franchise case it could pay top dollar for years first the trial and then the appeals that would come after a conviction nobody i said jerry put me in his will we started walking toward the exit doors dalys ponytail was longer and grayer but what was most notable was that it was intricately braided i hadnt seen that before then lucky you daly said let me know if you need a second chair on elliot he wants only one lawyer at the table dan he said no dream team well then keep me in mind as a writer in regard to the rest this meant he was available to write appeals on any convictions my new set of clients might incur daly had forged a solid reputation as an expert appeals man with a good batting average ill do that i said im still reviewing everything good enough we came through the doors and i could see the lincoln at the curb waiting daly was going the other way i told him id keep in touch we miss you at the bar mick he said over his shoulder ill drop by i called back but i knew i wouldnt drop by that i had to stay away from places like that i got in the back of the lincoln i tell my drivers never to get out and open the door for me and told patrick to take me over to chinese friends on broadway i told him to drop me and go get lunch on his own i needed to sit and read and didnt want any conversation i got to the restaurant between the first and second waves of patrons and waited no more than five minutes for a table wanting to get to work immediately i ordered a plate of the fried pork chops right away i knew they would be perfect they were paperthin and delicious and id be able to eat them with my fingers without taking my eyes off the wyms documents i opened the file joanne giorgetti had given me it contained copies only of what the prosecutor had turned over to jerry vincent under the rules of discovery primarily sheriffs documents relating to the incident arrest and followup investigation any notes strategies or defense documents that vincent had generated were lost with the original file the natural starting point was the arrest report which included the initial and most basic summary of what had transpired as is often the case it started with calls to the county communicationsanddispatch center multiple reports of gunfire came in from a neighborhood next to a park in calabasas the calls fell under sheriffs department jurisdiction because calabasas was in an unincorporated area north of malibu and near the western limits of the county the first deputy to respond was listed on the report as todd stallworth he worked the night shift out of the malibu substation and had been dispatched at pm to the neighborhood off las virgenes road from there he was directed into the nearby malibu creek state park where the shots were being fired now hearing shots himself stallworth called for backup and drove into the park to investigate there were no lights in the rugged mountain park as it was posted closed at sunset as stallworth entered on the main road the headlights of his patrol car picked up a reflection and the deputy saw a vehicle parked in a clearing ahead he put on his spotlight and illuminated a pickup truck with its tailgate down there was a pyramid of beer cans on the tailgate and what looked like a gun bag with several rifle barrels protruding from it stallworth stopped his car eighty yards from the pickup and decided to wait until backup arrived he was on the radio to the malibu station describing the pickup truck and saying that he was not close enough to read its license plate when suddenly there was a gunshot and the searchlight located above the sideview mirror exploded with the bullets impact stallworth killed the rest of the cars lights and bailed out crawling into the cover of some bushes that lined the clearing he used his handheld radio to call for additional backup and the special weapons and tactics team a threehour standoff ensued with the gunman hidden in the wooded terrain near the clearing he fired his weapon repeatedly but apparently his aim was at the sky no deputies were struck by bullets no other vehicles were damaged finally a deputy in black swat gear worked his way close enough to the pickup truck to read the license plate by using highpowered binoculars equipped with nightvision lenses the plate number led to the name eli wyms which in turn led to a cellphone number the shooter answered on the first ring and a swat team negotiator began a conversation the shooter was indeed eli wyms a fortyfouryearold housepainter from inglewood he was characterized in the arrest report as drunk angry and suicidal earlier in the day he had been kicked out of his home by his wife who informed him that she was in love with another man wyms had driven to the ocean and then north to malibu and then over the mountains to calabasas he saw the park and thought it looked like a good place to stop the truck and sleep but he drove on by and bought a case of beer at a gas station near the freeway he then turned around and went back to the park wyms told the negotiator that he started shooting because he heard noises in the dark and was afraid he believed he was shooting at rabid coyotes that wanted to eat him he said he could see their red eyes glowing in the dark he said he shot out the spotlight on the first patrol car that arrived because he was afraid the light would give his position away to the animals when asked about the shot from eighty yards he said he had qualified as an expert marksman during the first war in iraq the report estimated that wyms fired at least twentyseven times while deputies were on the scene and dozens of times before that investigators eventually collected a total of ninetyfour spent bullet casings wyms did not surrender that night until he ran out of beer shortly after crushing the last empty in his hand he told the cellphone negotiator that he would trade one rifle for a sixpack of beer he was turned down he then announced that he was sorry and ready for the incident and everything else to be over that he was going to kill himself and literally go out with a bang the negotiator tried to talk him out of it and kept the conversation going while a twoman swat unit moved through the heavy terrain toward his position in a dense stand of eucalyptus trees but soon the negotiator heard snoring on the cell line wyms had passed out the swat team moved in and wyms was captured without a shot being fired by law enforcement order was restored since deputy stallworth had taken the initial call and was the one fired upon he was given the collar the gunman was placed in stallworths squad car and transported to the malibu substation and jailed other documents in the file continued the eli wyms saga at his arraignment the morning after his arrest wyms was declared indigent and assigned a public defender the case moved slowly in the system with wyms being held in the mens central jail but then vincent stepped in and offered his services pro bono his first order of business was to ask for and receive a competency evaluation of his client this had the effect of slowing the case down even further as wyms was carted off to the state hospital in camarillo for a ninetyday psych evaluation that evaluation period was over and the reports were now in all of the doctors who examined tested and talked to wyms in camarillo had agreed that he was competent and ready to stand trial in the hearing scheduled before judge mark friedman at two a trial date would be set and the case clock would begin to tick again to me it was all a formality one read of the case documents and i knew there would be no trial what the days hearing would do was set the time period i would have to negotiate a plea agreement for my client it was a cutanddried case wyms would enter a plea and probably face a year or two of incarceration and mentalhealth counseling the only question i got from my survey of the file was why vincent had taken the case in the first place it didnt fall into line with the kinds of cases he usually handled with paying or higherprofile clients there didnt seem to be much of a challenge to the case either it was routine and wymss crime wasnt even unusual was it simply a case jerry took on to satisfy a need for pro bono work it seemed to me if that was the case that vincent could have found something more interesting which would pay off in other ways such as publicity the wyms case had initially drawn media attention because of the public spectacle in the park but when it came to trial or disposition of the case it would likely fly well below the media radar my next thought was to suspect that there was a connection to the elliot case vincent had found some sort of link but on first read i couldnt nail it down there were two general connections in that the wyms incident had happened less than twelve hours before the beach house murders and both crimes had occurred in the sheriffs departments malibu district but those connections didnt hold up to further scrutiny in terms of topography they werent remotely connected the murders were on the beach and the wyms shooting spree took place far inland in the county park on the other side of the mountains as far as i could recall none of the names in the wyms file were mentioned in the elliot materials i had reviewed the wyms incident happened on the night shift the elliot murders on the day shift i couldnt nail down any specific connection and in great frustration closed the file with the question unanswered i checked my watch and saw i had to get back to the ccb if i wanted time to meet my client in lockup before the two oclock hearing i called patrick to come get me paid for lunch and stepped out to the curb i was on my cell talking with lorna when the lincoln pulled up and i jumped into the back has cisco met with carlin yet i asked her no thats at two have cisco ask him about the wyms case too okay what about it ask him why vincent even took it you think theyre connected elliot and wyms i think it but i dont see it okay ill tell him anything else going on not at the moment youre getting a lot of calls from the media whos this guy jack mcevoy the name rang a bell but i couldnt place it i dont know who is he he works at the times he called up all huffy about not hearing from you saying you had an exclusive deal with him now i remembered the twoway street dont worry about him i havent heard from him either what else court tv wants to sit down and talk about elliot theyre going to carry live coverage throughout the trial making it their feature and so theyre hoping to get daily commentary from you at the end of court each day what do you think lorna i think its like free national advertising you better do it they told me theyre giving the trial its own logo wrap at the bottom of the screen murder in malibu theyre calling it then set it up what else well while were on the subject i got a notice a week ago that your bus bench contract expires at the end of the month i was just going to let it go because there was no money but now youre back and youve got money should we renew for the past six years i had advertised on bus benches strategically located in highcrime andtraffic locations around the city although i had dropped out for the past year the benches still spawned a steady stream of calls all of which lorna deferred or referred thats a twoyear contract right yes i made a quick decision okay renew it anything else thats it from here oh wait one other thing the landlord for the building came in today called herself the leasing agent which is just a fancy way of saying landlord she wants to know if were going to keep the office jerrys death is a lease breaker if we want it to be i got the feeling theres a waiting list on the building and this is an opportunity to jack the rent up for the next lawyer who comes in here i looked out the window of the lincoln as we cruised across the overpass and back into the civic center area i could see the newly built catholic cathedral and past that the waving steel skin of the disney concert hall it caught the sunlight and took on a warm orange glow i dont know lorna i like working from the backseat here its never boring what do you think im not particularly fond of putting on makeup every morning meaning she liked working out of her condo more than she liked getting ready and driving downtown to an office each day as usual we were on the same page something to think about i said no makeup no office overhead no fighting for a spot in the parking garage she didnt respond it was going to be my call i looked ahead and saw we were a block from my dropoff point in front of the ccb lets talk about it later i said i gotta jump out okay mickey be safe you too twentysix eli wyms was still doped up from the three months hed spent in camarillo hed been sent back to county with a prescription for a drug therapy that wasnt going to help me defend him let alone help him answer any questions about possible connections to the murders on the beach it took me less than two minutes in courtside lockup to grasp the situation and to decide to submit a motion to judge friedman requesting that all drug therapy be halted i went back to the courtroom and found joanne giorgetti at her place at the prosecution table the hearing was scheduled to start in five minutes she was writing something on the inside flap of a file when i walked up to the table without looking up she somehow knew it was me you want a continuance dont you and a ceaseanddesist on the drugs the guys a zombie she stopped writing and looked up at me considering he was potshotting my deputies im not sure i object to his being in that condition but joanne ive got to be able to ask the guy basic questions in order to defend him really she said it with a smile but the point was taken i shrugged and crouched down so we were on an even eye line youre right i dont think were talking about a trial here i said id be happy to listen to any offers your client shot at an occupied sheriffs car the state is interested in sending a message on this one we dont like people doing that she folded her arms to signal the states unwillingness to compromise on this she was an attractive and athletically built woman she drummed her fingers on one of her biceps and i couldnt help but notice the red fingernail polish as long as i could remember dealing with joanne giorgetti her nails were always painted bloodred she did more than represent the state she represented cops who had been shot at assaulted ambushed and spit on and she wanted the blood of every miscreant who had the bad luck to be prosecuted by her i would argue that my client panicked as he was by the coyotes was shooting at the light on the car not into the car your own documents say he was an expert marksman in the us army if he wanted to shoot the deputy he could have but he didnt he was discharged from the army fifteen years ago mickey right but some skills never go away like riding a bike well thats an argument you could surely make to the jury my knees were about to give out i reached over to one of the chairs at the defense table wheeled it over and sat down sure i can make that argument but it is probably in the states best interest to bring this case to a close get mr wyms off the street and into some sort of therapy that will help prevent this from ever happening again so what do you say should we go off into a corner someplace and work this out or go at it in front of a jury she thought for a moment before responding it was the classic prosecutors dilemma it was a case she could easily win she had to decide whether to pad her stats or do what might be the right thing as long as i get to pick the corner thats fine with me okay i wont oppose a continuance if you make the motion sounds good joanne what about the drug therapy i dont want this guy acting out again even in mens central look wait till they bring him out youll see hes a zombie you dont want this to go down and then have him challenge the deal because the state made him incompetent to make a decision lets get his head clear do the deal and then you can have them pump him up with whatever you want she thought about it saw the logic and finally nodded but if he acts out in jail one time im going to blame you and take it out on him i laughed the idea of blaming me was absurd whatever i got up and started to push the chair back to the defense table but then i turned back to the prosecutor joanne let me ask you something else why did jerry vincent take on this case she shrugged and shook her head i dont know well did it surprise you sure it was kind of strange him showing up i knew him from way back when you know meaning when he was a prosecutor yeah so what happened one day a few months ago i got notice of a competency motion on wyms and jerrys name was on it i called him up and said what the hell you know you dont even call to say im taking over the case and he just said he wanted to get some pro bono in and asked the pd for a case but i know angel romero the pd who had the case originally a couple months back i ran into him on one of the floors and he asked me what was happening on wyms and in the course of the conversation he told me that jerry didnt just come in asking for a pb referral he went to wyms first in mens central signed him up and then came in and told angel to turn over the file why do you think he took the case ive learned over the years that sometimes if you ask the same question more than once you get different responses i dont know i specifically asked him that and he didnt really answer he changed the subject to something else and it was all kind of awkward i remember thinking there was something else here like maybe he had a connection to wyms but then when he sent him off to camarillo i knew he wasnt doing the guy any favors what do you mean look you just spent a couple hours with the case and you know how its going to go this is a plea jail time counseling and supervision thats what it was before he was sent to camarillo so wymss time there wasnt really necessary jerry just prolonged the inevitable i nodded she was right sending a client to the psych ward at camarillo wasnt doing him any favors the mystery case was getting more mysterious only my client was in no condition to tell me why his lawyer vincent had kept him drugged up and locked away for three months okay joanne thanks lets i was interrupted by the clerk who called court into session and i looked up to see judge friedman taking the bench twentyseven angel romero was one of those human interest stories you read in the paper every now and then the story about the gangbanger who grew up hard on the streets of east la but fought his way through to an education and even law school then turned around and gave back to the community angels way to give back was to go into the public defenders office and represent the underdogs of society he was a lifer in the pd and had seen many young lawyers myself included come and go on their way to private practice and the supposed big bucks that came with it after the wyms hearing in which the judge granted the motion to continue in order to give giorgetti and me time to work out a plea i went down to the pds office on the tenth floor and asked for romero i knew he was a working lawyer not a supervisor and that most likely meant he was in a courtroom somewhere in the building the receptionist typed something into her computer and looked at the screen department onetwentyfour she said thank you i said department was judge champagnes courtroom on the thirteenth floor the same floor i had just come from but that was life in the ccb it seemed to run in circles i took the elevator back up and walked down the hall to powering my phone down as i approached the double doors court was in session and romero was in front of the judge arguing a motion to reduce bail i slid into the back row of the gallery and hoped for a quick ruling so i could get to romero without a long wait my ears perked up when i heard romero mention his client by name calling him mr scales i slid further down the bench so i had a better visual angle on the defendant sitting next to romero he was a white guy in an orange jail jumpsuit when i saw his profile i knew it was sam scales a con man and former client the last i remembered of scales he had gone off to prison on a plea deal id obtained for him that was three years ago he obviously had gotten out and gotten right back into trouble only this time he hadnt called me after romero finished his bail argument the prosecutor stood up and vigorously opposed bail outlining in his argument the new charges against scales when i had represented him he had been accused in a creditcard fraud in which he ripped off people donating to a tsunami relief organization this time it was worse he was once more charged with fraud but in this case the victims were the widows of military servicemen killed in iraq i shook my head and almost smiled i was glad sam hadnt called me the public defender could have him judge champagne ruled quickly after the prosecutor finished she called scales a predator and a menace to society and kept his bail at a million dollars she noted that if shed been asked she probably would have raised it it was then that i remembered it had been judge champagne who had sentenced scales in the earlier fraud there was nothing worse for a defendant than coming back and facing the same judge for another crime it was almost as if the judges took the failings of the justice system personally i slouched in my seat and used another observer in the gallery as a blind so that scales couldnt see me when the court deputy stood him up cuffed him and took him back into lockup after he was gone i straightened back up and was able to catch romeros eye i signaled him out into the hallway and he flashed five fingers at me five minutes he still had some business to take care of in the court i went out into the hallway to wait for him and turned my phone back on no messages i was calling lorna to check in when i heard romeros voice behind me he was four minutes early eenie meenie minie moe catch a killer by the toe if his lawyers haller let him go eenie meenie minie moe hey bro he was smiling i closed the phone and we bumped fists i hadnt heard that homespun jingle since i was with the pds office romero had made it up after i had gotten the notguilty verdict in the barnett woodson case back in ninetytwo whats up romero asked ill tell you whats up youre guzzling my clients man sam scales used to be mine i said it with a knowing smile and romero smiled right back you want him you can have him thats one dirty white boy as soon as the media gets wind of this case theyre going to lynch his ass for what hes done taking war widows money huh stealing government death benefits i tell you ive repped a lot of bad guys who did a lot of bad things but i put scales up there with the baby rapers man i cant stand the guy yeah what are you doing with a white boy anyway you work gang crimes romeros face turned serious and he shook his head not anymore man they thought i was getting too close to the customers you know once a vato always a vato so they took me off gangs after nineteen years im off gangs sorry to hear that buddy romero had grown up in boyle heights in a neighborhood ruled by a gang called quatro flats he had the tattoos to prove it if you could ever see his arms it didnt matter how hot a day it was he always wore long sleeves when he was working and when he represented a banger accused of a crime he did more than defend him in court he worked to spring the man from the clutches of gang life to pull him away from gang cases was an act of stupidity that could only happen in a bureaucracy like the justice system what do you want with me mick you didnt really come here to take scales from me right no you get to keep scales angel i wanted to ask you about another client you had for a while earlier this year eli wyms i was about to give the details of the case as a prompt but romero immediately recognized the case and nodded yeah vincent took that one off me you got it now with him being dead yeah i got all of vincents cases i just found out about wyms today well good luck with them bro what do you need to know about wyms vincent took it off me three months ago at least i nodded yeah i know i got a handle on the case what im curious about is vincent taking it according to joanne giorgetti he went after it is that right romero checked the memory banks for a few moments before answering he raised a hand and rubbed his chin as he did so i could see faint scars across his knuckles from where hed had tattoos removed yeah he went down to the jail and talked wyms into it got a signed discharge letter and brought it in after that the case was his i gave him my file and i was done man i moved in closer to him did he say why he wanted the case i mean he didnt know wyms did he i dont think so he just wanted the case he gave me the big wink you know no what do you mean whats the big wink i asked him why he was taking on a southside homeboy who went up there in whitepeople country and shot the place up pro bono no less i thought he had some sort of racial angle on it or something something that would get him a little publicity but he just sort of gave me the wink like there was something else did you ask him what romero took an involuntary step back as i pressed his personal space yeah man i asked but he wouldnt tell me he just said that wyms had fired the magic bullet i didnt know what the hell he meant and i didnt have any more time to play games with him i gave him the file and i went on to the next one there it was again the magic bullet i was getting close to something here and i could feel the blood in my veins start to move with high velocity is that it mick i gotta get back inside my eyes focused on romero and i realized he was looking at me strangely yeah angel thanks thats all go back in there and give em hell yeah man thats what i do romero went back toward the door to department and i headed off quickly to the elevators i knew what i would be doing for the rest of the day and into the night tracing a magic bullet twentyeight i entered the office and blew right by lorna and cisco who were at the reception desk looking at the computer i spoke without stopping on my way to the inner sanctum if you two have any updates for me or anything else i should know then come in now im about to go into lockdown and hello to you too lorna called after me but lorna knew well what was about to happen lockdown was when i closed all the doors and windows drew the curtains and killed the phones and went to work on a file and a case with total concentration and absorption lockdown for me was the ultimate do not disturb sign hanging on the door lorna knew that once i was in lockdown mode there was no getting me out until i had found what i was looking for i moved around jerry vincents desk and dropped into the seat i opened my bag on the floor and started pulling out the files i viewed what i needed to do here as me against them somewhere in the files i would find the key to jerry vincents last secret i would find the magic bullet lorna and cisco came into the office soon after i was settled i didnt see wren out there i said before either could speak and you never will again lorna said she quit that was kind of abrupt she went out to lunch and never came back did she call yeah she finally called she said she got a better offer shes going to be bruce carlins secretary now i nodded that seemed to make a certain amount of sense now before you go into lockdown we need to go over some things lorna said thats what i said when i came in whatve you got lorna sat down in one of the chairs in front of the desk cisco stayed standing more like pacing behind her all right lorna said couple things while you were in court first you mustve touched a nerve with that motion you filed on the evidence in patricks case what happened i asked the prosecutors called three times today wanting to talk about a dispo i smiled the motion to examine the evidence had been a long shot but it looked like it might come through and i would be able to help patrick whats going on with that lorna asked you didnt tell me you filed motions from the car yesterday and whats going on is that i think dr vogler gave his wife phony diamonds for her birthday now to make sure she never knows it theyre going to float a deal to patrick if i withdraw my request to examine the evidence good i think i like patrick i hope he gets the break whats next lorna looked at the notes on her steno pad i knew she didnt like to be rushed but i was rushing her youre still getting a lot of calls from the local media about jerry vincent or walter elliot or both you want to go over them no i dont have the time for any media calls well thats what ive been telling them but its not making them happy especially that guy from the times hes being an asshole so what if theyre not happy i dont care well you better be careful mickey hell hath no fury like the media scorned it was a good point the media can love you one day and bury you the next my father had spent twenty years as a media darling but toward the end of his professional life he had become a pariah because the reporters had grown weary of him getting guilty men off he became the embodiment of a justice system that had different rules for wellheeled defendants with powerful attorneys ill try to be more accommodating i said just not now fine anything else to report i think thats i told you about wren so thats all i have youll call the prosecutor on patricks case yes i will call him i looked over lornas shoulder at cisco who was still standing okay cisco your turn whatve you got still working on elliot mostly in regard to rilz and some handholding with our witnesses i have a question about witnesses lorna interrupted where do you want to put up dr arslanian shamiram arslanian was the gunshot residue authority vincent had scheduled to bring in from new york as an expert witness to knock down the states expert witness at trial she was the best in the field and with walter elliots financial reserves vincent was going with the best money could buy i wanted her close to the downtown ccb but the choice of hotels was limited try checkers first i said and get her a suite if theyre booked then try the standard and then the kyoto grand but get a suite so we have room to work got it and what about muniz you want him in close too julio muniz was a freelance videographer who lived in topanga canyon because of his homes proximity to malibu he had been the first member of the media to respond to the crime scene after hearing the call out for homicide investigators on the sheriffs radio band he had shot video of walter elliot with the sheriffs deputies outside the beach house he was a valuable witness because his videotape and his own recollections could be used to confirm or contradict testimony offered by sheriffs deputies and investigators i dont know i said it can take anywhere from an hour to three hours to get from topanga to downtown id rather not risk it cisco is he willing to come in and stay at a hotel yeah just as long as were paying and he can order room service okay then bring him in also wheres the video there are only notes on it in the file i dont want the first time i look at the video to be in court cisco looked puzzled i dont know but if its not around here i can have muniz dub off a copy well i havent seen it around here so get me a copy what else couple other things first i got with my source on the vincent thing and he didnt know anything about a suspect or this photo bosch showed you this morning nothing nada what do you think does bosch know your guys the leak and is shutting him out i dont know but everything i was telling him about this photo was news to him i took a few moments to consider what this meant did bosch ever come back and show the photo to wren no lorna said i was with her all morning bosch never came in then or after lunch i wasnt sure what any of this meant but i couldnt become bogged down with it i had to get to the files what was the second thing i asked cisco what you said you had a couple other things to tell me what was the second thing oh yeah i called vincents liquidator and you had that right hes still got one of patricks long boards whats he want for it nothing i looked at cisco and raised my eyebrows asking where the catch was lets just say hed like to do you the favor he lost a good client in vincent i think hes hoping youll use him for future liquidations and i didnt dissuade him from the idea or tell him you usually dont barter property for services with your clients i understood the surfboard would not come with any real strings attached thanks cisco did you take it with you no he didnt have it at the office but he made a call and somebody was supposed to bring it in to him this afternoon i could go back and get it if you want no just get me an address and ill have patrick pick it up what happened with bruce carlin didnt you debrief him today maybe hes got the muniz tape i was anxious to hear about bruce carlin on several levels most important i wanted to know if he had worked for vincent on the eli wyms case if so he might be able to lead me to the magic bullet but cisco didnt answer my question lorna turned and they looked at each other as if wondering which one of them should deliver the bad news whats wrong i asked lorna turned back to me carlins fucking with us she said i could see the angry set of her jaw and i knew she reserved that kind of language for special occasions something had gone wrong with carlins debriefing and she was particularly upset how so well he never showed up at two like he said he would instead he called at two right after wren called and quit and gave us the new parameters of his deal i shook my head in annoyance his deal how much does he want well i guess he realized that at two hundred dollars an hour he wouldnt make much since he was probably going to bill only two or three hours tops thats all cisco would need with him so he called up and said he wanted a flat fee or we could figure out things on our own like i said how much ten thousand dollars you gotta be fucking kidding me my words exactly i looked from her to cisco this is extortion isnt there a state agency that regulates you guys cant we come down on his shit somehow cisco shook his head there are all kinds of regulatory agencies but this is a shady area yeah i know its shady hes shady ive thought that for years what i mean is he had no deal with vincent we cant find any contract so hes not required to give us anything we simply need to hire him and hes setting his price at ten grand its a bullshit ripoff but its probably legal i mean youre the lawyer you tell me i thought about it for a few moments and then tried to push it aside i was still riding on the adrenaline charge id picked up in the courthouse i didnt want it to dissipate with distractions all right ill ask elliot if he wants to pay it meantime im going to hit all the files again tonight and if i get lucky and crack through then we wont need him we say fuck you and are done with him asshole lorna muttered i was pretty sure that was directed at bruce carlin and not me okay is that it i asked anything else i looked from one face to the other nobody had anything else to bring up okay then thank you both for all youve been putting up with and doing this week go out and have a good night lorna looked at me curiously youre sending us home she asked i checked my watch why not i said its almost four thirty and im going to dive into the files and i dont want any distractions you two go on home have a good night and well start again tomorrow youre going to work here alone tonight cisco asked yeah but dont worry ill lock the door and i wont let anybody in even if i know him i smiled lorna and cisco didnt i pointed to the open door to the office it had a slide bolt that could be used to lock it at the top of the doorframe if necessary i would be able to secure both outside and inside perimeters it gave new meaning to the idea of going into lockdown come on ill be fine ive got work to do they slowly reluctantly started to make their way out of my office lorna i called after them patrick should be out there tell him to keep hanging i might have something to tell him after i make that call twentynine i opened the patrick henson file on my desk and looked up the prosecutors number i wanted to get this out of the way before i went to work on the elliot case the prosecutor was dwight posey a guy i had dealt with before on cases and never liked some prosecutors deal with defense attorneys as though they are only one step removed from their clients as pseudocriminals not as educated and experienced professionals not as necessary cogs in the winding gears of the justice system most cops have this view and i can live with it but it bothers me when fellow lawyers adopt the pose unfortunately dwight posey was one of these and if i couldve gone through the rest of my life without ever having to talk to him i would have been a happy man but that was not going to be the case so haller he said after taking the call theyve got you walking in a dead mans shoes dont they what they gave you all of jerry vincents cases right thats how you ended up with henson yeah something like that anyway im returning your call dwight actually your three calls whats up you get the motion i filed yesterday i reminded myself that i had to step carefully here if i wanted to get everything i could out of the phone call i couldnt let my distaste for the prosecutor affect the outcome for my client yes i got the motion its sitting right here on my desk thats why ive been calling he left it open for me to step in and and uh well were not going to do that mick do what dwight put our evidence out there for examination it was looking more and more like i had struck a major nerve with my motion well dwight thats the beauty of the system right you dont get to make that decision a judge does thats why i didnt ask you i put it in a motion and asked the judge posey cleared his throat no actually we do this time he said were going to drop the theft charge and just proceed with the drug charge so you can withdraw your motion or we can inform the judge that the point is moot i smiled and nodded i had him i knew then that patrick was going to walk only problem with that dwight is that the drug charge came out of the theft investigation you know that when they popped my client the warrant was for the theft the drugs were found during the arrest so you dont have one without the other i had the feeling that he knew everything i was saying and that the call was simply following a script we were going where posey wanted us to go and that was fine with me this time i wanted to go there too then maybe we can just talk about a disposition on the matter he said as if the idea had just occurred to him and there we were we had come to the place posey had wanted to get to from the moment hed answered the call im open to it dwight you should know that my client voluntarily entered a rehab program after his arrest he has completed the program has fulltime employment and has been clean for four months hell give his piss anytime anywhere to prove it that is really good to hear posey said with false enthusiasm the das office as well as the courts always look favorably upon voluntary rehabilitation tell me something i dont know i almost said the kid is doing good i can vouch for that what do you want to do for him i knew how the script would read now posey would turn it into a goodwill gesture from the prosecution he would make it seem as though the das office were giving out the favor here when the truth was that the prosecution was acting to insulate an important figure from political and personal embarrassment that was fine with me i didnt care about the political ends of the deal as long as my client got what i wanted him to get tell you what mick lets make it go away and maybe patrick can use this opportunity to move ahead with being a productive member of society sounds like a plan to me dwight youre making my day and his okay then get me his rehab records and well put it into a package for the judge posey was talking about making it a pretrial intervention case patrick would have to take biweekly drug tests and in six months the case would go away if he kept clean he would still have an arrest on his record but no conviction unless you willing to expunge his record i asked uh thats asking a lot mickey he did after all break in and steal the diamonds he didnt break in dwight he was invited in and the alleged diamonds are what this is all about right whether or not he actually did steal any diamonds posey must have realized he had misspoken by bringing up the diamonds he folded his tent quickly all right fine well put it into the package youre a good man dwight i try to be you will withdraw your motion now first thing tomorrow when do we go to court i have a trial starting the end of next week then well go for monday ill let you know i hung up the phone and called the reception desk on the intercom luckily lorna answered i thought you were sent home i said were about to go through the door im going to leave my car here and go with cisco what on his donorcycle excuse me dad but i dont think you have anything to say about that i groaned but i do have a say over who works as my investigator if i can keep you two apart maybe i can keep you alive mickey dont you dare can you just tell cisco i need that address for the liquidator i will and ill see you tomorrow hope so wear a helmet i hung up and cisco came in carrying a postit in one hand and a gun in a leather holster in the other he walked around the desk put the postit down in front of me then opened a drawer and put the weapon in it what are you doing i asked you cant give me a gun its totally legal and registered to me thats great but you cant give it to me thats il im not giving it to you im just storing it here because im done work for the day ill get it in the morning okay whatever i think you two are overreacting better than underreacting see you tomorrow thank you will you send patrick in before you go you got it and by the way i always make her wear a helmet i looked at him and nodded thats good cisco he left the room and patrick soon came in patrick cisco talked to vincents liquidator and he still has one of your long boards you can go by and pick it up just tell him you are picking it up for me and to call me if there is any problem oh man thank you yeah well ive got even better news than that on your case what happened i went over the phone call id just had with dwight posey as i told patrick that he would do no jail time if he stayed clean i watched his eyes gain a little light it was as if i could see the burden drop off his shoulders he could look once again at the future i have to call my mom he said shes gonna be so happy yeah well i hope you are too i am i am now the way i figure it you owe me a couple thousand for my work on this thats about two and a half weeks of driving if you want you can stick with me until its paid off after that we can talk about it and see where were at that sounds good i like the job good patrick then its a deal patrick smiled broadly and was turning to go one other thing patrick he turned back to me i saw you sleeping in your car in the garage this morning sorry ill find another spot he looked down at the floor no im sorry i said i forgot that you told me when we talked on the phone the first time that you were living in your car and sleeping on a lifeguard stand i just dont know how safe it is to be sleeping in the same garage where a guy got shot the other night ill find someplace else well if you want i can give you an advance on your pay would that help you maybe get a motel room or something um i guess i was glad to help him out but i knew that living out of a weekly motel was almost as depressing as living out of a car ill tell you what i said if you want you could stay with me for a couple weeks until you get some money in your pocket and maybe get a better plan going at your place yeah you know temporarily with you i realized my mistake nothing like that patrick ive got a house and youd have your own room in fact on wednesday nights and every other weekend it would be better if you stayed with a friend or in a motel thats when i have my daughter he thought about it and nodded yeah i could do that i reached across the desk and signaled him to give me back the postit with the liquidators address on it i wrote my own address on it while i spoke why dont you go pick up your board and then head over to my place at this second address fareholm is right off laurel canyon one street before mount olympus you go up the stairs to the front porch and theres a table and chairs out there and an ashtray the extra keys under the ashtray the guest bedroom is right next to the kitchen just make yourself at home thanks he took the postit back and looked at the address id written i probably wont get there till late i told him ive got a trial starting next week and a lot of work to do before then okay look were only talking about a few weeks till you get on your feet again meantime maybe we can help each other out you know like if one of us starts to feel the pull maybe the other one will be there to talk about it okay okay we were quiet for a moment probably both of us thinking about the deal i didnt tell patrick that he might end up helping me more than i would help him in the past fortyeight hours the pressure of the new caseload had begun to weigh on me i could feel myself being pulled back feel the desire to go to the cottonwrapped world the pills could give me the pills opened the space between where i was and the brick wall of reality i was beginning to crave that distance up front and deep down i knew i didnt want that again and maybe patrick could help me avoid it thanks mr haller i looked up at him from my thoughts call me mickey i said and i should be the one saying thanks why are you doing all of this for me i looked at the big fish on the wall behind him for a moment then back at him im not sure patrick but im hoping that if i help you then ill be helping myself patrick nodded like he knew what i was talking about that was strange because i wasnt sure myself what i had meant go get your board patrick i said ill see you at the house and make sure you remember to call your mother thirty after i was finally alone in the office i started the process the way i always do with clean pages and sharp points from the supply closet i retrieved two fresh legal pads and four black warrior pencils i sharpened their points and got down to work vincent had broken the elliot case into two files one file contained the states case and the second thinner file contained the defense case the weight of the defense file was not of concern to me the defense played by the same rules of discovery as the prosecution anything that went into the second file went to the prosecutor a seasoned defense attorney knew to keep the file thin keep the rest in your head or hidden on a microchip in your computer if it is safe i had neither vincents head nor his laptop but i was sure the secrets jerry vincent kept were hidden somewhere in the hard copy the magic bullet was there i just had to find it i began with the thicker file the prosecutions case i read straight through every page and every word i took notes on one legal pad and drew a timeandaction flowchart on the other i studied the crime scene photographs with a magnifying glass i took from the desk drawer i drew up a list of every single name i encountered in the file from there i moved on to the defense file and again read every word on every page the phone rang two different times but i didnt even look up to see what name was on the screen i didnt care i was in relentless pursuit and cared about only one thing finding the magic bullet when i was finished with the elliot files i opened the wyms case and read every document and report it contained a timeconsuming process because wyms was arrested following a public incident that had drawn several uniform and swat deputies this file was thick with reports from the various units involved and personnel at the scene it was stuffed with transcriptions of the conversations with wyms as well as weapons and ballistics reports a lengthy evidence inventory witness statements dispatch records and patrol deployment reports there were a lot of names in the file and i checked every one of them against the list of names from the elliot files i also crossreferenced every address i had this client once i dont even know her name because i was sure that the name she was under in the system was not her own she was in on a first offense but she knew the system too well to be a virgin in fact she knew everything too well whatever her name was she had somehow rigged the system and it had her down as someone she wasnt the charge was burglary of an occupied dwelling but there was so much more than that behind the one charge this woman liked to target hotel rooms where men with large amounts of money slept she knew how to pick them follow them then finesse the door locks and the room safes while they slept in one candid moment probably the only one in our relationship she told me of the whitehot adrenaline high she got every time the last digit fell into place and she heard the electronic gears of the hotel safe start to move and unlock opening the safe and finding what was inside was never as good as that magic moment when the gears began to grind and she felt the velocity of her blood moving in her veins nothing before or after was as good as that moment the jobs werent about the money they were about the velocity of blood i nodded when she told me all of this i had never broken into a hotel room while some guy was snoring on the bed but i knew about the moment when the gears began to grind i knew about the velocity i found what i was looking for an hour into my second run at the files it had been there in front of me the whole time first in elliots arrest report and then on the timeandaction chart i had drawn myself i called the chart the christmas tree it always started basic and unadorned just the barebones facts of the case then as i continued to study and make the case my own i started hanging lights and ornaments on it details and witness statements evidence and lab results soon the tree was lit up and bright everything about the case was there for me to see in the context of time and action i had paid particular attention to walter elliot as i had drawn the christmas tree he was the tree trunk and all branches came from him i had his movements statements and actions noted by time pm we arrives at beach house pm we discovers bodies pm we calls pm we calls again pm deputies arrive on scene pm we secured pm homicide arrives pm we taken to malibu station pm we interviewed advised pm we transported to whittier pm gsr testing pm second interview attempt declined arrested pm we transported to mens central some of the times i estimated but most came directly from the arrest report and other documents in the file law enforcement in this country is as much about the paperwork as anything else i could always count on the prosecution file for reconstructing a time line on the second goround i used both the pencil point and eraser and started adding decorations to the tree pm we arrives at beach house front door unlocked pm we discovers bodies balcony door open pm we calls waits outside pm we calls again whats the holdup pm deputies arrive on scene murray alpha and harber alpha pm we secured placed in patrol car murrayharber search house pm homicide arrives first team kinder and ericsson second team joshua and toles pm we taken inside house describes discovery pm we taken to malibu station joshua and toles transport pm we interviewed advised kinder takes lead in interview pm we transported to whittier joshuatoles pm gsr testing ft anita sherman lab transport sherman pm second interview ericsson in lead we declines got smart pm we transported to mens central joshuatoles as i had constructed the christmas tree i kept a separate list on another page of every human being mentioned in the sheriffs reports i knew this would become the witness list i would turn over to the prosecution the following week as a rule i blanket the case subpoenaing anybody mentioned in the investigative record just to be safe you can always cut down a witness list at trial sometimes adding to it can be a problem from the witness list and the christmas tree i would be able to infer how the prosecution would roll out its case i would also be able to determine which witnesses the prosecution team was avoiding and possibly why it was while i was studying my work and thinking in these terms that i felt the gears begin to grind and the cold finger of revelation went down my spine everything became clear and bright and i found jerry vincents magic bullet walter elliot had been taken from the crime scene to the malibu station so that he would be out of the way and secured while the lead detectives continued their onsite investigation one short interview was conducted at the station before elliot ended it he was then transported to sheriffs headquarters in whittier where a gunshot residue test was conducted and his hands tested positive for nitrates associated with gunpowder afterward kinder and ericsson took another stab at interviewing their suspect but he wisely declined he was then formally placed under arrest and booked into county jail it was standard procedure and the arrest report documented the chain of elliots custody he was handled solely by the homicide detectives as he was moved from crime scene to substation to headquarters to jail but it was how he was handled previous to their arrival that caught my eye it was here that i saw something i had missed earlier something as simple as the designations of the uniform deputies who first responded to the call according to the records deputies murray and harber had the designations alpha and alpha after their names and i had seen at least one of those designations in the wyms file jumping from case to case and from file to file i found the wyms arrest report and quickly scanned the narrative not stopping until my eyes came to the first reference to the alpha designation deputy todd stallworth had the designation written after his name he was the deputy originally called to investigate the report of gunfire at malibu creek state park he was the deputy driving the car wyms fired upon and at the end of the standoff he was the deputy who formally placed wyms under arrest and took him to jail i realized that alpha did not refer to a specific deputy but to a specific patrol zone or responsibility the malibu district covered the huge unincorporated areas of the west county from the beaches of malibu up over the mountains and into the communities of thousand oaks and calabasas i assumed that this was the fourth district and alpha was the specific designation for a patrol unit a specific car it seemed to be the only way to explain why deputies who worked different shifts would share the same designation on different arrest reports adrenaline crashed into my veins and my blood took off running as everything came together all in a moment i realized what vincent had been up to and what he had been planning i didnt need his laptop or his legal pads anymore i didnt need his investigator i knew exactly what the defense strategy was at least i thought i did i pulled my cell phone and called cisco i skipped the pleasantries cisco its me do you know any sheriffs deputies uh a few why any of them work out of the malibu station i know one guy who used to hes in lynwood now malibu was too boring can you call him tonight tonight sure i guess whats up i need to know what the patrol designation fouralphaone means can you get that shouldnt be a problem ill call you back but hold on a sec for lorna she wants to talk to you i waited while she was given the phone i could hear tv noise in the background i had interrupted a scene of domestic bliss mickey are you still there at the office im here its eightthirty i think you should go home i think i should too im going to wait to hear back from cisco hes checking something out for me and then i think im going over to dan tanas to have steak and spaghetti she knew i went to dan tanas when i had something to celebrate usually a good verdict you had steak for breakfast then i guess this will make it a perfect day things went well tonight i think so real well youre going alone she said it with sympathy in her voice like now that she had hooked up with cisco she was starting to feel sorry for me alone out there in the big bad world craig or christian will keep me company craig and christian worked the door at dan tanas they took care of me whether i came in alone or not ill see you tomorrow lorna okay mickey have fun i already am i hung up and waited pacing in the room and thinking it all through again the dominoes went down one after the other it felt good and it all fit vincent had not taken on the wyms case out of any obligation to the law or the poor or the disenfranchised he was using wyms as camouflage rather than move the case toward the obvious plea agreement he had stashed wyms out at camarillo for three months thereby keeping the case alive and active meantime he gathered information under the flag of the wyms defense that he would use in the elliot case thereby hiding his moves and strategy from the prosecution technically he was probably acting within bounds but ethically it was underhanded eli wyms had spent ninety days in a state facility so vincent could build a defense for elliot elliot got the magic bullet while wyms got the zombie cocktail the good thing was i didnt have to worry about the sins of my predecessor wyms was out of camarillo and besides they werent my sins i could just take the benefit of vincents discoveries and go to trial it didnt take too long before cisco called back i talked to my guy in lynwood fouralpha is malibus lead car the four is for the malibu station and the alpha is for alpha like the alpha dog the leader of the pack hot shots the priority calls usually go to the alpha car fouralphaone would be the driver and if hes riding with a partner then the partner would be fouralphatwo so the alpha car covers the whole fourth district thats what he told me fouralpha is free to roam the district and scoop the cream off the top what do you mean the best calls the hot shots got it my theory was confirmed a double murder and shots fired near a residential neighborhood would certainly be alphacar calls one designation but different deputies responding different deputies responding but one car the dominoes clicked and fell does that help mick it does cisco but it also means more work for you on the elliot case no not elliot i want you to work on the eli wyms case find out everything you can about the night he was arrested get me details thats what im here for thirtyone the nights discovery pushed the case off the paper and into my imagination i was starting to get courtroom images in my head scenes of examinations and crossexaminations i was laying out the suits i would wear to court and the postures i would take in front of the jury the case was coming alive inside and this was always a good thing it was a momentum thing you time it right and you go into trial with the inescapable conviction that you will not lose i didnt know what had happened to jerry vincent how his actions might have brought about his demise or whether his death was linked at all to the elliot case but i felt as though i had a bead on things i had velocity and i was getting battle ready my plan was to sit in a corner booth at dan tanas and sketch out some of the key witness examinations listing the baseline questions and probable answers for each i was excited about getting to it and lorna need not have worried about me i wouldnt be alone i would have my case with me not jerry vincents case mine after quickly repacking the files and adding fresh pencils and legal pads i killed the lights and locked the office door i headed down the hallway and then across the bridge to the parking garage just as i was entering the garage i saw a man walking up the ramp from the first floor he was fifty yards away and it was only a few moments and a few strides before i recognized him as the man in the photograph bosch had shown me that morning my blood froze in my heart the fightorflight instinct stabbed into my brain the rest of the world didnt matter there was just this moment and i had to make a choice my brain assessed the situation faster than any computer ibm ever made and the result of the computation was that i knew the man coming toward me was the killer and that he had a gun i swung around and started to run hey a voice called from behind me i kept running i moved back across the bridge to the glass doors leading back into the building one clear single thought fired through every synapse in my brain i had to get inside and get to ciscos gun i had to kill or be killed but it was after hours and the doors had locked behind me as i had left the building i shot my hand into my pocket in search of the key then jerked it out bills coins and wallet flying out with it as i jammed the key into the lock i could hear running steps coming up quickly behind me the gun get the gun i finally yanked the door open and bolted down the hallway toward the office i glanced behind me and saw the man catch the door just before it closed and locked he was still coming key still in my hand i reached the office door and fumbled the key while getting it into the lock i could feel the killer closing in finally getting the door open i entered slammed it shut and threw the lock i hit the light switch then crossed the reception area and charged into vincents office the gun cisco left for me was there in the drawer i grabbed it yanked it out of its holster and went back out to the reception area across the room i could see the killers shape through the frosted glass he was trying to open the door i raised the gun and pointed at the blurred image i hesitated and then raised the gun higher and fired two shots into the ceiling the sound was deafening in the closed room thats right i yelled come on in the image on the other side of the glass door disappeared i heard footsteps moving away in the hallway and then the door to the bridge opening and closing i stood stockstill and listened for any other sound there was nothing without taking my eyes off the door i stepped over to the reception desk and picked up the phone i called and it was answered right away but i got a recording that told me my call was important and that i needed to hold on for the next available emergency dispatcher i realized i was shaking not with fear but with the overload of adrenaline i put the gun on the desk checked my pocket and found that i hadnt lost my cell phone with the office phone in one hand i used the other to open the cell and call harry bosch he answered on the first ring bosch that guy you showed me was just here haller what are you talking about who the guy in the photo you showed me today the one with the gun all right calm down where is he where are you i realized that the stress of the moment had pulled my voice tight and sharp embarrassed i took a deep breath and tried to calm myself before answering im at the office vincents office i was leaving and i saw him in the garage i ran back inside and he ran in after me he tried to get into the office i think hes gone but im not sure i fired a couple of shots and then you have a gun goddamn right i do i suggest you put it away before somebody gets hurt if that guys still out there hell be the one getting hurt who the hell is he there was a pause before he answered i dont know yet look im still downtown and was just heading home myself im in the car sit tight and ill be there in five minutes stay in the office and keep the door locked dont worry im not moving and dont shoot me when i get there i wont i reached over and hung up the office phone i didnt need if bosch was coming i picked the gun back up hey haller what what did he want what the guy what did he come there for thats a good goddamn question but i dont have the answer look stop fucking around and tell me im telling you i dont know what hes after now quit talking and get over here i involuntarily squeezed my hands into fists as i yelled and put an accidental shot into the floor i jumped as though i had been shot at by someone else haller bosch yelled what the hell was that i pulled in a deep breath and took my time composing myself before answering haller whats going on get over here and youll find out did you hit him did you put him down without answering i closed the phone thirtytwo bosch made it in six minutes but it felt like an hour a dark image appeared on the other side of the glass and he knocked sharply haller its me bosch carrying the gun at my side i unlocked the door and let him in he too had his gun out and at his side anything since we were on the phone he asked havent seen or heard him i guess i scared his ass away bosch holstered his gun and threw me a look as if to say my toughguy pose was convincing no one except maybe myself what was that last shot an accident i pointed toward the hole in the floor give me that gun before you get yourself killed i handed it over and he put it into the waistband of his pants you dont own a gun not legally i checked its my investigators he leaves it here at night bosch scanned the ceiling until he saw the two holes i had put there he then looked at me and shook his head he went over to the blinds and checked the street broadway was dead out there this time of night a couple nearby buildings had been converted into residential lofts but broadway still had a way to go before recapturing the nightlife it had had eighty years before okay lets sit down he said he turned from the window to see me standing behind him in your office why because were going to talk about this i moved into the office and took a seat behind the desk bosch sat down across from me first of all heres your stuff i found it out there on the bridge from the pocket of his jacket he pulled my wallet and loose bills he put it all on the desk and then reached back in for the coins okay now what i asked as i put my property back in my pocket now we talk bosch said first off do you want to file a report on this why bother you know about it its your case why dont you know who this guy is were working on it thats not good enough bosch he came after me why cant you id him bosch shook his head because we think hes a hitter brought in from out of town maybe out of the country thats fucking fantastic why did he come back here obviously because of you because of what you know me i dont know anything youve been in here for three days you must know something that makes you a danger to him im telling you ive got nothing then you have to ask yourself why did that guy come back what did he leave behind or forget the first time i just stared at him i actually wanted to help i was tired of being under the gun in more ways than one and if i couldve given bosch just one answer i would have i shook my head i cant think of a single come on haller bosch barked at me your life is threatened here dont you get it whatve you got i told you who did vincent bribe i dont know and i couldnt tell you if i did what did the fbi want with him i dont know that either he started pointing at me you fucking hypocrite youre hiding behind the protections of the law while the killer is out there waiting your ethics and rules wont stop a bullet haller tell me what youve got i told you i dont have anything and dont point your fucking finger at me this isnt my job its your job and maybe if you would get it done people around here would feel excuse me the voice came from behind bosch in one fluid move he turned and pivoted out of his chair drawing his gun and aiming it at the door a man holding a trash bag stood there his eyes going wide in fright bosch immediately lowered his weapon and the office cleaner looked like he might faint sorry bosch said i come back later the man said in a thick accent from eastern europe he turned and disappeared quickly through the door goddamn it bosch cursed clearly unhappy about pointing his gun at an innocent man i doubt well ever get our trash cans emptied again i said bosch went over to the door and closed and bolted it he came back to the desk and looked at me with angry eyes he sat back down took a deep breath and proceeded in a much calmer voice im glad you can keep your sense of humor counselor but enough with the fucking jokes all right no jokes bosch looked like he was struggling internally with what to say or do next his eyes swept the room and then held on me all right look youre right it is my job to catch this guy but you had him right here right goddamn here and so it stands to reason that he was here with a purpose he came to either kill you which seems unlikely since he apparently doesnt even know you or he came to get something from you the question is what is it what is in this office or in one of your files that could lead to the identity of the killer i tried to match him with an eventempered voice of my own all i can tell you is that i have had my case manager in here since tuesday ive had my investigator in here and jerry vincents own receptionist was in here up until lunchtime today when she quit and none of us detective none of us has been able to find the smoking gun youre so sure is here you tell me that vincent paid somebody a bribe but i can find no indication in any file or from any client that that is true i spent the last three hours in here looking at the elliot file and i saw no indication not one that he paid anybody off or bribed somebody in fact i found out that he didnt need to bribe anybody vincent had a magic bullet and he had a shot at winning the case fair and square so when i tell you i have nothing i mean it im not playing you im not holding back i have nothing to give you nothing what about the fbi same answer nothing bosch didnt respond i saw true disappointment cloud his face i continued if this mustache man is the killer then of course there is a reason that brought him back here but i dont know it am i concerned about it no not concerned im fucking scared shitless about it im fucking scared shitless that this guy thinks i have something because if i have it i dont even know i have it and that is not a good place to be bosch abruptly stood up he pulled ciscos gun out of his waistband and put it down on the desk keep it loaded and if i were you i would stop working at night he turned and headed toward the door thats it i called after him he spun in his tracks and came back to the desk what else do you want from me all you want is information from me most of the time information i cant give but you in turn give nothing back and thats half the reason im in danger bosch looked like he might be about to jump over the desk at me but then i saw him calm himself once more all except for the palpitation high on his cheek near his left temple that didnt go away that was his tell and it was a tell that once again gave me a sense of familiarity fuck it he finally said what do you want to know counselor go ahead ask me a question any question and ill answer it i want to know about the bribe where did the money go bosch shook his head and laughed in a false way i give you a free shot and i say to myself that ill answer your question no matter what it is and you go and ask me the question i dont have an answer to you think if i knew where the money went and who got the bribe that id be here right now with you uhuh haller id be booking a killer so youre sure one thing had to do with the other that the bribe if there was a bribe is connected to the killing im going with the percentages but the bribe if there was a bribe went down five months ago why was jerry killed now whys the fbi calling him now good questions let me know if you come up with any answers meantime anything else i can do for you counselor i was heading home when you called yeah there is he looked at me and waited i was on my way out too what you want me to hold your hand on the way to the garage fine lets go i closed the office once again and we proceeded down the hall to the bridge to the garage bosch had stopped talking and the silence was nerveracking i finally broke it i was going to go have a steak you want to come maybe well solve the worlds problems over some red meat where mussos i was thinking dan tanas bosch nodded if you can get us in dont worry i know a guy thirtythree bosch followed me but when i slowed on santa monica boulevard to pull into the valet stop in front of the restaurant he kept going i saw him drive by and turn right on doheny i went in by myself and craig sat me in one of the cherished corner booths it was a busy night but things were tapering off i saw the actor james woods finishing dinner in a booth with a movie producer named mace neufeld they were regulars and mace gave me a nod he had once tried to option one of my cases for a film but it didnt work out i saw corbin bernsen in another booth the actor who had given the best approximation of an attorney i had ever seen on television and then in another booth the man himself dan tana was having a late dinner with his wife i dropped my eyes to the checkered tablecloth enough whos who i had to prepare for bosch during the drive i had thought long and hard about what had just happened back at the office and now i only wanted to think about how best to confront bosch about it it was like preparing for the crossexamination of a hostile witness ten minutes after i was seated bosch finally appeared in the doorway and craig led him to me get lost i asked as he squeezed into the booth i couldnt find a parking space i guess they dont pay you enough for valet no valets a beautiful thing but i cant give my city car to a valet against the rules i nodded guessing that it was probably because he packed a shotgun in the trunk i decided to wait until after we ordered to make a play with bosch i asked if he wanted to look at the menu and he said he was ready to order when the waiter came we both ordered the steak helen with spaghetti and red sauce on the side bosch ordered a beer and i asked for a bottle of flat water so i said wheres your partner been lately hes working on other aspects of the investigation well i guess its good to hear there are other aspects to it bosch studied me for a long moment before replying is that supposed to be a crack just an observation doesnt seem from my end to be much happening maybe thats because your source dried up and blew away my source i dont have any source not anymore i figured out who was feeding your guy and that ended today i just hope you werent paying him for the information because iad will take him down for that i know you wont believe me but i have no idea who or what you are talking about i get information from my investigator i dont ask him how he gets it bosch nodded thats the best way to do it right insulate yourself and then you dont get any blowback in your face in the meantime if a police captain loses his job and pension those are the breaks i hadnt realized ciscos source was so highly placed the waiter brought our drinks and a basket of bread i drank some of the water as i contemplated what to say next i put the glass down and looked at bosch he raised his eyebrows like he was expecting something howd you know when i was leaving the office tonight bosch looked puzzled what do you mean i figure it was the lights you were out there on broadway and when i killed the lights you sent your guy into the garage i dont know what you are talking about sure you do the photo of the guy with the gun coming out of the building it was a phony you set it up choreographed it and used it to smoke out your leak then you tried to scam me with it bosch shook his head and looked out of the booth as if he were looking for someone to help him interpret what i was saying it was a bad act you set up the phony picture and then you showed it to me because you knew it would come back around through my investigator to your leak youd know that whoever asked you about the photo was the leak i cant discuss any aspect of the investigation with you and then you used it to try to play me to see if i was hiding something and to scare it out of me i told you i cant well you dont have to bosch i know its what you did you know what your mistakes were first of all not coming back like you said you would to show the photo to vincents secretary if the guy in the picture was legit you wouldve shown it to her because she knows the clients better than me your second mistake was the gun in the waistband of your hit man vincent was shot with a twentyfive too small for a waistband i missed that when you showed me the photo but ive got it now bosch looked toward the bar in the middle of the restaurant the overhead tv was showing sports highlights i leaned across the table closer to him so whos the guy in the photo your partner with a stickon mustache some clown from vice dont you have better things to do than to be running a game on me bosch leaned back and continued to look around the place his eyes moving everywhere but to me he was contemplating something and i gave him all the time he needed finally he looked at me okay you got me it was a scam i guess that makes you one smart lawyer haller just like the old man i wonder why youre wasting it defending scumbags shouldnt you be out there suing doctors or defending big tobacco or something noble like that i smiled is that how you like to play it you get caught being underhanded so you respond by accusing the other guy of being underhanded bosch laughed his face colored red as he turned away from me it was a gesture that struck me as familiar and his mention of my father brought him to mind i had a vague memory of my father laughing uneasily and looking away as he leaned back at the dinner table my mother had accused him of something i was too young to understand bosch put both arms on the table and leaned toward me youve heard of the first fortyeight right what are you talking about the first fortyeight the chances of clearing a homicide diminish by almost half each day if you dont solve it in the first fortyeight hours he looked at his watch before continuing im coming up on seventytwo hours and ive got nothing he said not a suspect not a viable lead nothing and i was hoping that tonight i might be able to scare something out of you something that would point me in the right direction i sat there staring at him digesting what he had said finally i found my voice you actually thought i knew who killed jerry and wasnt telling it was a possibility i had to consider fuck you bosch just then the waiter came with our steaks and spaghetti as the plates were put down bosch looked at me with a knowing smile on his face the waiter asked what else he could get for us and i waved him away without breaking eye contact youre an arrogant son of a bitch i said you can just sit there with a smile on your face after accusing me of hiding evidence or knowledge in a murder a murder of a guy i knew bosch looked down at his steak picked up his knife and fork and cut into it i noticed he was lefthanded he put a chunk of meat into his mouth and stared at me while he ate it he rested his fists on either side of his plate fork and knife in his grips as if guarding the food from poachers a lot of my clients who had spent time in prison ate the same way why dont you take it easy there counselor he said you have to understand something im not used to being on the same side of the line as the defense lawyer okay it has been my experience that defense attorneys have tried to portray me as stupid corrupt bigoted you name it so with that in mind yes i tried to run a game on you in hopes that it would help me solve a murder i apologize all to hell and back if you want i will have them wrap up my steak and ill take it to go i shook my head bosch had a talent for trying to make me feel guilty for his transgressions maybe now you should be the one who takes it easy i said all im saying is that from the start i have acted openly and honestly with you i have stretched the ethical bounds of my profession and i have told you what i could tell you when i could tell you i didnt deserve to have the shit scared out of me tonight and youre damn lucky i didnt put a bullet in your mans chest when he was at the office door he made a beautiful target you werent supposed to have a gun i checked bosch started eating again keeping his head down as he worked on the steak he took several bites and then moved to the side plate of spaghetti he wasnt a twirler he chopped at the pasta with his fork before putting a bite into his mouth he spoke after he swallowed his food so now that we have that out of the way will you help me i blew out my breath in a laugh are you kidding have you heard a single thing ive said here yeah i heard it all and no im not kidding when all is said and done i still have a dead lawyer your colleague on my hands and i could still use your help i started cutting my first piece of steak i decided he could wait for me to eat like i had waited for him dan tanas was considered by many to serve the best steak in the city count me as one of the many i was not disappointed i took my time savoring the first bite then put my fork down what kind of help we draw out the killer great how dangerous will it be depends on a lot of things but im not going to lie to you it could get dangerous i need you to shake some things up make whoevers out there think theres a loose end that you might be dangerous to them then we see what happens but youll be there ill be covered every step of the way how do we shake things up i was thinking a newspaper story i assume youve been getting calls from the reporters we pick one and give them the story an exclusive and we plant something in there that gets the killer thinking i thought about this and remembered what lorna had warned about playing fair with the media theres a guy at the times i said i kind of made a deal with him to get him off my back i told him that when i was ready to talk i would talk to him thats a perfect setup well use him i didnt say anything so are you in i picked up my fork and knife and remained silent while i cut into the steak again blood ran onto the plate i thought about my daughter getting to the point of asking me the same questions her mother asked and that i could never answer its like youre always working for the bad guys it wasnt as simple as that but knowing this didnt take away the sting or the look i remembered seeing in her eyes i put the knife and fork down without taking a bite i suddenly was no longer hungry yeah i said im in part three to speak the truth thirtyfour everybody lies cops lie lawyers lie clients lie even jurors lie there is a school of belief in criminal law that says every trial is won or lost in the choosing of the jury ive never been ready to go all the way to that level but i do know that there is probably no phase in a murder trial more important than the selection of the twelve citizens who will decide your clients fate it is also the most complex and fleeting part of the trial reliant on the whims of fate and luck and being able to ask the right question of the right person at the right time and yet we begin each trial with it jury selection in the case of california v elliot began on schedule in judge james p stantons courtroom at ten am thursday the courtroom was packed half filled with the venire the eighty potential jurors called randomly from the jury pool on the fifth floor of the ccb and half filled with media courthouse professionals wellwishers and just plain gawkers who had been able to squeeze in i sat at the defense table alone with my client fulfilling his wish for a legal team of just one spread in front of me was an open but empty manila file a postit pad and three different markers red blue and black back at the office i had prepared the file by using a ruler to draw a grid across it there were twelve blocks each the size of a postit each block was for one of the twelve jurors who would be chosen to sit in judgment of walter elliot some lawyers use computers to track potential jurors they even have software that can take information revealed during the selection process filter it through a sociopolitical patternrecognition program and spit out instant recommendations on whether to keep or reject a juror i had been using the oldschool grid system since i had been a baby lawyer in the public defenders office it had always worked well for me and i wasnt changing now i didnt want to use a computers instincts when it came to picking a jury i wanted to use my own a computer cant hear how someone gives an answer it cant see someones eyes when they lie the way it works is that the judge has a computergenerated list from which he calls the first twelve citizens from the venire and they take seats in the jury box at that point each is a member of the jury but they get to keep their seats only if they survive voir dire the questioning of their background and views and understanding of the law there is a process the judge asks them a series of basic questions and then the lawyers get the chance to follow up with a more narrow focus jurors can be removed from the box in one of two ways they can be rejected for cause if they show through their answers or demeanor or even their lifes circumstances that they cannot be fair judges of credibility or hear the case with an open mind there is no limit to the number of challenges for cause at the disposal of the attorneys oftentimes the judge will make a dismissal for cause before the prosecutor or defense attorney even raises an objection i have always believed that the quickest way off a jury panel is to announce that you are convinced that all cops lie or all cops are always right either way a closed mind is a challenge for cause the second method of removal is the preemptory challenge of which each attorney is given a limited supply depending on the type of case and charges because this trial involved charges of murder both the prosecution and defense would have up to twenty preemptory challenges each it is in the judicious and tactful use of these preemptories that strategy and instinct come into play a skilled attorney can use his challenges to help sculpt the jury into a tool of the prosecution or defense a preemptory challenge lets the attorney strike a juror for no reason other than his instinctual dislike of the individual an exception to this would be the obvious use of preemptories to create a bias on the jury a prosecutor who continually removed black jurors or a defense attorney who did the same with white jurors would quickly run afoul of the opposition as well as the judge the rules of voir dire are designed to remove bias and deception from the jury the term itself comes from the french phrase to speak the truth but this of course is contradictory to each sides cause the bottom line in any trial is that i want a biased jury i want them biased against the state and the police i want them predisposed to be on my side the truth is that a fairminded person is the last person i want on my jury i want somebody who is already on my side or can easily be pushed there i want twelve lemmings in the box jurors who will follow my lead and act as agents for the defense and of course the man sitting four feet from me in the courtroom wanted to achieve a diametrically opposite result out of jury selection the prosecutor wanted his own lemmings and would use his challenges to sculpt the jury his way and at my expense by ten fifteen the efficient judge stanton had looked at the printout from the computer that randomly selected the first twelve candidates and had welcomed them to the jury box by calling out code numbers issued to them in the jurypool room on the fifth floor there were six men and six women we had three postal workers two engineers a housewife from pomona an outofwork screenwriter two high school teachers and three retirees we knew where they were from and what they did but we didnt know their names it was an anonymous jury during all pretrial conferences the judge had been adamant about protecting the jurors from public attention and scrutiny he had ordered that the court tv camera be mounted on the wall over the jury box so that the jurors would not be seen in its view of the courtroom he had also ruled that the identities of all prospective jurors be withheld from even the lawyers and that each be referred to during voir dire by their seat number the process began with the judge asking each prospective juror questions about what they did for a living and the area of los angeles county they lived in he then moved on to basic questions about whether they had been victims of crime had relatives in prison or were related to any police officers or prosecutors he asked what their knowledge of the law and court procedures was he asked who had prior jury experience the judge excused three for cause a postal employee whose brother was a police officer a retiree whose son had been the victim of a drugrelated murder and the screenwriter because although she had never worked for archway studios the judge felt she might harbor ill will toward elliot because of the contentious relationship between screenwriters and studio management in general a fourth prospective juror one of the engineers was dismissed when the judge agreed with his plea for a hardship dismissal he was a selfemployed consultant and two weeks spent in a trial were two weeks with no income other than the five bucks a day he made as a juror the four were quickly replaced with four more random selections from the venire and so it went by noon i had used two of my preemptories on the remaining postal workers and would have used a third to strike the second engineer from the panel but decided to take the lunch hour to think about it before making my next move meanwhile golantz was holding fast with a full arsenal of challenges his strategy was obviously to let me use my strikes up and then he would come in with the final shaping of the jury elliot had adopted the pose of ceo of the defense i did the work in front of the jury but he insisted that he be allowed to sign off on each of my preemptory challenges it took extra time because i needed to explain to him why i wanted to dump a juror and he would always offer his opinion but each time he ultimately nodded his approval like the man in charge and the juror was struck it was an annoying process but one i could put up with just as long as elliot went along with what i wanted to do shortly after noon the judge broke for lunch even though the day was devoted to jury selection technically it was the first day of my first trial in over a year lorna taylor had come to court to watch and show her support the plan was to go to lunch together and then she would go back to the office and start packing it up as we entered the hallway outside the courtroom i asked elliot if he wanted to join us but he said he had to make a quick run to the studio to check on things i told him not to be late coming back the judge had given us a very generous ninety minutes for the lunch break and he would not look kindly on any late returns lorna and i hung back and let the prospective jurors crowd onto the elevators i didnt want to ride down with them inevitably when you do that one of them opens their mouth and asks something that is improper and you then have to go through the motions of reporting it to the judge when one of the elevators opened i saw the reporter jack mcevoy push his way out past the jurors scan the hallway and zero in on me great i said here comes trouble mcevoy came directly toward me what do you want i said to explain what you mean explain why youre a liar no look when i told you it was going to run sunday i meant it thats what i was told and here it is thursday and no story in the paper and when ive tried to call you about it you dont call me back ive got other reporters interested mcevoy i dont need the times look i understand but what happened was that they decided to hold it so it would run closer to the trial the trial started two hours ago the reporter shook his head you know the real trial testimony and evidence theyre running it out front this coming sunday the front page on sunday is that a promise monday at the latest oh now its monday look its the news business things change its supposed to run out front on sunday but if something big happens in the world they might kick it over till monday its eitheror whatever ill believe it when i see it i saw that the area around the elevators was clear lorna and i could go down now and not encounter any prospective jurors i took lorna by the arm and started leading her that way i pushed past the reporter so were okay mcevoy said youll hold off hold off on what talking to anyone else on giving away the exclusive whatever i left him hanging and headed toward the elevators when we got out of the building we walked a block over to city hall and i had patrick pick us up there i didnt want any prospective jurors who might be hanging around the courthouse to see me getting into the back of a chauffeured lincoln it might not sit well with them among my pretrial instructions to elliot had been a directive for him to eschew the studio limo and drive himself to court every day you never know who might see what outside the courtroom and what the effect might be i told patrick to take us over to the french garden on seventh street i then called harry boschs cell phone and he answered right away i just talked to the reporter i said and and its finally running sunday or monday on the front page he says so be ready finally yeah you going to be ready dont worry about it im ready i have to worry its my hello he was gone already i closed the phone what was that lorna asked nothing i realized that i had to change the subject listen when you go back to the office today i want you to call julie favreau and see if she can come to court tomorrow i thought elliot didnt want a jury consultant he doesnt have to know were using her then how will you pay her take it out of general operating i dont care ill pay her out of my own pocket if i have to but im going to need her and i dont care what elliot thinks i already burned through two strikes and have a feeling that by tomorrow im going to have to make whatever i have left count ill want her help on the final chart just tell her the bailiff will have her name and will make sure she gets a seat tell her to sit in the gallery and not to approach me when im with my client tell her she can text me on the cell when she has something important okay ill call her are you doing all right mick i mustve been talking too fast or sweating too much lorna had picked up on my agitation i was feeling a little shaky and i didnt know if it was because of the reporters bullshit or boschs hanging up or the growing realization that what i had been working toward for a year would soon be upon me testimony and evidence im fine i said sharply im just hungry you know how i get when im hungry sure she said i understand the truth was i wasnt hungry i didnt even feel like eating i was feeling the weight on me the burden of a mans future and it wasnt my clients future i was thinking of thirtyfive by three oclock on the second day of jury selection golantz and i had traded preemptory and cause challenges for more than ten hours of court time it had been a battle we had quietly savaged each other identifying each others musthave jurors and striking them without care or conscience we had gone through almost the entire venire and my jury seating chart was covered in some spots with as many as five layers of postits i had two preemptory challenges left golantz at first judicious with his challenges had caught up and then passed me and was down to his final preemptory it was zero hour the jury box was about to be complete in its current composition the panel now included an attorney a computer programmer two new postal service employees and three new retirees as well as a male nurse a tree trimmer and an artist from the original twelve seated the morning before there were still two prospective jurors remaining the engineer in seat seven and one of the retirees in seat twelve had somehow gone the distance both were white males and both in my estimation leaning toward the state neither was overtly on the prosecutions side but on my chart i had written notes about each in blue ink my code for a juror who i perceived as being cold to the defense but their leanings were so slight that i had still not used a precious challenge on either i knew i could take them both out in my final flourish and use of preemptory strikes but that was the risk of voir dire you strike one juror because of blue ink and the replacement might end up being neon blue and a greater risk to your client than the original was it was what made jury selection such an unpredictable proposition the latest addition to the box was the artist who took the opening in seat number eleven after golantz had used his nineteenth preemptory to remove a city sanitation worker who id had down as a red juror under the general questioning of judge stanton the artist revealed that she lived in malibu and worked in a studio off the pacific coast highway her medium was acrylic paint and she had studied at the art institute of philadelphia before coming to california for the light she said she didnt own a television and didnt regularly read any newspapers she said she knew nothing about the murders that had taken place six months earlier in the beach house not far from where she lived and worked almost from the start i had taken notes about her in red and grew happier and happier with her on my jury as the questions progressed i knew that golantz had made a tactical error he had eliminated the sanitation worker with one challenge and had ended up with a juror seemingly even more detrimental to his cause he would now have to live with the mistake or use his final challenge to remove the artist and run the same risk all over again when the judge finished his general inquiries it was the lawyers turn golantz went first and asked a series of questions he hoped would draw out a bias so that the artist could be removed for cause instead of through the use of his last preemptory but the woman held her own appearing very honest and openminded four questions into the prosecutors effort i felt a vibration in my pocket and reached in for my cell i held it down below the defense table between my legs and at an angle where it could not be seen by the judge julie favreau had been texting me all day favreau shes a keeper i sent her one back immediately haller i know what about and which one next favreau my secret jury consultant had been in the fourth row of the gallery during both the morning and afternoon sessions i had also met her for lunch while walter elliot had once again gone back to the studio to check on things and i had allowed her to study my chart so that she could make up her own she was a quick study and knew exactly where i was with my codes and challenges i got a response to my text message almost immediately that was one thing i liked about favreau she didnt overthink things she made quick instinctive decisions based solely on visual tells in relation to verbal answers favreau dont like havent heard enough from kick if you have to juror eight was the tree trimmer i had him in blue because of some of the answers he gave when questioned about the police i also thought he was too eager to be on the jury this was always a flag in a murder case it signaled to me that the potential juror had strong feelings about law and order and wasnt hesitant about the idea of sitting in judgment of another person the truth was i was suspicious of anybody who liked to sit in judgment of another anybody who relished the idea of being a juror was blue ink all the way judge stanton was allowing us a lot of leeway when it came time to question a prospective juror the attorneys were allowed to trade their time to question anyone else on the panel he was also allowing the liberal use of back strikes meaning it was acceptable to use a preemptory challenge to strike out anybody on the panel even if they had already been questioned and accepted when it was my turn to question the artist i walked to the lectern and told the judge i accepted her on the jury at this time without further questioning i asked to be allowed instead to make further inquiries of juror number eight and the judge allowed me to proceed juror number eight i just want to clarify a couple of your views on things first let me ask you at the end of this trial after youve heard all the testimony if you think my client might be guilty would you vote to convict him the tree trimmer thought for a moment before answering no because that wouldnt be beyond a reasonable doubt i nodded letting him know that he had given the right answer so you dont equate mightve with beyond a reasonable doubt no sir not at all good do you believe that people get arrested in church for singing too loud a puzzled look spread across the tree trimmers face and there was a murmur of laughter in the gallery behind me i dont understand theres a saying that people dont get arrested in church for singing too loud in other words where theres smoke theres fire people dont get arrested without good reason the police usually have it right and arrest the right people do you believe that i believe that everybody makes mistakes from time to time including the police and you have to look at each case individually but do you believe that the police usually have it right he was cornered any answer would raise a flag for one side or the other i think they probably do theyre the professionals but i would look at every case individually and not think that just because the police usually get things right they automatically got the right man in this case that was a good answer from a tree trimmer no less again i gave him the nod his answers were right but there was something almost practiced about his delivery it was smarmy holierthanthou the tree trimmer wanted very badly to be on the jury and that didnt sit well with me what kind of car do you drive sir the unexpected question was always good for a reaction juror number eight leaned back in his seat and gave me a look like he thought i was trying to trick him in some way my car yes what do you drive to work i have a pickup i keep my equipment and stuff in it its a ford onefifty do you have any bumper stickers on the back yeah a few what do they say he had to think a long moment to remember his own bumper stickers uh i got the nra sticker on there and then i got another that says if you can read this then back off something like that maybe it doesnt say it that nice there was laughter from his fellow members of the venire and number eight smiled proudly how long have you been a member of the national rifle association i asked on the juror information sheet you didnt list that well im not really not a member i mean i just have the sticker on there deception he was either lying about being a member and leaving it off his info sheet or he wasnt a member and was using his bumper sticker to hold himself out as something he was not or as part of an organization he believed in but didnt want to officially join either way it was deceptive and it confirmed everything i was feeling favreau was right he had to go i told the judge i was finished my questioning and sat back down when the judge asked if the prosecution and defense accepted the panel as composed golantz attempted to challenge the artist for cause i opposed this and the judge sided with me golantz had no choice but to use his last preemptory to remove her i then used my secondtolast challenge to remove the tree trimmer the man looked angry as he made the long walk out of the courtroom two more names were called from the venire and a realestate agent and one more retiree took seats eight and eleven in the box their answers to the questions from the judge put them right down the middle of the road i coded them black and heard nothing that raised a flag halfway through the judges voir dire i got another text from favreau favreau both of them if you ask me both lemmings in general having lemmings on the panel was good jurors with no indication of forceful personality and with middleoftheroad convictions could oftentimes be manipulated during deliberations they look for someone to follow the more lemmings you have the more important it is to have a juror with a strong personality and one who you believe is predisposed to be for the defense you want somebody in the deliberations room who will pull the lemmings with him golantz in my view had made a basic tactical error he had exhausted his preemptory challenges before the defense and far worse had left an attorney on the panel juror three had made it through and my gut instinct was that golantz had been saving his last preemptory for him but the artist got that and now golantz was stuck with a lawyer on the panel juror number three didnt practice criminal law but hed had to study it to get his ticket and from time to time must have flirted with the idea of practicing it they didnt make movies and tv shows about realestate lawyers criminal law had the pull and juror three would not be immune to this in my view that made him an excellent juror for the defense he was lit up all red on my chart and was my numberone choice for the panel he would go into the trial and the deliberations that come after it knowing the law and the absolute underdog status of the defense it not only made him sympathetic to my side but it made him the obvious candidate as foreman the juror elected by the panel to make communications with the judge and to speak for the entire panel when the jury got back in there to begin deliberations the person they would all turn to first would be the lawyer if he was red then he was going to pull and push many of his fellow jurors toward a notguilty and at minimum his ego as an attorney would insist that his verdict was correct and he would hold out for it he alone could be the one who hung the jury and kept my client from a conviction it was a lot to bank on considering juror number three had answered questions from the judge and the lawyers for less than thirty minutes but that was what jury selection came down to quick instinctual decisions based on experience and observation the bottom line was that i was going to let the two lemmings ride on the panel i had one preemptory left and i was going to use it on juror seven or juror ten the engineer or the retiree i asked the judge for a few moments to confer with my client i then turned to elliot and slid my chart over in front of him this is it walter were down to our last bullet what do you think i think we need to get rid of seven and ten but we can get rid of only one elliot had been very involved since the first twelve were seated the morning before he had expressed strong and intuitive opinions about each juror i wanted to strike but he had never picked a jury before i had i put up with his comments but ultimately made my own choices this last choice however was a tossup either of the jurors could be damaging to the defense either could turn out to be a lemming it was a tough call and i was tempted to let my clients instincts be the deciding factor elliot tapped a finger on the block for juror ten on my grid the retired technical writer for a toy manufacturer him he said get rid of him you sure absolutely i looked at the grid there was a lot of blue on block ten but there was an equal amount on block seven the engineer i had a hunch that the technical writer was like the tree trimmer he wanted badly to be on the jury but probably for a wholly different set of reasons i thought maybe his plan was to use his experience as research for a book or maybe a movie script he had spent his career writing instruction manuals for toys in retirement he had acknowledged during voir dire he was trying to write fiction there would be nothing like a frontrow seat on a murder trial to help stimulate the imagination and creative process that was fine for him but not for elliot i didnt want anybody who relished the idea of sitting in judgment for any reason on my jury juror seven was blue for another reason he was listed as an aerospace engineer the industry he worked in had a large presence in southern california and consequently i had questioned several engineers during voir dire over the years in general engineers were conservative politically and religiously two very blue attributes and they worked for companies that relied on huge government contracts and grants a vote for the defense was a vote against the government and that was a hard leap for them to make last and perhaps most important engineers exist in a world of logic and absolutes these are things you often cannot apply to a crime or crime scene or even to the criminal justice system as a whole i dont know i said i think the engineer should go no i like him ive liked him since the beginning hes given me good eye contact i want him to stay i turned from elliot and looked over at the box my eyes traveled from juror seven to juror ten and then back again i was hoping for some sign some tell that would reveal the right choice mr haller judge stanton said do you wish to use your last challenge or accept the jury as it is now composed i remind you it is getting late in the day and we still have to choose our alternate jurors my phone was buzzing while the judge addressed me uh one more moment your honor i turned back toward elliot and leaned into him as if to whisper something but what i really was doing was pulling my phone are you sure walter i whispered the guys an engineer that could be trouble for us look i make my living reading people and rolling the dice elliot whispered back i want that man on my jury i nodded and looked down between my legs where i was holding the phone it was a text from favreau favreau kick i see deception fits prosecution profile but i see good eye contact and open face hes interested in your story he likes your client eye contact that settled it i slipped the phone back into my pocket and stood up elliot grabbed me by the sleeve of my jacket i bent down to hear his urgent whisper what are you doing i shook off his grasp because i didnt like his public display of attempting control over me i straightened back up and looked up at the judge your honor the defense would like to thank and excuse juror ten at this time while the judge dismissed the technical writer and called a new candidate to the tenth chair in the box i sat down and turned to elliot walter dont ever grab me like that in front of the jury it makes you look like an asshole and im already going to have a tough enough time convincing them youre not a killer i turned so that my back was to him as i watched the latest and most likely the last juror take the open seat in the box part four fillet of soul walking in a dead mans shoes attorney takes over for murdered colleague first case the trial of the decade by jack mcevoy times staff writer it wasnt the cases dropped in his lap that were the difficulty it was the big one with the big client and highest stakes attached to it defense attorney michael haller stepped into the shoes of the murdered jerry vincent two weeks ago and now finds himself at the center of this years socalled trial of the decade today testimony is scheduled to begin in the trial of walter elliot the yearold chairman of archway studios charged with murdering his wife and her alleged lover six months ago in malibu haller stepped into the case after vincent was found shot to death in his car in downtown los angeles vincent had made legal provisions that allowed haller to step into his practice in the event of his death haller who had been at the end of a yearlong sabbatical from practicing law went to sleep one night with zero cases and woke up the next day with new clients to handle i was excited about coming back to work but i wasnt expecting anything like this said haller the yearold son of the late michael haller sr one of los angeless storied defense attorneys in the s and s jerry vincent was a friend and colleague and of course i would gladly go back to having no cases if he could be alive today the investigation of vincents murder is ongoing there have been no arrests and detectives say there are no suspects he was shot twice in the head while sitting in his car in the garage next to the building where he kept his office in the block of broadway following vincents death the fallen attorneys entire law practice was turned over to haller his job was to cooperate with investigators within the bounds of attorneyclient protections inventory the cases and make contact with all active clients there was an immediate surprise one of vincents clients was due in court the day after the murder my staff and i were just beginning to put all the cases together when we saw that jerry and now of course i had a sentencing with a client haller said i had to drop all of that race over to the criminal courts building and be there for the client that was one down and other active cases to go every client on that list had to be quickly contacted informed of vincents death and given the option of hiring a new lawyer or continuing with haller handling the case a handful of clients decided to seek other representation but the vast majority of cases remain with haller by far the biggest of these is the murder in malibu case it has drawn wide public attention portions of the trial are scheduled to be broadcast live nationally on court tv dominick dunne the premier chronicler of courts and crime for vanity fair is among members of the media who have requested seats in the courtroom the case came to haller with one big condition elliot would agree to keep haller as his attorney only if haller agreed not to delay the trial walter is innocent and has insisted on his innocence since day one haller told the times in his first interview since taking on the case there were early delays in the case and he has waited six months for his day in court and the opportunity to clear his name he wasnt interested in another delay in justice and i agreed with him if youre innocent why wait weve been working almost around the clock to be ready and i think we are it wasnt easy to be ready whoever killed vincent also stole his briefcase from his car it contained vincents laptop computer and his calendar it was not too difficult to rebuild the calendar but the laptop was a big loss haller said it was really the central storage point for case information and strategy the hard files we found in the office were incomplete we needed the laptop and at first i thought we were dead in the water but then haller found something the killer had not taken vincent backed his computer up on a digital flash drive attached to his key chain wading through the megabytes of data haller began to find bits and pieces of strategy for the elliot trial jury selection took place last week and when the testimony begins today he said he will be fully prepared i dont think mr elliot is going to have any dropoff in his defense whatsoever haller said were locked and loaded and ready to go elliot did not return calls for comment for this story and has avoided speaking to the media except for one press conference after his arrest in which he vehemently denied involvement in the murders and mourned the loss of his wife prosecutors and investigators with the los angeles county sheriffs department said elliot killed his wife mitzi and johan rilz in a fit of rage after finding them together at a weekend home owned by the elliots on the beach in malibu elliot called deputies to the scene and was arrested following the crime scene investigation though the murder weapon has never been found forensic tests determined that elliot had recently fired a weapon investigators said he also gave inconsistent statements while initially interviewed at the crime scene and afterwards other evidence against the movie mogul is expected to be revealed at trial elliot remains free on million bail the highest amount ever ordered for a suspect in a crime in los angeles county history legal experts and courthouse observers say it is expected that the defense will attack the handling of evidence in the investigation and the testing procedures that determined that elliot had fired a gun deputy dist atty jeffrey golantz who is prosecuting the case declined comment for this story golantz has never lost a case as a prosecutor and this will be his eleventh murder case thirtysix the jury came out in a singlefile line like the lakers taking the basketball court they werent all wearing the same uniform but the same feeling of anticipation was in the air the game was about to begin they split into two lines and moved down the two rows of the jury box they carried steno pads and pens they took the same seats they were in on friday when the jury was completed and sworn in it was almost ten am monday and a laterthanexpected start but earlier judge stanton had had the lawyers and the defendant back in chambers for almost forty minutes while he went over lastminute ground rules and took the time to give me the squint and express his displeasure over the story published on the front page of the mornings los angeles times his chief concern was that the story was weighted heavily on the defense side and cast me as a sympathetic underdog though on friday afternoon he had admonished the new jury not to read or watch any news reports on the case or trial the judge was concerned that the story might have slipped through in my own defense i told the judge that i had given the interview ten days earlier for a story i had been told would run at least a week before the trial started golantz smirked and said my explanation suggested i was trying to affect jury selection by giving the interview earlier but was now tainting the trial instead i countered by pointing out that the story clearly stated that the prosecution had been contacted but refused to comment if the story was onesided that was why stanton grumpily seemed to accept my story but cautioned us about talking to the media i knew then that i had to cancel my agreement to give commentary to court tv at the end of each days trial session the publicity wouldve been nice but i didnt want to be on the wrong side of the judge we moved on to other things stanton was very interested in budgeting time for the trial like any judge he had to keep things moving he had a backlog of cases and a long trial only backed things up further he wanted to know how much time each side expected to take putting forth his case golantz said he would take a minimum of a week and i said i needed the same though realistically i knew i would probably take much less time most of the defense case would be made or at least set up during the prosecution phase stanton frowned at the time estimates and suggested that both the prosecution and defense think hard about streamlining he said he wanted to get the case to the jury while their attention was still high i studied the jurors as they took their seats and looked for indications of biases or anything else i was still happy with the jury especially with juror three the lawyer a few others were questionable but i had decided over the weekend that i would make my case to the lawyer and hope that he would pull and push the others along with him when he voted for acquittal the jurors all kept their eyes to themselves or looked up at the judge the alpha dog of the courtroom as far as i could tell no juror even glanced at the prosecution or defense table i turned and looked back at the gallery the courtroom once again was packed with members of the media and the public as well as those with a blood link to the case directly behind the prosecutions table sat mitzi elliots mother who had flown in from new york next to her sat johan rilzs father and two brothers who had traveled all the way from berlin i noticed that golantz had positioned the grieving mother on the end of the aisle where she and her constant flow of tears would be fully visible to the jury the defense had five seats on reserve in the first row behind me sitting there were lorna cisco patrick and julie favreau the last on hand because i had hired her to ride through the trial and observe the jury for me i couldnt watch the jurors at all times and sometimes they revealed themselves when they thought none of the lawyers were watching the empty fifth seat had been reserved for my daughter my hope had been that over the weekend i would convince my exwife to allow me to take hayley out of school for the day so she could go with me to court she had never seen me at work before and i thought opening statements would be the perfect time i felt very confident in my case i felt bulletproof and i wanted my daughter to see her father this way the plan was for her to sit with lorna whom she knew and liked and watch me operate in front of the jury in my argument i had even employed the margaret mead line about taking her out of school so that she could get an education but it was a case i ultimately couldnt win my exwife refused to allow it my daughter went to school and the reserved seat went unused walter elliot had no one in the gallery he had no children and no relatives he was close to nina albrecht had asked me if she would be allowed to sit in the gallery to show her support but because she was listed on both the prosecution and defense witness lists she was excluded from watching the trial until her testimony was completed otherwise my client had no one and this was by design he had plenty of associates wellwishers and hangerson who wanted to be there for him he even had alist movie actors willing to sit behind him and show their support but i told him that if he had a hollywood entourage or his corporate lawyers in the seats behind him he would be broadcasting the wrong message and image to the jury it is all about the jury i told him every move that is made from the choice of tie you wear to the witnesses you put on the stand is made in deference to the jury our anonymous jury after the jurors were seated and comfortable judge stanton went on the record and began the proceedings by asking if any jurors had seen the story in the mornings times none raised their hands and stanton responded with another reminder about not reading or watching reports on the trial in the media he then told jurors that the trial would begin with opening statements from the opposing attorneys ladies and gentlemen remember he said these are statements they are not evidence its up to each side to present the evidence that backs the statements up and you will be the ones at the end of the trial who decide if they have done that with that he gestured to golantz and said the prosecution would go first as outlined in a pretrial conference each side would have an hour for its opening statement i didnt know about golantz but i wouldnt take close to that handsome and impressivelooking in a black suit white shirt and maroon tie golantz stood up and addressed the jury from the prosecution table for the trial he had a second chair an attractive young lawyer named denise dabney she sat next to him and kept her eyes on the jury the whole time he spoke it was a way of doubleteaming two pairs of eyes constantly sweeping across the faces of the jurors doubly conveying the seriousness and gravity of the task at hand after introducing himself and his second golantz got down to it ladies and gentleman of the jury we are here today because of unchecked greed and anger plain and simple the defendant walter elliot is a man of great power money and standing in our community but that was not enough for him he did not want to divide his money and power he did not want to turn the cheek on betrayal instead he lashed out in the most extreme way possible he took not just one life but two in a moment of high anger and humiliation he raised a gun and killed both his wife mitzi elliot and johan rilz he believed his money and power would place him above the law and save him from punishment for these heinous crimes but that will not be the case the state will prove to you beyond any reasonable doubt that walter elliot pulled the trigger and is responsible for the deaths of two innocent human beings i was turned in my seat half to obscure the jurys view of my client and half to keep a view of golantz and the gallery rows behind him before his first paragraph was completed the tears were flowing from mitzi elliots mother and that was something i would need to bring up with the judge out of earshot of the jury the theatrics were prejudicial and i would ask the judge to move the victims mother to a seat that was less of a focal point for the jury i looked past the crying woman and saw hard grimaces on the faces of the men from germany i was very interested in them and how they would appear to the jury i wanted to see how they handled emotion and the surroundings of an american courtroom i wanted to see how threatening they could be made to look the grimmer and more menacing they looked the better the defense strategy would work when i focused on johan rilz looking at them now i knew i was off to a good start they looked angry and mean golantz laid his case out to the jurors telling them what he would be presenting in testimony and evidence and what he believed it meant there were no surprises at one point i got a oneline text from favreau which i read below the table favreau they are eating this up you better be good right i thought tell me something i dont know there was an unfair advantage to the prosecution built into every trial the state has the power and the might on its side it comes with an assumption of honesty and integrity and fairness an assumption in every jurors and onlookers mind that we wouldnt be here if smoke didnt lead to a fire it is that assumption that every defense has to overcome the person on trial is supposed to be presumed innocent but anybody who has ever stepped foot into a courtroom as a lawyer or defendant knows that presumed innocence is just one of the idealistic notions they teach in law school there was no doubt in my mind or anybody elses that i started this trial with a defendant who was presumed guilty i had to find a way to either prove him innocent or prove the state guilty of malfeasance ineptitude or corruption in its preparation of the case golantz lasted his entire allotted hour seemingly leaving no secrets about his case hidden he showed typical prosecutorial arrogance put it all out there and dare the defense to try to contradict it the prosecution was always the sixhundredpound gorilla so big and strong it didnt have to worry about finesse when it painted its picture it used a sixinch brush and hung it on the wall with a sledgehammer and spike the judge had told us in the pretrial session that we would be required to remain at our tables or to use the lectern placed between them while addressing witnesses during testimony but opening statements and closing arguments were an exception to this rule during these bookend moments of the trial we would be free to use the space in front of the jury box a spot the veterans of the defense bar called the proving grounds because it was the only time during a trial when the lawyers spoke directly to the jury and either made their case or didnt golantz finally moved from the prosecution table to the proving grounds when it was time for his big finish he stood directly in front of the midpoint of the box and held his hands wide like a preacher in front of his flock im out of time here folks he said so in closing i urge you to take great care as you listen to the evidence and the testimony common sense will lead you i urge you not to get confused or sidetracked by the roadblocks to justice the defense will put before you keep your eyes on the prize remember two people had their lives stolen from them their future was ripped away that is why we are here today for them thank you very much the old keepyoureyesontheprize opener that one had been kicking around the courthouse since i was a public defender nevertheless it was a solid beginning from golantz he wouldnt win any oratoroftheyear trophies but he had made his points hed also addressed the jurors as folks at least four times by my count and that was a word i would never use with a jury favreau had texted me twice more during the last half hour of his delivery with reports of declining jury interest they might have been eating it up at the start but now they were apparently full sometimes you can go on too long golantz had trudged through a full fifteen rounds like a heavyweight boxer i was going to be a welterweight i was interested in quick jabs i was going to get in and get out make a few points plant a few seeds and raise a few questions i was going to make them like me that was the main thing if they liked me they would like my case once the judge gave me the nod i stood up and immediately moved into the proving grounds i wanted nothing between me and the jury i was also aware that this put me right in front and in focus of the court tv camera mounted on the wall above the jury box i faced the jury without physical gesture except for a slight nod of my head ladies and gentlemen i know the judge already introduced me but i would like to introduce myself and my client i am michael haller the attorney representing walter elliot whom you see here sitting at the table by himself i pointed to elliot and by prior design he nodded somberly not offering any form of a smile that would appear as falsely ingratiating as calling the jurors folks now i am not going to take a lot of time here because i want to get to the testimony and the evidence what little there is of it and get this show on the road enough talk its time to put up or shut up mr golantz wove a big and complicated picture for you it took him a whole hour just to get it out but i am here to tell you that this case is not that complicated what the prosecutions case amounts to is a labyrinth of smoke and mirrors and when we blow away the smoke and get through the labyrinth you will understand that you will find that there is no fire that there is no case against walter elliot that there is more than reasonable doubt here that there is outrage that this case was ever brought against walter elliot in the first place again i turned and pointed to my client he sat with his eyes cast downward on the pad of paper he was now writing notes on again by prior design depicting my client as busy actively involved in his own defense chin up and not worried about the terrible things the prosecutor had just said about him he had right on his side and right was might i turned back to the jury and continued i counted six times that mr golantz mentioned the word gun in his speech six times he said walter took a gun and blew away the woman he loved and a second innocent bystander six times but what he didnt tell you six times is that there is no gun he has no gun the sheriffs department has no gun they have no gun and have no link between walter and a gun because he has never owned or had such a weapon mr golantz told you that he will introduce indisputable evidence that walter fired a gun but let me tell you to hold on to your hats keep that promise in your back pocket and lets see at the end of this trial whether that socalled evidence is indisputable lets just see if it is even left standing as i spoke my eyes washed back and forth across the jurors like the spotlights sweeping the sky over hollywood at night i remained in constant but calm motion i felt a certain rhythm in my thoughts and cadence and i instinctively knew i was holding the jury each one of them was riding with me i know that in our society we want our law enforcement officers to be professional and thorough and the best they can possibly be we see crime on the news and in the streets and we know that these men and women are the thin line between order and disorder i mean i want that as much as you do ive been the victim of a violent crime myself i know what that is like and we want our cops to step in and save the day after all thats what they are there for i stopped and swept the whole jury box holding every set of eyes for a brief moment before continuing but thats not what happened here the evidence and im talking about the states own evidence and testimony will show that from the start the investigators focused on one suspect walter elliot the evidence will show that once walter became that focus then all other bets were off all other avenues of investigation were halted or never even pursued they had a suspect and what they believed was a motive and they never looked back they never looked anywhere else either for the first time i moved from my position i stepped forward to the railing in front of juror number one i slowly walked along the front of the box hand sliding along the railing ladies and gentlemen this case is about tunnel vision the focus on one suspect and the complete lack of focus on anything else and i will promise you that when you come out of the prosecutions tunnel youre going to be looking at one another and squinting your eyes against the bright light and youre going to be wondering where the hell their case is thank you very much my hand trailed off the railing and i headed back to my seat before i sat down the judge recessed court for lunch thirtyseven once more my client eschewed lunch with me so he could get back to the studio and make his businessasusual appearance in the executive offices i was beginning to think he viewed the trial as an annoying inconvenience in his schedule he was either more confident than i was in the defenses case or the trial simply wasnt a priority whatever the reason that left me with my entourage from the first row we went over to traxx in union station because i felt it was far enough away from the courthouse to avoid our ending up in the same place as one of the jurors patrick drove and i had him valet the lincoln and join us so that he would feel like part of the team they gave us a table in a quiet enclosure next to a window that looked out on the train stations huge and wonderful waiting room lorna had made the seating arrangements and i ended up next to julie favreau ever since lorna had hooked up with cisco she had decided that i needed to be with someone and had endeavored to be something of a matchmaker this effort coming from an exwife an exwife i still cared for on many levels was decidedly uncomfortable and it felt clumsy when lorna overtly pointed me to the chair next to my jury consultant i was in the middle of day one of a trial and the possibility of romance was the last thing i was thinking about besides that i was incapable of a relationship my addiction had left me with an emotional distance from people and things that i was only now beginning to close as such i had made it my priority to reconnect with my daughter after that i would worry about finding a woman to spend time with romance aside julie favreau was wonderful to work with she was an attractive diminutive woman with delicate facial features and raven hair that fell around her face in curls a spray of youthful freckles across her nose made her look younger than she was i knew she was thirtythree years old she had once told me her story shed come to los angeles by way of london to act in film and had studied with a teacher who believed that internal thoughts of character could be shown externally through facial tells tics and body movements it was her job as an actor to bring these giveaways to the surface without making them obvious her student exercises became observation identification and interpretation of these tells in others her assignments took her anywhere from the poker rooms in the south county where she learned to read the faces of people trying not to give anything away to the courtrooms of the ccb where there were always lots of faces and giveaways to read after seeing her in the gallery for three days straight of a trial in which i was defending an accused serial rapist i approached her and asked who she was expecting to find out she was a previously unknown victim of the man at the defense table i was surprised to hear her story and to learn she was simply there to practice reading faces i took her to lunch got her number and the next time i picked a jury i hired her to help me she had been deadon in her observations and i had used her several times since so i said as i spread a black napkin on my lap how is my jury doing i thought it was obvious that the question was directed at julie but patrick spoke up first i think they want to throw the book at your guy he said i think they think hes a stuckup rich guy who thinks he can get away with murder i nodded his take probably wasnt too far off well thanks for the encouraging word i said ill make sure i tell walter to not be so stuckup and rich from now on patrick looked down at the table and seemed embarrassed i was just saying is all no patrick i appreciate it any and all opinions are welcome and they all matter but some things you cant change my client is rich beyond anything any of us can imagine and that gives him a certain style and image an offputting countenance that im not sure i can do anything about julie what do you think of the jury so far before she could answer the waiter came and took our drink orders i stuck with water and lime while the others ordered iced tea and lorna asked for a glass of mad housewife chardonnay i gave her a look and she immediately protested what im not working im just watching plus im celebrating youre in trial again and were back in business i grudgingly nodded speaking of which i need you to go to the bank i pulled an envelope out of my jacket pocket and handed it across the table to her she smiled because she knew what was in it a check from elliot for the remainder of the agreedupon fee for my services lorna put the envelope away and i turned my attention back to julie so what are you seeing i think its a good jury she said overall i see a lot of open faces they are willing to listen to your case at least right now we all know they are predisposed to believe the prosecution but they havent shut the door on anything you see any change from what we talked about friday i still present to number three who is number three lorna asked before julie could answer golantzs slipup threes a lawyer and the prosecution shouldve never left him in the box i still think hes a good one to present to julie said but there are others i like eleven and twelve too both retirees and sitting right next to each other i have a feeling that theyre going to bond and almost work as a team when it gets to deliberations you win one over and you win them both i loved her english accent it wasnt uppercrust at all it had a streetsmarts tone to it that gave what she said validity she had not been very successful as an actress so far and she had once told me that she got a lot of audition calls for period pieces requiring a dainty english accent that she hadnt quite mastered her income was primarily earned in the poker rooms where she now played for keeps and from jury reading for me and the small group of lawyers i had introduced her to what about juror seven i asked during selection he was all eyes now he wont look at me julie nodded you noticed that eye contact has completely dropped off the chart like something changed between friday and today i would have to say at this point that thats a sign hes in the prosecutions camp while youre presenting to number three you can bet mr undefeateds going to number seven so much for listening to my client i said under my breath we ordered lunch and told the waiter to hurry the order because we needed to get back to court while we waited i checked with cisco on our witnesses and he said we were good to go in that department i then asked him to hang around after court and see if he could follow the germans out of the courthouse and stay with them until they reached their hotel i wanted to know where they were staying it was just a precaution before the trial was over they were not going to be very happy with me it was good strategy to know where your enemies were i was halfway through my grilledchicken salad when i glanced through the window into the waiting room it was a grand mixture of architectural designs but primarily it had an art deco vibe to it there were rows and rows of big leather chairs for travelers to wait in and huge chandeliers hanging above i saw people sleeping in chairs and others sitting with their suitcases and belongings gathered close around them and then i saw bosch he was sitting alone in the third row from my window he had his earbuds in our eyes held for a moment and then he looked away i put my fork down and reached into my pocket for my cash i had no idea how much mad housewife cost per glass but lorna was into her second round i put five twenties down on the table and told the others to finish eating while i stepped out to make a phone call i left the restaurant and called boschs cell he pulled his plugs and answered it as i was approaching the third row of seats what he said by way of a greeting frank morgan again actually ron carter why are you calling me what did you think of the story i sat in the open seat across from him gave him a glance but acted like i was talking to someone far away from me this is kind of stupid bosch said well i didnt know whether you wanted to stay undercover or just hang up we closed our phones and looked at each other well i asked are we in play we wont know until we know whats that mean the story is out there i think it did what we wanted it to do now we wait and see if something happens then yes were in play we wont know were in play until were in play i nodded even though what he had said made no sense to me whos the woman in black he asked you didnt tell me you had a girlfriend we should probably put coverage on her too shes my jury reader thats all oh she helps you pick out the cop haters and antiestablishment types something like that is it just you here are you watching me by yourself you know i had a girlfriend once she always asked questions in bunches never one at a time did you ever answer any of her questions or did you just cleverly deflect them like you are doing now im not alone counselor dont worry you have people around you that youll never see ive got people on your office whether you are there or not and cameras they had been installed ten days earlier when we had thought that the times story was imminent yeah good but we wont be there for long i noticed where are you moving to nowhere i work out of my car sounds like fun i studied him a moment he had been sarcastic in his tone as usual he was an annoying guy but somehow he had gotten me to entrust my safety to him well ive got to get to court is there something i should be doing any particular way you want me to act or place you want me to go just do what you always do but there is one thing keeping an eye on you in motion takes a lot of people so at the end of the day when you are home for the night call me and tell me so i can release some people okay but youll still have somebody watching right dont worry youll be covered twentyfourseven oh and one other thing what dont ever approach me again like this i nodded i was being dismissed got it i stood up and looked toward the restaurant i could see lorna counting the twenties i had left and putting them down on the check it looked like she was using them all patrick had left the table and gone to get the car from the valet see ya detective i said without looking at him he didnt respond i walked away and caught up with my party as they were coming out of the restaurant was that detective bosch you were with lorna asked yeah i saw him out there what was he doing he said he likes to come over here for lunch sit in those big comfortable chairs and just think thats a coincidence that we were here too julie favreau shook her head there are no coincidences she said thirtyeight after lunch golantz began to present his case he went with what i called the square one presentation he started at the very beginning the call that brought the double murder to public light and proceeded in linear fashion from there the first witness was an emergency operator with the countys communications center she was used to introduce the tape recordings of walter elliots calls for help i had sought in a pretrial motion to thwart the playing of the two tapes arguing that printed transcripts would be clearer and more useful to the jurors but the judge had ruled in the prosecutions favor he ordered golantz to provide transcripts so jurors could read along with the audio when the tapes were played in court i had tried to halt the playing of the tapes because i knew they were prejudicial to my client elliot had calmly spoken to the dispatcher in the first call reporting that his wife and another person had been murdered in that calm demeanor was room for an interpretation of calculated coldness that i didnt want the jury to make the second tape was worse from a defense standpoint elliot sounded annoyed and also indicated he knew and disliked the man who had been killed with his wife tape dispatcher nineoneone do you have an emergency walter elliot i well they look dead i dont think anybody can help them dispatcher excuse me sir who am i talking to walter elliot this is walter elliot this is my house dispatcher yes sir and you say somebody is dead walter elliot i found my wife shes shot and theres a man here hes shot too dispatcher hold on a moment sir let me type this in and get help going to you break dispatcher okay mr elliot i have paramedics and deputies on their way walter elliot its too late for them the paramedics i mean dispatcher i have to send them sir you said they are shot are you in danger walter elliot i dont know i just got here i didnt do this thing are you recording this dispatcher yes sir everything is recorded are you in the house right now walter elliot im in the bedroom i didnt do it dispatcher is there anybody else in the house besides you and the two people who are shot walter elliot i dont think so dispatcher okay i want you to step outside so the deputies will see you when they pull up stand out where they can see you walter elliot okay im going out end the second tape involved a different dispatcher but i allowed golantz to play it i had lost the big argument about whether the tapes could be played at all i saw no sense in wasting the courts time by making the prosecutor bring in the second dispatcher to establish and introduce the second tape this one was made from elliots cell phone he was outside and the slight sound of the oceans waves could be heard in the background tape dispatcher nineoneone what is your emergency walter elliot yeah i called before where is everybody dispatcher you called nineoneone walter elliot yeah my wifes shot sos the german where is everybody dispatcher is this the call in malibu on crescent cove road walter elliot yeah thats me i called at least fifteen minutes ago and nobodys here dispatcher sir my screen shows our alpha unit has an eta of less than one minute hang up the phone and stand out front so they will see you when they arrive will you do that sir walter elliot im already standing out here dispatcher then wait right there sir walter elliot if you say so goodbye end elliot not only sounded annoyed in the second call by the delay but said the word german with almost a sneer in his voice whether or not guilt could be extrapolated from his verbal tones didnt matter the tapes helped set the prosecutions theme of walter elliots being arrogant and believing he was above the law it was a good start for golantz i passed on questioning the dispatcher because i knew there was nothing to be gained for the defense next up for the prosecution was sheriffs deputy brendan murray who was driving the alpha car that first responded to the call in a half hour of testimony in minute detail golantz led the deputy through his arrival and discovery of the bodies he paid special attention to murrays recollections of elliots behavior demeanor and statements according to murray the defendant showed no emotions when leading them up the stairs to the bedroom where his wife lay shot to death and naked on the bed he calmly stepped over the legs of the dead man in the doorway and pointed to the body on the bed he said thats my wife im pretty sure shes dead murray testified according to murray elliot also said at least three times that he had not killed the two people in the bedroom well was that unusual golantz asked well were not trained to get involved in murder investigations murray said were not supposed to so i never asked mr elliot if he did it he just kept telling us he didnt i had no questions for murray either he was on my witness list and i would be able to recall him during the defense phase if i needed to but i wanted to wait for the prosecutions next witness christopher harber who was murrays partner and a rookie in the sheriffs department i thought that if either of the deputies was to make a mistake that might help the defense it would be the rookie harbers testimony was shorter than murrays and he was used primarily to confirm his partners testimony he heard the same things murray heard he saw the same things as well just a few questions your honor i said when stanton inquired about crossexamination while golantz had been conducting his direct examination from the lectern i remained at the defense table for the cross this was a ploy i wanted the jury the witness and the prosecutor to think i was just going through the motions and asking a few questions on cross the truth was i was about to plant what would be a key point in the defenses case now deputy harber you are a rookie correct that is correct have you ever testified in court before not in a murder case well dont be nervous despite what mr golantz may have told you i dont bite there was a polite murmur of laughter in the courtroom harbers face turned a little pink he was a big man with sandy hair cut militaryshort the way they like it in the sheriffs department now when you and your partner arrived at the elliot house you said you saw my client standing out front in the turnaround is that correct that is correct okay what was he doing just standing there he had been told to wait there for us okay now what did you know about the situation when the alpha car pulled in there we only knew what dispatch had told us that a man named walter elliot had called from the house and said that two people were dead inside they had been shot had you ever had a call like that before no were you scared nervous jackedup what i would say that the adrenaline was flowing but we were pretty calm did you draw your weapon when you got out of your car yes i did did you point it at mr elliot no i carried it at my side did your partner draw his weapon i believe so did he point it at mr elliot harber hesitated i always liked it when witnesses for the prosecution hesitated i dont recall i wasnt really looking at him i was looking at the defendant i nodded like that made sense to me you had to be safe correct you didnt know this guy you just knew that there supposedly were two dead people inside thats right so it would be correct to say you approached mr elliot cautiously thats right when did you put your weapon away that was after we had searched and secured the premises you mean after you went inside and confirmed the deaths and that there was no one else inside correct okay so when you were doing this mr elliot was with you the whole time yes we needed to keep him with us so he could show us where the bodies were now was he under arrest no he was not he volunteered to show us but you handcuffed him didnt you harbers second hesitation followed the question he was in uncharted water and probably remembering the lines hed rehearsed with golantz or his young second chair he had voluntarily agreed to be handcuffed we explained to him that we were not arresting him but that we had a volatile situation inside the house and that it would be best for his safety and ours if we could handcuff him until we secured the premises and he agreed yes he agreed in my peripheral vision i saw elliot shake his head i hoped the jury saw it too were his hands cuffed behind his back or in the front in the back according to procedure we are not allowed to handcuff a subject in the front a subject what does that mean a subject can be anybody involved in an investigation someone who is arrested including that yes but mr elliot was not under arrest i know you are new on the job but how often have you handcuffed someone who was not under arrest its happened on occasion but i dont recall the number of times i nodded but i hoped it was clear that i wasnt nodding because i believed him now your partner testified and you have testified that mr elliot on three occasions told you both that he was not responsible for the killings in that house right right you heard those statements yes i did was that when you were outside or inside or where that was inside when we were up in the bedroom so that means that he made these supposedly uninvited protestations of his innocence while he was handcuffed with his arms behind his back and you and your partner had your weapons drawn and ready is that correct the third hesitation yes i believe that would be so and you are saying he was not under arrest at this time he was not under arrest okay so what happened after mr elliot led you inside and up to the bodies and you and your partner determined that there was no one else in the house we took mr elliot back outside we sealed the house and we called detective services for a homicide callout was that all according to sheriffs procedure too yes it was good now deputy harber did you take the handcuffs off of mr elliot then since he was not under arrest no sir we didnt we placed mr elliot in the back of the car and it is against procedure to place a subject in a sheriffs car without handcuffs again theres that word subject are you sure mr elliot wasnt under arrest i am sure we did not arrest him okay how long was he in the backseat of that car approximately one half hour while we waited for the homicide team and what happened when the team arrived when the investigators arrived they looked in the house first then they came out and took custody of mr elliot i mean took him out of the car there was a slip i dove into he was in custody at that time no i made a mistake there he voluntarily agreed to wait in the car and then they arrived and took him out you are saying he voluntarily agreed to be handcuffed in the back of a patrol car yes if he had wanted to could he have opened the door and gotten out i dont think so the back doors have security locks you cant open them from inside but he was in there voluntarily yes he was even harber didnt look like he believed what he was saying his face had turned a deeper shade of pink deputy harber when did the handcuffs finally come off of mr elliot when the detectives removed him from the car they took the cuffs off and gave them back to my partner okay i nodded like i was finished and flipped up a few pages on my pad to check for questions i missed i kept my eyes down on the pad when i spoke oh deputy one last thing the first call to nineoneone went out at oneohfive according to the dispatch log mr elliot had to call again nineteen minutes later to make sure he hadnt been forgotten about and then you and your partner finally arrived four minutes after that a total of twentythree minutes to respond i now looked up at harber deputy why did it take so long to respond to what mustve been a priority call the malibu district is our largest geographically we had to come all the way over the mountain from another call wasnt there another patrol car that was closer and also available my partner and i were in the alpha car its a rover we handle the priority calls and we accepted this one when it came in from dispatch okay deputy i have nothing further on redirect golantz followed the misdirection id set up he asked harber several questions that revolved around whether elliot had been under arrest or not the prosecutor sought to diffuse this idea as it would play into the defenses tunnelvision theory that was what i wanted him to think i was doing and it had worked golantz spent another fifteen minutes eliciting testimony from harber that underlined that the man he and his partner had handcuffed outside the scene of a double murder was not under arrest it defied common sense but the prosecution was sticking with it when the prosecutor was finished the judge adjourned for the afternoon break as soon as the jury had cleared the courtroom i heard a whispered voice call my name i turned around and saw lorna who pointed her finger toward the back of the courtroom i turned further to look back and there were my daughter and her mother squeezed into the back row of the gallery my daughter surreptitiously waved to me and i smiled back thirtynine i met them in the hallway outside the courtroom away from the clot of reporters who surrounded the other principals of the trial as they exited hayley hugged me and i was overwhelmed that she had come i saw an empty wooden bench and we sat down how long were you guys in there i asked i didnt see you unfortunately not that long maggie said her last period today was pe so i decided to take the afternoon off pull her out early and come on down we saw most of your cross with the deputy i looked from maggie to our daughter who was sitting between us she had her mothers looks dark hair and eyes skin that held a tan long into the winter what did you think hay um i thought it was really interesting you asked him a lot of questions he looked like he was getting mad dont worry hell get over it i looked over her head and winked at my exwife mickey i turned around and saw it was mcevoy from the times he had come over his pad and pen ready not now i said i just had a quick and i just said not now leave me alone mcevoy turned and walked back to one of the groups circling golantz who was that hayley asked a newspaper reporter ill talk to him later mom said there was a big story about you today it wasnt really about me it was about the case thats why i was hoping you could come see some of it i looked at my exwife again and nodded my thanks she had put aside any anger she had toward me and placed our daughter first no matter what else i could always count on her for that do you go back in there hayley asked yes this is just a little break so people can get something to drink or use the bathroom we have one more session and then well go home and start it all over tomorrow she nodded and looked down the hall toward the courtroom door i followed her eyes and saw that people were starting to go back in um daddy did that man in there kill somebody i looked at maggie and she shrugged as if to say i didnt tell her to ask the question well honey we dont know he is accused of that yes and a lot of people think he did but nothing has been proven yet and were going to use this trial to decide that thats what the trial is for remember how i explained that to you i remember mick is this your family i looked over my shoulder and froze when i looked into the eyes of walter elliot he was smiling warmly expecting an introduction little did he know who maggie mcfierce was uh hi walter this is my daughter hayley and this is her mom maggie mcpherson hi hayley said shyly maggie nodded and looked uncomfortable walter made the mistake of thrusting his hand out to maggie if she could have acted more stiffly i couldnt imagine it she shook his hand once and then quickly pulled away from his grasp when his hand moved toward hayley maggie literally jumped up put her arms on our daughters shoulders and pulled her from the bench hayley lets go into the restroom real quick before court starts again she hustled hayley off toward the restroom walter watched them go and then looked at me his hand still held out and empty i stood up sorry walter my exwifes a prosecutor she works for the da his eyebrows climbed his forehead then i guess i understand why shes an exwife i nodded just to make him feel better i told him to go on back into the courtroom and that i would be along shortly i walked toward the restrooms and met maggie and hayley as they were coming out i think were going to head home maggie said really shes got a lot of homework and i think shes seen enough for today i couldve argued that last point but i let it go okay i said hayley thanks for coming it means a lot to me okay i bent down and kissed her on the top of her head then pulled her in close for a hug it was only at times like this with my daughter that the distance i had opened in my life came closed i felt connected to something that mattered i looked up at maggie thanks for bringing her she nodded for what its worth youre doing good in there its worth a lot thank you she shrugged and let a small smile slip out and that was nice too i watched them walk toward the elevator alcove knowing they werent going home to my house and wondering how it was that i had messed up my life so badly hayley i called after them my daughter looked back at me see you wednesday pancakes she was smiling as they joined the crowd waiting for an elevator i noticed that my former wife was smiling too i pointed at her as i walked back toward the courtroom and you can come too she nodded well see she said an elevator opened and they moved toward it well see those two words seemed to cover it all for me forty in any murder trial the main witness for the prosecution is always the lead investigator because there are no living victims to tell the jury what happened to them it falls upon the lead to tell the tale of the investigation as well as to speak for the dead the lead investigator brings the hammer he puts everything together for the jury makes it clear and makes it sympathetic the leads job is to sell the case to the jury and like any exchange or transaction it is often just as much about the salesman as it is about the goods being sold the best homicide men are the best salesmen ive seen men as hard as harry bosch on the stand shed a tear when theyve described the last moments a murder victim spent on earth golantz called the cases lead investigator to the stand after the afternoon break it was a stroke of genius and master planning john kinder would hold center stage until court was adjourned for the day and the jurors would go home with his words to consider over dinner and then into the night and there was nothing i could do about it but watch kinder was a large affable black man who spoke with a fatherly baritone he wore reading glasses slipped down to the end of his nose when referring to the thick binder hed carried with him to the stand between questions he would look over the rims at golantz or the jury his eyes seemed comfortable kind alert and wise he was the one witness i didnt have a comeback for with golantzs precise questioning and a series of blowups of crime scene photos which i had been unsuccessful in keeping out on the grounds they were prejudicial kinder led the jury on a tour of the murder scene and what the evidence told the investigative team it was purely clinical and methodical but it was supremely interesting with his deep authoritative voice kinder came off as something akin to a professor teaching homicide to every person in the courtroom i objected here and there when i could in an effort to break the golantzkinder rhythm but there was little i could do but nut it out and wait at one point i got a text on my phone from the gallery and it didnt help ease my concerns favreau they love this guy isnt there anything you can do without turning to glance back at favreau i simply shook my head while looking down at the phones screen under the defense table i then glanced at my client and it appeared that he was barely paying attention to kinders testimony he was writing notes on a legal pad but they werent about the trial or the case i saw a lot of numbers and the heading foreign distribution underlined on the page i leaned over and whispered to him this guys killing us up there i said just in case youre wondering a humorless smile bent his lips and elliot whispered back i think were doing fine youve had a good day i shook my head and turned back to watch the testimony i had a client who wasnt concerned by the reality of his situation he was well aware of my trial strategy and that i had the magic bullet in my gun but nothing is a sure thing when you go to trial thats why ninety percent of all cases are settled by disposition before trial nobody wants to roll the dice the stakes are too high and a murder trial is the biggest gamble of them all but from day one walter elliot didnt seem to get this he just went about the business of making movies and working out foreign distribution and seemingly believed that there was no question that he would walk at the end of the trial i felt my case was bulletproof but not even i had that kind of confidence after the basics of the crime scene investigation were thoroughly covered with kinder golantz moved the testimony toward elliot and the investigators interaction with him now you have testified that the defendant remained in deputy murrays patrol car while you initially surveyed the crime scene and sort of got the lay of the land correct yes that is correct when did you first speak with walter elliot kinder referred to a document in the binder open on the shelf at the front of the witness stand at approximately two thirty i came out of the house after completing my initial survey of the crime scene and i asked the deputies to take mr elliot out of the car and then what did you do i told one of deputies to take the handcuffs off him because i didnt think that was necessary any longer there were several deputies and investigators on the scene by this point and the premises were very secure well was mr elliot under arrest at that point no he wasnt and i explained that to him i told him that the guys the deputies had been taking every precaution until they knew what they had mr elliot said he understood this i asked if he wanted to continue to cooperate and show the members of my team around inside and he said yes he would do it so you took him back inside the house yes we had him put on booties first so as not to contaminate anything and then we went back inside i had mr elliot retrace the exact steps he said he had taken when he came in and found the bodies i made a note about the booties being a bit late since elliot had already shown the first deputies around inside id potshot kinder with that on cross was there anything unusual about the steps he said he had taken or anything inconsistent in what he told you i objected to the question saying that it was too vague the judge agreed score one inconsequential point for the defense golantz simply rephrased and got more specific where did mr elliot lead you in the house detective kinder he walked us in and we went straight up the stairs to the bedroom he told us this was what he had done when he entered he said he then found the bodies and called nineoneone from the phone next to the bed he said the dispatcher told him to leave the house and go out front to wait and thats what he did i asked him specifically if he had been anywhere else in the house and he said no did that seem unusual or inconsistent to you well first of all i thought it was odd if true that hed gone inside and directly up to the bedroom without initially looking around the first level of the house it also didnt jibe with what he told us when we got back outside the house he pointed at his wifes car which was parked in the circle out front and said that was how he knew she had somebody with her in the house i asked him what he meant and he said that she parked out front so that johan rilz the other victim could use the one space available in the garage they had stored a bunch of furniture and stuff in there and that left only one space he said the german had hidden his porsche in there and his wife had to park outside and what was the significance of that to you well to me it showed deception hed told us that he hadnt been anywhere in the house but the bedroom upstairs but it was pretty clear to me he had looked in the garage and seen the second victims porsche golantz nodded emphatically from the lectern driving home the point about elliot being deceptive i knew i would be able to handle this point on cross but i wouldnt get the chance until the next day after it had percolated in the brains of the jury for almost twentyfour hours what happened after that golantz asked well there was still a lot of work to do inside the house so i had a couple members of my team take mr elliot to the malibu substation so he could wait there and be comfortable was he arrested at this time no once again i explained to him that we needed to talk to him and if he was still willing to be cooperative we were going to take him to an interview room at the station and i said that i would get there as soon as possible once again he agreed who transported him investigators joshua and toles took him in their car why didnt they go ahead and interview him once they got to the malibu station because i wanted to know more about him and the crime scene before we talked to him sometimes you get only one chance even with a cooperating witness you used the word witness wasnt mr elliot a suspect at this time it was a catandmouse game with the truth it didnt matter how kinder answered everybody in the courtroom knew that they had drawn a bead on elliot well to some extent anybody and everybody is a suspect kinder answered you go into a situation like that and you suspect everybody but at that point i didnt know a lot about the victims i didnt know a lot about mr elliot and i didnt know exactly what we had so at that time i was viewing him more as a very important witness he found the bodies and he knew the victims he could help us okay so you stashed him at the malibu station while you went to work at the crime scene what were you doing my job was to oversee the documentation of the crime scene and the gathering of any evidence in that house we were also working the phones and the computers and confirming the identities and backgrounding the parties involved what did you learn we learned that neither of the elliots had a criminal record or had any guns legally registered to them we learned that the other victim johan rilz was a german national and appeared to have no criminal record or own any weapons we learned that mr elliot was the head of a studio and very successful in the movie business things like that at some point did a member of your team draw up search warrants in the case yes we did proceeding with an abundance of caution we drew up and had a judge sign off on a series of search warrants so we had the authority to continue the investigation and take it wherever it led is it unusual to take such steps perhaps the courts have granted law enforcement wide leeway in the gathering of evidence but we determined that because of the parties involved in this case we would go the extra mile we went for the search warrants even though we might not need them what specifically were the search warrants for we had warrants for the elliot house and for the three cars mr elliots his wifes and the porsche in the garage we also had a search warrant granting us permission to conduct tests on mr elliot and his clothing to determine if he had discharged a gun in recent hours the prosecutor continued to lead kinder through the investigation up until he cleared the crime scene and interviewed elliot at the malibu station this set up the introduction of a videotape of the first sitdown interview with elliot this was a tape i had viewed several times during preparation for trial i knew it was unremarkable in terms of the content of what elliot told kinder and his partner roland ericsson what was important to the prosecution about the tape was elliots demeanor he didnt look like somebody who had just discovered the naked body of his dead wife with a bullet hole in the center of her face and two more in her chest he appeared as calm as a summer sunset and that made him look like an icecold killer a video screen was set up in front of the jury box and golantz played the tape often stopping it to ask kinder a question and then starting it again the taped interview lasted ten minutes and was nonconfrontational it was simply an exercise in which the investigators locked in elliots story there were no hard questions elliot was asked broadly about what he did and when it ended with kinder presenting a search warrant to elliot that the investigator explained granted the sheriffs department access to test his hands arms and clothing for gunshot residue elliot smiled slightly as he replied have at it gentlemen he said do what you have to do golantz checked the clock on the back wall of the courtroom and then used a remote to freeze the image of elliots half smile on the video screen that was the image he wanted the jurors to take with them he wanted them to think about that catchmeifyoucan smile as they drove home in five oclock traffic your honor he said i think now would be a good time to break for the day i will be moving with deputy kinder in a new direction after this and maybe we should start that tomorrow morning the judge agreed adjourning court for the day after once more admonishing the jurors to avoid all media reports on the trial i stood at the defense table and watched the jurors file into the deliberation room i was pretty sure that the prosecution had won the first day but that was to be expected we still had our shots coming i looked over at my client walter what do you have going tonight i asked a small dinner party with friends theyve invited dominick dunne then i am going to watch the first cut of a film my studio is producing with johnny depp playing a detective well call your friends and call johnny and cancel it all youre having dinner with me were going to work i dont understand yes you do youve been ducking me since the trial began that was okay because i didnt want to know what i didnt need to know now its different were in trial were past discovery and i need to know everything walter so were going to talk tonight or youre going to have to hire another lawyer in the morning i saw his face grow tight with checked anger in that moment i knew he could be a killer or at least someone who could order it done you wouldnt dare he said try me we stared at each other for a moment and i saw something about his face relax make your calls i finally said well take my car fortyone since i had insisted on the meeting elliot insisted on the place with a thirtysecond phone call he got us a private booth at the water grill over by the biltmore and had a martini waiting on the table for him when we got there as we sat down i asked for a bottle of flat water and some sliced lemons i sat across from my client and watched him study the fresh fish menu for the longest time i had wanted to be in the dark about walter elliot usually the less you know about your client the better able you are to provide a defense but we were past that time now you called it a dinner meeting elliot said without taking his eyes from the menu arent you going to look im having what youre having walter he put the menu to the side and looked at me fillet of sole sounds good he signaled a waiter who had been standing nearby but too intimidated to approach the table elliot ordered for us both adding a bottle of chardonnay to come with the fish and told the waiter not to forget about my flat water and lemon he then clasped his hands on the table and looked expectantly at me i could be dining with dominick dunne he said this better be good walter this is going to be good this is going to be where you stop hiding from me this is where you tell me the whole story the true story you see if i know what you know then im not going to get sandbagged by the prosecution i am going to know what moves golantz is going to make before he makes them elliot nodded as though he agreed it was time to deliver the goods i did not kill my wife or her nazi friend he said i have told you that from day one i shook my head thats not good enough i said i want the story i want to know what really happened walter i want to know whats going on or im going to be moving on dont be ridiculous no judge is going to let you walk away in the middle of a trial you want to bet your freedom on that walter if i want off this case i will find a way off it he hesitated and studied me before answering you should be careful what you ask for guilty knowledge could be a dangerous thing ill risk it but im not sure i can i leaned across the table to him what does that mean walter what is going on im your lawyer you can tell me what youve done and it stays with me before he could speak the waiter brought a bottle of european water to the table and a side plate of sliced lemons enough for everybody in the restaurant elliot waited until he had filled my glass and moved away and out of earshot before responding what is going on is that you have been hired to present my defense to the jury in my estimation you have done an excellent job so far and your preparations for the defense phase are on the highest level all of this in two weeks astonishing drop the bullshit i said it too loud elliot looked outside the booth and stared down a woman at a nearby table who had heard the expletive youll have to keep your voice down he said the bond of attorneyclient confidentiality ends at this table i looked at him he was smiling but i also knew he was reminding me of what i had already assured him of that what was said here stayed here was it a signal that he was willing to finally talk i played the only ace i had tell me about the bribe jerry vincent paid i said at first i detected a momentary shock in his eyes then came a knowing look as the wheels turned inside and he put something together then i thought i saw a quick flash of regret i wished julie favreau had been sitting next to me she could have read him better than i could that is a very dangerous piece of information to be in possession of he said how did you get it i obviously couldnt tell my client i got it from a police detective i was now cooperating with i guess you could say it came with the case walter i have all of vincents records including his financials it wasnt hard to figure out that he funneled a hundred thousand of your advance to an unknown party is the bribe what got him killed elliot raised his martini glass with two fingers clenching the delicate stem and drank what was left in it he then nodded to someone unseen over my shoulder he wanted another then he looked at me i think it is safe to say a confluence of events led to jerry vincents death walter im not fucking around with you i need to know not only to defend you but to protect myself he put his empty glass to the side of the table and someone whisked it away within two seconds he nodded as if in agreement with me and then he spoke i think you may have found the reason for his death he said it was in the file you even mentioned it to me i dont understand what did i mention elliot responded in an impatient tone he planned to delay the trial you found the motion he was killed before he could file it i tried to put it together but i didnt have enough of the parts i dont understand walter he wanted to delay the trial and that got him killed why elliot leaned across the table toward me he spoke in a tone just above a whisper okay you asked for it and ill tell you but dont blame me when you wish you didnt know what you know yes there was a bribe he paid it and everything was fine the trial was scheduled and all we had to do was be ready to go we had to stay on schedule no delays no continuances but then he changed his mind and wanted to delay why i dont know i think he actually thought he could win the case without the fix it appeared that elliot didnt know about the fbis phone calls and apparent interest in vincent if he did know now would have been the time to mention it the fbis focus on vincent would have been as good a reason as any to delay a trial involving a bribery scheme so delaying the trial got him killed thats my guess yes did you kill him walter i dont kill people you had him killed elliot shook his head wearily i dont have people killed either a waiter moved up to the booth with a tray and a stand and we both leaned back to let him work he deboned our fish plated them and put them down on the table along with two small serving pitchers with beurre blanc sauce in them he then placed elliots fresh martini down along with two wineglasses he uncorked the bottle elliot had ordered and asked if he wanted to taste the wine yet elliot shook his head and told the waiter to go away okay i said when we were left alone lets go back to the bribe who was bribed elliot took down half his new martini in one gulp that should be obvious when you think about it then im stupid help me out a trial that cannot be delayed why my eyes stayed on him but i was no longer looking at him i went inside to work the riddle until it came to me i ticked off the possibilities judge prosecutor cops witnesses jury i realized that there was only one place where a bribe and an unmovable trial intersected there was only one aspect that would change if the trial were delayed and rescheduled the judge prosecutor and all the witnesses would remain the same no matter when it was scheduled but the jury pool changes week to week theres a sleeper on the jury i said you got to somebody elliot didnt react he let me run with it and i did my mind swept along the faces in the jury box two rows of six i stopped on juror number seven number seven you wanted him in the box you knew hes the sleeper who is he elliot nodded slightly and gave me that half smile he took his first bite of fish before answering my question as calmly as if we were talking about the lakers chances at the playoffs and not the rigging of a murder trial i have no idea who he is and dont really care to know but hes ours we were told that number seven would be ours and hes no sleeper hes a persuader when it gets to deliberations he will go in there and turn the tide for the defense with the case vincent built and youre delivering it probably wont take more than a little push im banking on us getting our verdict but at minimum he will hold out for acquittal and well have a hung jury if that happens we just start all over and do it again they will never convict me mickey never i pushed my plate aside i couldnt eat walter no more riddles tell me how this went down tell me from the start from the start from the start elliot chuckled at the thought of it and poured himself a glass of wine without first tasting from the bottle a waiter swooped in to take over the operation but elliot waved him away with the bottle this is a long story mickey would you like a glass of wine to go with it he held the mouth of the bottle poised over my empty glass i was tempted but i shook my head no walter i dont drink im not sure i can trust someone who doesnt take a drink from time to time im your lawyer you can trust me i trusted the last one too and look what happened to him dont threaten me walter just tell me the story he drank heavily from his wineglass and then put it down too hard on the table he looked around to see if anyone in the restaurant had noticed and i got the sense that it was all an act he was really checking to see if we were being watched i scanned the angles i had without being obvious i didnt see bosch or anyone else i pegged as a cop in the restaurant elliot began his story when you come to hollywood it doesnt matter who you are or where you come from as long as youve got one thing in your pocket money thats right i came here twentyfive years ago and i had money i put it in a couple of movies first and then into a halfassed studio nobody gave two shits about and i built that place into a contender another five years and it will no longer be the big four they talk about it will be the big five archway will be right up there with paramount and warners and the rest i wasnt anticipating going back twentyfive years when i told him to start the story from the beginning okay walter i get all of that about your success what are you saying im saying it wasnt my money when i came here it wasnt my money i thought the story was that you came from a family that owned a phosphate mine or shipping operation in florida he nodded emphatically all true but it depends on your definition of family it slowly came to me are you talking about the mob walter i am talking about an organization in florida with a tremendous cash flow that needed legitimate businesses to move it through and legitimate front men to operate those businesses i was an accountant i was one of those men it was easy to put together florida twentyfive years ago the heyday of the uninhibited flow of cocaine and money i was sent west elliot said i had a story and i had suitcases full of money and i loved movies i knew how to pick em and put em together i took archway and turned it into a billiondollar enterprise and then my wife a sad look of regret crossed his face what walter he shook his head on the morning after our twelfth anniversary after the prenuptial agreement was vested she told me she was leaving she was going to get a divorce i nodded i understood with the prenup vested mitzi elliot would be entitled to half of walter elliots holdings in archway studios only he was just a front his holdings actually belonged to the organization and it wasnt the type of organization that would allow half of its investment to walk out the door in a skirt i tried to change her mind elliot said she wouldnt listen she was in love with that nazi bastard and thought he could protect her the organization had her killed it sounded so strange to say those words out loud it made me look around and sweep my eyes across the restaurant i wasnt supposed to be there that day elliot said i was told to stay away to make sure i had a rocksolid alibi whyd you go then his eyes held on mine before he answered i still loved her in some way somehow i still did and i wanted her i wanted to fight for her i went out there to try to stop it maybe be the hero save the day and win her back i dont know i didnt have a plan i just didnt want it to happen so i went out there but i was too late they were both dead when i got there terrible elliot was staring at the memory perhaps the scene in the bedroom in malibu i dropped my eyes down to the white tablecloth in front of me a defense attorney never expects his client to tell him the whole truth parts of the truth yes but never the cold hard and complete truth i had to think that there were things elliot had left out but what he had told me was enough for now it was time to talk about the bribe and then came jerry vincent i prompted his eyes came back into focus and he looked at me yes tell me about the bribe i dont have a lot to tell my corporate attorney hooked me up with jerry and he was fine we worked out the fee arrangement and then he came to me this was early on at least five months ago and he said he had been approached by someone who could salt the jury you know put someone on the jury who would be for us no matter what happened he would be a holdout for acquittal but he would also work for the defense on the inside during deliberations he would be a talker a skilled persuader a con man the catch was that once it was in play the trial would have to stay on schedule so that this person would end up on my jury and you and jerry took the offer we took it this was five months ago at the time i didnt have much of a defense i didnt kill my wife but it seemed the odds were stacked against me we had no magic bullet and i was scared i was innocent but could see that i was going to be convicted so we took the offer how much a hundred thousand up front like you found out jerry paid it through his fees he inflated his fee and i paid him and then he paid for the juror then it was going to be another hundred for a hung jury and twofifty for an acquittal jerry told me that these people had done it before you mean fixed a jury yes thats what he said i thought maybe the fbi had gotten wind of the earlier fixes and that was why they had come to vincent were they jerrys trials that were fixed before i asked he didnt say and i didnt ask did he ever say anything about the fbi sniffing around your case elliot leaned back as if i had just said something repulsive no is that whats going on he looked very concerned i dont know walter im just asking questions here but jerry told you he was going to delay the trial right elliot nodded yes that monday he said we didnt need the fix he had the magic bullet and he was going to win the trial without the sleeper on the jury and that got him killed it had to be i dont think these kinds of people just let you change your mind and pull out of something like this what kind of people the organization i dont know just these kinds of people whoever does this sort of thing did you tell anyone that jerry was going to delay the case no you sure of course im sure then who did jerry tell i wouldnt know well who did jerry make the deal with who did he bribe i dont know that either he wouldnt tell me said it would be better if i didnt know names same thing im telling you it was a little late for that i had to end this and get away by myself to think i glanced at my untouched plate of fish and wondered if i should take it to go for patrick or if someone back in the kitchen would eat it you know elliot said not to put any more pressure on you but if i get convicted im dead i looked at him the organization he nodded a guy gets busted and he becomes a liability normally they wipe him out before he even gets to court they dont take the chance that hell try to cut a deal but i still have control of their money you see they wipe me out and they lose it all archway the real estate everything so theyre hanging back and watching if i get off then we go back to normal and everythings good if i get convicted im too much of a liability and i wont last two nights in prison theyll get to me in there its always good to know exactly what the stakes are but i probably could have gone without the reminder were dealing with a higher authority here elliot continued it goes way beyond things like attorneyclient confidentiality thats small change mick the things ive told you tonight can go no further than this table not into court or anywhere else what ive told you here could get you killed in a heartbeat just like jerry remember that elliot had spoken matteroffactly and concluded the statement by calmly draining the wine from his glass but the threat was implicit in every word he had said i would have no trouble remembering it elliot waved down a waiter and asked for the check fortytwo i was thankful that my client liked his martinis before dinner and his chardonnay with it i wasnt sure i would have gotten what i got from elliot without the alcohol smoothing the way and loosening his tongue but afterward i didnt want him running the risk of getting pulled over on a dui in the middle of a murder trial i insisted that he not drive home but elliot insisted he wasnt going to leave his maybach overnight in a downtown garage so i had patrick take us to the car and then i drove elliot home while patrick followed this car cost four hundred grand i asked him im scared to drive it a little less actually yeah well do you have anything else to drive when i told you not to take the limo i didnt expect youd be tooling up to your murder trial in one of these think about the impressions you are putting out there walter this doesnt look good remember what you told me the first day we met about having to win outside of the courtroom too a car like this doesnt help you with that my other car is a carrera gt great whats that worth more than this one tell you what why dont you borrow one of my lincolns i even have one that has a plate that says not guilty you can drive that thats okay i have access to a nice modest mercedes is that all right perfect walter despite everything you told me tonight im going to do my best for you i think we have a good shot at this then you believe im innocent i hesitated i believe you didnt shoot your wife and rilz im not sure that makes you innocent but put it this way i dont think youre guilty of the charges youre facing and thats all i need he nodded maybe thats the best i can ask for thank you mickey after that we didnt talk much as i concentrated on not wrecking the car which was worth more than most peoples houses elliot lived in beverly hills in a gated estate in the flats south of sunset he pushed a button on the cars ceiling that opened the steel entry gate and we slipped through patrick coming in right behind me in the lincoln we got out and i gave elliot his keys he asked if i wanted to come in for another drink and i reminded him that i didnt drink he stuck out his hand and i shook it and it felt awkward as if we were sealing some sort of deal on what had been revealed earlier i said good night and got into the back of my lincoln the internal gears were working all the way back to my house patrick had been a quick study of my nuances and seemed to know that it was not the time to interrupt with small talk he let me work i sat leaning against the door my eyes gazing out the window but not seeing the neon world go by i was thinking about jerry vincent and the deal he had made with a party unknown it wasnt hard to figure out how it was done the question of who did it was another matter i knew that the jury system relied on random selection on multiple levels this helped ensure the integrity and crosssocial composition of juries the initial pool of hundreds of citizens summoned to jury duty each week was drawn randomly from voter registrations as well as property and public utility records jurors culled from this larger group for the jury selection process in a specific trial were again chosen randomly this time by a courthouse computer the list of those prospective jurors was given to the judge presiding over the trial and the first twelve names or code numbers on the list were called to take the seats in the box for the initial round of voir dire again the order of names or numbers on the list was determined by computergenerated random selection elliot told me that after a trial date had been set in his case jerry vincent was approached by an unknown party and told that a sleeper could be placed on the jury the catch was that there could be no delays if the trial moved the sleeper couldnt move with it all of this told me that this unknown party had full access to all levels of the random processes of the jury system the initial summons to show for jury duty at a specific courthouse on a specific week the random selection of the venire for the trial and the random selection of the first twelve jurors to go into the box once the sleeper was in the box it was up to him to stay there the defense would know not to oust him with a preemptory strike and by appearing to be proprosecution he would avoid being challenged by the prosecution it was simple enough as long as the trials date didnt change stepping it out this way gave me a better understanding of the manipulation involved and who might have engineered it it also gave me a better understanding of the ethical predicament i was in elliot had admitted several crimes to me over dinner but i was his lawyer and these admissions would remain confidential under the bonds of the attorneyclient relationship the exception to this rule was if i were endangered by my knowledge or had knowledge of a crime that was planned but had not yet occurred i knew that someone had been bribed by vincent that crime had already occurred but the crime of jury tampering had not yet occurred that crime wouldnt take place until deliberations began so i was dutybound to report it elliot apparently didnt know of this exception to the rules of client confidentiality or was convinced that the threat of my meeting the same end as jerry vincent would keep me in check i thought about all of this and realized there was one more exception to consider i would not have to report the intended jury tampering if i were to stop the crime from happening i straightened up and looked around we were on sunset coming into west hollywood i looked ahead and saw a familiar sign patrick pull over up here in front of book soup i want to run in for a minute patrick pulled the lincoln to the curb in front of the bookstore i told him to wait in front and i jumped out i went in the stores front door and back into the stacks although i loved the store i wasnt there to shop i needed to make a phone call and i didnt want patrick to hear it the mystery aisle was too crowded with customers i went further back and found an empty alcove where big coffeetable books were stacked heavily on the shelves and tables i pulled my phone and called my investigator cisco its me where are you at home whats up lorna there no she went to a movie with her sister she should be back in thats all right i wanted to talk to you i want you to do something and you may not want to do it if you dont i understand either way i dont want you to talk about it with anybody including lorna there was a hesitation before he answered who do i kill we both started to laugh and it relieved some of the tension that had been building through the night we can talk about that later but this might be just as dicey i want you to shadow somebody for me and find out everything you can about him the catch is if you get caught well both probably get our tickets pulled who is it juror number seven fortythree as soon as i got back in the lincoln i started to regret what i was doing i was walking a fine gray line that could lead me into big trouble on the one hand it is perfectly reasonable for an attorney to investigate a report of jury misconduct and tampering but on the other hand that investigation could be viewed as tampering in itself judge stanton had taken steps to ensure the anonymity of the jury i had just asked my investigator to subvert that if it blew up in our faces stanton would be more than upset and would do more than give me the squint this wasnt a makeawish infraction stanton would complain to the bar the chief judge and all the way up the line to the supreme court if he could get them to listen he would see to it that the elliot trial was my last patrick drove up fareholm and pulled the car into the garage below my house we walked out and then up the stairs to the front deck it was almost ten oclock and i was beat after a fourteenhour day but my adrenaline kicked in when i saw a man sitting in one of the deck chairs his face in silhouette with the lights of the city behind him i put my arm out to stop patrick from advancing the way a parent would stop a child from stepping blindly into the street hello counselor bosch i recognized the voice and the greeting i relaxed and let patrick continue we stepped up onto the porch and i unlocked the door to let patrick go in i then closed the door and turned to bosch nice view he said defending scumbags got you this place i was too tired to do the dance with him what are you doing here detective i figured you might be heading home after the bookstore he said so i just went on ahead and waited for you up here well im done for the night you can give your team the word if there really is a team what makes you think theres not i dont know i just havent seen anybody i hope you werent bullshitting me bosch ive got my ass way out in the wind on this after court you had dinner with your client at water grill you both had the fillet of sole and both of you raised your voices at times your client drank liberally which resulted in you driving him home in his car on your way back from there you stopped into book soup and made a phone call you obviously didnt want your driver to hear i was impressed okay then never mind that i get it theyre out there what do you want bosch whats going on bosch stood up and approached me i was going to ask you the same thing he said what was walter elliot so hot and bothered about tonight at dinner and whod you call in the back of the bookstore first of all elliots my client and im not telling you what we talked about im not crossing that line with you and as far as the call in the bookstore goes i was ordering pizza because as you and your colleagues might have noticed i didnt eat my dinner tonight stick around if you want a slice bosch looked at me with that half smile of his the knowing look with his flat dead eyes so thats how you want to play it counselor for now we didnt speak for a long moment we just sort of stood there waiting for the next clever line it didnt come and i decided i really was tired and hungry good night detective bosch i went in and closed the door leaving bosch out there on the deck fortyfour my turn at detective kinder did not come until late on tuesday after the prosecutor had spent several more hours drawing the details of the investigation out on direct examination this worked in my favor i thought the jury and julie favreau confirmed this by text message was getting bored by the minutiae of the testimony and would welcome a new line of questions the direct testimony primarily regarded the investigative efforts that took place after walter elliots arrest kinder described at length his delving into the defendants marriage the discovery of a recently vested prenuptial agreement and the efforts elliot made in the weeks before the murders to determine how much money and control of archway studios he would lose in a divorce with a time chart he was also able to establish through elliots statements and documented movements that the defendant had no credible alibi for the estimated time of the murders golantz also took the time to question kinder about all the dead ends and offshoots of the investigation that proved to be ancillary kinder described the many unfounded leads that were called in and dutifully checked out the investigation of johan rilz in an effort to determine if he had been the main target of the killer and the comparison of the double murder to other cases that were similar and unsolved in all golantz and kinder appeared to have done a thorough job of nailing my client to the murders in malibu and by midafternoon the young prosecutor was satisfied enough to say no more questions your honor it was now finally my turn and i had decided to go after kinder in a crossexamination that would stay tightly focused on just three areas of his direct testimony and then surprise him with an unexpected punch to the gut i moved to the lectern to conduct the questioning detective kinder i know we will be hearing from the medical examiner later in the trial but you testified that you were informed after the autopsy that the time of death of mrs elliot and mr rilz was estimated to be between eleven am and noon on the day of the murders that is correct was it closer to eleven or closer to noon its impossible to tell for sure that is just the time frame in which it happened okay and once you had that frame you then proceeded to make sure that the man you had already arrested had no alibi correct i would not put it that way no then how would you put it i would say that it was my obligation to continue to investigate the case and prepare it for trial part of that due diligence would be to keep an open mind to the possibility that the suspect had an alibi for the murders in carrying out that obligation i determined according to multiple interviews as well as records kept at the gate at archway studios that mr elliot left the studio driving by himself at ten forty that morning this gave him plenty of time to thank you detective youve answered the question i havent finished my answer golantz stood and asked the judge if the witness could finish his answer and stanton allowed it kinder continued in his homicide tone as i was saying this gave mr elliot plenty of time to get to the malibu house within the parameters of the estimated time of death did you say plenty of time to get there enough time earlier you described making the drive yourself several times when was that the first time was exactly one week after the murders i left the gatehouse at archway at ten forty in the morning and drove to the malibu house i arrived at eleven fortytwo well within the murder window how did you know that you were taking the same route that mr elliot would have taken i didnt so i just took what i considered the most obvious and quickest route that somebody would take most people dont take the long cut they take the short cut the shortest amount of time to their destination from archway i took melrose to la brea and then la brea down to the ten at that point i headed west to the pacific coast highway how did you know that the traffic you encountered would be the same that mr elliot encountered i didnt traffic in los angeles can be a very unpredictable thing can it not yes is that why you drove the route several times one reason yes okay detective kinder you testified that you drove the route a total of five times and got to the malibu house each time before your socalled murder window closed right correct in regard to these five driving tests what was the earliest time you got to the house in malibu kinder looked at his notes that would have been the first time when i got there at eleven fortytwo and what was the worst time the worst what was the longest drive time you recorded during your five trips kinder checked his notes again the latest i got there was eleven fiftyone okay so your best time was still in the last third of the window the medical examiner set for the time of these murders and your worst time would have left mr elliot less than ten minutes to sneak into his house and murder two people correct yes but it could have been done could have you dont sound very confident detective i am very confident that the defendant had the time to commit these murders but only if the murders took place at least fortytwo minutes after the killing window opened correct if you want to look at it that way its not how i am looking at it detective im working with what the medical examiner has given us so in summary for the jury you are saying that mr elliot left his studio at ten forty and got all the way out to malibu snuck into his house surprised his wife and her lover in the upstairs bedroom and killed them both all before that window slammed shut at noon do i have all of that right essentially yes i shook my head as if it was a lot to swallow okay detective lets move on please tell the jury how many times you began the driving route to malibu but broke it off when you knew that you werent going to make it before that window closed at noon that never happened but there had been a slight hesitation in kinders response i was sure the jury picked up on it yes or no detective if i were to produce records and even video that showed you started at the archway gate at ten forty in the morning seven times and not five then those records would be false kinders eyes flicked to golantz and then back to me what youre suggesting happened didnt happen he said and youre not answering the question detective once again yes or no if i introduced records that showed you conducted your driving study at least seven times but have only testified to five times would those records be false no but i didnt thank you detective i only asked for a yes or no response golantz stood and asked the judge to allow the witness to fully answer the question but stanton told him he could take it up on redirect but now i hesitated knowing that golantz would go after kinders explanation on redirect i had the opportunity to get it now and possibly still control it and turn the admission to my advantage it was a gamble because at the moment i felt i had dinged him pretty good and if i went with him until court adjourned for the day then the jurors would go home with police suspicion percolating in their brains that was never a bad thing i decided to risk it and try to control it detective tell us how many of these test drives you broke off before reaching the house in malibu there were two which ones the second time and the last time the seventh i nodded and you stopped these because you knew you would never make it to the house in malibu within the murder window correct no thats very incorrect then what was the reason you stopped the test drives one time i was called back to the office to conduct an interview of somebody waiting there and the other time i was listening to the radio and i heard a deputy call for backup i diverted to back him up why didnt you document these in your report on your driving time investigation i didnt think they were germane because they were incomplete tests so these incompletes were not documented anywhere in that thick file of yours no they were not and so we have only your word about what caused you to stop them before reaching the elliot house in malibu correct that would be correct i nodded and decided i had flogged him enough on this front i knew golantz could rehabilitate kinder on redirect maybe even come up with documentation of the calls that pulled kinder off the malibu route but i hoped that i had raised at least a question of trust in the minds of the jurors i took my small victory and moved on i next hammered kinder on the fact that there was no murder weapon recovered and that his sixmonth investigation of walter elliot had never linked him to a gun of any sort i hit this from several angles so that kinder had to repeatedly acknowledge that a key part of the investigation and prosecution was never located even though if elliot was the killer hed had little time to hide the weapon finally in frustration kinder said well its a big ocean out there mr haller it was an opening i was waiting for a big ocean detective are you suggesting that mr elliot had a boat and dumped the gun out in the middle of the pacific no nothing like that then like what i am just saying the gun could have ended up in the water and the currents took it away before our divers got out there it could have ended up out there you want to take mr elliots life and livelihood away from him on a could have detective kinder no thats not what i am saying what you are saying is that you dont have a gun you cant connect a gun to mr elliot but you have never wavered in believing he is your man correct we had a gunshot residue examination that came back positive in my mind that connected mr elliot to a gun what gun was that we dont have it uhhuh and can you sit there and say to a scientific certainty that mr elliot fired a gun on the day his wife and johan rilz were murdered well not to a scientific certainty but the test thank you detective kinder i think that answers the question lets move on i flipped the page on my notepad and studied the next set of questions i had written the night before detective kinder in the course of your investigation did you determine when johan rilz and mitzi elliot became acquainted i determined that she hired him for his interior decorating services in the fall of two thousand five if she was acquainted with him before that i do not know and when did they become lovers that was impossible for us to determine i do know that mr rilzs appointment book showed regular appointments with mrs elliot at one home or the other the frequency increased about six months before her death was he paid for each one of those appointments mr rilz kept very incomplete books it was hard to determine if he was paid for specific appointments but in general the payments to mr rilz from mrs elliot increased when the frequency of the appointments increased i nodded like this answer fit with a larger picture i was seeing okay and you have also testified that you learned that the murders occurred just thirtytwo days after the prenuptial agreement between walter and mitzi elliot vested thereby giving mrs elliot a full shot at the couples financial holdings in the event of a divorce thats right and that is your motive for these killings in part yes i call it an aggravating factor do you see any inconsistency in your theory of the crime detective kinder no i do not was it not obvious to you from the financial records and the appointment frequency that there was some sort of romantic or at least a sexual relationship going on between mr rilz and mrs elliot i wouldnt say it was obvious you wouldnt i said it with surprise i had him in a little corner if he said the affair was obvious he would be giving me the answer he knew i wanted if he said it was not obvious then he came off as a fool because everyone else in the courtroom thought it was obvious in retrospect it might look obvious but at the time i think it was hidden then how did walter elliot find out about it i dont know doesnt the fact that you were unable to find a murder weapon indicate that walter elliot planned these murders not necessarily then its easy to hide a weapon from the entire sheriffs department no but like i told you it could have simply been thrown into the ocean off the back deck and the currents took over from there that wouldnt take a lot of planning kinder knew what i wanted and where i was trying to go i couldnt get him there so i decided to use a shove detective didnt it ever occur to you that if walter elliot knew about his wifes affair it would have made better sense just to divorce her before the prenuptial agreement vested there was no indication of when he learned of the affair and your question does not take into account things like emotions and rage it was possible that the money had nothing to do with it as a motivating factor it could have just been betrayal and rage pure and simple i hadnt gotten what i wanted i was annoyed with myself and chalked it up to rust i was prepared for the cross but it was the first time i had gone headtohead with a seasoned and cagey witness in a year i decided to back off here and to hit kinder with the punch he wouldnt see coming fortyfive i asked the judge for a moment and then went to the defense table i bent down to my clients ear just nod like i am telling you something really important i whispered elliot did as instructed and then i picked up a file and went back to the lectern i opened the file and then looked at the witness stand detective kinder at what point in your investigation did you determine that johan rilz was the primary target of this double murder kinder opened his mouth to respond immediately then closed it and sat back and thought for a moment it was just the kind of body language i was hoping the jury would pick up on at no point did i ever determine that kinder finally responded at no point was johan rilz front and center in your investigation well he was the victim of a homicide that made him front and center the whole time in my book kinder seemed pretty proud of that answer but i didnt give him much time to savor it then his being front and center explains why you went to germany to investigate his background correct i did not go to germany what about france his passport indicates he lived there before coming to the united states i didnt go there then who on your team did no one we didnt believe it was necessary why wasnt it necessary we had asked interpol for a background check on johan rilz and it came back clean what is interpol it stands for international criminal police organization its an organization that links the police in more than a hundred countries and facilitates crossborder cooperation it has several offices throughout europe and enjoys total access and cooperation from its host countries thats nice but it means you didnt go directly to the police in berlin where rilz was from no we did not did you directly check with police in paris where rilz lived five years ago no we relied on our interpol contacts for background on mr rilz the interpol background pretty much was a check of a criminal arrest record correct that was included yes what else was included im not sure what else i dont work for interpol if mr rilz had worked for the police in paris as a confidential informant on a drug case would interpol have given you this information kinders eyes widened for a split second before he answered it was clear he wasnt expecting the question but i couldnt get a read on whether he knew where i was heading or if it was all new to him i dont know whether they would have given us that information or not law enforcement agencies usually dont give out the names of their confidential informants willynilly do they no they dont why is that because it might put the informants in danger so being an informant in a criminal case can be dangerous on occasion yes detective have you ever investigated the murder of a confidential informant golantz stood up before kinder could answer and asked the judge for a sidebar conference the judge signaled us up i grabbed the file off the lectern and followed golantz up the court reporter moved next to the bench with her steno machine the judge rolled his chair over and we huddled mr golantz the judge prompted judge i would like to know where this is going because im feeling like im being sandbagged here there has been nothing in any of the defenses discovery that even hints at what mr haller is asking the witness about the judge swiveled in his chair and looked at me mr haller judge if anybody is being sandbagged its my client this was a sloppy investigation that save it for the jury mr haller whaddaya got i opened the file and put a computer printout down in front of the judge which positioned it upside down to golantz what ive got is a story that ran in le parisien four and a half years ago it names johan rilz as a witness for the prosecution in a major drug case he was used by the direction de la police judiciaire to make buys and get inside knowledge of the drug ring he was a ci your honor and these guys over here never even looked at him it was tunnel vision from the mr haller again save your argument for the jury this printout is in french do you have the translation sorry your honor i took the second of three sheets out of the file and put it down on top of the first again in the direction of the judge golantz was twisting his head awkwardly as he tried to read it how do we know this is the same johan rilz golantz said its a common name over there maybe in germany but not in france so how do we know its him the judge asked this time this is a translated newspaper article this isnt any kind of official document i pulled the last sheet from the file and put it down this is a photocopy of a page from rilzs passport i got it from the states own discovery it shows that rilz left france for the united states in march two thousand three one month after this story was published plus youve got the age the article has his age right and it says he was making drug buys for the cops out of his business as an interior decorator it obviously is him your honor he betrayed a lot of people over there and put them in jail then he comes here and starts over golantz started shaking his head in a desperate sort of way its still no good he said this is a violation of the rules of discovery and is inadmissible you cant sit on this and then sucker punch the state with it the judge swiveled his view to me and this time gave me the squint as well your honor if anybody sat on anything it was the state this is stuff the prosecution shouldve come up with and given to me in fact i think the witness did know about this and he sat on it that is a serious accusation mr haller the judge intoned do you have evidence of that judge the reason i know about this at all is by accident on sunday i was reviewing my investigators prep work and noticed that he had run all the names associated with this case through the lexisnexis search engine he had used the computer and account i inherited with jerry vincents law practice i checked the account and noticed that the default setting was for englishlanguage search only having looked at the photocopy of rilzs passport in the discovery file and knowing of his background in europe i did the search again this time including french and german languages i came up with this french newspaper article in about two minutes and i find it hard to believe that i found something that easily that the entire sheriffs department the prosecution and interpol didnt know about so judge i dont know if that is evidence of anything but the defense is certainly feeling like the party thats been damaged here i couldnt believe it the judge swiveled to golantz and gave him the squint the first time ever i shifted to my right so that a good part of the jury had an angle on it what about that mr golantz the judge asked its absurd your honor we have sat on nothing and anything that we have found has gone into the discovery file and i would like to ask why mr haller didnt alert us to this yesterday when he just admitted that he made this discovery sunday and the printout is dated then as well i stared deadpan at golantz when i answered if i had known you were fluent in french i would have given it to you jeff and maybe you couldve helped out but im not fluent and i didnt know what it said and i had to get it translated i was handed that translation about ten minutes before i started my cross all right the judge said breaking up the staredown this is still a printout of a newspaper article what are you going to do about verifying the information it contains mr haller well as soon as we break im going to put my investigator on it and see if we can contact somebody in the police judiciaire were going to be doing the job the sheriffs department should have done six months ago were obviously going to verify it as well golantz added rilzs father and two brothers are sitting in the gallery maybe you can start with them the judge held up a hand in a calming gesture like he was a parent quelling an argument between two brothers okay he said i am going to stop this line of crossexamination mr haller i will allow you to lay the foundation for it during the presentation of the defense you can call the witness back then and if you can verify the report and the identity then i will give you wide latitude in pursuing it your honor that puts the defense at a disadvantage i protested how so because now that the states been made aware of this information it can take steps to hinder my verification of it thats absurd golantz said but the judge nodded i understand your concern and i am putting mr golantz on notice that if i find any indication of that then i will become shall we say very agitated i think we are done here gentlemen the judge rolled back into position and the lawyers returned to theirs on my way back i checked the clock on the back wall of the courtroom it was ten minutes until five i figured if i could stall for a few more minutes the judge would recess for the day and the jurors would have the french connection to mull over for the night i stood at the lectern and asked the judge for a few moments i then acted like i was studying my notepad trying to decide if there was anything else i wanted to ask kinder about mr haller how are we doing the judge finally prompted were doing fine judge and i look forward to exploring mr rilzs activities in france more thoroughly during the defense phase of the trial until then i have no further questions for detective kinder i returned to the defense table and sat down the judge then announced that court was recessed for the day i watched the jury file out of the courtroom and picked up no read from any of them i then glanced behind golantz to the gallery all three of the rilz men were staring at me with hardened dead eyes fortysix cisco called me at home at ten oclock he said he was nearby in hollywood and that he could come right over he said he already had some news about juror number seven after hanging up i told patrick that i was going out on the deck to meet privately with cisco i put on a sweater because there was a chill in the air outside grabbed the file id used in court earlier and went out to wait for my investigator the sunset strip glowed like a blast furnace fire over the shoulder of the hills id bought the house in a flush year because of the deck and the view it offered of the city it never ceased to entrance me day or night it never ceased to charge me and tell me the truth that truth being that anything was possible that anything could happen good or bad hey boss i jumped and turned cisco had climbed the stairs and come up behind me without my even hearing him he mustve come up the hill on fairfax and then killed the engine and freewheeled down to my house he knew id be upset if his pipes woke up everybody in the neighborhood dont scare me like that man what are you so jumpy about i just dont like people sneaking up on me sit down out here i pointed him to the small table and chairs positioned under the roofs eave and in front of the living room window it was uncomfortable outdoor furniture i almost never used i liked to contemplate the city from the deck and draw the charge the only way to do that was standing the file id brought out was on the table cisco pulled out a chair and was about to sit down when he stopped and used a hand to sweep the smog dust and crud off the seat man dont you ever spray this stuff off youre wearing jeans and a tshirt cisco just sit down he did and i did and i saw him look through the translucent window shade into the living room the television was on and patrick was in there watching the extremesports channel on cable people were doing flips on snowmobiles is that a sport cisco asked to patrick i guess hows it working out with him its working hes only staying a couple weeks tell me about number seven down to business okay he reached behind him and pulled a small journal out of his back pocket you got any light out here i got up went to the front door and reached in to turn on the deck light i glanced at the tv and saw the medical staff attending to a snowmobile driver who apparently had failed to complete his flip and had three hundred pounds of sled land on him i closed the door and sat back down across from cisco he was studying something in his journal okay he said juror number seven i havent had much time on this but ive got a few things i wanted to get right to you his name is david mcsweeney and i think almost everything he put on his jsheet is false the jsheet was the singlepage form each juror fills out as part of the voir dire process the sheets carry the prospective jurors name profession and area of residence by zip code as well as a checklist of basic questions designed to help attorneys form opinions about whether they want the individual on their jury in this case the name wouldve been excised but all the other information was on the sheet i had given cisco to start with give me some examples well according to the zip on the sheet he lives down in palos verdes not true i followed him from the courthouse directly to an apartment off of beverly over there behind cbs cisco pointed south in the general direction of beverly boulevard and fairfax avenue where the cbs television studio was located i had a friend run the plate on the pickup he drove home from court and it came back to david mcsweeney on beverly same address i saw him go into i then had my guy run his dl and shoot me over the photo i looked at it on my phone and mcsweeney is our guy the information was intriguing but i was more concerned with how cisco was conducting his investigation of juror number seven we had already blown up one source on the vincent investigation cisco man your prints are going to be all over this i told you i cant have any blowback on this chill man theres no fingerprints my guy isnt going to go volunteering that he did a search for me its illegal for a cop to do an outside search hed lose his job and if somebody comes looking we still dont need to worry because he doesnt use his terminal or user id when he does these for me he cadged an old lieutenants password so there are no prints okay no trails were safe on this i reluctantly nodded cops stealing from cops why didnt that surprise me all right i said what else well for one thing hes got an arrest record and he checked the box on the sheet that said hed never been popped before what was the arrest for two arrests adw in ninetyseven and conspiracy to commit fraud in ninetynine no convictions but that is all i know for right now when the court opens i can get more if you want i wanted to know more especially about how arrests for fraud and assault with a deadly weapon could result in no convictions but if cisco pulled records on the case then hed have to show id and that would leave a trail not if you have to sign out the files let it go for now you got anything else yeah im telling you i think its all phony on the sheet he says hes an engineer with lockheed as far as i can tell thats not true i called lockheed and they dont have a david mcsweeney in the phone directory so unless the guys got a job with no phone then he raised his hands palm up as if to say there was no explanation but deception ive only had tnight on this but everythings coming up phony and that probably includes the guys name what do you mean well we dont officially know his name do we it was blacked out on the jsheet right so i followed juror number seven and ided him as david mcsweeney but whos to say thats the same name that was blacked out on the sheet know what i mean i thought for a moment and then nodded youre saying that mcsweeney couldve hijacked a legitimate jurors name and maybe even his jury summons and is masquerading as that person in the courthouse exactly when you get a summons and show up at the juror checkin window all they do is check your dl against the list these are minimumwage court clerks mick it would not be difficult to get a dummy dl by one of them and we both know how easy it is to get a dummy i nodded most people want to get out of jury duty this was a scheme to get into it civic duty taken to extreme cisco said if you can somehow get me the name the court has for number seven i would check it and im betting i find out there is a guy at lockheed with that name i shook my head theres no way i can get it without leaving a trail cisco shrugged so whats going on with this mick dont tell me that fucking prosecutor put a sleeper on the jury i thought a moment about telling him but decided against it at the moment its better if i dont tell you down periscope it meant that we were taking the submarine compartmentalizing so if one of us sprang a leak it wouldnt sink the whole sub its best this way did you see this guy with anybody any kas of interest i followed him over to the grove tonight and he met somebody for a coffee in marmalade one of the restaurants theyve got over there it was a woman it looked like a casual thing like they sort of ran into each other unplanned and sat down together to catch up other than that ive got no known associates so far ive really only been with the guy since five when the judge cut the jury loose i nodded he had gotten me a lot in a short amount of time more than id anticipated how close did you get to him and the woman not close you told me to take all precautions so you cant describe her i just said i didnt get close mick i can describe her i even got a picture of her on my camera he had to stand up to get his big hand into one of the front pockets of his jeans he pulled out a small black nonattentiongetting camera and sat back down he turned it on and looked at the screen on the back he clicked some buttons on the top and then handed it across the table to me they start there and you can scroll through till you get to the woman i manipulated the camera and scrolled through a series of digital photos showing juror number seven at various times during the evening the last three shots were of him sitting with a woman in marmalade she had jetblack hair that hung loose and shadowed her face the photos also werent very crisp because they had been taken from long distance and without a flash i didnt recognize the woman i handed the camera back to cisco okay cisco you did good you can drop it now just drop it yeah and go back to this i slid the file across the table to him he nodded and smiled slyly as he took it so what did you tell the judge up there at the sidebar i had forgotten he had been in the courtroom waiting to start his tail of juror seven i told him i realized that you had done the original background search on the englishlanguage default so i redid it to include french and german i even printed the story out again sunday so i would have a fresh date on it nice but i look like a fuckup i had to come up with something if id told him you came across it a week ago and id been sitting on it since we wouldnt be having this conversation id probably be in lockup for contempt besides the judge thinks golantz is the fuckup for not finding it before the defense that seemed to placate cisco he held up the file so then what do you want me to do with it he asked wheres the translator you used on the printout probably in her dorm over in westwood shes an exchange student i came up with on the net well call her up and pick her up because youre going to need her tonight i have a feeling lorna isnt going to like this me and a twentyyearold french girl lorna doesnt speak french so she will understand theyre what nine hours ahead over there in paris yeah nine or ten i forget okay then i want you to get with the translator and at midnight start working the phones call all the gendarmes or whatever they call themselves who worked that drug case and get one of them on a plane over here at least three of them are named in that article you can start there just like that you think one of those guys is going to just jump on a plane for us theyll probably be stabbing one another in the back trying to get the ticket tell them well fly first class and put whoever comes out in the hotel where mickey rourke stays yeah what hotels that i dont know but i hear hes big over there they think hes like a genius or something anyway look what im saying is just tell them whatever they want to hear spend whatever needs to be spent if two want to come then bring over two and we vet them and put the best one on the stand just get somebody over here its los angeles cisco every cop in the world wants to see this place and then go back home and tell everybody what and who he saw okay ill get somebody on a plane but what if he cant leave right away then get him going as soon as possible and let me know i can stretch things in court the judge wants to hurry everything along but i can slow it down if i need to probably next tuesday or wednesday is as far as i can go get somebody here by then you want me to call you tonight when i have it set up no i need my beauty rest im not used to being on my toes in court all day and im wiped out im going to bed just call me in the morning okay mick he stood up and so did i he slapped me on the shoulder with the file and then tucked it into the waistband at the back of his jeans he descended the steps and i walked to the edge of the deck to look down on him as he mounted his horse by the curb dropped it into neutral and silently started to glide down fareholm toward laurel canyon boulevard i then looked up and out at the city and thought about the moves i was making my personal situation and my professional deceit in front of the judge in court i didnt ponder it all too long and i didnt feel guilty about any of it i was defending a man i believed was innocent of the murders he was charged with but complicit in the reason they had occurred i had a sleeper on the jury whose placement was directly related to the murder of my predecessor and i had a detective watching over me whom i was holding back on and couldnt be sure was considering my safety ahead of his own desire to break open the case i had all of that and i didnt feel guilty or fearful about anything i felt like a guy flipping a threehundredpound sled in midair it might not be a sport but it was dangerous as hell and it did what i hadnt been able to do in more than a years time it shook off the rust and put the charge back in my blood it gave it a fierce momentum i heard the sound of the pipes on ciscos panhead finally fire up he had made it all the way down to laurel canyon before kicking over the engine the throttle roared deeply as he headed into the night part five take the nickel fortyseven on monday morning i had my corneliani suit on i was sitting next to my client in the courtroom and was ready to begin to present his defense jeffrey golantz the prosecutor sat at his table ready to thwart my efforts and the gallery behind us was maxed out once again but the bench in front of us was empty the judge was sequestered in his chambers and running almost an hour behind his own nineoclock start time something was wrong or something had come up but we had not yet been informed we had seen sheriffs deputies escort a man i didnt recognize into chambers and then out again but there had been no word on what was going on hey jeff what do you think i finally asked across the aisle golantz looked over at me he was wearing his nice black suit but he had been wearing it every other day to court and it wasnt as impressive anymore he shrugged no idea he said maybe hes back there reconsidering my request for a directed verdict i smiled golantz didnt im sure he is he said with his best prosecutorial sarcasm the prosecutions case had strung out through the entire previous week i had helped with a couple of protracted crossexaminations but for the most part it had been golantz engaging in overkill he kept the medical examiner who had conducted the autopsies on mitzi elliot and johan rilz on the witness stand for nearly an entire day describing in excruciating detail how and when the victims died he kept walter elliots accountant on the stand for half a day explaining the finances of the elliot marriage and how much walter stood to lose in a divorce and he kept the sheriffs forensic tech on for nearly as long explaining his finding of high levels of gunshot residue on the defendants hands and clothes in between these anchor witnesses he conducted shorter examinations of lesser witnesses and then finally finished his case friday afternoon with a tearjerker he put mitzi elliots lifelong best friend on the stand she testified about mitzi confiding in her the plans to divorce her husband as soon as the prenuptial agreement vested she told of the fight between husband and wife when the plan was revealed and of seeing bruises on mitzi elliots arms the next day she never stopped crying during her hour on the stand and continually veered into hearsay testimony that i objected to as is routine i asked the judge as soon as the prosecution rested for a directed verdict of acquittal i argued that the state had not come close to establishing a prima facie case against elliot but as is also routine the judge flatly denied my motion and said the trial would move to the defense phase promptly at nine am the following monday i spent the weekend strategizing and preparing my two anchor witnesses dr shamiram arslanian my gsr expert and a jetlagged french police captain named malcolm pepin it was now monday morning and i was locked and loaded and ready to go but there was no judge on the bench to let me whats going on elliot whispered to me i shrugged your guess is as good as mine most times when the judge doesnt come out it has nothing to do with the case at hand usually its about the next trial on his calendar elliot wasnt appeased a deep furrow had settled into the center of his brow he knew something was up i turned and looked back into the gallery julie favreau was sitting three rows back with lorna i gave them a wink and lorna sent back a thumbsup i swept the rest of the gallery and noticed that behind the prosecution table there was a gap in the shouldertoshoulder spectators no germans i was about to ask golantz where rilzs family members were when a uniformed sheriffs deputy walked up to the rail behind the prosecutor excuse me golantz turned and the deputy beckoned him with a document he was holding are you the prosecutor the deputy said who do i talk to about this golantz got up and walked over to the rail he took a quick look at the document and handed it back its a defense subpoena are you deputy stallworth thats right then youre in the right spot no im not i didnt have anything to do with this case golantz took the subpoena back and studied it i could see the wheels begin turning but it was going to be too late when he figured things out you werent on the scene at the house what about the perimeter or traffic control i was home asleep man i work midnight shift hold it a second golantz went back to his desk and opened a file i saw him check the final witness list i had submitted two weeks before what is this haller whats what hes on there this is bullshit no its not hes been on there for two weeks i got up and went to the rail i held out my hand deputy stallworth im michael haller stallworth refused to shake my hand embarrassed in front of the whole gallery i pressed on im the one who summoned you if you wait out in the hall ill try to get you in and out as soon as court starts theres some sort of delay with the judge but sit tight and ill get to you no this is wrong i didnt have anything to do with this case i just got off duty and im going home deputy stallworth there is no mistake here and even if there were you cant walk out on a subpoena only the judge can release you at my request you go home and youre going to make him mad i dont think you want him mad at you the deputy huffed like he was being put out in a big way he looked over at golantz for help but the prosecutor was holding a cell phone to his ear and whispering into it i had a feeling it was an emergency call look i said to stallworth just go out into the hall and ill i heard my name along with the prosecutors called from the front of the courtroom i turned and saw the clerk signaling us to the door that led to the judges chambers finally something was happening golantz ended his call and got up i turned from stallworth and followed golantz toward the judges chambers the judge was sitting behind his desk in his black robe he appeared ready to go as well but something was holding him back gentlemen sit down he said judge did you want the defendant in here i asked no i dont think thats necessary just have a seat and ill tell you whats going on golantz and i sat side by side in front of the judge i could tell that golantz was silently steaming over the stallworth subpoena and what it might mean stanton leaned forward and clasped his hands together on top of a folded piece of paper on the desk in front of him we have an unusual situation involving juror misconduct he said it is still developing and i apologize for keeping you out there in the dark he stopped there and we both looked at him wondering if we were supposed to leave now and go back to the courtroom or if we could ask questions but stanton continued after a moment my office received a letter thursday addressed personally to me unfortunately i didnt get a chance to open it until after court on friday kind of an endoftheweek catchup session after everybody was sent home the letter said well here is the letter ive already handled it but dont either of you touch it he unfolded the piece of paper hed weighted with his hands and allowed us to read it i stood up so i could lean over the desk golantz was tall enough even sitting down that he didnt have to judge stanton you should know that juror number seven is not who you think he is and not who he says he is check lockheed and check his prints hes got an arrest record the letter looked like it had come out of a laser printer there were no other markings on the page other than the two creases from where it had been folded i sat back down did you keep the envelope it came in i asked yes stanton said no return address and the postmark is hollywood im going to have the sheriffs lab take a look at the note and the envelope judge i hope you havent spoken to this juror golantz said we should be present and part of any questioning this could just be a ploy by someone to get that juror off the panel i expected golantz to rush to the jurors defense as far as he was concerned number seven was a blue juror i rushed to my own defense hes talking about this being a ploy by the defense and i object to the accusation the judge quickly held his hands up in a calming gesture just hold your horses both of you i didnt talk to number seven yet i spent the weekend thinking about how to proceed with it when i came to court today i conferred with a few other judges on the matter and i was fully prepared to bring it up with counsel present this morning the only problem is juror number seven didnt show up today hes not here that brought a pause to both golantz and me hes not here golantz said did you send deputies to yes i sent court deputies to his home and his wife told them that he was at work but she didnt know anything about court or a trial or anything like that they went over to lockheed and found the man and brought him here a few minutes ago it wasnt him he was not juror number seven judge youre losing me i said i thought you said they found him at work the judge nodded i know i did this is beginning to sound like laurel and hardy and that whos on first thing abbott and costello i said what abbott and costello they did the whos on first thing whichever the point is juror number seven was not juror number seven im still not following you judge i said we had number seven down in the computer as rodney l banglund engineer from lockheed resident of palos verdes but the man who has been sitting for two weeks in seat number seven is not rodney banglund we dont know who he was and now hes missing he took banglunds place but banglund didnt know about it golantz said apparently the judge said banglund the real one is being interviewed about it now but when he was in here he didnt seem to know anything about this he said he never got a jury summons in the first place so his summons was sort of hijacked and used by this unknown person i said the judge nodded so it appears the question is why and the sheriffs department will hopefully get that answered what does this do to the trial i asked do we have a mistrial i dont think so i think we bring the jury out we explain that number sevens been excused for reasons they dont need to know about we drop in the first alternate and go from there meantime the sheriffs department quietly makes damn sure everybody else in that box is exactly who they are supposed to be mr golantz golantz nodded thoughtfully before speaking this is all rather shocking he said but i think the state would be prepared to continue as long as we find out that this whole thing stops at juror number seven mr haller i nodded my approval the session had gone as i had hoped ive got witnesses from as far as paris in town and ready to go i dont want a mistrial my client doesnt want a mistrial the judge sealed the deal with a nod okay go on back out there and well get this thing going in ten minutes on the way down the hall to the courtroom golantz whispered a threat to me hes not the only one whos going to investigate this haller yeah whats that supposed to mean it means when we find this bastard were also going to find out what he was doing on the jury and if there is any tie to the defense then im go i pushed by him toward the door to the courtroom i didnt need to listen to the rest good for you jeff i said as i entered the courtroom i didnt see stallworth and hoped the deputy had gone out into the hallway as i had instructed and was waiting elliot was all over me when i got to the defense table what happened whats going on i used my hand to signal him to keep his voice down i then whispered to him juror number seven didnt show up today and the judge looked into it and found out he was a phony elliot stiffened and looked like somebody had just pressed a letter opener two inches into his back my god what does this mean for us nothing the trial continues with an alternate juror in his place but there will be an investigation of who number seven was and hopefully walter it doesnt come to your door i dont see how it could but we cant go on now you have to stop this get a mistrial i looked at the pleading look on my clients face and realized hed never had any faith in his own defense he had been counting solely on the sleeping juror the judge said no on a mistrial we go with what weve got elliot rubbed a shaking hand over his mouth dont worry walter youre in good hands were going to win this thing fair and square just then the clerk called the courtroom to order and the judge bounded up the steps to the bench okay back on the record with california versus elliot he said lets bring in our jury fortyeight the first witness for the defense was julio muniz the freelance videographer from topanga canyon who got the jump on the rest of the local media and arrived ahead of the pack at the elliot house on the day of the murders i quickly established through my questions how muniz made his living he worked for no network or local news channel he listened to police scanners in his home and car and picked up addresses for crime scenes and active police situations he responded to these scenes with his video camera and took film he then sold to the local news broadcasts that had not responded in regard to the elliot case it began for him when he heard a callout for a homicide team on his scanner and went to the address with his camera mr muniz what did you do when you arrived there i asked well i got my camera out and started shooting i noticed that they had somebody in the back of the patrol car and i thought that was probably a suspect so i shot him and then i shot the deputies stringing crime scene tape across the front of the property things like that i then introduced the digital videocassette muniz used that day as the first defense exhibit and rolled the video screen and player in front of the jury i put in the cassette and hit play it had been previously spooled to begin at the point that muniz began shooting outside the elliot house as the video played i watched the jurors paying close attention to it i was already familiar with the video having watched it several times it showed walter elliot sitting in the back passenger seat of the patrol car because the video had been shot at an angle above the car the a designation painted on its roof was clearly visible the video jumped from the car to scenes of the deputies cordoning off the house and then jumped back again to the patrol car this time it showed elliot being removed from the car by detectives kinder and ericsson they uncuffed him and led him into the house using a remote i stopped the video and rewound it back to a point where muniz had come in close on elliot in the backseat of the patrol car i started the video forward again and then froze the image so the jury could see elliot leaning forward because his hands were cuffed behind his back okay mr muniz let me draw your attention to the roof of the patrol car what do you see painted there i see the cars designation painted there it is foura or four alpha as they say on the sheriffs radio okay and did you recognize that designation had you seen it before well i listen to the scanner a lot and so i am familiar with the fouralpha designation and i had actually seen the fouralpha car earlier that day and what were the circumstances of that i had been listening to the scanner and i heard about a hostage situation in malibu creek state park i went out to shoot that too what time was this about two am so about ten hours before you were videoing the activities at the elliot house you went out to shoot video at this hostage situation correct thats correct and the fouralpha car was involved also in this earlier incident yes when the suspect was finally captured he was transported in fouralpha the same car about what time did that occur that wasnt until almost five in the morning it was a long night did you shoot video of this yes i did that footage comes earlier on the same tape he pointed to the frozen image on the screen then lets see i said i hit the rewind button on the remote golantz immediately stood objected and asked for a sidebar the judge waved us up and i brought along the witness list i had submitted to the court two weeks earlier your honor golantz said angrily the defense is once again sandbagging there has been no indication in discovery or otherwise of mr hallers intent to explore some other crime with this witness i object to this being introduced i calmly slid the witness list in front of the judge under the rules of discovery i had to list each witness i intended to call and give a brief summary of what their testimony was expected to include julio muniz was on my list the summary was brief but allinclusive it clearly says he would testify about video he shot on may second the day of the murders i said the video he shot at the park was shot on the day of the murders may two its been on there for two weeks judge if anybody is sandbagging then its mr golantz sandbagging himself he could have talked to this witness and checked out his videos he apparently didnt the judge studied the witness list for a moment and nodded objection overruled he said you may proceed mr haller i went back and rewound the video and started to play it the jury continued to pay maximum interest it was a night shoot and the images were more grainy and the scenes seemed to jump around more than in the first sequence finally it came to footage showing a man with his hands cuffed behind his back being placed in a patrol car a deputy closed the door and slapped the roof twice the car drove off and came directly by the camera as it was going by i froze the image the screen showed a grainy shot of the patrol car the light of the camera illuminated the man sitting in the backseat as well as the roof of the car mr muniz whats the designation on the roof of that car again its foura or fouralpha and the man being transported where is he sitting in the rear right passenger seat is he handcuffed well he was when they put him in the car i shot it his hands were cuffed behind his back correct correct now is he in the same position and seat in the patrol car that mr elliot was in when you videotaped him about eight hours later yes he is exact same position thank you mr muniz no further questions golantz passed on crossexamination there was nothing about the direct that could be attacked and the video didnt lie muniz stepped down i told the judge i wanted to leave the video screen in place for my next witness and i called deputy todd stallworth to the stand stallworth looked angrier as he came into the courtroom this was good he also looked beat and his uniform looked like it had wilted on his body one of the sleeves of his shirt had a black scuff mark on it presumably from some struggle during the night i quickly established stallworths identity and that he was driving the alpha car in the malibu district during the first shift on the day of the murders in the elliot house before i could ask another question golantz once more objected and asked for another sidebar when we got there he raised his hands palms up in a whats this gesture his style was getting old with me judge i object to this witness the defense hid him on the witness list among the many deputies who were on the scene and have no bearing on the case once again i had the witness list ready this time i slapped it down in front of the judge with frustration then ran my finger down the column of names until i reached todd stallworth it was there in the middle of a list of five other deputies all of whom had been on the scene at the elliot house judge if i was hiding stallworth i was hiding him in plain sight hes clearly listed there under law enforcement personnel the explanation is the same as before it says hell testify about his activities on may thats all i put down because i never talked to him im hearing what he has to say for the first time right now golantz shook his head and tried to maintain his composure judge from the start of this trial the defense has relied on trickery and deception to mr golantz the judge interrupted dont say something you cant back up and that will get you in trouble this witness just like the first one mr haller called has been on this list for two weeks right there in blackandwhite you had every opportunity to find out what these people were going to say if you didnt take that opportunity then that was your decision but this is not trickery or deception you better watch yourself golantz stood with his head bowed for a moment before speaking your honor the state requests a brief recess he finally said in a quiet voice how brief until one oclock i wouldnt call two hours brief mr golantz your honor i cut in i object to any recess he just wants to grab my witness and turn his testimony now that i object to golantz said look no recess no delay and no more bickering the judge said weve already lost most of the morning objection overruled step back we returned to our places and i played a thirtysecond cut of the video showing the handcuffed man being placed in the back of the alpha car at malibu creek state park i froze the image in the same spot as before just as the car was speeding by the camera i left it on the screen as i continued my direct examination deputy stallworth is that you driving that car yes it is who is the man in the backseat his name is eli wyms i noticed that he was handcuffed before being placed in the car is that because he was under arrest yes he was what was he arrested for for trying to kill me for one he was also charged with unlawful discharge of a weapon how many counts of unlawful discharge of a weapon i cant recall the exact number how about ninetyfour that sounds about right it was a lot he shot the place up out there stallworth was tired and subdued but unhesitant in his answers he had no idea how they fit into the elliot case and didnt seem to care about trying to protect the prosecution with short nonresponsive answers he was probably mad at golantz for not getting him out of testifying so you arrested him and took him to the nearby malibu station no i transported him all the way to the county jail in downtown where he could be placed on the psych level how long did that take the drive i mean about an hour and then you drove back to malibu no first i had fouralpha repaired wyms had fired a shot that took out the side lamp while i was downtown i went to the motor pool and had it replaced that took up the rest of my shift so when did the car return to malibu at shift change i turned it over to the daywatch guys i looked down at my notes that would have been deputies murray and harber thats right stallworth yawned and there was murmured laughter in the courtroom i know we have you past your bedtime deputy i wont take too much longer when you turn the car over from shift to shift do you clean it out or disinfect the car in any way youre supposed to realistically unless youve got puke in the backseat nobody does that the cars get taken out of rotation once or twice a week and the motor guys clean them up did eli wyms puke in your car no i wouldve known more murmured laughter i looked down from the lectern at golantz and he wasnt smiling at all okay deputy stallworth let me see if i got this right eli wyms was arrested for shooting at you and firing at least ninetythree other shots that morning he was arrested his hands were cuffed behind his back and he was transported by you downtown do i have all of that right sounds right to me in the video mr wyms can be seen in the rear passenger side seat did he stay there for the whole hourlong ride downtown yes he did i had him belted in is it standard procedure to place someone who is in custody on the passenger side yes it is you dont want him behind you when youre driving deputy i also noticed on the tape that you did not place mr wymss hands in plastic bags or anything of that nature before placing him in your patrol car why is that didnt think it was necessary why because it was not going to be an issue the evidence was overwhelming that he had fired the weapons in his possession we werent worried about gunshot residue thank you deputy stallworth i hope you can go get some sleep now i sat down and left the witness for golantz he slowly got up and took the lectern he knew exactly where i was going now but there was little he was going to be able to do to stop me but i had to give him credit he found a small crack in my direct and tried his best to exploit it deputy stallworth approximately how long did you wait for your car to be repaired at the downtown motor hub about two hours they only have a couple guys work midnight watch and they were juggling jobs down there did you stay with the car for those two hours no i grabbed a desk in the office and wrote up the arrest report on wyms and you testified earlier that no matter what the procedure is supposed to be you generally rely on the motor pool to keep the fleet cars clean is that correct yes correct do you make a formal request or do people working in the motor hub just take it upon themselves to clean and maintain the car ive never made a formal request it just gets done i guess now during those two hours that you were away from the car and writing the report do you know if the employees in the motor hub cleaned or disinfected the car no i do not they could have and you wouldnt necessarily know about it right right thank you deputy i hesitated but got up for redirect deputy stallworth you said it took them two hours to repair the car because they were shorthanded and busy correct correct he said it in a boyamigettingtiredofthis tone so it is unlikely that these guys would have taken the time to clean your car if you didnt ask right i dont know youd have to ask them did you specifically ask them to clean the car nope thank you deputy i sat down and golantz passed on another round it was now almost noon the judge adjourned for lunch but gave the jury and lawyers only a fortyfiveminute break as he sought to make up for time lost during the morning that was fine with me my star witness was next and the sooner i got her on the stand the closer my client was going to be to a verdict of acquittal fortynine dr shamiram arslanian was a surprise witness not in terms of her presence at the trial she had been on the witness list longer than i had been on the case but in terms of her physical appearance and personality her name and pedigree in forensics conjured an image of a woman deep dark and scientific a white lab coat and hair ironed back in a knot but she was none of that she was a vivacious blueeyed blonde with a cheerful disposition and easy smile she wasnt just photogenic she was telegenic she was articulate and confident but never came close to being arrogant the oneword description for her was the oneword description every lawyer wants for every one of his witnesses likable and it was rare to get that in a witness delivering your forensic case i had spent most of the weekend with shami as she preferred to be called we had gone over the gunshot residue evidence in the elliot case and the testimony she would give for the defense as well as the crossexamination she could expect to receive from golantz this had been delayed until so late in the game to avoid discovery issues what my expert didnt know she couldnt reveal to the prosecutor so she was kept in the dark about the magic bullet until the last possible moment there was no doubt that she was a celebrity gun for hire she had once hosted a show about her own exploits on court tv she was asked twice for her autograph when i took her to dinner at the palm and was on a firstname basis with a couple of tv execs who visited the table she charged a celebritylevel fee as well for four days in los angeles to study prepare and testify she would receive a flat rate of plus expenses nice work if you could get it and she could she was known to study the many requests for her time and to choose only those in which she steadfastly believed there had been a grievous error committed or a miscarriage of justice it also didnt hurt if you had a case that was getting the attention of the national media i knew after spending the first ten minutes with her that she was going to be worth every penny elliot would pay her she would be double trouble for the prosecution her personality was going to win over the jury and her facts were going to seal the deal so much of trial work comes down to who is testifying not what the testimony actually reveals its about selling your case to the jury and shami could sell burnt matches the states forensic witness was a lab geek with the personality of a test tube my witness had hosted a television show called chemically dependent i heard the low hum of recognition in the courtroom as my bighaired witness made her entrance from the back holding all eyes as she walked up the center aisle through the gate and across the proving grounds to the witness stand she wore a navy blue suit that fit her curves snugly and accentuated the cascade of blonde curls over her shoulders even judge stanton seemed infatuated he asked the courtroom deputy to get her a glass of water before she had even taken the oath he hadnt asked the states forensic geek if he had wanted jack shit after she gave her name and spelled it and took the oath to tell nothing but the truth i got up with my legal pad and went to the lectern good afternoon dr arslanian how are you im doin just fine thanks for asking there was a slight trace of a southern accent in her voice before we go over your curriculum vitae i want to get something out of the way up front you are a paid consultant to the defense is that correct yes that is correct im paid to be here not paid to testify to anything other than my own opinion whether its in line with the defense or not thats my deal and i never change it okay tell us where you are from doctor i live in ossining new york right now i was born and raised in florida and spent a lot of years in the boston area going to different schools here and there shamiram arslanian that doesnt sound like a florida name she smiled brilliantly my father is one hundred percent armenian so i guess that makes me half armenian and half floridian my father said i was armageddian when i was a girl many in the courtroom chuckled politely what is your background in forensic sciences i asked well ive got two related degrees i got my masters at mit the massachusetts institute of technology and that is in chemical engineering i then got a phd in criminology and that was awarded to me from john jay college in new york when you say awarded does that mean its an honorary degree hell no she said forcefully i worked my butt off two years to get that sucker this time laughter broke out across the courtroom and i noticed that even the judge smiled before politely tapping his gavel one time for order i saw on your résumé that you have two undergraduate degrees as well is that true ive got two of everything it seems two kids two cars ive even got two cats at home named wilbur and orville i glanced over at the prosecution table and saw that golantz and his second were staring straight forward and had not so much as cracked a smile i then checked the jury and saw all twentyfour eyes holding on my witness with rapt attention she had them eating out of her hand and she hadnt even started yet what are your undergraduate degrees i got one from harvard in engineering and one from the berklee college of music i went to both schools at the same time you have a music degree i said with feigned surprise i like to sing more laughter the hits kept coming one surprise after another shami arslanian was the perfect witness golantz finally stood and addressed the judge your honor the state would ask that the witness provide testimony regarding forensics and not music or pet names or things not germane to the serious nature of this trial the judge grudgingly asked me to keep my examination on point golantz sat down he had won the point but lost the position everybody in the room now viewed him as a spoilsport stealing what little levity there was in such a serious matter i asked a few more questions which revealed that dr arslanian currently worked as a teacher and researcher at john jay i covered her history and limited availability as an expert witness and finally brought her testimony to her study of the gunshot residue found on walter elliots body and clothing on the day of the murders in malibu she testified that she reviewed the procedures and results of the sheriffs lab and conducted her own evaluations and modeling she said she also reviewed all videotapes submitted to her by the defense in conjunction with her studies now dr arslanian the states forensic witness testified earlier in this trial that the tabs wiped on mr elliots hands and sleeves and jacket tested positive for elevated levels of certain elements associated with gunshot residue do you agree with that conclusion yes i do my witness said a low vibration of surprise rolled through the room you are saying that your studies concluded that the defendant had gunshot residue on his hands and clothes that is correct elevated levels of barium antimony and lead in combination these are indications of gunshot residue what does elevated levels mean it just means that some of these materials you would find on a persons body whether they had fired or handled a weapon or not just from everyday life so it is elevated levels of all three materials that are required for a positive result in gunshot residue testing correct yes that and concentration patterns can you explain what you mean by concentration patterns sure when a gun discharges in this case we think were talking about a handgun there is an explosion in the chamber that gives the bullet its energy and velocity that explosion sends gases out the barrel with the bullet as well as out any little crack and opening in the gun the breech that is the part at the rear of the guns barrel comes open after a shot has been fired the escaping gases propel these microscopic elements were talking about backward onto the shooter and thats what happened in this case correct no not correct based on the totality of my investigation i cannot say that i raised my eyebrows in feigned surprise but doctor you just said you agreed with the states conclusion that there was gunshot residue on the defendants hands and sleeves i do agree with the states conclusion that there was gsr on the defendant but that wasnt the question you asked i took a moment as if to retrace my question dr arslanian are you saying that there could be an alternate explanation for the gunshot residue on mr elliot yes i am we were there we had finally arrived at the crux of the defenses case it was time to shoot the magic bullet did your study of the materials provided to you over the weekend by the defense lead you to an alternate explanation for the gunshot residue on walter elliots hands and clothing yes they did and what is that explanation it is very highly likely in my opinion that the residue on mr elliots hands and clothes was transferred there transferred are you suggesting someone intentionally planted gsr on him no i am not i am suggesting that it occurred inadvertently by happenstance or mistake gunshot residue is basically microscopic dust it moves it can be transferred by contact what does transferred by contact mean it means the material we are talking about lights on a surface after it is discharged from the firearm if that surface comes into contact with another some of the material will transfer it will rub off is whatm saying this is why there are law enforcement protocols for safeguarding against this the victims and suspects in gun crimes often have their clothes removed for preservation and study some agencies put evidence bags over peoples hands to preserve and guard against transference can this material be transferred more than once yes it can with depreciating levels this is a solid material its not a gas it doesnt dissipate like a gas it is microscopic but solid and it has to be someplace at the end of the day i have conducted numerous studies of this and found that transference can repeat and repeat but in the case of repeated transference wouldnt the amount of material depreciate with each transfer until negligible thats right each new surface will hold less than the prior surface so its all a matter of how much you start with the more you start with the greater the amount that can be transferred i nodded and took a small break by flipping up pages on my pad as if i were looking for something i wanted there to be a clear line between the discussion of theory and the specific case at hand okay doctor i finally said with these theories in mind can you tell us what happened in the elliot case i can tell you and show you dr arslanian said when mr elliot was handcuffed and placed in the back of the fouralpha patrol car he was literally placed in a hotbed of gunshot residue that is where and when the transference took place how so his hands arms and clothing were placed in direct contact with gunshot residue from another case transfer to him would have been inevitable golantz quickly objected saying i had not laid the groundwork for such an answer i told the judge i intended to do that right now and asked permission to set the video equipment up in front of the jury again dr arslanian had taken the video shot by my first witness julio muniz and edited it into one demonstration video i introduced it as a defense exhibit over golantzs failed objection using it as a visual aid i carefully walked my witness through the defenses theory of transference it was a demonstration that took nearly an hour and was one of the most thorough presentations of alternate theory i had ever been involved in we started with eli wymss arrest and his placement in the backseat of the alpha car we then cut to elliot being placed in the same patrol car less than ten hours later the same car and the same seat both mens hands cuffed behind their backs she was stunningly authoritative in her conclusion a man who had fired weapons at least ninetyfour times was placed in that seat she said ninetyfour times he would have literally been reeking of gunshot residue and is it your expert opinion that gunshot residue would have transferred from eli wyms to that car seat i asked most definitely and is it your expert opinion that the gunshot residue on that seat could then have been transferred to the next person who sat there yes it is and is it your expert opinion that this was the origin of the gunshot residue on walter elliots hands and clothes again with his hands behind his back like that he came in direct contact with a transfer surface yes in my expert opinion i do believe that this is how he got the gunshot residue on his hands and clothes i paused again to drive home the experts conclusions if i knew anything about reasonable doubt i knew i had just embedded it in every jurors consciousness whether they would later vote their conscience was another matter fifty it was now time to bring in the big prop to drive dr arslanians testimony home doctor did you draw any other conclusions from your analysis of the gsr evidence that supported the theory of transference you have outlined here yes i did and what was that can i use my mannequin to demonstrate i asked the judge for permission to allow the witness to use a mannequin for demonstration purposes and he granted it without objection from golantz i then stepped through the clerks corral to the hallway leading to the judges chambers i had left dr arslanians mannequin here until it had been ruled admissible i wheeled it out to the center of the proving grounds in front of the jury and the court tv camera i signaled to dr arslanian to come down from the witness stand to make her demonstration the mannequin was a fullbody model with fully manipulating limbs hands and even fingers it was made of white plastic and had several smudges of gray on its face and hands from experiments and demonstrations conducted over the years it was dressed in blue jeans and a dark blue collared shirt beneath a windbreaker with a design on the back commemorating a university of florida national football championship earlier in the year the mannequin was suspended two inches off the ground on a metal brace and wheeled platform i realized i had forgotten something and went over to my rolling bag i quickly pulled out the wooden dummy gun and collapsing pointer i handed them both to dr arslanian and then went back to the lectern okay what do we have here doctor this is manny my demonstration mannequin manny this is the jury there was a bit of laughter and one juror the lawyer even nodded his hello to the dummy mannys a florida gator fan uh he is today sometimes the messenger can obscure the message with some witnesses you want that because their testimony isnt all that helpful but that was not the case with dr arslanian i knew i had been walking a tightrope with her too cute and entertaining on one side solid scientific evidence on the other the proper balance would make her and her information leave the strongest impression on the jury i knew it was now time to get back to serious testimony why do we need manny here doctor because an analysis of the sems tabs collected by the sheriffs forensic expert can show us why the gunshot residue on mr elliot did not come from his firing of a weapon i know the states expert explained these procedures to us last week but i would like you to refresh us what is a sems tab the gsr test is conducted with round tabs or disks that have a peeloff sticky side the tabs are patted on the area to be tested and they collect all the microscopic material on the surface the tab then goes into a scanning electron microscope or sems as we call it through the microscope we see or dont see the three elements we have been talking about here barium antimony and lead okay then do you have a demonstration for us yes i do please explain it to the jury dr arslanian extended her pointer and faced the jury her demonstration had been carefully planned and rehearsed right down to my always referring to her as doctor and her always referring to the states forensic man as mister mr guilfoyle the sheriffs department forensic expert took eight different samples from mr elliots body and clothes each tab was coded so that the location it sampled would be known and charted she used the pointer on the mannequin as she discussed the locations of the samples the mannequin stood with its arms down at its sides tab a was the top of the right hand tab b was the top of the left hand tab c was the right sleeve of mr elliots windbreaker and d was the left sleeve then we have tabs e and f being the right and leftfront panels of the jacket and g and h being the chest and torso portions of the shirt mr elliot wore beneath the open jacket are these the clothes he was wearing that day no they are not these are exact duplicates of what he was wearing right down to the size and manufacturer okay what did you learn from your analysis of the eight tabs ive prepared a chart for the jurors so they can follow along i presented the chart as a defense exhibit golantz had been given a copy of it that morning he now stood and objected saying his late receipt of the chart violated the rules of discovery i told the judge the chart had only been composed the night before after my meetings with dr arslanian on saturday and sunday the judge agreed with the prosecutor saying that the direction of my examination of the witness was obvious and well prepared and that i therefore should have drawn the chart sooner the objection was sustained and dr arslanian now had to wing it on her own it had been a gamble but i didnt regret the move i would rather have my witness talking to the jurors without a net than have had golantz in possession of my strategy in advance of its implementation okay doctor you can still refer to your notes and the chart the jurors just need to follow along what did you learn from your analysis of the eight sems tabs i learned that the levels of gunshot residue on the different tabs greatly differed how so well tabs a and b which came from mr elliots hands were where the highest levels of gsr were found from there we get a steep dropoff in the gsr levels tabs c d e and f with much lower levels and no gsr reading at all on tabs g and h again she used the pointer to illustrate what did that tell you doctor that the gsr on mr elliots hands and clothes did not come from firing a weapon can you illustrate why first comparable readings coming from both hands indicate that the weapon was fired in a twohanded grip she went to the mannequin and raised its arms forming a v by pulling the hands together out front she bent the hands and fingers around the wooden gun but a twohanded grip would also have to result in higher levels of gsr on the sleeves of the jacket in particular and the rest of the clothes as well but the tabs processed by the sheriffs department dont show that am i right youre right they show the opposite while a dropoff from the readings on the hands is expected it is not expected to be of this rate so in your expert opinion what does it mean a compoundtransfer exposure the first exposure occurred when he was placed with his hands and arms behind his back in the fouralpha car after that the material was on his hands and arms and some of it was then transferred for a second time onto the front panels of his jacket during normal hand and arm movement this would have occurred continuously until the clothing was collected from him what about the zero reading on the tabs from the shirt beneath the jacket we discount that because the jacket could have been zipped closed during the commission of the shooting in your expert opinion doctor is there any way that mr elliot could have gotten this pattern of gsr on his hands and clothing by discharging a firearm no there is not thank you doctor arslanian no further questions i returned to my seat and leaned over to whisper into walter elliots ear if we didnt just give them reasonable doubt then i dont know what it is elliot nodded and whispered back to me the best ten thousand dollars ive ever spent i didnt think i had done so badly myself but i let it go golantz asked the judge for the midafternoon break before crossexamination of the witness began and the judge agreed i noticed what i believed to be a higher energy in the verbal buzz of the courtroom after the adjournment shami arslanian had definitely given the defense momentum in fifteen minutes i would see what golantz had in his arsenal for impeaching my witnesss credibility and testimony but i couldnt imagine he had much if he had something he wouldnt have asked for the break he would have gotten up and charged right after her after the jury and the judge had vacated the courtroom and the observers were pushing out into the hallway i sauntered over to the prosecutors table golantz was writing out questions on a legal pad he didnt look up at me what he said the answers no to what question the one you were going to ask about my client taking a plea agreement were not interested golantz smirked youre funny haller so what youve got an impressive witness the trials a long way from over and ive got a french police captain whos going to testify tomorrow that rilz ratted out seven of the most dangerous vindictive men hes ever investigated two of them happened to get out of prison last year and they disappeared nobody knows where they are maybe they were in malibu last spring golantz put his pen down and finally looked up at me yeah i talked to your inspector clouseau yesterday its pretty clear hes saying whatever you want him to say as long as you fly him first class at the end of the depo he pulled out one of those star maps and asked me if i could show him where angelina jolie lives hes one serious witness you came up with i had told captain pepin to cool it with the star map stuff he apparently hadnt listened i needed to change the subject so where are the germans i asked golantz checked behind him as if to make sure johan rilzs family members werent there i told them that they had to be prepared for your strategy of building a defense by shitting all over the memory of their son and brother he said i told them you were going to take johans problems in france five years ago and use them to try to get his killer off i told them that you were going to depict him as a german gigolo who seduced rich clients men and women all over malibu and the west side you know what the father said to me no but youll tell me he said that theyd had enough of american justice and were going back home i tried to retort with a clever and cynical comeback line but i came up empty dont worry golantz said up or down ill call them and tell them the verdict good i left him there and went out into the hallway to look for my client i saw him in the center of a ring of reporters feeling cocky after the success of dr arslanians testimony he was now working the big jury public opinion all this time theyve concentrated on coming after me the real killers been out there running around free a nice concise sound bite he was good i was about to push through the crowd to grab him when dennis wojciechowski intercepted me first come with me he said we walked down the hallway away from the crowd whats up cisco i was wondering where youve been ive been busy i got the report from florida do you want to hear it i had told him what elliot had told me about fronting for the socalled organization elliots story had seemed sincere enough but in the light of day i reminded myself of a simple truism everybody lies and told cisco to see what he could do about confirming it give it to me i said i used a pi in fort lauderdale who ive worked with before tampas on the other side of the state but i wanted to go with a guy i knew and trusted i understand what did he come up with elliots grandfather founded a phosphateshipping operation seventyeight years ago he worked it then elliots father worked it and then elliot himself worked it only he didnt like getting his hands dirty in the phosphate business and he sold it a year after his father died of a heart attack it was a privately owned company so the record of the sale is not public newspaper articles at the time put the sale at about thirtytwo million what about organized crime my guy couldnt find a whiff of it looked to him like it was a good clean operation legally that is elliot told you he was a front and he was sent out here to invest their money he didnt say anything about him selling his own company and bringing the money out here the mans lying to you i nodded okay cisco thanks you need me in court ive got a few things im still working on i heard juror number seven went missing this morning yeah hes in the wind and i dont need you in court okay man ill talk to you he headed off toward the elevators and i was left to stare at my client holding forth with the reporters a slow burn started in me and it gained heat as i waded into the crowd to get to him okay thats all people i said no further comment no further comment i grabbed elliot by the arm pulled him out of the crowd and walked him down the hall i shooed a couple of trailing reporters away until we were finally far enough from all other ears and could speak privately walter what were you doing he was smiling gleefully he made a fist and pumped it into the air sticking it up their asses the prosecutor and the sheriffs all of them yeah well you better wait on that weve still got a ways to go we may have won the day but we havent won the war yet oh come on its in the bag mick she was fucking outstanding in there i mean i want to marry her yeah thats nice but lets see how she does on cross before you buy the ring okay another reporter came up and i told her to take a hike then turned back to my client listen walter we need to talk okay talk i had a private investigator check your story out in florida and i just found out it was bullshit you lied to me walter and i told you never to lie to me elliot shook his head and looked annoyed with me for taking the wind out of his sails to him being caught in the lie was a minor inconvenience an annoyance that i would even bring it up why did you lie to me walter whyd you spin that story he shrugged and looked away from me when he spoke the story i read it in a script once i turned the project down actually but i remembered the story but why im your lawyer you can tell me anything i asked you to tell me the truth and you lied to me why he finally looked me in the eyes i knew i had to light a fire under you what fire what are you talking about come on mickey lets not get he was turning to go back to the courtroom but i grabbed him roughly by the arm no i want to hear what fire did you light everybodys going back in the break is over and we should be in there i gripped him even harder what fire walter youre hurting my arm i relaxed my grip but didnt let go and i didnt take my eyes off his what fire he looked away from me and put an aw shucks grin on his face i finally let go of his arm look he said from the start i needed you to believe i didnt do it it was the only way for me to know you would bring your best game that you would be goddamn relentless i stared at him and saw the smile become a look of pride i told you i could read people mick i knew you needed something to believe in i knew if i was a little bit guilty but not guilty of the big crime then it would give you what you needed it would give you your fire back they say the best actors in hollywood are on the wrong side of the camera at that moment i knew that was true i knew that elliot had killed his wife and her lover and was even proud of it i found my voice and spoke whered you get the gun oh id had it bought it under the table at a flea market back in the seventies i was a big dirty harry fan and i wanted a fortyfour mag i kept it out at the beach house for protection you know a lot of drifters down on the beach what really happened in that house walter he nodded like it was his plan all along to take this moment to tell me what happened was i went out there to confront her and whoever she was fucking every monday like clockwork but when i got there i realized it was rilz shed passed him off in front of me as a faggot had him to dinners and parties and premieres with us and they probably laughed all about it later laughed about me mick it got me mad enraged actually i got the gun out of the cabinet put on rubber gloves from under the sink and i went upstairs you should have seen the look on their faces when they saw that big gun i stared at him for a long moment id had clients confess to me before but usually they were crying wringing their hands battling the demons their crimes had created inside but not walter elliot he was cold to the bone howd you get rid of the gun i hadnt gone out there alone i had somebody with me and they took the gun the gloves and my first set of clothes then walked down the beach got back up to the pch and caught a cab meantime i washed up and changed then i dialed nineoneone who was it that helped you you dont need to know that i nodded not because i agreed with him i nodded because i already knew i had a flash vision of nina albrecht easily unlocking the door to the deck when i couldnt figure it out it showed a familiarity with her bosss bedroom that had struck me the moment i saw it i looked away from my client and down at the floor it had been scuffed by a million people who had trod a million miles for justice i never counted on the transference mick when they said they wanted to do the test i was all for it i thought i was clean and they would see that and it would be the end of it no gun no residue no case he shook his head at such a close call thank god for lawyers like you i jerked my eyes up to his did you kill jerry vincent elliot looked me in the eye and shook his head no i didnt but it was a lucky break because i ended up with a better lawyer i didnt know how to respond i looked down the hall to the courtroom door the deputy was there he waved to me and signaled me into the courtroom the break was over and the judge was ready to start i nodded and held up one finger wait i knew the judge wouldnt take the bench until he was told the lawyers were in place go back in i said to elliot i have to use the restroom elliot calmly walked toward the waiting deputy i quickly stepped into the nearby restroom and went to one of the sinks i splashed cold water on my face spotting my best suit and shirt but not caring at all fiftyone that night i sent patrick to the movies because i wanted the house to myself i wanted no television or conversation i wanted no interruption and no one watching me i called bosch and told him i was in for the night it was not so that i could prepare for what likely would be the last day of the trial i was more than ready for that i had the french police captain primed and ready to deliver another dose of reasonable doubt to the jury and it was not because i now knew that my client was guilty i could count the truly innocent clients id had over the years on one hand guilty people were my specialty but i was feeling bruised because i had been used so well and because i had forgotten the basic rule everybody lies and i was feeling bruised because i knew that i too was guilty i could not stop thinking about rilzs father and brothers about what they had told golantz about their decision to go home they were not waiting to see the verdict if it first meant seeing their dead loved one dragged through the sewers of the american justice system i had spent the good part of twenty years defending guilty and sometimes evil men i had always been able to accept that and deal with it but i didnt feel very good about myself or the work that i would perform the next day it was in these moments that i felt the strongest desire to return to old ways to find that distance again to take the pill for the physical pain that i knew would numb me to the internal pain it was in these moments that i realized that i had my own jury to face and that the coming verdict was guilty that there would be no more cases after this one i went outside to the deck hoping the city could pull me out of the abyss into which i had fallen the night was cool and crisp and clear los angeles spread out in front of me in a carpet of lights each one a verdict on a dream somewhere some people lived the dream and some didnt some people cashed in their dreams a dime on the dollar and some kept them close and as sacred as the night i wasnt sure if i even had a dream left i felt like i only had sins to confess after a while a memory washed over me and somehow i smiled it was one of my last clear memories of my father the greatest lawyer of his time an antique glass ball an heirloom from mexico passed down through my mothers family had been found broken beneath the christmas tree my mother brought me to the living room to view the damage and to give me the chance to confess my guilt by then my father was sick and wasnt going to get better he had moved his work what was left of it home to the study next to the living room i didnt see him through the open door but from that room i heard his voice in a singsong nursery rhyme in a pickle take the nickel i knew what it meant even at five years old i was my fathers son in blood and the law i refused to answer my mothers questions i refused to incriminate myself now i laughed out loud as i looked at the city of dreams i leaned down elbows on the railing and bowed my head i cant do this anymore i whispered to myself the song of the lone ranger suddenly burst from the open door behind me i stepped back inside and looked at the cell phone left on the table with my keys the screen said private number i hesitated knowing exactly how long the song would play before the call went to message at the last moment i took the call is this michael haller the lawyer yes who is this this is los angeles police officer randall morris do you know an individual named elaine ross sir i felt a fist grip my guts lanie yes what happened whats wrong uh sir i have miss ross up here on mulholland drive and she shouldnt be driving in fact she sort of passed out after she handed me your card i closed my eyes for a moment the call seemed to confirm my fears about lanie ross she had fallen back an arrest would put her back into the system and probably cost her another stay in jail and rehab which jail are you taking her to i asked i gotta be honest mr haller im code seven in twenty minutes if i take her down to book her im looking at two more hours and im tapped on my overtime allowance this month i was going to say if you can come get her or send somebody for her im willing to give her the break you know what i mean yes i do thank you officer morris ill come get her if you give me the address you know where the overlook is above fryman canyon yes i do were right here make it quick ill be there in less than fifteen minutes fryman canyon was only a few blocks from the converted garage guesthouse where a friend allowed lanie to live rent free i could get her home walk back to the park and retrieve her car afterward it would take me less than an hour and it would keep lanie out of jail and her car out of the tow lot i left the house and drove laurel canyon up the hill to mulholland when i reached the top i took a left and headed west i lowered the windows and let the cool air in as i felt the first pulls of fatigue from the day grab me i followed the serpentine road for half a mile slowing once when my headlights washed across a scruffy coyote standing vigil on the side of the road my cell phone buzzed as i had been expecting it to what took you so long to call bosch i said by way of a greeting ive been calling but theres no cell coverage in the canyon bosch said is this some kind of test where the hell are you going you called and said you were done for the night i got a call a client of mine got busted on a deuce up here the cops giving her a break if i drive her home from where the fryman canyon overlook im almost there who was the cop randall morris he didnt say whether he was hollywood or north hollywood mulholland was a boundary between the two police divisions morris could work out of either one okay pull over until i can check it out pull over where mulholland was a winding twolane road with no pullover spots except for the overlooks if you pulled over anywhere else you would get plowed into by the next car to come around the bend then slow down im already here the fryman canyon overlook was on the valley side i took a right to turn in and drove right by the sign that said that the parking area was closed after sunset i didnt see lanies car or a police cruiser the parking area was empty i checked my watch it had been only twelve minutes since i had told officer morris that i would be there in less than fifteen damn what bosch asked i hit the heel of my palm on the steering wheel morris hadnt waited hed gone ahead and taken lanie to jail what bosch repeated shes not here i said and neither is the cop he took her to jail i would now have to figure out which station lanie had been transported to and probably spend the rest of the night arranging bail and getting her home id be wrecked in court the next day i put the car in park and got out and looked around the lights of the valley spread out below the precipice for miles and miles bosch i gotta go i have to try to find i saw movement in my peripheral vision to the left i turned and saw a crouching figure coming out of the tall brush next to the parking clearing at first i thought coyote but then i saw that it was a man he was dressed in black and a ski mask was pulled down over his face as he straightened from the crouch i saw that he was raising a gun at me wait a minute i said what is drop the fucking phone i dropped the phone and raised my hands okay okay what is this are you with bosch the man moved quickly toward me and shoved me backwards i stumbled to the ground and then felt him grab the back of my jackets collar get up what is get up now he started pulling me up okay okay im getting up the moment i was on my feet i was shoved forward and crossed through the lights at the front of my car where are we going what is i was shoved again who are you why are you you ask too many questions lawyer he grabbed the back of my collar and shoved me toward the precipice i knew it was almost a sheer dropoff at the edge i was going to end up in somebodys backyard hot tub after a threehundredfoot high dive i tried to dig my heels in and slow my forward momentum but that resulted in an even harder shove i had velocity now and the man in the mask was going to run me off the edge into the blackness of the abyss you cant suddenly there was a shot not from behind me but from the right and from a distance almost simultaneously there was a metal snapping sound from behind me and the man in the mask yelped and fell into the brush to the left then came voices and shouting drop your weapon drop your weapon get on the ground get down on the ground i dove facedown to the dirt at the edge of the precipice and put my hands over my head for protection i heard more yelling and the sound of running i heard engines roaring and vehicles crunching across the gravel when i opened my eyes i saw blue lights flashing in repeated patterns off the dirt and brush blue lights meant cops it meant i was safe counselor a voice said from above me you can get up now i craned my neck to look up it was bosch his shadowed face silhouetted by the stars above him you cut that one pretty close he said fiftytwo the man in the black mask groaned in pain as they cuffed his hands behind his back my hand jesus you assholes my hand is broken i climbed to my feet and saw several men in black windbreakers moving about like ants on a hill some of the plastic raid jackets said lapd on them but most had fbi printed across the back soon a helicopter came overhead and lit the entire parking clearing with a spotlight bosch stepped over to the fbi agents huddling over the man in the mask was he hit he asked there is no wound an agent said the round must have hit the gun but that still hurts like a son of a bitch where is the gun were still looking the agent said it may have gone over the side another agent said if we dont find it tonight we find it in daylight said a third they pulled the man up into a standing position two of the fbi agents stood on either side of him holding him at the elbows lets see who weve got bosch said the ski mask was unceremoniously yanked off and a flashlight was aimed pointblank at the mans face bosch turned and looked back at me juror number seven i said what are you talking about juror number seven from the trial he didnt show up today and the sheriffs department was looking for him bosch turned back to the man i knew was named david mcsweeney hold him right there he then turned and signaled to me to follow him he walked out of the circle of activity and into the parking clearing near my car he stopped and turned back to me but i got my question in first what just happened what just happened was we just saved your life he was going to push you over the side i know that but what happened where did you and everybody else come from you said you would let people go at night after i was tucked in where did all of these cops come from and whats the fbi doing here things were different tonight things happened what things happened what changed we can go over that later lets talk about what weve got here first i dont know what weve got here tell me about juror number seven why didnt he show up today well you should probably ask him that all i can tell you is that this morning the judge called us into chambers and said he got an anonymous letter saying number seven was a phony and he lied about having a record the judge planned to question him but he didnt show up the sheriffs were sent to his house and his job and they brought back a guy who wasnt juror number seven bosch raised his hand like a traffic cop hold on hold on youre not making sense i know you just had a scare but he stopped when one of the men in an lapd jacket came over to address him you want us to call paramedics he says he thinks his hand is broken no just hold him there well have him checked after we book him you sure fuck him the man nodded and went back to the spot where they were holding mcsweeney yeah fuck him i said why did he want to kill you bosch asked i raised my empty hands i dont know maybe because of the story we planted wasnt that the plan to draw him out i think youre holding out on me haller look ive told you what i could tell you all along youre the one holding out and playing games whats the fbi doing here theyve been in it from the start right and you just forgot to tell me i told you what you needed to know well i need to know it all now or my cooperation with you ends now that includes being any sort of witness against that man over there i waited a moment and he said nothing i turned to walk toward my car and bosch put his hand on my arm he smiled in frustration and shook his head come on man cool your jets dont be throwing empty threats around you think its an empty threat why dont we see how empty it is when i start stringing out the federal grand jury subpoena i know is going to come out of this i can argue client confidentiality all the way to the supreme court i bet that will only take about two years and your newfound pals over in the bureau are going to wish you had just come clean with me when you had the chance bosch thought a moment and pulled me by the arm all right tough guy come over here we walked to a spot in the parking area even further from the law enforcement ant hill bosch started to talk the bureau contacted me a few days after the vincent murder and said that he had been a person of interest to them thats all a person of interest he was one of the lawyers whose names came up in their look at the state courts nothing specific just based on rumors things he had supposedly told clients he could get done connections he claimed to have that sort of thing theyd drawn up a list of lawyers they heard might be bent and vincent was on it they invited him in as a cooperating witness and he declined they were increasing the pressure on him when he got hit so they tell you all of this and you join forces isnt that wonderful thanks for telling me like i said you didnt need to know a man in an fbi jacket crossed the parking area behind bosch and his face was momentarily lit from above he looked familiar to me but i couldnt place him but then i imagined a mustache on him hey theres the asshole you sent after me the other night i said loud enough for the passing agent to hear hes lucky i didnt put a bullet in his face at the door bosch put his hands on my chest and pushed me back a few steps calm down counselor if it werent for the bureau i wouldnt have had the manpower to keep the watch on you and right now you could be lying down there at the bottom of the mountain i pushed his hands off me but settled down my anger dissipated as i accepted the reality of what bosch had just said and the reality that i had been used as a pawn from the beginning by my client and now by bosch and the fbi bosch took the moment to signal over another agent who was standing nearby watching this is agent armstead hes been running the bureaus side of things and hes got some questions for you why not i said nobody answers mine i might as well answer yours armstead was a young cleancut agent with a precision military haircut mr haller well get to your questions as soon as we can he said right now we have a fluid situation here and your cooperation will be greatly appreciated is juror number seven the man vincent paid the bribe to i looked at bosch with a who is this guy expression man how would i know that i wasnt part of this thing you want an answer to that go ask him dont worry we will be asking him a lot of questions what were you doing up here mr haller i told you people i told bosch i got a call from somebody who said he was a cop he said he had a woman i know personally up here and she was under the influence and that i could come up and drive her home and save her the trouble of getting booked on a deuce we checked that name you gave me on the phone bosch said there is one randall morris in the department hes on gang detail in south bureau i nodded yeah well i think its pretty clear now that it was a fake call but he knew my friends name and he had my cell it seemed convincing at the time all right how did he get the womans name armstead asked good question i had a relationship with her a platonic relationship but i havent talked to her in almost a month then how would he know about her man youre asking me shit i dont know go ask mcsweeney i immediately realized i had slipped up i wouldnt know that name unless i had been investigating juror number seven bosch looked at me curiously i didnt know if he realized the jury was supposed to be anonymous even to the lawyers on the case before he could come up with a question i was saved by someone yelling from the brush where i had almost been pushed over the side ive got the gun bosch pointed a finger at my chest stay right here i watched bosch and armstead trot over and join a few of the others as they studied the found weapon under a flashlight beam bosch didnt touch the weapon but bent down into the light to examine it closely the william tell overture started to play behind me i turned around and saw my phone lying on the gravel its tiny square screen glowing like a beacon i went over and picked it up it was cisco and i took the call cisco i gotta call you back make it quick ive got some good shit for you youre going to want to know this i closed the phone and watched as bosch finished his study of the weapon and then stepped over to mcsweeney he leaned close to him and whispered something into his ear he didnt wait for a response he just turned and walked back toward me i could tell even in the dim moonlight that he was excited armstead was following behind him the guns a beretta bobcat like we were looking for on vincent he said if the ballistics match then weve got that guy locked in a box ill make sure you get a commendation from city hall good ill frame it put this together for me haller and you can start with him being the one who killed vincent why did he want to kill you too i dont know the bribe armstead asked is he the one who got the money same answer i gave you five minutes ago i dont know but it makes sense doesnt it how did he know your friends name on the phone i dont know that either then what good are you bosch asked it was a good question and the immediate answer didnt sit well with me look detective i dont bother man why dont you just get in your car and get the fuck out of here well take it from here he turned and started walking away and armstead followed i hesitated and then called out to bosch i waved him back he said something to the fbi agent and came back to me alone no bullshit he said impatiently i dont have the time okay this is the thing i said i think he was going to make it look like i jumped bosch considered this and then shook his head suicide who would believe that youve got the case of the decade man youre hot youre on tv and youve got a kid to worry about suicide wouldnt sell i nodded yes it would he looked at me and said nothing waiting for me to explain im a recovering addict bosch you know anything about that why dont you tell me the story would go that i couldnt take the pressure of the big case and all the attention and i either had or was about to relapse so i jumped instead of going back to that its not an uncommon thing bosch they call it the fast out and it makes me think that what i pointed across the clearing toward juror number seven that he and whoever he was doing this for knew a lot about me they did a deep background they came up with my addiction and rehab and lanies name then they came up with a solid plan for getting rid of me because they couldnt just shoot down another lawyer without bringing down massive scrutiny on what it is theyve got going if i went down as a suicide thered be a lot less pressure yeah but why did they need to get rid of you i guess they think i know too much do you before i could answer mcsweeney started yelling from the other side of the clearing hey over there with the lawyer i want to make a deal i can give you some big people man i want to make a deal bosch waited to see if there was more but that was it my tip i said go over there and strike while the irons hot before he remembers hes entitled to a lawyer bosch nodded thanks coach he said but i think i know what im doing he started to head across the clearing hey bosch wait i called you owe me something before you go over there bosch stopped and signaled to armstead to go to mcsweeney he then came back to me what do i owe you one answer tonight i called you and told you i was in for the night you were supposed to cut the surveillance down to one car but this is the whole enchilada up here what changed your mind you havent heard have you heard what you get to sleep late tomorrow counselor theres no trial anymore why not because your clients dead somebody probably our friend over there who wants to make a deal took elliot and his girlfriend out tonight when they came home from dinner his electric gate wouldnt open and when he got out to push it open somebody came up and put a bullet in the back of his head then he hit the woman in the car i took a half step back in shock i knew the gate bosch was talking about i had been to elliots mansion in beverly hills just the other night and as far as the girlfriend went i also thought i knew who that would be id had nina albrecht figured for that position ever since elliot told me hed had help on the day of the murders in malibu bosch didnt let the stunned look on my face keep him from continuing i got tipped from a friend in the medical examiners office and figured that somebody might be out there cleaning the slate tonight i figured i ought to call the team back and see what happens at your place lucky for you i did i stared right through bosch when i answered yeah i said lucky for me fiftythree there was no longer a trial but i went to court on tuesday morning to see the case through to its official end i took my place next to the empty seat walter elliot had occupied for the past two weeks the news photographers who had been allowed access to the courtroom seemed to like that empty chair they took a lot of photos of it jeffrey golantz sat across the aisle he was the luckiest prosecutor on earth he had left court one day thinking he was facing a careerhobbling loss and came back the next day with his perfect record intact his upward trajectory in the das office and city politics was safe for now he had nothing to say to me as we sat and waited for the judge but there was a lot of talk in the gallery people were buzzing with news of the murders of walter elliot and nina albrecht no one made mention of the attempt on my life and the events at the fryman canyon overlook for the moment that was all secret once mcsweeney told bosch and armstead that he wanted to deal the investigators had asked me to keep quiet so they could move slowly and carefully with their cooperating suspect i was happy to cooperate with that myself to a point judge stanton took the bench promptly at nine his eyes were puffy and he looked like hed had very little sleep i wondered if he knew as many details of what had transpired the night before as i did the jury was brought in and i studied their faces if any of them knew what had happened they werent showing it i noticed several of them check out the empty seat beside me as they took their own ladies and gentlemen good morning the judge said at this time i am going to discharge you from service in this trial as i am sure you can see mr elliot is not in his seat at the defense table this is because the defendant in this trial was the victim of a homicide last night half of the jurors mouths dropped open in unison the others expressed their surprise with their eyes a low murmur of excited voices went through the courtroom and then a slow and deliberate clapping began from behind the prosecution table i turned to see mitzi elliots mother applauding the news of elliots demise the judge brought his gavel down harshly just as golantz jumped from his seat and rushed to her grabbing her hands gently and stopping her from continuing i saw tears rolling down her cheeks there will be no demonstrations from the gallery the judge said harshly i dont care who you are or what connection you might have to the case everyone in here will show respect to the court or i will have you removed golantz returned to his seat but the tears continued to flow from the mother of one of the victims i know that to all of you this is rather shocking news stanton told the jurors be assured that the authorities are investigating the matter thoroughly and hopefully will soon bring the individual or individuals responsible to justice i am sure you will learn all about it when you read the paper or watch the news as you are now free to do as far as today goes i want to thank you for your service i know you all were very attentive to the presentation of the prosecution and defense cases and i hope your time here was a positive experience you are free now to go back to the deliberation room to gather your things and go home you are excused we stood one last time for the jury and i watched them file through the doorway to the deliberation room after they were gone the judge thanked golantz and me for our professional demeanor during trial thanked his staff and quickly adjourned court i hadnt bothered to unpack any files from my bag so i stood motionless for the longest time after the judge left the courtroom my reverie wasnt broken until golantz approached me with his hand out without thinking i reached out and shook it no hard feelings on anything mickey youre a damn good lawyer was i thought yeah i said no hard feelings you going to hang around and talk to jurors see which way they were leaning he asked i shook my head no im not interested me neither take care of yourself he clapped me on the shoulder and pushed out through the gate i was sure there would be a throng of media out in the hall waiting and hed tell them that in some strange way he felt that justice had been served live by the gun die by the gun or words to that effect id leave the media for him instead i gave him a good lead and then followed him out the reporters were already surrounding him and i was able to hug the wall and escape notice all except for jack mcevoy from the times he spotted me and started trailing he caught me as i got to the stairwell entrance hey mick i glanced at him but didnt stop walking i knew from experience not to if one member of the media downed you the rest of the pride would catch up and pile on i didnt want to be devoured i hit the stairwell door and started down no comment he stayed with me stride for stride im not writing about the trial im covering the new murders i thought maybe you and i could have the same deal again you know trade informa no deal jack and no comment catch you later i put my hand out and stopped him on the first landing i left him there went down two more landings and then out into the hallway i walked down to judge holders courtroom and entered michaela gill was in the clerks pod and i asked if i could see the judge for a few minutes but i dont have you down for an appointment she said i know that michaela but i think the judge will want to see me is she back there can you tell her i only want ten minutes tell her its about the vincent files the clerk picked up the phone punched a button and gave the judge my request then she hung up and told me i could go right back to her chambers thank you the judge was behind her desk with her halfglasses on a pen poised in her hand as if i had interrupted her in the middle of signing an order well mr haller she said its certainly been an eventful day have a seat i sat in the familiar chair in front of her thank you for seeing me judge what can i do for you she asked the question without looking at me she started scribbling signatures on a series of documents i just wanted you to know i will be resigning as counsel on the rest of the vincent cases she put the pen down and looked over her glasses at me what im resigning i came back too soon or probably should never have come back at all but im finished thats absurd your defense of mr elliot has been the talk of this courthouse i watched parts of it on television you clearly were schooling mr golantz and i dont think there were many observers who would have bet against an acquittal i waved the compliments away anyway judge it doesnt matter its not really why im here she took her glasses off and put them down on the desk she looked hesitant but then asked the next question then why are you here because judge i wanted you to know that i know and soon enough everybody else will as well i am sure i dont know what you are talking about what do you know mr haller i know that you are for sale and that you tried to have me killed she barked out a laugh but there was no mirth in her eyes only daggers is this some kind of joke no its no joke then mr haller i suggest you calm down and compose yourself if you go around this courthouse making these kinds of outlandish accusations then there will be consequences for you severe consequences maybe you are right you are feeling the stress of coming back too soon from rehab i smiled and i could tell by her face that she immediately realized her mistake slipped up there didnt you judge howd you know i was in rehab better yet how did juror number seven know how to lure me away from home last night the answer is you had me backgrounded you set me up and sent mcsweeney out to kill me i dont know what you are talking about and i dont know this man you say tried to kill you well i think he knows you and the last time i saw him he was about to start playing lets make a deal with the federal government it hit her like a punch in the gut i knew revealing it to her wasnt going to endear me to bosch or armstead but i didnt care neither of them was the guy who had been used like a pawn and had nearly taken the high dive off mulholland i was that guy and that entitled me to confront the person i knew was behind it i put it together without having to make a deal with anybody i said my investigator traced mcsweeney nine years ago he was arrested for an adw and who was his attorney mitch lester your husband the next year he was popped again for fraud and once again it was mitch lester on the case theres the connection it makes a nice little triangle doesnt it you have access to and control of the jury pool and the selection process you can get into the computers and it was you who planted the sleeper on my jury jerry vincent paid you but then he changed his mind after the fbi came sniffing around you couldnt run the risk that jerry might get jammed up with the fbi and try to deal a judge to them so you sent mcsweeney then when it all turned to shit yesterday you decided to clean house you sent mcsweeney juror number seven after elliot and albrecht and then me how am i doing judge i miss anything so far i said the word judge like it had the same meaning as garbage she stood up this is insane you have no evidence connecting me to anyone but my husband and making the leap from one of his clients to me is completely absurd youre right judge i dont have evidence but were not in court here this is just you and me i just have my gut instincts and they tell me that this all comes back to you i want you to leave now but the feds on the other hand they have mcsweeney i could see it strike fear in her eyes guess you havent heard from him have you yeah i dont think theyre letting him make any calls while they debrief him you better hope he doesnt have any of that evidence because if he puts you in that triangle then youll be trading your black robe for an orange jumpsuit get out or i will call courthouse security and have you arrested she pointed toward the door i calmly and slowly stood up sure ill go and you know something i may never practice law again in this courthouse but i promise you that ill come back to watch you prosecuted you and your husband count on it the judge stared at me her arm still extended toward the door and i saw the anger in her eyes slowly change to fear her arm drooped a little and then she let it drop all the way i left her standing there i took the stairs all the way down because i didnt want to get on a crowded elevator eleven flights down at the bottom i pushed through the glass doors and left the courthouse i pulled my phone and called patrick and told him to pull the car around then i called bosch i decided to light a fire under you and the bureau i told him what do you mean what did you do i didnt want to wait around while the bureau took its usual year and a half to make a case sometimes justice cant wait detective what did you do haller i just had a conversation with judge holder yes i figured it out without mcsweeneys help i told her the feds had mcsweeney and he was cooperating if i were you and the bureau id hurry the fuck up with your case and in the meantime keep tabs on her she doesnt seem like a runner to me but you never know have a good day i closed the phone before he could protest my actions i didnt care he had used me the whole time it felt good to turn the tables on him make him and the fbi do the dancing at the end of the string part six the last verdict fiftyfour bosch knocked on my door early thursday morning i hadnt combed my hair yet but i was dressed he on the other hand looked like he had pulled an allnighter i wake you he asked i shook my head i have to get my kid ready for school thats right wednesday nights and every other weekend whats up detective ive got a couple of questions and i thought you might be interested in knowing where things stand on everything sure lets sit out here i dont want her hearing this i patted down my hair as i walked toward the table i dont want to sit bosch said i dont have a lot of time he turned to the railing and leaned his elbows down on it i changed directions and did the same thing right next to him i dont like to sit when im out here either i have the same sort of view at my place he said only its on the other side i guess that makes us flip sides of the same mountain he turned his eyes from the view to me for a moment something like that he said so whats happening i thought youd be too angry with me to ever tell me what was going on truth is i think the bureau moves too slowly myself they didnt like what you did very much but i didnt mind it got things rolling bosch straightened up and leaned back on the railing the view of the city behind him so then whats happening i asked the grand jury came back with indictments last night holder lester carlin mcsweeney and a woman whos a supervisor in the jury office and was the one who gave them access to the computers were taking them all down simultaneously this morning so keep it under your hat until we have everybody hooked up it was nice that he trusted me enough to tell me before the arrests i thought it might be even nicer to go down to the ccb and watch them take holder out of there in handcuffs is it solid i asked holder is a judge you know you better have it nailed down its solid mcsweeney gave it all up weve got phone records money transfers he even taped her husband during some of the conversations i nodded it sounded like the typical federal package one reason i never took on federal cases when i was practicing was that when the big g made a case it usually stayed made victories for the defense were rare most times you just got flattened like roadkill i didnt know carlin was hooked up in this i said hes right at the center he goes way back with the judge and she used him to approach vincent in the first place vincent used him to deliver the money then when vincent started getting cold feet because the fbi was sniffing around carlin got wind of it and told the judge she thought the best thing to do was get rid of the weak link she and her husband sent mcsweeney to take care of vincent got wind of it how wren williams yeah we think he got close to her to keep tabs on vincent we dont think she knew what was going on shes not smart enough i nodded and thought about how all the pieces fit together what about mcsweeney he just did what he was told the judge tells him to hit a guy and he just does it first of all mcsweeney was a con man before he was a killer so i dont for a minute think were getting the whole truth out of him but he says the judge can be very persuasive the way she explained it to him either vincent went down or they all went down there was no choice besides she also promised to increase his cut after he went through with the trial and tipped the case i nodded so what are the indictments conspiracy to commit murder corruption this is only the first wave there will be more down the road this wasnt the first time mcsweeney told us hed been on four juries in the last seven years two acquittals and two hangers three different courthouses i whistled as i thought of some of the big cases that had ended in shocking acquittals or hung juries in recent years robert blake bosch smiled and shook his head i wish he said oj too but they werent in business back then for that one we just lost those cases on our own doesnt matter this is going to be huge biggest one ive ever had he folded his arms and glanced over his shoulder at the view youve got the sunset strip and ive got universal he said i heard the door open and looked back to see hayley peeking out dad whats up hay is everything all right everythings fine hayley this is detective bosch hes a policeman hello hayley bosch said i think it was the only time i had ever seen him put a real smile on his face hi my daughter said hayley did you eat your cereal i asked yes okay then you can watch tv until its time to go she disappeared inside and closed the door i checked my watch she still had ten minutes before we had to leave shes a cute kid bosch said i nodded i gotta ask you a question he said you started this whole thing tumbling didnt you you sent that anonymous letter to the judge i thought for a moment before answering if i say yes am i going to become a witness i had not been called to the federal grand jury after all with mcsweeney giving everything up they apparently didnt need me and i didnt want to change that now no its just for me bosch said i just want to know if you did the right thing i considered not telling him but ultimately i wanted him to know yeah that was me i wanted to get mcsweeney off the jury and then win the case fair and square i didnt expect judge stanton to take the letter and consult other judges about it he called up the chief judge and asked her advice i nodded its gotta be what happened i said he calls her not knowing she was behind the whole thing she then tipped mcsweeney and told him not to show up for court then used him to try to clean up the mess bosch nodded as though i was confirming things he already knew and you were part of the mess she mustve figured you sent the letter to judge stanton you knew too much and had to go just like vincent it wasnt about the story we planted it was about you tipping judge stanton i shook my head my own actions had almost brought about my own demise in the form of a high dive off mulholland i guess i was pretty stupid i dont know about that youre still standing after today none of them will be theres that what kind of deal did mcsweeney cut no death penalty and consideration if everybody goes down then hell probably get fifteen in the federal system that means hell still do thirteen whos his lawyer hes got two dan daly and roger mills i nodded he was in good hands i thought about what walter elliot had told me that the guiltier you were the more lawyers you needed pretty good deal for three murders i said one murder bosch corrected what do you mean vincent elliot and albrecht he didnt kill elliot and albrecht those two didnt match up what are you talking about he killed them and then he tried to kill me bosch shook his head he did try to kill you but he didnt kill elliot and albrecht it was a different weapon on top of that it didnt make sense why would he ambush them and then try to make you look like a suicide it doesnt connect mcsweeney is clean on elliot and albrecht i was stunned silent for a long moment for the last three days i had believed that the man who killed elliot and albrecht was the same man who had tried to kill me and that he was safely locked in the hands of the authorities now bosch was telling me there was a second killer somewhere out there does beverly hills have any ideas i finally asked oh yeah theyre pretty sure they know who did it but theyll never make a case the hits kept coming one surprise after another who the family you mean like the family with a capital f organized crime bosch smiled and shook his head the family of johan rilz they took care of it how do they know that lands and grooves the bullets they dug out of the two victims were ninemillimeter parabellums brass jacket and casing and manufactured in germany bhpd took the bullet profile and matched them to a cninetysix mauser also manufactured in germany he paused to see if i had any questions when i didnt he continued over at bhpd theyre thinking its almost like somebody was sending a message a message from germany you got it i thought of golantz telling the rilz family how i was going to drag johan through the mud for a week they had left rather than witness that and elliot was killed before it could happen parabellum i said you know your latin detective didnt go to law school whats it mean prepare for war its part of a saying if you want peace prepare for war what will happen with the investigation now bosch shrugged i know a couple of beverly hills detectives wholl get a nice trip to germany out of it they fly their people business class with the seats that fold down into beds theyll go through the motions and the due diligence but if the hit was done right nothing will ever happen howd they get the gun over here it could be done through canada or der fedex if it absolutely positively has to be there on time i didnt smile i was thinking about elliot and the equilibrium of justice somehow bosch seemed to know what i was thinking remember what you said to me when you told me you had told judge holder you knew she was behind all of this i shrugged what did i say you said sometimes justice cant wait and and you were right sometimes it doesnt wait in that trial you had the momentum and elliot looked like he was going to walk so somebody decided not to wait for justice and he delivered his own verdict back when i was riding patrol you know what we called a killing that came down to simple street justice what the brass verdict i nodded i understood we were both silent for a long moment anyway thats all i know bosch finally said i gotta go and get ready to put people in jail its going to be a good day bosch pushed his weight off the railing ready to go its funny you coming here today i said last night i decided i was going to ask you something the next time i saw you yeah whats that i thought about it for a moment and then nodded it was the right thing to do flip sides of the same mountain do you know you look a lot like your father he said nothing he just stared at me for a moment then nodded once and turned to the railing he cast his gaze out at the city when did you put that together he asked technically last night when i was looking at old photos and scrapbooks with my daughter but i think on some level ive known it for a long time we were looking at photos of my father they kept reminding me of somebody and then i realized it was you once i saw it it seemed obvious i just didnt see it at first i walked to the railing and looked out at the city with him most of what i know about him came from books i said a lot of different cases a lot of different women but there are a few memories that arent in books and are just mine i remember coming into the office he had set up at home when he started to get sick there was a painting framed on the wall a print actually but back then i thought it was a real painting the garden of earthly delights weird scary stuff for a little kid the memory i have is of him holding me on his lap and making me look at the painting and telling me that it wasnt scary that it was beautiful he tried to teach me to say the painters name hieronymus bosch rhymes with anonymous he told me only back then i dont think i could say anonymous either i wasnt seeing the city out there i was seeing the memory i was quiet for a while after that it was my half brothers turn eventually he leaned his elbows down on the railing and spoke i remember that house he said i visited him once introduced myself he was on the bed he was dying what did you say to him i just told him id made it through thats all there wasnt really anything else to say like right now i thought what was there to say somehow my thoughts jumped to my own shattered family i had little contact with the siblings i knew i had let alone bosch and then there was my daughter whom i saw only eight days a month it seemed like the most important things in life were the easiest to break apart youve known all these years i finally said why didnt you ever make contact i have another half brother and three half sisters theyre yours too you know bosch didnt say anything at first then he gave an answer i guessed he had been telling himself for a few decades i dont know i guess i didnt want to rock anybodys boat most of the time people dont like surprises not like this for a moment i wondered what my life wouldve been like if i had known about bosch maybe i wouldve been a cop instead of a lawyer who knows im quitting you know i wasnt sure why i had said it quitting what my job the law you could say the brass verdict was my last verdict i quit once it didnt take i came back well see bosch glanced at me and then put his eyes back out on the city it was a beautiful day with lowflying clouds and a coldair front that had compressed the smog layer to a thin amber band on the horizon the sun had just crested the mountains to the east and was throwing light out on the pacific we could see all the way out to catalina i came to the hospital that time you got shot he said i wasnt sure why i saw it on the news and they said it was a gut shot and i knew those could go either way i thought maybe if they needed blood or something i could i figured we matched you know anyway there were all these reporters and cameras i ended up leaving i smiled and then i started to laugh i couldnt help it whats so funny you a cop volunteering to give blood to a defense attorney i dont think they wouldve let you back into the clubhouse if they knew about that now bosch smiled and nodded i guess i didnt think about that and just like that both our smiles disappeared and the awkwardness of being strangers returned eventually bosch checked his watch the warrant teams are meeting in twenty minutes i gotta roll okay ill see you around counselor ill see you around detective he went down the steps and i stayed where i was i heard his car start up then pull away and go down the hill fiftyfive i stayed out on the deck after that and looked out at the city as the light moved across it many different thoughts filtered through my head and flew off into the sky like the clouds up there remotely beautiful and untouchable distant i was left feeling that i would never see bosch again that he would have his side of the mountain and i would have mine and thats all there would be after a while i heard the door open and steps on the deck i felt my daughters presence by my side and i put my hand on her shoulder what are you doing dad just looking are you all right im fine what did that policeman want just to talk hes a friend of mine we were both silent for a moment before she moved on i wish mom had stayed with us last night she said i looked down at her and squeezed the back of her neck one thing at a time hay i said we got her to have pancakes with us last night didnt we she thought about it and gave me the nod she agreed pancakes were a start im going to be late if we dont go she said one more time and ill get a conduct slip i nodded too bad the suns just about to hit the ocean come on dad that happens every day i nodded somewhere at least i went in for the keys then locked up and we went down the steps to the garage by the time i backed the lincoln out and had it pointed down the hill i could see the sun was spinning gold on the pacific acknowledgments in no particular order the author wishes to thank the following individuals for contributions to the research and writing
