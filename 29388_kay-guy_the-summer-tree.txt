five wardstones last creation and the finest of ginserat one went south across saeren to cathal one over the mountains to eridu another remained with revor and the dalrei on the plain the fourth wardstone colan carried home conarys son now high king in paras derval the last stone was accepted though in bitterness of heart by the broken remnant of the lios alfar scarcely a quarter of those who had come to war with ratermaine went back to the shadowland from the parley at the foot of the mountain they carried the stone and the body of their kingmost hated by the dark for their name was light from that day on few men could ever claim to have seen the lios except perhaps as moving shadows at the edge of a wood when twilight found a farmer or a carter walking home for a time it was rumoured among the common folk that every sevenyear a messenger would come by unseen ways to hold converse with the high king in paras derval but as the years swept past such tales dwindled as they tend to into the mist of halfremembered history ages went by in a storm of years except in houses of learning even conary was just a name and ratermaine and forgotten too was revors ride through daniloth on the night of the red sunset it had become a song for drunken tavern nights no more true or less than any other such songs no more bright for there were newer deeds to extol younger heroes to parade through city streets and palace corridors to be toasted in their turn by village tavern fires alliances shifted fresh wars were fought to salve old wounds glittering triumphs assuaged past defeats high king succeeded high king some by descent and others by brandished sword and through it all through the petty wars and the great ones the strong leaders and weak the long green years of peace when the roads were safe and the harvest rich through it all the mountain slumberedfor the rituals of the wardstones though all else changed were preserved the stones were watched the naal fires tended and there never came the terrible warning of ginserats stones turning from blue to red and under the great mountain rangat cloudshouldered in the windblasted north a figure writhed in chains eaten by hate to the edge of madness but knowing full well that the wardstones would give warning if he stretched his powers to break free still he could wait being outside of time outside of death he could brood on his revenge and his memoriesfor he remembered everything he could turn the names of his enemies over and over in his mind as once he had played with the bloodclotted necklace of ratermaine in a taloned hand but above all he could wait wait as the cycles of men turned like the wheel of stars as the very stars shifted pattern under the press of years there would come a time when the watch slackened when one of the five guardians would falter then could he in darkest secrecy exert his strength to summon aid and there would come a day when rakoth maugrim would be free in fionavar and a thousand years passed under the sun and stars of the first of all the worlds part isilvercloak chapter in the spaces of calm almost lost in what followed the question of why tended to surface why them there was an easy answer that had to do with ysanne beside her lake but that didnt really address the deepest question kimberly whitehaired would say when asked that she could sense a glimmered pattern when she looked back but one need not be a seer to use hindsight on the warp and weft of the tapestry and kim in any event was a special case with only the professional faculties still in session the quadrangles and shaded paths of the university of toronto campus would normally have been deserted by the beginning of may particularly on a friday evening that the largest of the open spaces was not served to vindicate the judgement of the organizers of the second international celtic conference in adapting their timing to suit certain prominent speakers the conference administrators had run the risk that a good portion of their potential audience would have left for the summer by the time they got under way at the brightly lit entrance to convocation hall the besieged security guards might have wished this to be the case an astonishing crowd of students and academics bustling like a rock audience with preconcert excitement had gathered to hear the man for whom principally the late starting date had been arranged lorenzo marcus was speaking and chairing a panel that night in the first public appearance ever for the reclusive genius and it was going to be standing room only in the august precincts of the domed auditorium the guards searched out forbidden tape recorders and waved ticketholders through with expressions benevolent or inimical as their natures dictated bathed in the bright spill of light and pressed by the milling crowd they did not see the dark figure that crouched in the shadows of the porch just beyond the farthest circle of the lights for a moment the hidden creature observed the crowd then it turned swiftly and quite silently and slipped around the side of the building there where the darkness was almost complete it looked once over its shoulder and then with unnatural agility began to climb hand over hand up the outer wall of convocation hall in a very little while the creature which had neither ticket nor tape recorder had come to rest beside a window set high in the dome above the hall looking down past the glittering chandeliers it could see the audience and the stage brightly lit and far below even at this height and through the heavy glass the electric murmur of sound in the hall could be heard the creature clinging to the arched window allowed a smile of lean pleasure to flit across its features had any of the people in the highest gallery turned just then to admire the windows of the dome they might have seen it a dark shape against the night but no one had any reason to look up and no one did on the outside of the dome the creature moved closer against the window pane and composed itself to wait there was a good chance it would kill later that night the prospect greatly facilitated patience and brought a certain anticipatory satisfaction for it had been bred for such a purpose and most creatures are pleased to do what their nature dictates dave martyniuk stood like a tall tree in the midst of the crowd that was swirling like leaves through the lobby he was looking for his brother and he was increasingly uncomfortable it didnt make him feel any better when he saw the stylish figure of kevin laine coming through the door with paul schafer and two women dave was in the process of turning away he didnt feel like being patronized just thenwhen he realized that laine had seen him martyniuk what are you doing here hello laine my brothers on the panel vince martyniuk of course kevin said hes a bright man one in every family dave cracked somewhat sourly he saw paul schafer give a crooked grin kevin laine laughed at least but im being rude you know paul this is jennifer lowell and kim ford my favorite doctor hi dave said forced to shift his program to shake hands this is dave martyniuk people hes the center on our basketball team daves in thirdyear law here in that order kim ford teased brushing a lock of brown hair back from her eyes dave was trying to think of a response when there was a movement in the crowd around them dave sorry im late it was finally vincent i have to get backstage fast i may not be able to talk to you till tomorrow pleased to meet youto kim though he hadnt been introduced vince bustled off briefcase high front of him like the prow of a ship cleaving through the crowd your brother kim ford asked somewhat unnecessarily yeah dave was feeling sour again kevin laine he saw had been accosted by some other friends and was evidently being witty if he headed back to the law school dave thought he could still do a good three hours on evidence before the library closed are you alone here kim ford asked yeah but i why dont you sit with us then dave a little surprised at himself followed kim into the hall her the dwarf said and pointed directly across the auditorium to where kimberly ford was entering with a tall broadshouldered man shes the one the greybearded man beside him nodded slowly they were standing half hidden in the wings of the stage watching the audience pour in i think so he said worriedly i need five though matt but only one for the circle she came with three and there is a fourth with them now you have your five i have five the other man said mine i dont know if this were just for metrans jubilee stupidity it wouldnt matter but loren i know the dwarfs voice was surprisingly gentle but she is the one we were told of my friend if i could help you with your dreams you think me foolish i know better than that the tall man turned away his sharp gaze went across the room to where the five people his companion had indicated were sitting one by one he focused on them then his eyes locked on paul schafers face sitting between jennifer and dave paul was glancing around the hall only half listening to the chairmans fulsome introduction of the evenings keynote speaker when he was hit by the probe the light and sound in the room faded completely he felt a great darkness there was a forest a corridor of whispering trees shrouded in mist starlight in the space above the trees somehow he knew that the moon was about to rise and when it rose he was in it the hall was gone there was no wind in the darkness but still the trees were whispering and it was more than just a sound the immersion was complete and within some hidden recess paul confronted the terrible haunted eyes of a dog or a wolf then the vision fragmented images whipping past chaotic myriad too fast to hold except for one a tall man standing in darkness and upon his head the great curved antlers of a stag then it broke sharp wildly disorienting his eyes scarcely able to focus swept across the room until they found a tall greybearded man on the side of the stage a man who spoke briefly to someone next to him and then walked smiling to the lectern amid thunderous applause set it up matt the greybearded man had said we will take them if we can he was good kim you were right jennifer lowell said they were standing by their seats waiting for the exiting crowd to thin kim ford was flushed with excitement wasnt he she asked them all rhetorically what a terrific speaker your brother was quite good i thought paul schafer said to dave quietly surprised dave grunted noncommittally then remembered something you feeling okay paul looked blank a moment then grimaced you too im fine i just needed a days rest im more or less over the mono dave looking at him wasnt so sure none of his business though if schafer wanted to kill himself playing basketball hed played a football game with broken ribs once you survived kim was talking again id love to meet him you know she looked wistfully at the knot of autographseekers surrounding marcus so would i actually said paul softly kevin shot him a questioning look dave kim went on your brother couldnt get us into that reception could he dave was beginning the obvious reply when a deep voice rode in over him excuse me please for intruding a figure little more than four feet tall with a patch over one eye had come up beside them my name he said in an accent dave couldnt place is matt sören i am dr marcuss secretary i could not help but overhear the young ladys remark may i tell you a secret he paused dr marcus has no desire at all to attend the planned reception with all respect he said turning to dave to your very learned brother jennifer saw kevin laine begin to turn himself on performance time she thought and smiled to herself laughing kevin took charge you want us to spirit him away the dwarf blinked then a basso chuckle reverberated in his chest you are quick my friend yes indeed i think he would enjoy that very much kevin looked at paul schafer a plot jennifer whispered hatch us a plot gentlemen easy enough kevin said after some quick reflection as of this moment kims his niece he wants to see her family before functions he waited for pauls approval good matt sören said and very simple will you come with me then to fetch your ah uncle of course i will kim laughed havent seen him in ages she walked off with the dwarf towards the tangle of people around lorenzo marcus at the front of the hall well dave said i think ill be moving along oh martyniuk kevin exploded dont be such a legal drip this guys worldfamous hes a legend you can study for evidence tomorrow look come to my office in the afternoon and ill dig up my old exam notes for you dave froze kevin laine he knew all too well had won the award in evidence two years before along with an armful of other prizes jennifer watching him hesitate felt an impulse of sympathy there was a lot eating this guy she thought and kevins manner didnt help it was so hard for some people to get past the flashiness to see what was underneath and against her will for jennifer had her own defences she found herself remembering what lovemaking used to do to him hey people i want you to meet someone kims voice knifed into her thoughts she had her arm looped possessively through that of the tall lecturer who beamed benignly down upon her this is my uncle lorenzo uncle my roommate jennifer kevin and paul and this is dave marcuss dark eyes flashed i am he said more pleased to meet you than you could know you have rescued me from an exceptionally dreary evening will you join us for a drink at our hotel were at the park plaza matt and i with pleasure sir kevin said he waited for a beat and well try hard not to be dreary marcus lifted an eyebrow a cluster of academics watched with intense frustration in their eyes as the seven of them swept out of the hall together and into the cool cloudless night and another pair of eyes watched as well from the deep shadows under the porch pillars of convocation hall eyes that reflected the light and did not blink it was a short walk and a pleasant one across the wide central green of the campus then along the dark winding path known as philosophers walk that twisted with gentle slopes on either side behind the law school the faculty of music and the massive edifice of the royal ontario museum where the dinosaur bones preserved their long silence it was a route that paul schafer had been carefully avoiding for the better part of the past year he slowed a little to detach himself from the others up ahead in the shadows kevin kim and lorenzo marcus were weaving a baroque fantasy of improbable entanglements between the clans ford and marcus with a few of kevins remoter russian ancestors thrown into the mix by marriage jennifer on marcuss left arm was urging them on with her laughter while dave martyniuk loped silently along on the grass beside the walkway looking a little out of place matt sören quietly companionable had slowed his pace to fall into stride with paul schafer however withdrawing could feel the conversation and laughter sliding into background the sensation was a familiar one of late and after a while it was as if he were walking alone which may have been why partway along the path he became aware of something to which the others were oblivious it pulled him sharply out of reverie and he walked a short distance in a different sort of silence before turning to the dwarf beside him is there any reason he asked very softly why the two of you would be followed matt sören broke stride only momentarily he took a deep breath where he asked in a voice equally low behind us to the left slope of the hill is there a reason there may be would you keep walking please and say nothing for nowit may be nothing when paul hesitated the dwarf gripped his arm please he repeated schafer after a moment nodded and quickened his pace to catch up to the group now several yards ahead the mood by then was hilarious and very loud only paul listening for it heard the sharp abruptly truncated cry from the darkness behind them he blinked but no expression crossed his face matt sören rejoined them just as they reached the end of the shadowed walkway and came out to the noise and bright lights of bloor street ahead lay the huge stone pile of the old park plaza hotel before they crossed the road he placed a hand again on schafers arm thank you said the dwarf well said lorenzo marcus as they settled into chairs in his sixteenthfloor suite why dont you all tell me about yourselves yourselves he repeated raising an admonitory finger at grinning kevin why dont you start marcus went on turning to kim what are you studying kim acquiesced with some grace well im just finishing my interning year at hold it kim it was paul ignoring a fierce look from the dwarf he levelled his eyes on their host sorry dr marcus ive got some questions of my own and i need answers now or were all going home paul what the no kev listen a minute they were all staring at schafers pale intense features something very strange is happening here i want to know he said to marcus why you were so anxious to cut us out of that crowd why you sent your friend to set it up i want to know what you did to me in the auditorium and i really want to know why we were followed on the way over here followed the shock registering on lorenzo marcuss face was manifestly unfeigned thats right paul said and i want to know what it was too matt marcus asked in a whisper the dwarf fixed paul schafer with a long stare paul met the glance our priorities he said cant be the same in this after a moment matt sören nodded and turned to marcus friends from home he said it seems there are those who want to know exactly what you are doing when you travel friends lorenzo marcus asked i speak loosely very loosely there was a silence marcus leaned back in his armchair stroking the grey beard he closed his eyes this isnt how i would have chosen to begin he said at length but it may be for the best after all he turned to paul i owe you an apology earlier this evening i subjected you to something we call a searching it doesnt always work some have defences against it and with others such as yourself it seems strange things can happen what took place between us unsettled me as well pauls eyes more blue than grey in the lamplight were astonishingly unsurprised ill need to talk about what we saw he said to lorenzo marcus but the thing is why did you do it in the first place and so they were there kevin leaning forward every sense sharpened saw lorenzo marcus draw a deep breath and he had a flash image in that instant of his own life poised on the edge of an abyss because lorenzo marcus said you were quite right paul schaferi didnt just want to escape a boring reception tonight i need you the five of you were not five daves heavy voice crashed in ive got nothing to do with these people you are too quick to renounce friendship dave martyniuk marcus snapped back but he went on more gently after a frozen instant it doesnt matter hereand to make you see why i must try to explain which is harder than it would have been once he hesitated hand at his beard again you arent lorenzo marcus are you paul said very quietly in the stillness the tall man turned to him again why do you say that paul shrugged am i right that searching truly was a mistake yes said their host you are right dave was looking from paul to the speaker with hostile incredulity although i am marcus in a wayas much as anyone is there is no one else but marcus is not who i am and who are you it was kim who asked and was answered in a voice suddenly deep as a spell my name is loren men call me silvercloak i am a mage my friend is matt sören who was once king of the dwarves we come from paras derval where ailell reigns in a world that is not your own in the stone silence that followed this kevin laine who had chased an elusive image down all the nights of his life felt an astonishing turbulence rising in his heart there was a power woven into the old mans voice and that as much as the words reached through to him almighty god he whispered paul how did you know wait a second you believe this it was dave martyniuk all bristling belligerence ive never heard anything so crackbrained in my life he put his drink down and was halfway to the door in two long strides dave please it stopped him dave turned slowly in the middle of the room to face jennifer lowell dont go she pleaded he said he needed us her eyes he noticed for the first time were green he shook his head why do you care didnt you hear it she replied didnt you feel anything he wasnt about to tell these people what he had or hadnt heard in the old mans voice but before he could make that clear kevin laine spoke dave we can afford to hear him out if theres danger or its really wild we can run away after he heard the goad in the words and the implication he didnt rise to it though never turning from jennifer he walked over and sat beside her on the couch didnt even look at kevin laine there was a silence and she was the one who broke it now dr marcus or whatever you prefer to be called well listen but please explain because im frightened now it is not known whether loren silvercloak had a vision then of what the future held for jennifer but he bestowed upon her a look as tender as he could give from a nature stormtossed but still more giving perhaps than anything else and then he began the tale there are many worlds he said caught in the loops and whorls of time seldom do they intersect and so for the most part they are unknown to each other only in fionavar the prime creation which all the others imperfectly reflect is the lore gathered and preserved that tells of how to bridge the worldsand even there the years have not dealt kindly with ancient wisdom we have made the crossing before matt and i but always with difficulty for much is lost even in fionavar how haw do you cross it was kevin it is easiest to call it magic though there is more involved than spells your magic kevin continued i am a mage yes loren said the crossing was mine and so too if you come will be the return this is ridiculous martyniuk exploded again this time he would not look at jennifer magic crossings show me something talk is cheap and i dont believe a word of this loren stared coldly at dave kim seeing it caught her breath but then the severe face creased in a sudden smile the eyes improbably danced youre right he said it is much the simplest way look then there was silence in the room for almost ten seconds kevin saw out of the corner of his eye that the dwarf too had gone very still whatll it be he thought they saw a castle where dave martyniuk had stood moments before there appeared battlements and towers a garden a central courtyard an open square before the walls and on the very highest rampart a banner somehow blowing in a nonexistent breeze and on the banner kevin saw a crescent moon above a spreading tree paras derval loren said softly gazing at his own artifice with an expression almost wistful in brennin high kingdom of fionavar mark the flags in the great square before the palace they are there for the coming celebration because the eighth day past the full of the moon this month will end the fifth decade of ailells reign and us kimberlys voice was parchmentthin where do we fit in a wry smile softened the lines of lorens face not heroically im afraid though there is pleasure in this for you i hope a great deal is being done to celebrate the anniversary there has been a long spring drought in brennin and it has been deemed politic to give the people something to cheer about and i daresay there is reason for it at any rate metran first mage to ailell has decided that the gift to him and to the people from the council of the mages will be to bring five people from another worldone for each decade of the reignto join us for the festival fortnight kevin laine laughed aloud red indians to the court of king james with a gesture almost casual loren dissolved the apparition in the middle of the room im afraid theres some truth to that metrans ideas he is first of my council but i daresay i need not always agree with him youre here paul said i wanted to try another crossing in any case loren replied quickly it has been a long time since last i was in your world as lorenzo marcus have i got this straight kim asked you want us to cross with you somehow to your world and then youll bring us back basically yes you will be with us for two weeks perhaps but when we return i will have you back in this room within a few hours of when we departed well said kevin with a sly grin that should get you martyniuk for sure just think dave two extra weeks to study for evidence dave flushed bright red as the room broke up in a release of tension im in loren silvercloak said kevin laine as they quieted and so became the first he managed a grin ive always wanted to wear warpaint to court whens takeoff loren looked at him steadily tomorrow early evening if we are to time it properly i will not ask you to decide now think for the rest of tonight and tomorrow if you will come with me be here by late afternoon what about you what if we dont come kims forehead was creased with the vertical line that always showed when she was under stress loren seemed disconcerted by the question if that happens i fail it has happened before dont worry about me niece it was remarkable what a smile did to his face shall we leave it at that he went on as kims eyes still registered an unresolved concern if you decide to come be here tomorrow i will be waiting one thing it was paul again im sorry to keep asking the unpleasant questions but we still dont know what that thing was on philosophers walk dave had forgotten jennifer hadnt they both looked at loren at length he answered speaking directly to paul there is magic in fionavar i have shown you something of it even here there are also creatures of good and evil who coexist with humankind your own world too was once like this though it has been drifting from the pattern for a long time now the legends of which i spoke in the auditorium tonight are echoes scarcely understood of mornings when man did not walk alone and other beings both friend and foe moved in the forests and the hills he paused what followed us was one of the svart alfar i think am i right matt the dwarf nodded without speaking the svarts loren went on are a malicious race and have done great evil in their time there are few of them left this one braver than most it would seem somehow followed matt and me through on our crossing they are ugly creatures and sometimes dangerous though usually only in numbers this one i suspect is dead he looked to matt again once more the dwarf nodded from where he stood by the door i wish you hadnt told me that jennifer said the mages eyes deepset were again curiously tender as he looked at her im sorry you have been frightened this evening will you accept my assurance that unsettling as they may sound the svarts need not be of concern to you he paused his gaze holding hers i would not have you do anything that goes against your nature i have extended to you an invitation no more you may find it easier to decide after leaving us he rose to his feet another kind of power a man accustomed to command kevin thought a few moments later as the five of them found themselves outside the door of the room they made their way down the hall to the elevator matt sören closed the door behind them how bad is it loren asked sharply the dwarf grimaced not very i was careless a knife the mage was quickly helping his friend to remove the scaleddown jacket he wore i wish teeth actually loren cursed in sudden anger when the jacket finally slipped off to reveal the dark heavily clotted blood staining the shirt on the dwarfs left shoulder he began gently tearing the cloth away from around the wound swearing under his breath the whole time it isnt so bad loren be easy and you must admit i was clever to take the jacket off before going after him very clever yes which is just as well because my own stupidity of late is terrifying me how in the name of conall cernach could i let a svart alfar come through with us he left the room with swift strides and returned a moment later with towels soaked in hot water the dwarf endured the cleansing of his wound in silence when the dried blood was washed away the teeth marks could be seen purple and very deep loren examined it closely this is bad my friend are you strong enough to help me heal it we could have metran or teyrnon do it tomorrow but id rather not wait go ahead matt closed his eyes the mage paused a moment then carefully placed a hand above the wound he spoke a word softly then another and beneath his long fingers the swelling on the dwarfs shoulder began slowly to recede when he finished though the face of matt sören was bathed in a sheen of perspiration with his good arm matt reached for a towel and wiped his forehead all right loren asked just fine just fine the mage mimicked angrily it would help you know if you didnt always play the silent hero how am i supposed to know when youre really hurting if you always give me the same answer the dwarf fixed loren with his one dark eye and there was a trace of amusement in his face you arent he said you arent supposed to know loren made a gesture of ultimate exasperation and left the room again returning with a shirt of his own which he began cutting into strips loren dont blame yourself for letting the svart come through you couldnt have done anything dont be a fool i should have been aware of its presence as soon as it tried to come within the circle im very seldom foolish my friend the dwarfs tone was mild you couldnt have known because it was wearing this when i killed it sören reached into his right trouser pocket and pulled out an object that he held up in his palm it was a bracelet of delicate silver workmanship and set within it was a gem green like an emerald a vellin stone loren silvercloak whispered in dismay so it would have been shielded from me matt someone gave a vellin to a svart alfar so it would seem the dwarf agreed the mage was silent he attended to the bandaging of matts shoulder with quick skilled hands when that was finished he walked still wordless to the window he opened it and a latenight breeze fluttered the white curtains loren gazed down at the few cars moving along the street far below these five people he said at last still looking down what am i taking them back to do i have any right the dwarf didnt answer after a moment loren spoke again almost to himself i left so much out you did did i do wrong perhaps but you are seldom wrong in these things nor is ysanne if you feel they are needed but i dont know what for i dont know how it is only her dreams my premonitions then trust yourself trust your premonitions the girl is a hook and the other one paul he is another thing i dont know what but something youve been troubled for a long time my friend and i dont think needlessly the mage turned from the window to look at the other man im afraid you may be right matt who would have us followed here someone who wants you to fail in this which should tell us something loren nodded abstractedly but who he went on looking at the greenstoned bracelet that the dwarf still held who would ever give such a treasure into the hands of a svart alfar the dwarf looked down at the stone for a very long time as well before answering someone who wants you dead matt sören said chapter the girls shared a silent taxi west to the duplex they rented beside high park jennifer partly because she knew her roommate very well decided that she wouldnt be the first to bring up what had happened that night what they both seemed to have heard under the surface of the old mans words but she was dealing with complex emotions of her own as they turned down parkside drive and she watched the dark shadows of the park slide past on their right when they got out of the cab the latenight breeze seemed unseasonably chill she looked across the road for a moment at the softly rustling trees inside they had a conversation about choices about doing or not doing things that either one of them could have predicted dave martyniuk refused kims offer to share a cab and walked the mile west to his flat on palmerston he walked quickly the athletes stride overlaid by anger and tension you are too quick to renounce friendship the old man had said dave scowled moving faster what did he know about it the telephone began ringing as he unlocked the door of his basement apartment yeah he caught it on the sixth ring you are pleased with yourself i am sure jesus dad what is it this time dont swear at me it would kill you wouldnt it to do something that would bring us pleasure i dont know what the hell youre talking about such language such respect dad i dont have time for this any more yes hide from me you went tonight as vincents guest to this lecture and then you went off after with the man he most wanted to speak with and you couldnt even think of asking your brother dave took a careful breath his reflexive anger giving way to the old sorrow dad please believe meit didnt happen that way marcus went with these people i know because he didnt feel like talking to the academics like vince i just tagged along you just tagged along his father mimicked in his heavy ukrainian accent you are a liar your jealousy is so much that you dave hung up and unplugged the telephone with a fierce and bitter pain he stared at it watching how over and over again it didnt ring they said goodnight to the girls and watched martyniuk stalk off into the darkness coffee time amigo kevin laine said brightly much to talk about we have yes paul hesitated and in the moment of that hesitation kevins mood shattered like glass not tonight i think ive got some things to do kev the hurt in kevin laine moved to the surface threatened to break through okay was all he said though good night maybe ill see you tomorrow and he turned abruptly and jogged across bloor against the light to where hed parked his car he drove home a little too fast through the quiet streets it was after one oclock when he pulled into the driveway so he entered the house as silently as he could sliding the bolt gently home i am awake kevin it is all right what are you doing up its very late abba he used the hebrew word for father as he always did sol laine in pajamas and robe at the kitchen table raised a quizzical eyebrow as kevin walked in i need permission from my son to stay up late who elses kevin dropped into one of the other chairs a good answer his father approved would you like some tea sounds good how was this talk sol asked as he attended to the boiling kettle fine very good actually we had a drink with the speaker afterwards kevin briefly considered telling his father about what had happened but only briefly father and son had a long habit of protecting each other and kevin knew that this was something sol would be unable to handle he wished it were otherwise it would have been good he thought a little bitterly to have someone to talk to jennifer is well and her friend kevins bitterness broke in a wave of love for the old man whod raised him alone sol had never been able to reconcile his orthodoxy with his sons relationship with catholic jenniferand had resented himself for not being able to so through their short time together and after kevins father had treated jen like a jewel of great worth shes fine says hello kims fine too but paul isnt kevin blinked oh abba youre too sharp for me why do you say that because if he was you would have gone out with him afterwards the way you always used to you would still be out i would be drinking my tea alone all alone the twinkle in his eyes belied the lugubrious sentiments kevin laughed aloud then stopped when he heard the bitter note creeping in no hes not all right but i seem to be the only one who questions it i think im becoming a pain in the ass to him i hate it sometimes his father said filling the glass cups in their russianstyle metal holders a friend has to be that no one else seems to think theres anything wrong though they just talk about how it takes time it does take time kevin kevin made an impatient gesture i know it does im not that stupid but i know him too i know him very well and hes theres something else here and i dont know what it is his father didnt speak for a moment how long is it now he asked finally ten months kevin replied flatly last summer ach sol shook his heavy stillhandsome head such a terrible thing kevin leaned forward abba hes been closing himself off to everyone i dont im afraid for what might happen and i cant seem to get through are you trying too hard sol laine asked gently his son slumped back in his chair maybe he said and the old man could see the effort the answer took but it hurts abba hes all twisted up sol laine who had married late had lost his wife to cancer when kevin their only child was five years old he looked now at his handsome fair son with a twisting in his own heart kevin he said you will have to learnand for you it will be hardthat sometimes you cant do anything sometimes you simply cant kevin finished his tea he kissed his father on the forehead and went up to bed in the grip of a sadness that was new to him and a sense of yearning that was not he woke once in the night a few hours before kimberly would reaching for a note pad he kept by the bed he scribbled a line and fell back into sleep we are the total of our longings he had written but kevin was a songwriter not a poet and he never did use it paul schafer walked home as well that night north up avenue road and two blocks over at bernard his pace was slower than daves though and you could not have told his thoughts or mood from his movements his hands were in his pockets and two or three times where the streetlights thinned he looked up at the ragged pattern of cloud that now hid and now revealed the moon only at his doorway did his face show an expressionand this was only a transitory irresolution as of someone weighing sleep against a walk around the block perhaps schafer went in though and unlocked his groundfloor apartment turning on a lamp in the living room he poured himself a drink and carried the glass to a deep armchair again the pale face under the dark shock of hair was expressionless and again when his mouth and eyes did move a long time later it was to register only a kind of indecision wiped away quickly this tune by the tightening jaw he leaned sideways then to the stereo and tape deck turned them on and inserted a cassette in part because it was very late but only in part he adjusted the machine and put on the headphones then he turned out the only light in the room it was a private tape one he had made himself a year ago on it as he sat there motionless in the dark sounds from the summer before took shape a graduation recital in the faculty of musics edward johnson building by a girl named rachel kincaid a girl with dark hair like his own and dark eyes like no one else in this world and paul schafer who believed one should be able to endure anything and who believed this of himself most of all listened as long as he could and failed again when the second movement began he shuddered through an indrawn breath and stabbed the machine to silence it seemed that there were still things one could not do so one did everything else as well as the one possibly could and found new things to try to will oneself to master and always one realized at the kernel and heart of things that the ends of the earth would not be far enough away which was why despite knowing very well that there were things they had not been told paul schafer was glad bleakly glad to be going farther than the ends of the earth on the morrow and the moon moving then to shine unobstructed through the window lit the room enough to reveal the serenity of his face and in the place beyond the ends of earth in fionavar which lay waiting for them like a lover like a dream another moon larger than our own rose to light the changing of the wardstone guard in the palace of paras derval the priestess appointed came with the new guards tended and banked the naal flame set before the stone and withdrew yawning to her narrow bed and the stone ginserats stone set in its high obsidian pillar carved with a relief of conary before the mountain shone still as it had a thousand years radiantly blue chapter towards dawn a bank of clouds settled low over the city kimberly ford stirred surfaced almost to wakefulness then slipped back down into a light sleep and a dream unlike any shed known before there was a place of massive jumbled stones a wind was blowing over wide grasslands it was dusk she almost knew the place was so close to naming it that her inability tasted bitter in her mouth the wind made a chill keening sound as it blew between the stones she had come to find one who was needed but she knew he was not there a ring was on her finger with a stone that gleamed a dull red in the twilight and this was her power and her burden both the gathered stones demanded an invocation from her the wind threatened to tear it from her mouth she knew what she was there to say and was brokenhearted beyond all grief shed ever known at the price her speaking would exact from the man shed come to summon in the dream she opened her mouth to say the words she woke then and was very still a long time when she rose it was to move to the window where she drew the curtain back the clouds were breaking up venus rising in the east before the sun shone silverwhite and dazzling like hope the ring on her finger in the dream had shone as well deep red and masterful like mars the dwarf dropped into a crouch hands loosely clasped in front of him they were all there kevin with his guitar dave martyniuk defiantly clutching the promised evidence notes loren remained out of sight in the bedroom preparing the dwarf had said and now without preamble matt sören said more ailell reins in brennin the high kingdom fifty years now as you have heard he is very old much reduced metran heads the council of the mages and gorlaes the chancellor is first of all advisers you will meet them both ailell had two sons only very late in life the name of the elder matt hesitated is not to be spoken the younger is diarmuid now heir to the throne too many mysteries kevin laine thought he was nervous and angry with himself for that beside him kim was concentrating fiercely a single vertical line furrowing her forehead south of us the dwarf continued the saeren flows through its ravine and beyond the river is cathal the garden country there has been war with shalhassans people in my lifetime the river is patrolled on both sides north of brennin is the plain where the dalrei dwell the riders the tribes follow the eltor herds as the seasons change you are unlikely to see any of the dalrei they dislike walls and cities kims frown kevin saw had deepened over the mountains eastward the land grows wilder and very beautiful that country is called eridu now though it had another name long ago it breeds a people once brutal though quiet of late little is known of doings in eridu for the mountains are a stern barrier matt sörens voice roughened among the eriduns dwell the dwarves unseen for the most part in their chambers and halls under the mountains of banir lok and banir tal beside calor diman the crystal lake a place more fair than any in all the worlds kevin had questions again but withheld them he could see there was an old pain at work here north and west of brennin is pendaran wood it runs for miles to the north between the plain and the sea beyond the forest is daniloth the shadowland the dwarf stopped as abruptly as hed begun and turned to adjust his pack and gear there was a silence matt it was kimberly the dwarf turned what about the mountain north of the plain matt made a swift convulsive gesture with one hand and stared at the slight brownhaired girl so you were right my friend from the very first kevin wheeled in the doorway leading from the bedroom stood the tall figure of loren in a long robe of shifting silver hues what have you seen the mage asked kim very gently she too had twisted to face him the grey eyes were strangeinward and troubled she shook her head as if to clear it nothing really just that i do see a mountain and loren pressed and she closed her eyes a hunger inside somehow i cant explain it it is written said loren after a moment in our books of wisdom that in each of the worlds there are those who have dreams or visionsone sage called them memoriesof fionavar which is the first matt who has gifts of his own named you as one such yesterday he paused kim didnt move it is known loren went on that to bring people back in a crossing such a person must be found to stand at the heart of the circle so thats why you wanted us because of kim it was paul schafer the first words hed spoken since arriving yes said the mage simply damn tried kevin softly and i thought it was my charm no one laughed kim stared at loren as if seeking answers in the lines of his face or the shifting patterns of his robe finally she asked and the mountain lorens voice was almost matteroffact one thousand years ago someone was imprisoned there at the deepest root of rangat which is the mountain you have seen kim nodded hesitated someone evil the word came awkwardly to her tongue they might have been alone in the room yes said the mage one thousand years ago he nodded again in this moment of misdirection of deceit when everything stood in danger of falling apart his eyes were more calm and compassionate than they had ever been with one hand kim tugged at a strand of brown hair she drew a breath all right she said all right then how do i help you cross dave was struggling to absorb all this when things began to move too quickly he found himself part of a circle around kim and the mage he linked hands with jennifer and matt on either side the dwarf seemed to be concentrating very hard his legs were wide apart braced then loren began to speak words in a tongue dave didnt know his voice growing in power and resonance and was interrupted by paul schafer lorenis the person under that mountain dead the mage gazed at the slim figure whod asked the question he feared you too he whispered then no he answered telling the truth no he isnt and resumed speaking in his strange language dave wrestled with the refusal to seem afraid that had in large part brought him here and with the genuine panic that was building within him paul had nodded once at lorens answer but that was all the mages words had become a complex rising chant the aura of power began to shimmer visibly in the room a lowpitched humming sound began hey dave burst out i need a promise ill be back there was no reply matt sörens eyes were closed now his grip on daves wrist was firm the shimmer in the air increased and then the humming began to rise in volume no dave shouted again no i need a promise and on the words he violently pulled his hands free from those of jennifer and the dwarf kimberly ford screamed and in mat moment the room began to dissolve on them kevin frozen disbelieving saw kim reach out then wildly to clutch daves arm and take jens free hand even as he heard the cry torn from her throat then the cold of the crossing and the darkness of the space between worlds came down and kevin saw nothing more in his mind though whether for an instant or an age he thought he heard the sound of mocking laughter there was a taste in his mouth like ashes of grief dave he thought oh martyniuk what have you done part iirachels song chapter it was night when they came through in a small dimly lit room somewhere high up there were two chairs benches and an unlit fire an intricately patterned carpet on the stone floor along one wall stretched a tapestry but the room was too darkly shadowed despite flickering wall torches for them to make it out the windows were open so silvercloak youve come back a reedy voice from the doorway said without warmth kevin looked over quickly to see a bearded man leaning casually on a spear loren ignored him matt he said sharply are you all right the dwarf visibly shaken by the crossing managed a terse nod he had slumped into one of the heavy chairs and there were beads of perspiration on his forehead kevin turned to check the others all seemed to be fine a little dazed but fine except except that dave martyniuk wasn t there oh god he began loren and was stopped in midsentence by a beseeching look from the mage paul schafer standing beside kevin caught it as well and kevin saw him walk quietly over to the two women schafer spoke softly to them and then nodded once to loren at which point the mage finally turned to the guard who was still leaning indolently on his weapon is it the evening before loren asked why yes the man replied but shouldnt a great mage know that without the asking kevin saw lorens eyes flicker in the torchlight go he said go tell the king i have returned its late hell be sleeping he will want to know this go now the guard moved with deliberate insolent slowness as he turned though there was a sudden thunk and a thrown knife quivered in the panelling of the doorway inches from his head i know you vart a deep voice said as the man whipped around pale even by torchlight i have marked you you will do what you have been told and quickly and you will speak to rank with deferenceor my next dagger will not rest in wood matt sören was on his feet again and danger bristled through him like a presence there was a tense silence then i am sorry my lord mage the lateness of the hour my fatigue welcome home my lord i go to do your will the guard raised his spear in a formal salute then spun again sharply this time and left the room matt walked forward to retrieve his dagger he remained in the doorway watching now said kevin laine where is he loren had dropped into the chair the dwarf had vacated i am not sure he said forgive me but i truly dont know but you have to know jennifer exclaimed he pulled away just as i was closing the circle i was too far under the poweri couldnt come out to see his path i do not even know if he came with us i do said kim ford simply he came i had him all the way i was holding him loren rose abruptly you did brightly woven this means he has crossedhe is in fionavar somewhere and if that is so he will be found our friends will begin to search immediately your friends kevin asked not that creep in the doorway i hope loren shook his head not him no he is gorlaess tooland here i must ask of you another thing he hesitated there are factions in this court and a struggle taking place for ailell is old now gorlaes would like me gone for many reasons and failing that would take joy in discrediting me before the king so if dave is missing kevin murmured exactly i think only metran knows i went for fiveand i never promised him so many in any case dave will be found i promise you that can i ask you to keep his presence a secret for this time jennifer lowell had moved to the open window while the others talked a hot night and very dry below and to her left she could make out the lights of a town lying almost directly adjacent to the walled enclosure of what she assumed to be paras derval there were fields in front of her and beyond them rose the thick close trees of a forest there was no breeze she looked upward apprehensive and was desperately relieved to find she knew the stars for though the slender hand on the window ledge was steady and the cool green eyes gave little away she had been badly thrown by daves disappearance and the sudden dagger in a life shaped of careful decisions the only impulsive act of significance had been the beginning of her relationship with kevin laine one night two years ago now improbably she found herself in a place where only the fact that she could see the summer triangle overhead gave her any kind of security she shook her head and not lacking in a sense of irony smiled very slightly to herself paul schafer was speaking answering the mage it seems he said softlythey were all speaking quietlythat if you brought us here then were already a part of your group or well be seen that way anyhow ill keep my mouth shut kevin was nodding and then kim jennifer turned from the window i wont say anything she said but please find dave soon because i really am going to be very frightened if you dont company matt growled from the doorway ailell already it cant be said loren matt listened for a moment longer no not the king i think and his dark bearded face twisted into its version of a smile listen for yourself the dwarf said a second later kevin heard it too the unsteady caroling of someone coming down the hallway towards them someone far gone in drink those who rode that night with revor did a deed to last forever the weaver cut from brighter cloth those who rode through daniloth you fat buffoon another voice snarled rather more controlled shut up or youll have him disinherited for bringing you in here the sardonic laughter of a third person could be heard as the footsteps made their tenuous way up the corridor song the aggrieved troubadour said is a gift to men from the immortal gods not the way you sing tegid his critic snapped loren was suppressing a smile kim saw kevin snorted with laughter shipyard lout the one called tegid retorted not quietly you betray your ignorance those who were there will never forget my singing that night in the great hall at seresh i had them weeping i had i was there you clown i was sitting beside you and ive still got stains on my green doublet from when they started throwing fruit at you poltroons what can you expect in seresh but the battle after the brave fight in that same hall even though wounded i rallied our wounded hilarity and exasperation vied for mastery in the other speakers voice a tomato in the eye is hardly hold it coll the third man spoke for the first tune and in the room loren and matt exchanged a glance theres a guard just ahead the light controlling voice went on ill deal with him wait for a minute after i go in then take tegid to the last room on the left and keep him quiet or by the river blood of lisen i will be disinherited matt stepped quickly into the hallway good even prince he raised his dagger in salute a vein of blue glittered in the light there is no guard here now he has gone to bring your fathersilvercloak has just returned with four people who have crossed you had best move tegid to a safe place very fast sören welcome home said the prince walking forward coll take him quickly quickly tegid expostulated great tegid moves at his own pace he deigns not to hide from minions and vassals he confronts them with naked steel of rhoden and the prodigious armor of his wrath he tegid the prince said with extreme softness move now and sharply or i will have you stuffed through a window and dropped to the courtyard prodigiously there was a silence yes my lord the reply came surprisingly meek as they moved past the doorway kim caught a glimpse of an enormously fat man and another muscled but seeming small beside him before a third figure appeared in the entranceway haloed by the wall torch in the corridor diarmuid she had time to remember they call him diarmuid the younger son and then she found herself staring all his life diarmuid dan ailell had been doing that to people supporting himself with a beringed hand upon the wall he leaned lazily in the doorway and accepted lorens bow surveying them all kim after a moment was able to isolate some of the qualities the lean graceful build high cheekbones in an overrefined face a wide expressive mouth registering languid amusement just then the jewelled hands and the eyes the cynical mocking expression in the very blue eyes of the kings heir in the high kingdom it was hard to judge his age close to her own she guessed thank you silvercloak he said a timely return and a timely warning it is folly to defy your father for tegid loren began it is a matter far too trivial diarmuid laughed advising me again already a crossing hasnt changed you loren there are reasons there are reasonshe murmured vaguely i doubt it the mage replied other than perversity and south keep wine good reasons both diarmuid agreed flashing a smile who he said in a very different tone have you brought for metran to parade tomorrow loren seemingly used to this made the introductions gravely kevin named first bowed formally paul followed suit keeping his eyes on those of the prince kim merely nodded and jennifer a peach exclaimed diarmuid dan ailell silvercloak you have brought me a peach to nibble he moved forward then the jewellery at wrist and throat catching the torchlight and taking jennifers hand bowed very low and kissed it jennifer lowell not predisposed by character or environment to suffer this sort of thing gladly let him have it as he straightened are you always this rude she asked and there was no warmth in the voice at all or in the green eyes it stopped him for an instant only almost always he answered affably i do have some redeeming qualities though i can never remember what theyre supposed to be ill wager he went on in a swift change of mood that loren is shaking his head behind my back right now in tragic disapproval which happened to be true ah well then he continued turning to look at the frowning mage i suppose im expected to apologize now he grinned at lorens sober agreement then turned once more to jennifer i am sorry sweetling drink and a long ride this afternoon you are quite extravagantly beautiful and have probably dealt with worse intrusions before indulge me it was prettily done jennifer somewhat bemused found she could only manage a nod which succeeded in provoking yet another sublimely mocking smile she flushed angry again loren cut in sharply you are behaving badly diarmuid and you know it enough the prince snapped dont push me loren the two men exchanged a tense look when diarmuid spoke again though it was in a milder tone i did apologize loren do me some justice after a moment the mage nodded fair enough he said we dont have time to quarrel in any case i need your help two things a svart attacked us in the world from which i brought these people it followed matt and me and it was wearing a vellin stone and the other thing diarmuid was instantly attentive drunk as he was there was a fifth person who crossed with us we lost him he is in fionavarbut i dont know where i need him found and i would much prefer that gorlaes not know of him obviously how do you know he is here kimberly was our hook she says she had him diarmuid turned to fix kim with an appraising stare tossing her hair back she met the look and the expression in her own eyes was more than a little hostile turning without reaction the prince walked to the window and looked out in silence the waning moon had risenoverly large but jennifer also gazing out did not notice that it hasnt rained while you were gone by the way said diarmuid we have other things to talk about matt he continued crisply coll is in the last room on the left make sure tegid is asleep then brief him a description of the fifth person tell coll ill speak with him later wordlessly matt slipped from the room no rain at all loren asked softly none and the crops diarmuid raised an eyebrow without bothering to answer lorens face seemed molded of fatigue and concern and the king he asked almost reluctantly diarmuid paused this time before answering not well he wanders sometimes he was apparently talking to my mother last night during dinner in the great hall impressive wouldnt you say five years past her death loren shook his head he has been doing that for some time though not in public before is there is there word of your brother none the answer this tune was very swift a strained silence followed his name is not to be spoken kevin remembered and looking at the prince wondered there was a gathering diarmuid said seven nights past at the full of the moon a secret one they invoked the goddess as dana and there was blood no the mage made a violent gesture that is going too far who summoned it diarmuids wide mouth crooked slightly herself of course he said jaelle jaelle loren began pacing the room she will cause trouble i know it of course she will she means to and my father is too old to deal with it can you see ailell on the summer tree now and there was a new thing in the light voicea deep coruscating bitterness i never could diarmuid the mages tone had suddenly gone soft he stopped his pacing beside the prince whatever power lies in the tree is outside my province and jaelles too though she would deny it you have heard my views on this blood magic i fear takes more than it gives back so we sit diarmuid snarled stiff anger cracking through we sit while the wheat burns up in fields all over brennin fine doings for a wouldbe royal house my lord princethe use of the title was careful admonitorythis is no ordinary season and you do not need me to tell you that something unknown is at work and not even jaelles midnight invocations will redress the balance until we touch what lies beneath diarmuid sank into one of the chairs gazing blankly at the dim tapestry opposite the window the wall torches had almost burnt out leaving the room webbed with lighter and darker shadows leaning against the window ledge jennifer thought that she could almost see the threads of tension snaking through the darkened spaces what am i doing here she thought not for the last time a movement on the other side of the chamber caught her eye and she turned to see paul schafer looking at her he gave a small unexpectedly reassuring smile and i dont understand him either she thought somewhat despairingly diarmuid was on his feet again by then seemingly unable to be still for any length of time loren he said you know the king wont come tonight did you he must i wont let gorlaes have someones here paul said sharply he had quietly ended up in marts post by the door five men three with swords diarmuid i know you havent seen me i wont be far and the heir to the throne of brennin leaped in a rustle of cloth and a moonlit flash of yellow hair through the window reaching out almost lazily for a handhold on the wall outside for gods sake kevin thought which was all he had time for vart the surly guard appeared in the doorway when he saw that matt was nowhere to be seen a thin smile flicked across his face my lord the chancellor vart announced kevin wasnt sure what hed expected but it wasnt what he saw gorlaes the chancellor was a big broadshouldered brownbearded man of middle years he smiled generously showing good teeth as he came sweeping in welcome back silvercloak and brightly woven indeed you have come in the very teeth of timeas ever and he laughed loren kevin saw did not the other man who came in an armed aide close beside him was stooped and very old the king kevin wondered for a brief disoriented moment but it was not good evening metran loren said deferentially to this whitehaired new arrival are you well well very well very very metran wheezed he coughed there is not enough light in here i want to see he said querulously a trembling arm was raised and suddenly the six wall torches blazed illuminating the chamber why kim thought couldnt loren have done that better much better metran went on shuffling forward to sink into one of the chairs his attendant hovered close by the other soldier kim saw had placed himself by the door with vart paul had withdrawn towards jennifer by the window where loren asked is the king i sent vart to advise him i was here and he has been so advised gorlaes answered smoothly vart in the doorway snickered ailell has instructed me to convey his greetings to you and your he paused to look around four companions four only four metran cut in barely audible over a coughing fit gorlaes spared him only the briefest of glances and went on to your four companions i have been asked to take them under my care as chancellor for the night the king had a trying day and would prefer to receive them formally in the morning it is very late im sure you understand the smile was pleasant even modest now if you would be good enough to introduce me to our visitors i can have my men show them to their rooms and you my friend can go to your richly deserved rest thank you gorlaes loren smiled but a thin edge like that of a drawn blade had come into his voice however under the circumstances i count myself responsible for the wellbeing of those who crossed with me i will make arrangements for them until the king has received us silvercloak are you implying that their wellbeing can be better attended to than by the chancellor of the realm there too kevin thought his muscles involuntarily tensing the same edge though neither man had moved it seemed to him as if there were two swords drawn in the torchlit room not at all gorlaes said the mage it is simply a matter of my own honor you are tired my friend leave this tedious business to me there is no tedium in caring for friends loren i must insist no there was a cold silence you realize said gorlaes his voice dropping almost to a whisper that you offer me little choice the voice came up suddenly i must obey the commands of my king vart lagoth the two soldiers in the doorway moved forward and pitched halfdrawn swords clattering fulllength to the floor behind their prone bodies stood a very calm matt sören and the big capable man named coll seeing them there kevin laine whose childhood fantasies had been shaped of images like this knew a moment of sheer delight at which point a lithe feral figure shimmering with jewelry swung easily through the window into the room he landed lightly beside jennifer and she felt a wandering hand stroke her hair before he spoke who makes this noise at such an hour can a soldier not sleep at night in his fathers palace without why gorlaes and metran and here is loren you have returned silvercloakand with our visitors i see in the very teeth of time the insolence of his voice filled the room gorlaes send quickly my father will want to welcome them immediately the king the chancellor replied stiffly is indisposed my lord prince he sent me he cant come then i must do the family honors myself silvercloak would you and so loren carefully introduced them again and a peach said diarmuid dan ailell bending slowly to kiss jennifers hand against her will she laughed he didnt hurry the kiss when he straightened though his words were formal and both of his arms were raised in a wide gesture of ritual i welcome you now he began and kevin turning instinctively saw the benign countenance of gorlaes contort for a blurred instant with fury i welcome you now diarmuid said in a voice stripped of mockery as guestfriends of my father and myself the home of ailell is your home your honor is ours an injury done you is an injury to ourselves and treason to the oak crown of the high king be welcome to paras derval i will personally attend to your comfort for tonight only on the last phrase did the voice change a little as the quick eyes malicious and amused flashed to jennifers she flushed again but he had already turned gorlaes he said softly your retainers appear to have collapsed i have been told in the few hours since ive been back from south keep of entirely too much drinking among them i know it is a festival but really and the tone was so mild so very reproachful kevin fought to keep a straight face coll diarmuid went on have four rooms made ready on the north side please and quickly no it was jennifer kim and i will share just three she resolutely avoided looking at the prince kimberly watching him decided that his eyebrows went higher than they had any right to go we will too said paul schafer quietly and kevin felt his pulse leap oh abba he thought maybe this will do it for him maybe it will im too hot why is it so hot everywhere metran first of the mages asked of no one in particular the north side of the palace opposite the town overlooked a walled garden when they were finally alone in their room kevin opened the glass doors and stepped out onto a wide stone balcony the moon waning was high overhead bright enough to illuminate the shrubs and the few flowers below their room not much of a garden he commented as paul came out to join him theres been no rain diarmuid said thats true there was silence a light breeze had finally come up to cool the evening have you noticed the moon paul asked leaning on the parapet kevin nodded larger you mean yes i did wonder what effect that has higher tides most likely i guess and more werewolves schafer gave him a wry look i wouldnt be surprised tell me what did you think about that business back there well loren and diarmuid seem to be on the same side it looks that way matts not very sure of him somehow that doesnt surprise me really what about gorlaes he was pretty quick to call in the marines was he just following orders or not a chance paul i saw his face when diarmuid made us guestfriends not happy my friend really schafer said well that simplifies things at least id like to know more about this jaelle though and diarmuids brother too the nameless one kevin intoned lugubriously he of no name schafer snorted funny man yes him well figure it out weve figured things out before i know said paul schafer and after a moment gave a rare smile oh romeo romeo wherefore art thou romeo came a plaintive cry from off to their left they looked over kim ford languishing for all she was worth swayed towards them from the next balcony the leap was about ten feet im coming kevin responded instantly he rushed to the edge of their own balcony oh fly to me kimberly trilled jennifer behind her began almost reluctantly to laugh im coming kevin repeated ostentatiously limbering up you two all right there he asked in midflex been ravished yet not a chance kim lamented cant find anyone whos man enough to jump to our balcony kevin laughed id have to do it pretty fast he said to get there before the prince i dont know jennifer lowell said if anyone can move faster than that guy paul schafer hearing the banter begin and the laughter of the two women moved to the far end of the balcony he knew very well that the frivolity was only a release from tension but it wasnt something to which he had access any more resting his own ringless fineboned hands on the railing he gazed out and down at the denuded garden below he stood there looking about him but not really seeing the inner landscape demanded its due even had schafer been carefully scanning the shadows though it is unlikely that he would have discerned the dark creature that crouched behind a clump of stunted shrubs watching him the desire to kill was strong upon it and paul had moved to within easy range of the poison darts it carried he might have died then but fear mastered bloodlust in the figure below it had been ordered to observe and to report but not to kill so paul lived observed oblivious and after a time he drew a long breath and lifted his eyes from sightless fixation on the shadows below to see a thing none of the others saw high on the stone outer wall enclosing the garden stood an enormous grey dog or a wolf and it was looking at him across the moonlit space between with eyes that were not those of a wolf or a dog and in which lay a sadness deeper and older than anything paul had ever seen or known from the top of the wall the creature stared at him the way animals are not supposed to be able to do and it called him the pull was unmistakable imperative terrifying looming in night shadow it reached out for him the eyes unnaturally distinct boring into his own paul touched and then twisted his mind away from a well of sorrow so deep he feared it could drown him whatever stood on the wall had endured and was still enduring a loss that spanned the worlds it dwarfed him appalled him and it was calling him sweat cold on his skin in the summer night paul schafer knew that this was one of the things caught up in the chaotic vision lorens searching had given him with an effort brutally physical he broke away when he turned his head he felt the motion like a twist in his heart kev he managed to gasp the voice eerie in his own head what is it his friends response was instant over there on the wall do you see anything paul pointed but did not look back what theres nothing what did you see not sure he was breathing hard something maybe a dog and and it wants me paul schafer said kevin stunned was silent they stood a moment like that looking at each other not sharing then schafer turned and went inside kevin stayed a while longer to reassure the others then went in himself paul had taken the smaller of the two beds that had been hastily provided and was lying on his back hands behind his head wordlessly kevin undressed and went to bed the moon slanted a thin beam of light into the far corner of the room illuminating neither of them chapter all the night they had been gathering stern men from ailells own birthplace in rhoden cheerful ones from highwalled seresh by saeren mariners from taerlindel and soldiers from the fastness of north keep though not many of these because of the one who was exiled from villages and dustdry farms all over the high kingdom they came as well for days they had been trickling into paras derval crowding the inns and hostels spilling out into makeshift campgrounds beyond the last streets of the town below the palace some had come walking west from the oncerich lands by the river glein leaning on the carved staffs of the southeast they had cut across the burntout desolation of the grain lands to join the dusty traffic on the leinan road from the grazing lands and the dairy lands in the northeast others had come riding on the horses that were the legacy of their winter trading with the dalrei by the banks of the latham and though their horses might be painfully gaunt each mount yet bore the sumptuous woven saddlecloth that every brennin horseman crafted before he took a horse a weaving for the weavers gift of speed from beyond leinan they came as well dour dark farmers from gwen ystrat in their wide sixwheeled carts none of their women though not from so near dun maura in the province of the mother but from everywhere else the women and children had come in noisy festive number even in the midst of drought and deprivation the people of brennin were gathering to pay homage to their king and perhaps to briefly forget their troubles in doing so morning found them densely clustered in the square before the palace walls looking up they could see the great balustrade hung with banners and gaily colored streamers and most wonderful of all the great tapestry of iorweth in the wood brought forth for this one day that all the folk of brennin might see their high king stand beneath the symbols of mórnir and the weaver both in paras derval but all was not consigned to high and sacred things around the fringes of the crowd moved jugglers and clowns and performers doing glittering things with knives and swords and bright scarves the cyngael chanted their ribald verses to pockets of laughing auditors extemporizing satires for a fee upon whomever their benefactor designated not a few revenges were thus effected in the clear cutting words of the cyngaelimmune since colans day from any law save that of their own council amid the babble pedlars carried their colorful goods about or erected hasty booths from which to display their craft in the sunlight and then the noise never less than a roar became a thundering for figures had appeared on the balustrade the sound hit kevin like a blow he regarded the absence of sunglasses as a source of profound and comprehensive grief hungover to incapacity pale to the edge of green he glanced over at diarmuid and silently cursed the elegance of his figure turning to kimand the movement hurt like hellhe received a wry smile of commiseration which salved his spirit even as it wounded his pride it was already hot the sunlight was painfully brilliant in the cloudless sky and so too were the colors worn by the lords and ladies of ailells court the high king himself to whom theyd not yet been presented was further down the balcony hidden behind the intervening courtiers kevin closed his eyes wishing it were possible to retreat into the shade instead of standing up front to be seen red indians indeed redeyed indians anyhow it was easier with his eyes closed the fulsome voice of gorlaes orating the glittering achievements of ailells reign slid progressively into background what the hell kind of wine did they make in this world kevin thought too drained to be properly outraged the knock had come an hour after theyd gone to bed neither of them had been asleep careful said paul rising on one elbow kevin had swung upright and was pulling on his cords before moving to the door yes he said without touching the lock who is it convivial night persons came an already familiar voice open up ive got to get tegid out of the hallway laughing kevin looked over his shoulder paul was up and half dressed already kevin opened the door and diarmuid entered quickly flourishing two flasks of wine one of them already unstoppered into the room behind him also carrying wine came coll and the preposterous tegid followed by two other men bearing an assortment of clothing for tomorrow the prince said in response to kevins quizzical look at the last pair i promised id take care of you he tossed over one of the wine flasks and smiled very kind of you kevin replied catching it he raised the flask in the way hed learned in spain years before to shoot a dark jet of wine down his throat he flipped the leather flask over to paul who drank wordlessly ah exclaimed tegid as he eased himself onto a long bench im dry as jaelles heart to the king he cried raising his own flask and to his glorious heir prince diarmuid and to our noble and distinguished guests and to the rest of the peroration was lost in the sound of wine voluminously pouring into his mouth at length the flow ceased tegid surfaced belched and looked around ive a mighty thirst in me tonight he explained unnecessarily paul addressed the prince casually if youre in a party mood arent you in the wrong bedroom diarmuids smile was rueful dont assume you were a first choice he murmured your charming companions accepted their dresses for tomorrow but nothing more im afraid the small one kimhe shook his headhas a tongue in her my condolences said kevin delighted ive been on the receiving end a few times then said diarmuid dan ailell let us drink in joint commiseration the prince set the tone by commencing to relate what he characterized as essential information a wittily obscene description of the various court ladies they were likely to meet a description that reflected an extreme awareness of their private as well as public natures tegid and coll stayed the other two men left after a time to be replaced by a diiferent pair with fresh wine flasks eventually these two departed as well the two men who succeeded them however were not smiling as they entered what is it carde coll asked the fairhaired one the man addressed cleared his throat diarmuid sprawled in a deep chair by the window turned at the sound gardes voice was very soft something strange my lord i thought you should know right away theres a dead svart alfar in the garden below this window through the wineinduced haze descending upon him kevin saw diarmuid swing to his feet brightly woven the prince said which of you killed it gardes voice dropped to a whisper thats just it my lord erron found it dead its throat was ripped apart my lord erron thinks he thinks it was done by a wolf though with respect my lord i dont ever want to meet what killed that creature in the silence that followed this kevin looked over at paul schafer sitting up on his bed schafer seemed thinner and more frail than ever his expression was unreadable diarmuid broke the stillness you said it was below this window carde nodded but the prince had turned already and throwing open the doors was on the balcony and then dropping over the edge and right behind him was paul schafer which meant that kevin had to go too with coll beside him and carde just behind he moved to the edge of the balcony swung over the balustrade hung by his hands a dizzy instant and dropped the ten feet to the garden the other two followed only tegid remained in the room his mountainous bulk precluding the descent diarmuid and paul had moved to where three men were standing by a stunted clump of shrubbery they parted to let the prince in among them kevin breathing deeply to clear his head moved up beside paul and looked down when his eyes adjusted to the dark he wished they hadnt the svart alfar had been almost decapitated its head had been clawed to shreds one arm had been torn through the shoulder remaining attached to the body only by an exposed strip of cartilage and there were deep claw marks scoring the naked torso of the dark green hairless creature even in the shadows kevin could see the thick blood clotting the driedout soil breathing very carefully shocked almost sober he resisted an impulse to be sick no one spoke for a long time the fury that was reflected in the mangled creature on the ground imposed its own silence eventually diarmuid straightened and moved back a few steps carde he said crisply i want the watch doubled on our guests as of now tomorrow i want a report on why that thing wasnt seen by any of you and why you didnt see what killed it either if i post guards i expect them to be useful my lord carde badly shaken moved off with the other guards coll was still crouching beside the dead svart now he looked over his shoulder diar he said it was no ordinary wolf that did this i know said the prince if it was a wolf kevin turning looked at paul schafer again schafer had his back to them he was gazing at the outer wall of the garden at length the four of them walked back to the balcony with the aid of crevices in the palace wall and a hand over the balustrade from tegid they were all soon in the room once more diarmuid tegid and coll departed shortly after the prince left them two flasks of wine and an offer they accepted both kevin ended up drinking almost all of the wine himself primarily because paul for a change wasnt in a mood to talk were on kim hissed prodding him with an elbow they were it seemed the four of them stepped forward in response to gorlaess sweeping gesture and as instructed waved to the loudly cheering crowd kimberly waving with one hand and supporting kevin with the other realized suddenly that this was the scene that loren had conjured up for them in the park plaza two nights before instinctively she looked up over her shoulder and saw the banner flapping lazily overhead the crescent moon and the oak kevin grateful for her arm did manage a few waves and a fixed smile while reflecting that the tumultuous gathering below was taking a lot on faith at this height they could have been any four members of the court he supposed impressed with himself for thinking so clearly that the public relations thing would probably focus on the nobility anyhow the people around them knew that they were from another worldand someone seemed to be awfully unhappy about it his head was killing him and some indeterminate fungus seemed to have taken up residence in his mouth better shape up fast he thought youre about to meet a king and there was a long ride waiting tomorow with god knows what at the end for diarmuids last offer had been an unexpected one were going south tomorrow morning hed said as the dawn was breaking across the river a raid of sorts though a quiet one no one to know if you think you can manage you may find it interesting not altogether safe but i think we can take care of you it was the smile on the last phrase that got both of themwhich kevin realized was probably what the manipulative bastard had intended the great hall at paras derval had been designed by tomaz lal whose disciple ginserat had been he who later made the wardstones and much else of power and beauty in the older days twelve great pillars supported the high ceiling set far up in the walls were the windows of delevanstainedglass images of the founding of the high kingdom by iorweth and the first wars with eridu and cathal the last window on the western wall above the canopied throne of brennin showed conary himself colan young beside him their fair hair blowing back as they rode north through the plain to the last battle against rakoth maugrim when the sun was setting that window would blaze with light in such a fashion that the faces of the king and his golden son were illuminated as from within with majesty though the window had been crafted almost a thousand years before such was the art of delevan the craft of tomaz lal walking between the huge pillars over mosaicinlaid tiles kimberly was conscious for the first time of feeling awe in this place the pillars windows everpresent tapestries the jewelled floor the gemencrusted clothing of the lords and ladies even the silken splendor of the lavendercolored gown she wore she drew a deep careful breath and kept her gaze as straight as she could and doing so she saw as loren led the four of them to the western end of the hall under the last great window a raised dais of marble and obsidian and upon it a throne carved of heavy oak and sitting upon the throne was the man shed only glimpsed through the crowd on the balcony earlier in the day the tragedy of ailell dan art lay in what he had fallen from the haggard man with the wispy snowwhite beard and blurred cataractoccluded gaze showed little of the giant warrior with eyes like a noonday sky who had taken the oak throne fifty years before gaunt and emaciated ailell seemed to have been stretched thin by his years and the expression with which he peered forward to follow their approach was not welcoming to one side of the king stood gorlaes the broadshouldered chancellor was dressed in brown with his seal of office hung about his neck and no other ornament on the other side of the throne in burgundy and white stood diarmuid the kings heir of brennin who winked when her gaze lingered kim turned away abruptly to see metran the first mage making his slow wheezing way attendant solicitously at hand to stand with loren just in front of them seeing paul schafer gazing intently at the king she turned back to the throne herself and after a pause she heard her name being spoken in introduction she stepped forward and bowed having decided earlier that under no circumstances was she going to try anything so hazardous as a curtsy the others followed suit jennifer did curtsy sinking down in a rustle of green silk and rising gracefully as an appreciative murmur ran through the hall be welcome to brennin the high king said leaning back in his throne bright be the thread of your days among us the words were gracious but there was little pleasure in the low desiccated tones in which they were spoken thank you metran loren the king said in the same voice thank you teyrnon he added nodding to a third man half hidden beyond loren metran bowed too low in response and almost toppled over his aide helped him straighten someone snickered in the background loren was speaking we thank you for your kindness my lord our friends have met your son and the chancellor already the prince was good enough to make them guestfriends of your house last night his voice on the last phrase was pitched to carry the kings eyes rested for a long moment on those of loren and kim watching changed her mind ailell might be old but he certainly wasnt senilethe amusement registering in his face was far too cynical yes said the king i know he did and herewith i endorse his doing so tell me loren he went on in a different tone do you know if any of your friends play tabael loren shook his head apologetically truly my lord he said i never thought to ask they have the same game in their world they call it chess but i play said paul there was a short silence paul and the king looked at each other when ailell spoke his voice was very soft i hope he said that you will play with me while you are with us schafer nodded by way of response the king leaned back and loren seeing this turned to lead them from the hall hold silvercloak the voice was icily imperious it knifed into them kim quickly turned left to where shed noticed a small grouping of women in grey robes now that cluster parted and a woman walked forward towards the throne all in white she was very tall with red hair held back by a circlet of silver on her brow her eyes were green and very cold in her bearing as she strode towards them was a deep scarcely suppressed rage and as she drew near kimberly saw that she was beautiful but despite the hair which gleamed like a fire at night under stars this was not a beauty that warmed one it cut like a weapon there was no nuance of gentleness in her no shading of care but fair she was as is the flight of an arrow before it kills loren checked in the act of withdrawing turned as she approachedand there was no warmth in his face either have you not forgotten something the woman in white said her voice feathersoft and sinuous with danger an introduction i would have done so in due course loren replied lightly if you are impatient i can due course impatient by macha and nemain you should be cursed for insolence the redhaired woman was rigid with fury her eyes burned into those of the mage who endured the look without expression until another voice interceded in rich plummy tones im afraid you are right priestess said gorlaes our voyager here does at times forget the patterns of precedence our guests should have been presented to you today i fear fool the priestess snapped you are a fool gorlaes today i should have been spoken to before he went on this journey how dare you metran how dare you send for a crossing without leave of the mother the balancing of worlds is in her hands and so it is in mine you touch the earthroot in peril of your soul if you do not seek her leave metran retreated from the enraged figure fear and confusion chased each other across his features loren however raised a hand and pointed one long steady finger at the woman confronting him nowhere he said and thick anger spilled from his own voice now nowhere is such a thing written and this by all the gods you know you overreach yourself jaelleand be warned it shall not be permitted the balance lies not with youand your moonlit meddling may shatter it yet the priestesss eyes flickered at thatand kim suddenly remembered diarmuids reference the night before to a secret gathering and it was diarmuids lazy voice that slid next into the charged silence jaelle he said from by his fathers throne whatever the worth of what you say surely this is not the time to say it lovely as you are you are marring a festival with your wrangling and we seem to have another guest waiting to be greeted stepping lightly from the dais he walked past all of them down to the end of the hall where kim saw as she turned to watch there stood another woman this one whitehaired with age and leaning on a gnarled staff before the great doors of ailells hall be welcome ysanne said the prince a deep courtesy in his tone it is long since you have graced our court but kim hearing the name spoken seeing the frail figure standing there felt something touch her then like a finger on the heart a current of sound had begun to ripple through the gathered courtiers and those lining the spaces between the pillars were crowding backwards in fear but the murmur was only faint background for kim now because all her senses were locked onto the seamed wizened figure walking carefully towards the throne on the arm of the young prince ysanne you should not be here ailell surprisingly had risen to speak and it could be seen that even stooped with years he was the tallest man in the room true enough the old woman agreed placidly coming to a halt before him her voice was gentle as jaelles had been harsh the redhaired priestess was gazing at her with a bitter contempt then why ailell asked softly fifty years on this throne merits a journey to pay homage ysanne replied is there anyone else here besides metran and perhaps loren who well recalls the day you were crowned i came to wish you bright weaving ailell and for two other things which are it was loren who asked first to see your travelers ysanne replied and turned to face paul schafer his responding gesture was brutally abrupt throwing a hand in front of his eyes schafer cried out no no searching ysanne raised her eyebrows she glanced at loren then turned back to paul i see she said fear not then i never use the searchingi dont need it the whispering in the hall rose again for the words had carried pauls arm came down slowly he met the old womans gaze steadily then his own head held highand strangely it was ysanne who broke the stare and then it was then it was that she turned past jennifer and kevin ignoring the rigid figure of jaelle and for the first tune saw kimberly grey eyes met grey before the carven throne under the high windows of delevan ah cried the old woman then on a sharply taken breath and in the softest thread of a whisper added after a moment i have awaited you for so long now my dear and only kim herself had seen the spasm of fear that had crossed ysannes face before she spoke those quiet words like a benediction how kim managed to stammer what do you mean ysanne smiled i am a seer the dreamer of the dream and somehow kim knew what that meant and there were sudden bright tears in her eyes come to me the seer whispered loren will tell you how she turned then and curtsied low before the tall king of brennin fare kindly ailell she said to him the other thing i have come to do is say goodbye i shall not return and we shall not meet again you and i on this side of the night she paused i have loved you carry that ysanne the king cried but she had turned and leaning on her staff she walked alone this time the length of the stunned brilliant hall and out the double doors into the sunlight that night very late paul schafer was summoned to play tabael with the high king of brennin the escort was a guard he didnt know and walking behind him down shadowy corridors paul was inwardly grateful for the silent presence of coll who he knew was following them it was a long walk but they saw few people still awake a woman combing her hair in a doorway smiled at him and a party of guards went by sheathed swords clinking at their sides passing some bedrooms paul heard murmurs of latenight talk and once a woman cried out softly on a taken breatha sound very like a cry that he remembered the two men with their hidden follower came at length to a pair of heavy doors schafers face was expressionless as they were opened to his escorts tapping and he was ushered into a large richly furnished room at the center of which were two deep armchairs and a table set for tabael welcome it was gorlaes the chancellor who came forward to grip pauls arm in greeting it is kind of you to come it is kind came the thinner voice of the king he moved out from a shadowed corner of the room as he spoke i am grateful to you for indulging an old mans sleeplessness the day has worn heavily upon me gorlaes good night my lord the chancellor said quickly i will be happy to stay and no need go to sleep tarn will serve us the king nodded to the young page who had opened the door for paul gorlaes looked as if he would protest again but refrained good night then my lord and once more my deepest wellwishes on this brightly woven day he walked forward and on one knee kissed the hand ailell extended then the chancellor left the room leaving paul alone with the king and his page wine by the table tarn then we will serve ourselves go to bedi will wake you when i want to retire now come my young stranger ailell said lowering himself carefully into a chair in silence paul walked foward and took the other chair tarn deftly filled the two glasses set beside the inlaid board then withdrew through an inner doorway into the kings bedroom the windows of the room were open and the heavy curtains drawn back to admit whatever breath of air might slide in in a tree somewhere outside a bird was singing it sounded like a nightingale the beautifully carved pieces glinted in the light of the candles but the face of the tall king of brennin was hidden as he leaned back in his chair he spoke softly the game we play is the same loren tells me though we name the pieces differently i always play the black take you the white and begin paul schafer liked to attack in chess especially with white and the first move gambits and sacrifices followed each other in his game designed to generate a whirlwind assault on the opposition king the fact that the opposition this night was a king had no effect on him for schafers code though complex was unwavering he set out to demolish the black pieces of ailell just as he would have those of anyone else and that night heartsick and vulnerable there was even more fire in his game than usual for he sought to hide from torment in the cold clarity of the blackandwhite board so he marshalled himself ruthlessly and the white pieces spun into a vortex of attack to be met by a defence of intricate resilient subtlety whatever ailell had dwindled from however his mind and authority might seem to waver paul knew ten moves into the game that he was dealing with a man of formidable resources slowly and patiently the king ordered his defences cautiously he shored up his bulwarks and so it was that schafers freewheeling attack began to exhaust itself and was turned inexorably back after almost two hours play paul tipped over the white king in resignation the two men leaned back in their chairs and exchanged their first look since the game had begun and they smiled neither knowing since there was no way they could know how rare it was for the other to do so sharing that moment however as paul raised his silver goblet to salute the king they moved closer across the twin gulfs of worlds and years to the kind of bonding that might have allowed them to understand each other it was not to happen but something else was born that night and the fruit of that silent game would change the balance and the pattern of all the worlds there were ailell spoke first his voice husky no one he said no one has ever given me a game like that i do not lose in tabael i almost did tonight paul smiled for the second time you almost did you may next gamebut im not very certain of it you play beautifully my lord ailell shook his head no i play carefully all the beauty was on your side but sometimes plodding caution will wear down brilliance when you sacrificed the second rider ailell gestured wordlessly i suppose that it is only the young who can do a thing like that it has been so long for me i seem to have forgotten he raised his own cup and drank paul refilled both goblets before replying he felt drained simplified the bird outside he realized had stopped singing a long time ago i think he said that it is more a question of style than of youth or age im not very patient so i play the way i do in tabael you mean other things too paul answered after a hesitation ailell surprisingly nodded i was like that once though it may be hard for you to credit his expression was selfdeprecating i took this throne by force in a time of chaos and held it with my sword in the early years if we are to be a dynasty it begins with me and follows with with diarmuid i suppose paul remained silent and after a moment the king went on it is power that teaches patience holding power i mean and you learn the price it exactswhich is something i never knew when i was your age and thought a sword and quick wits could deal with anything i never knew the price you pay for power ailell leaned over the board and picked up one of the pieces take the queen in tabael he said the most powerful piece on the board yet she must be protected when threatened by guard or rider for the game will be lost if that exchange is made and the king said ailell dan art in tabael you cannot sacrifice a king paul couldnt read the expression in the sunken stillhandsome face but there was a new timbre in the voice something shifting far under the words ailell seemed to notice his discomfort he smiled again faintly i am heavy company at night he said especially tonight too much comes back i have too many memories i have too many of my own paul said impulsively and hated himself the instant the words were spoken ailells expression though was mild even compassionate i thought you might he said im not sure why but i thought you might paul lowered his face to the deep wine goblet and took a long drink my lord he said to break the ensuing stillness with a new subject any new subject why did the priestess say that loren should have asked her before bringing us what does she was wrong about that and i will send to tell her so not that jaelle is likely to listen ailells expression was rueful she loves to make trouble to stir up tensions she might find ways to exploit jaelle is ambitious beyond belief and she seeks a return to the old ways of the goddess ruling through her high priestess which is how it was before iorweth came from oversea there is a good deal of ambition in my court there often is around the throne of an aging king but hers runs deeper than any paul nodded your son said something like that last night what diarmuid did ailell gave a laugh that was actually evocative of the prince im surprised he sobered up long enough to think so clearly pauls mouth twitched actually he wasnt sober but he seemed to think pretty clearly anyhow the king gestured dismissively he is charming sometimes after a pause he tugged at his beard and asked im sorry what were we speaking of jaelle paul said what she said this morning yes yes of course once her words would have been true but not for a long time now in the days when the wild magic could only be reached underground and usually only with blood the power needed for a crossing would be drained from the very heart of the earth and that has always been the province of the mother so in those days it was true that such an expenditure of earthroot of avarlith could only be made through intercession of the high priestess with the goddess now though for long years now since amairgen learned the skylore and founded the council of the mages the power drain in their magic runs only through the mages source and the avarlith is not touched i dont understand what power drain i go too quickly it is hard to remember that you are from another world listen then if a mage were to use his magic to start a fire in that hearth it would require power to do it once all our magic belonged to the goddess and that power was tapped straight from the earthroot and being both drained and expended in fionavar the power would find its way back to the earthit would never diminish but in a crossing the power is used in another world so you lose it exactly or so it was once but since amairgen freed the mages from the mother the power will be drained from the source only and he rebuilds it in himself over time he or she of course but you mean each mage has yes of course each is bonded to a source as loren is to matt or metran to denbarra that is the anchoring law of the skylore the mage can do no more than his source can sustain and this bond is for life whatever a mage does someone else pays the price and so much came clear then paul remembered matt sören trembling as they came through the crossing he remembered lorens sharp concern for the dwarf and then seeing more clearly still the dim torches on the walls of that first room the torches frail metran had so easily gestured to brightness while loren had refrained to let his source recover paul felt his mind stretch away from selfabsorption stiffly as if muscles had been too long unused how he asked how are they bound to each other mage and source there are a great many laws and long training to be endured in the end if there is still willingness they may bind with the ritual though it is not a thing to be done lightly there are only three left in fionavar denbarra is sisterson to metran teyrnons source is barak his closest friend as a child some pairings have been strange ones lisen of the wood was source to amairgen whitebranch first of the mages why was it strange ah the high king smiled a little wistfully it is a long tale that one perhaps you may hear a part of it sung in the great hall all right but what about loren and matt how did they that too is strange ailell said at the end of his training loren sought leave of the council and of me to travel for a time he was gone three years when he returned he had his cloak and he was bonded to the king of the dwarves a thing that had never happened before no dwarf the king broke off sharply and in the abrupt silence they both heard it again a barely audible tapping on the wall of the room across from the open window as paul looked at the king in wonder it came again ailells face had gone queerly soft oh mörnir he breathed they have sent he looked at paul hesitating then seemed to make a decision stay with me young paul pwyll stay and be silent for you are about to see a thing few men have been allowed and walking over to the wall the king pressed his palm carefully against it in a place where the stone had darkened slightly levar shanna he murmured and stood back as the thin outline of a door began to take shape in the seamless structure of the wall a moment later the demarcation was clear and then the door slid soundlessly open and a slight figure moved lightly into the room it was cloaked and hooded and remained so a moment registering pauls presence and ailells nod of endorsement then it discarded the concealing garment in one smooth motion and bowed low before the king greetings i bear high king and a gift to remember your crowning day and i have tidings needful for you to hear from daniloth i am brendel of the kestrel mark and in this fashion did paul schafer first see one of the lios alfar and before the ethereal flamelike quality of the silverhaired figure that stood before him he felt himself to have grown heavy and awkward as a different dimension of grace was made manifest be welcome nabrendel of the kestrel ailell murmured this is paul schafer whom i think we would name pwyll in fionavar he is one of the four who came with silvercloak from another of the worlds to join the fabric of our celebration this i know said brendel i have been in paras derval two days now waiting to find you alone this one i have seen and the others including the golden one she alone made the waiting tolerable high king else i might have been long hence from your walls with the gift i bear undelivered a flame of laughter danced in his eyes which were greengold in the candlelight i thank you then for waiting said ailell and tell me now how does ralathen brendels face went suddenly still the laughter extinguished ah he exclaimed softly you bring me quickly to my tidings high king lathen mistweaver heard his song in the fall of the year he has gone oversea and away and with him also went laien spearchild last of those who survived the bael rangat none now are left though few enough were ever left the eyes of the lios alfar had darkened they were violet now in the shadows he stopped a moment then continued tenniel reigns in daniloth it is his greeting i bring you lathen gone now too the king said very low and laien heavy tidings you bear nabrendel and there are heavier yet to tell the lios replied in the winter rumor came to daniloth of svart alfar moving in the north ratenniel posted watch and last month we learned that the word was not false a party of them moved south past us to the edgings of pendaran and there were wolves with them we fought them there high king for the first time since the bael rangat the lios alfar went to war we drove them back and most of them were slainfor we are still something of what we werebut six of my brothers and sisters fell six we loved will never now hear their song death has come again to us ailell had collapsed into his chair as the lios alfar spoke svarts outside pendaran he moaned now almost to himself oh mörnir what wrong of mine was so great that this need come upon me in my age and aged he did seem then shaking his head quiveringly back and forth his hands on the carved arms of the chair trembled paul exchanged a glance with the bright figure of the lios but though his own heart was twisted with pity for the old king he saw no trace of the same in the eyes now grey of their visitor i have a gifting for you high king brendel said at length ratenniel would have you know that he is other than was the mistweaver my tidings of battle should tell you that he will not hide in daniloth and henceforth you will see us more often than at the sevenyear in token of which and as earnest of alliance and our interwoven threads of destiny the lord of the lios alfar sends you this never in his life had paul seen a thing so beautiful as the object brendel handed to ailell in the thin scepter of crystal that passed from the lios to the man every nuance of light in the room seemed to be caught and then transmuted the orange of the wall torches the red flickers of the candles even the bluewhite diamonds of starlight seen through the window all seemed to be weaving in ceaseless intricate motion as if shuttling on a loom with the scepter a summonglass the king murmured as he looked down upon the gift this is a treasure indeed it has been four hundred years since one of these lay within our halls and whose fault was that brendel said coldly unfair my friend ailell replied a little sharply in his turn the words of the lios seemed to kindle a spark of pride in him vailerth high king broke the summonglass as a small part of a great madnessand brennin paid a blood price for that madness in civil war the kings voice was firm again tell ratenniel that i accept his gift should he use it to summon us the summons shall be answered say that to your lord tomorrow i will speak with my council as to the other tidings you have brought pendaran will be watched i promise you it is in my heart that more than watching may be needed high king brendel replied softly now there is a power stirring in fionavar ailell nodded slowly so loren said to me some time ago he hesitated then went on almost reluctantly tell me nabrendel how does the daniloth wardstone the same as it has been since the day ginserat made it brendel said fiercely the lios alfar do not forget look to your own high king no offence was meant my friend said ailell but you know that all the guardians must burn the naal fire and know you this as well the people of conary and colan and of ginserat himself do not forget the bael rangat either our stone is blue as it ever was and as if the gods are kind it ever will be there was a silence brendels eyes burned now with a luminous intensity come said ailell suddenly rising to stand tall above them come and i will show you turning on his heel he stalked to his bedroom opened the door and passed through following quickly behind paul caught a glimpse of the great fourpostered canopied bed of the king and he saw the figure of tarn the page asleep on his cot in a corner of the room ailell did not break stride though and paul and the lios alfar hastened to keep up as the king opened another door on the opposite wall of the bedchamber and passed through that as well into a short corridor at the end of which was another heavy door there he stopped breathing hard we are above the room of the stone ailell said speaking with some difficulty he pressed a catch in the middle of the door and slid back a small rectangle of wood which allowed them to see down into the room on the other side colan himself had this made the king said to them when he returned with the stone from rangat it is told that for the rest of his days he would often rise in the night and walk this corridor to gaze upon ginserats stone and ease his heart with the knowledge that it was as it had been of late i have found myself doing the same look you nabrendel of the kestrel look upon the wardstone of the high kingdom wordlessly the lios stepped forward and placed his eye to the opening in the door he stayed there for a long time and was still silent when at length he drew back and you young pwyll look you as well and mark whether the blue of the binding still shines in the stone ailell gestured and paul moved past brendel to put his eye to the aperture it was a small chamber with no decorations on the walls or floor and no furnishings of any kind in the precise center of the room there stood a plinth or pillar rising past the height of a man and before it was set a low altar upon which burned a pure white fire upon the sides of the pillar were carven images of kingly men and resting in a hollowedout space at the top of the column lay a stone about the size of a crystal ball and paul saw that that stone shone with its own light and the light with which it shone was blue back in the room they had left paul found a third goblet on a table by the window and poured wine for the three of them brendel accepted his cup but immediately began a restless pacing of the room ailell had seated himself again in his chair by the gameboard watching from the window paul saw the lios alfar stop his coiled movement and stand before the king we believe the wardstones high king because we must he began softly almost gently but you know there are other powers that serve the dark and some of them are great their lord may yet be bound beneath rangat but moving over the land now is an evil we cannot ignore have you not seen it in your drought high king how can you not see it rains in cathal and on the plain only in brennin will the harvest fail only silence ailells voice cracked high and sharp you know not of what you speak seek not to meddle in our affairs the king leaned forward in his chair glaring at the slim figure of the lios alfar two bright spots of red flushed his face above the wispy beard nabrendel stopped he was not tall but in that moment he seemed to grow in stature as he gazed at the high king when he finally spoke it was without pride or bitterness i did not mean to anger you he said on this day least of all it is in my heart though that little in the days to come can be the affair of one people alone such is the meaning of ratenniels gift i am glad you have accepted it i will give your message to my lord he bowed very low turned and walked back through the doorway in the wall donning his cloak and hood as he moved the door slid silently closed behind him and then there was nothing in the room to mark his ever having been there save the shimmering scepter of glass ailell was twisting around and around in the trembling hands of an old man from where he stood by the window paul could hear a different bird now lifting its voice in song he supposed it must be getting close to dawn but they were on the west side of the palace and the sky was still dark he wondered if the king had completely forgotten his presence at length however ailell drew a tired breath and laying the scepter down by the gameboard moved slowly to stand by paul gazing out the window from where they stood paul could see the land fall away westward and far in the distance rose the trees of a forest a greater darkness against the dark of the night leave me friend pwyll ailell said at length not unkindly i am weary now and will be best by myself weary he repeated and old if there truly is some power of darkness walking the land i can do nothing about it tonight unless i die and truly i do not want to die on the tree or otherwise if this is my failing then so it must be his eyes were distant and sad as he gazed out the window towards the woods far off paul cleared his throat awkwardly i dont think that wanting to live can be a failing the words rasped from too long a silence a difficult emotion was waiting within him ailell smiled at that but with his mouth only and he continued to look out at the darkness for a king it may be pwyll the price remember he went on in a different voice some blessings i have had you heard ysanne in the hall this morning she said she had loved me i never knew that i dont think the king mused softly turning at last to look at paul that i will tell that part to marrien the queen paul let himself out of the room after bowing with all the respect he had there was a queer constriction in his throat marrien the queen he shook his head and took an uncertain step along the corridor a long shadow detached itself from the wall nearby do you know the way coll asked not really no paul said i guess i dont they passed through the hallways of the palace their footsteps echoing beyond the walls dawn was just breaking in the east over gwen ystrat it was dark still in the palace though outside his doorway paul turned to diarmuids man coll he asked whats the tree the burly soldier froze after a moment a hand went up to rub the broad hook of his broken nose they had stopped walking paras derval lay wrapped in silence for a moment paul thought his question would not be answered but then coll did speak his voice pitched low the summer tree he said its in the wood west of the town sacred it is to mörnir of the thunder why is it important because said coll lower yet thats where the god would summon the high king in the old days when the land had need summon him for what to hang on the summer tree and die said coll succinctly ive said too much already your friend is with the lady rheva tonight i believe ill be back to wake you in a little while weve got a long ride today and he spun on his heel to walk off coll the big man turned slowly is it always the king who hangs colls broad sunburnt face was etched with apprehension the answer when it came seemed almost to be against his will princes of the blood have been known to do it instead which explains diarmuid last night coll i really dont want to get you in troublebut if i were to make a guess at what happened here id guess that ailell was called because of this drought or maybe theres a drought because he hasnt gone and id guess he is terrified of the whole thing and loren backs him because he doesnt trust whatever happens on the summer tree after a moment coll nodded stiffly and schafer continued then id go on to guess and this is really a guess that diarmuids brother wanted to do it for the king and ailell forbade himwhich is why hes gone and diarmuid is heir would that be a good guess coll had come very close as schafer was speaking he searched pauls eyes with his own honest brown ones then he shook his head a kind of awe written into his features this is deeper than i can go it would be he said a very good guess the high king must consent to his surrogate and when he refused the prince cursed him which is treason and was exiled it is now death to speak his name in the silence that followed it seemed to paul as if the whole weight of the night was pressing down upon the two of them there is no power in me coll said then in his deep voice but if there was i would have him cursed in the name of all the gods and goddesses there are who paul whispered why the prince of course said coll the exiled prince diarmuids brother aileron chapter beyond the palace gates and the walls of the town the depredations of drought came home the impact of a rainless summer could be measured in the heavy dust of the road in the thin grass peeling like brown paint on hills and tummocks in stunted trees and driedup village wells in the fiftieth year of ailells reign the high kingdom was suffering as no living man could remember for kevin and paul riding south with diarmuid and seven of his men in the morning the way of things registered most brutally in the pinched bitter features of the farmers they passed on the road already the heat of the sun was casting a shimmer of mirage on the landscape there were no clouds in the sky diarmuid was setting a hard pace though and kevin who was no horseman and whod had a sleepless night was exceedingly happy when they pulled up outside a tavern in the fourth village they came to they took a hasty meal of cold sharply spiced meat bread and cheese with pints of black ale to wash away the throatclogging dust of the road kevin eating voraciously saw diarmuid speak briefly to carde who quietly sought the innkeeper and withdrew into another room with him noticing kevins glance the prince walked over to the long wooden table where he and paul were sitting with the lean dark man named erron were checking for your friend diarmuid told them its one of the reasons were doing this loren went north to do the same and ive sent word to the coast whos with the women paul schafer asked quickly diarmuid smiled trust me he said i do know what im doing there are guards and matt stayed in the palace too loren went without him paul queried sharply how diarmuids expression was even more amused even without magic our friend can handle himself he has a sword and knows how to use it you worry a good deal dont you does it surprise you kevin cut in we dont know where we are we dont know the rules here daves gone missing god knows whereand we dont even know where were going with you now that last said diarmuid is easy enough were crossing the river into cathal if we can by night and quietly because theres a very good chance well be killed if found i see said kevin swallowing and are we allowed to know why we are subjecting ourselves to that unpleasant possibility for the first time that morning diarmuids smile flashed fullforce of course you are he said kindly youre going to help me seduce a lady tell me carde he murmured turning any news there was none the prince drained his pint and was striding out the door the others scrambled to their feet and followed a number of the villagers came out of the inn to watch them ride off mörnir guard you young prince one farmer cried impulsively and in the name of the summer tree may he take the old man and let you be our king diarmuid had raised a gracious hand at the first words but the speakers last phrase brought him to wheel his horse hard there was a brutal silence the princes face had gone cold no one moved overhead kevin heard a noisy flap of wings as a dense cluster of crows wheeled aloft darkening the sun for an instant diarmuids voice when it came was formal and imperious the words you have spoken are treason ailells son said and with a sideways nod spoke one word more coll the farmer may never have seen the arrow that killed him diarmuid did not he was already pounding up the road without a backwards glance as coll replaced his bow by the time the shock had passed and the screaming had begun all ten of them were around the bend that would carry them south kevins hands were shaking with shock and fury as he galloped the image of the dead man engulfing him the screams still echoing in his mind coll beside him seemed impassive and unperturbed save that he carefully refused to meet the glance of paul schafer who was staring fixedly at him as they rode and to whom he had spoken a treasonous word of his own the night before in the early spring of dr john ford of toronto had taken a fortnights leave from his residency at londons st thomas hospital hiking alone in the lake district north of keswick he came at the end of a long day afoot down the side of a hill and walked wearily up to a farmyard tucked into the shadow of the slope there was a girl in the yard drawing water from a well the westering sun slanted upon her dark hair when she turned at the sound of his footstep he saw that her eyes were grey she smiled shyly when hat in hand he asked for a drink and before she had finished drawing it for him john ford had fallen in love simply and irrevocably which was his nature in all things deirdre cowan who was eighteen that spring had been told long ago by her grandmother that she would love and marry a man from over the sea because her gran was known to have the sight deirdre never doubted what she had been told and this man handsome and diffident had eyes that called to her ford spent that night in her fathers house and in the quietest dark before dawn deirdre rose from her bed she was not surprised to see her gran in the hallway by her own bedroom door nor to see the old woman make a gesture of blessing that went back a very long way she went to fords room the gray eyes beguiling her body sweet with trust they were married in the fall and john ford took his wife home just as the first snows of the winter came and it was their daughter who walked a dwarf beside her twentyfive springs after her parents had been brought together towards the shores of a lake in another world to meet her own destiny the path to the lake where ysanne lived twisted north and west through a shallow valley flanked by gentle hills a landscape that would have been lovely in any proper season but kim and matt were walking through a country scorched and barrenand the thirst of the land seemed to knife into kim twisting like anguish inside her her face hurt the bones seeming taut and difficult within her movement was becoming painful and everywhere she looked her eyes flinched away its dying she said matt looked at her with his one eye you feel it she nodded stiflly i dont understand the dwarfs expression was grim the gift is not without its darkness i do not envy you envy me what matt kims brow furrowed what do i have matt sörens voice was soft power memory truly i am not sure if the hurt of the land reaches so deeply its easier in the palace im blocked there from all this we can go back for one moment sharp and almost bitter kim did want to turn backall the way back not just to paras derval but home where the ruin of the grass and the dead stalks of flowers by the path did not burn her so but then she remembered the eyes of the seer as they had looked into hers and she heard again the voice drumming in her veins i have awaited you no she said how much farther around the curve well see the lake soon but hold let me give you somethingi should have thought of it sooner and the dwarf held out towards her a bracelet of silver workmanship in which was set a green stone what is it a vellin stone it is very precious there are few left and the secret of fashioning them died with ginserat the stone is a shield from magic put it on with wonder in her eyes kimberly placed it upon her wrist and as she did the pain was gone the hurt the ache the burning all were gone she was aware of them but distantly for the vellin was her shield and she felt it guarding her she cried out in wonder but the relief in her face was not mirrored in that of the dwarf ah said matt sören grimly so i was right there are dark threads shuttling on the loom the weaver grant that loren comes back soon why kim asked what does this mean if the vellin guards you from the lands pain then that pain is not natural and if there is a power strong enough to do this to the whole of the high kingdom then there is a fear in me i begin to wonder about the old tales of mörnirs tree and the pact the founder made with the god and if not that then i dare not think what come said the dwarf it is time i took you to ysanne and walking more swiftly he led her around an outthrust spur of hill slope and as they cleared the spur she saw the lake a gem of blue in a necklace of low hills and somehow there was still green by the lake and the profuse scattered colors of wildflowers kim stopped dead in her tracks oh matt the dwarf was silent while she gazed down enraptured on the water it is fair he said finally but had you ever seen calor diman between the mountains you would spare your hearts praise somewhat to have some left for the queen of waters kim hearing the change in his voice looked at him for a moment then drawing a deliberate breath she closed her eyes and was wordless a long time when she spoke it was in a cadence not her own between the mountains she said very high up it is the melting snow in summer falls into the lake the air is thin and clear there are eagles circling the sunlight turns the lake into a golden fire to drink of that water is to taste of whatever light is falling down upon it whether of sun or moon or stars and under the full moon calor diman is deadly for the vision never fades and never stops pulling a tide in the heart only the true king of dwarves may endure that night vigil without going mad and he must do so for the diamond crown he must wed the queen of waters lying all night by her shores at full of the moon he will be bound then to the end of his days as the king must be to calor diman and kimberly opened her eyes to look full upon the former king of dwarves why matt she asked in her own voice why did you leave he made no answer but met her look unflinchingly at length he turned still silent and led her down the winding path to ysannes lake she was waiting there for them dreamer of the dream knowledge in her eyes and pity and another nameless thing kevin laine had never been able to hide his emotions well and that summary execution so casually effected had disturbed him very deeply he had not spoken a word through a days hard riding and the twilight found him still pale with undischarged anger in the gathering dark the company passed through more heavily wooded country slanting gradually downhill towards the south the road went past a thick copse of trees and revealed half a mile beyond the towers of a small fortress diarmuid pulled to a halt he seemed fresh still unaffected by the day on horseback and kevin whose bones and muscles ached ferociously fixed the prince with a cold stare he was however ignored rothe said diarmuid to a compact brownbearded rider you go in speak to averren and no one else i am not here coll is leading a number of you on a reconnaissance no details he wont ask anyway find out discreetly if a stranger has been seen in the area then join us by the dael slope rothe spun his horse and galloped towards the tower thats south keep carde murmured to kevin and paul our watchtower down here not too bigbut theres little danger of anything crossing the river so we dont need much the big garrisons downriver west by the sea cathals invaded twice that way so theres a castle at seresh to keep watch why cant they cross the river paul asked kevin maintained his selfimposed silence gardes smile in the gathering dark was mirthless that youll see soon enough when we go down to try diarmuid throwing a cloak over his shoulders waited until the keep gates had swung open for rothe then he led them west off the road along a narrow path that began to curve south through the woods they rode for perhaps an hour quietly now though no order had been given these kevin realized were highly trained men for all the roughness of their garb and speech when compared to the dandies theyd met in the palace the moon a thinning crescent swung into sight behind them as they wound out of the trees diarmuid halted at the edge of the sloping plain a hand up for silence and after a moment kevin heard it too the deep sound of water swiftflowing under the waning moon and the emerging stars he dismounted with the others gazing south he could see the land fall sheer away in a cliff only a few hundred yards from where they stood but he could not see anything at all on the far side it was as if the world ended just in front of them theres a land fault here a light voice said close to his ear kevin stiffened but diarmuid went on casually cathal lies about a hundred feet lower than us youll see when we go forward and said the prince his voice still light it is a mistake to mate judgements too soon that man had to diehad he not word would be in the palace by now that i was encouraging treasonous talk and there are those who would like to spread that word his life was forfeit from the time he spoke and the arrow was a kinder death than gorlaes would have granted him well wait for rothe here ive told carde to rub you both down youll not make it across with muscles that wont move he walked away and sat on the ground leaning against the trunk of a tree after a moment kevin laine who was neither a petty man nor a stupid one smiled to himself gardes hands were strong and the liniment he used was extraordinary by the time rothe rejoined them kevin felt functional again it was quite dark now and diarmuid threw back his cloak as he suddenly rose they gathered around him at the edge of the wood and a ripple of soundless tension went through the company kevin feeling it looked for paul and saw that schafer was already gazing at him they exchanged a tight smile then listened intently as diarmuid began to speak softly and concisely the words spun into the almost windless night were received and registered and then there was silence and they were moving nine of them with one man left to the horses over the slope that led to the river they had to cross into a country where they would be killed if seen running lightly beside coll kevin felt his heart suddenly expand with a fierce exhilaration which lasted growing brighter until they dropped to a crouch then a crawl and reaching the edge of the cliff looked down saeren was the mightiest river west of the mountains tumbling spectacularly out of the high peaks of eridu it roared down into the lowlands of the west there it would have slowed and begun to meander had not a cataclysm torn the land millennia ago in the youngness of the world an earthquake that had ripped a gash like a wound in the firmament the saeren gorge through that deep ravine the river thundered dividing brennin which had been raised up in the earths fury from cathal lying low and fertile to the south and great saeren did not slow or wander in its course nor could a dry summer in the north slake its force the river foamed and boiled two hundred feet below them glinting in the moonlight awesome and appalling and between them and the water lay a descent in darkness down a cliff too sheer for belief if you fall diarmuid had said unsmiling try not to scream you may give the others away and now kevin could see the far side of the gorge and along the southern cliff well below their elevation were the bonfires and garrisons of cathal the outposts guarding their royalty and their gardens from the north kevin swore shakily i do not believe this what are they afraid of no one can cross this thing its a long dive coll agreed from his right side but he says it was crossed hundreds of years ago just once and thats why were trying now just for the hell of it eh kevin breathed still incredulous whats the matter are you bored with backgammon with what nevermind and indeed there was little chance to talk after that for diarmuid farther along to their right spoke softly and erron lean and supple moved quickly over to a large twisted tree kevin hadnt noticed and knotted a rope carefully about the trunk that done he dropped the line over the edge paying it out between his hands when the last coil spun down into darkness he wet each of his palms deliberately and cocked an eye at diarmuid the prince nodded once erron gripped the rope tightly stepped forward and disappeared over the edge of the cliff hypnotically they all watched the taut line of the rope coll went over to the tree to check the knot kevin became aware as the long moments passed that his hands were wet with perspiration he wiped them surreptitiously on his breeches then on the far side of the rope he saw paul schafer looking at him it was dark and he couldnt see pauls face clearly but something in the expression a remoteness a strangeness triggered a sudden cold apprehension in kevins chest and brought flooding remorselessly back the memory he could never quite escape of the night rachel kincaid had died he remembered rachel himself remembered her with a kind of love of his own for it had been hard not to love the darkhaired girl with the shy preraphaelite grace for whom two things in the world meant fire the sounds of a cello under her bow and the presence of paul schafer kevin had seen and caught his breath to see the look in her dark eyes when paul would enter a room and he had watched too the hesitant unfolding of trust and need in his proud friend until it all went smash and he had stood helpless tears in his own eyes in the emergency ward of st michaels hospital with paul when the death word came when paul schafer his face a dry mask had spoken the only words he would ever speak on rachels death it should have been me he had said and walked alone out of a toobright room but now in the darkness of another world a different voice was speaking to him hes down you next friend kevin said diarmuid and there was indeed the dancing of the rope that meant erron was signaling from the bottom moving before he could think kevin went up to the rope wet his hands as erron had done gripped carefully and slid over and down alone using his booted feet for leverage and control he descended hand over hand into the growing thunder of noise that was the saeren gorge the cliff was rough and there was a danger that the line might fray on one of the rock edgesbut there was little to be done about that or about the burning in his hands as the rope slid abrasively through his grip he looked down only once and was dizzied by the speed of the water far below turning his face to the cliff kevin breathed deeply for a moment willing himself to be calm then he continued hand and foot rope and toehold down to where the river waited it became a process almost mechanical reaching for crevices with his foot pushing off as the rope slid through his palms he blocked out pain and fatigue the returning ache of abused muscles he forgot even where he was the world was a rope and a face of rock it seemed to have always been so oblivious was he that when erron touched his ankle kevins heart leaped in a spasm of terror erron helped him step down onto the thin strip of earth barely ten feet from where the water roared past drenching them with spray the noise was overwhelming it made conversation almost impossible erron jerked three times on the slack line and after a moment it began to sway and bob beside them with the weight of a body above paul kevin thought wearily thatll be paul and then another thought invaded him and registered hard over exhaustion he doesnt care if he falls the realization hit with the force of apprehended truth kevin looked upwards and began frantically scanning the cliff face but the moon was lighting the southern side only and schafers descent was invisible only the lazy almost mocking movement of the rope end beside them testified that someone was above and only now absurdly too late did kevin think of pauls weakened condition he remembered rushing him to hospital only two weeks before after the basketball game schafer shouldnt have played and at the memory his heart angled in his breast unable to bear the strain of looking upwards he turned instead to the bobbing rope beside him so long as that slow dance continued paul was all right the movement of the rope meant life a continuation fiercely kevin concentrated on the line swaying slowly in front of the dark rock face he didnt pray but he thought of his father which was almost the same thing he was still gazing fixedly at the rope when erron finally touched his arm and pointed and looking upwards then kevin drew free breath again to see the slight familiar figure moving down to join them paul schafer alighted moments later neatly though breathing hard his eyes met kevins for an instant then flicked away he tugged the rope three times himself before moving down the strand to slump against the rock face eyes closed a time later there were nine of them standing spraydrenched by the river bank diarmuids eyes gleamed in the light reflected off the water he seemed feral and fey a spirit of night unleashed and he signalled coll to begin the next stage of the journey the big man had descended with another coil of rope in the pack on his broad back now he unslung his bow and drawing an arrow from its quiver fitted an end of the rope to an iron ring set in the shaft then he moved forward to the edge of the water and began scanning the opposite shore kevin couldnt see what he was looking to find on their own side a few shrubs and one or two thick short trees had dug into the thin soil but the cathal shore was sandier and there seemed to be nothing growing by the river coll however had raised his great bow with the arrow notched to the string he drew one steady breath and pulled the bowstring all the way back past his ear the gesture smooth though the corded muscles of his arm had gone ridged and taut coll released and the arrow sang into arching flight the thin rope hurtling with it high over saerento sink deep into the stone cliff on the far side carde whod been holding the free end of the rope quickly pulled it tight then coll measured and cut it and tying the free end to another arrow proceeded to fire the shaft pointblank into the rock behind them the arrow buried itself into stone kevin utterly incredulous turned to diarmuid questions exploding in his eyes the prince walked over and shouted in his ear over the thunder of the water lorens arrows it helps to have a mage for a friendthough if he finds out how ive used his gift hell consign me to the wolves and the prince laughed aloud to see the silvered highway of cord that spanned saeren in the moonlight watching him kevin felt it then the intoxicating lure of this man who was leading them he laughed himself in that moment feeling constraint and apprehension slip away a sense of freedom came upon him of being tuned to the night and their journey as he watched erron leap up grab the rope and begin to swing hand over hand out over the water the wave that hit the darkhaired man was a fluke kicked up from an angled rock by the shore it slammed into erron as he was changing grips and threw him violently sideways desperately erron curved his body to hang on with one hand but the wave that followed the first buffeted him mercilessly and he was torn from the rope and flung into the millrace of saeren kevin laine was running before the second wave hit pelting flat out downstream along the strand he leaped without pausing to calculate or look back for the overhanging branch of one of the knotted trees that dug into the earth by the river fully extended in flight his arms outstretched he barely reached it there was no time to think with a racking contorted movement he twisted his body looped his knees over the branch and hung face down over the torrent only then did he look almost blinded by spray to see erron a cork in the flood hurtling towards him again no time kevin reached down tasting his death in that moment erron threw up a convulsive hand and each clasped the others wrist the pull was brutal it would have ripped kevin from the tree like a leafhad not someone else been there someone who was holding his legs on the branch with a grip like an iron band a grip that was not going to break ive got you screamed paul schafer lift him if you can and hearing the voice locked in schafers viselike hold kevin felt a surge of strength run through him both hands gripping errons wrist he pulled him from the river there were other hands by then reaching for erron taking him swiftly to shore kevin let go and allowed paul to haul him up to the branch straddling it they faced each other gasping hard for breath you idiot paul shouted his chest heaving you scared the hell out of me kevin blinked then the too too much boiled over you shut up i scared you what do you think youve been doing to me since rachel died paul utterly unprepared was shocked silent trembling with emotion and adrenalin afterburn kevin spoke again his voice raw i mean it paul when i was waiting at the bottom i didnt think you were going to make it down and paul i wasnt sure if you cared their heads were close together for the words to be heard schafers pupils were enormous in the reflected moonlight his face was so white as to be almost inhuman that isnt quite true he replied finally but it isnt far wrong not far enough oh paul you have to bend a little if you cant talk cant you cry at least she deserves your tears cant you cry for her at that paul schafer laughed the sound chilled kevin to the core there was such wildness in it i cant paul said thats the whole problem kev i really really cant then youre going to break kevin rasped i might schafer replied scarcely audible im trying hard not to believe me kev i know you care it matters to me very much if if i do decide to go ill say goodbye i promise youll know oh for gods sake is that supposed to make me come on coll bellowed from the shore and kevin startled realized that hed been calling for some time that branch could crack any second so they moved back to the strand to be disconcertingly enveloped by bearhugs from diarmuids men coll himself nearly broke kevins back with his massive embrace the prince walked over his expression utterly sober you saved a man i value he said i owe you both i was being frivolous when i invited you to come and unfair i am grateful now that i did good said kevin succinctly i dont much enjoy feeling like excess baggage and now he went on raising his voice so they could all hear while he buried again that which he had no answer for and no right to answer lets cross this stream i want to see those gardens and walking past the prince his shoulders straight head high as he could carry it he led them back to the rope across the river grief in his heart like a stone one by one then hand over hand they did cross and on the other shore where sand met cliff in cathal diarmuid found them what he had promised the worn handholds carved into the rock five hundred years ago by alorre prince of brennin who had been the first and the last to cross the saeren into the garden country screened by darkness and the sound of the river they climbed up to where the grass was green and the scent of moss and cyclamen greeted them the guards were few and careless easily avoided they came to a wood a mile from the river and took shelter there as a light rain began to fall beneath her feet kimberly could feel the rich texture of the soil and the sweetness of wildflowers surrounded her they were in the strand of wood lining the north shore of the lake the leaves of the tall trees somehow untouched by the drought filtered the sunlight leaving a verdant coolness through which they walked looking for a flower matt had gone back to the palace she will stay with me tonight the seer had said no harm will touch her by the lake you have given her the vellin which was wiser perhaps than even you knew matt sören i have my powers too and tyrth is here with us tyrth the dwarf asked my servant ysanne replied he will take her back when the time conies trust me and go easily you have done well to bring her here we have much to talk of she and i so the dwarf had gone but there had been little of the promised talk since his departure to kims first stumbled questions the whitehaired seer had offered only a gentle smile and an admonition patience child there are things that come before the telling time first there is a flower we need come with me and see if we can find a bannion for tonight and so kim found herself walking through shade and light under the trees questions tumbling over each other in her mind bluegreen ysanne had said it was with red like a drop of blood at the heart ahead of her the seer moved light and surefooted over root and fallen branch she seemed younger in the wood than in ailells hall and here she carried no staff to lean upon which triggered another question and this one broke through do you feel the drought the way i do ysanne stopped at that and regarded kim a moment her eyes bright in the seamed wizened face she turned again though and continued walking scanning the ground on either side of the twisting path when her answer came kim was unprepared not the same way it tires me and there is a sense of oppression but not actual pain as with you i canthere and darting quickly to one side she knelt on the earth the red at the center did look like blood against the seacolored petals of the bannion i knew we would find one today said ysanne and her voice had roughened it has been years so many many years with care she uprooted the flower and rose to her feet come child we will take this home and i will try to tell you what you need to know why did you say youd been waiting for me they were in the front room of ysannes cottage in chairs beside the fireplace late afternoon through the window kim could see the figure of the servant tyrth mending the fence in back of the cottage a few chickens scrabbled and pecked in the yard and there was a goat tied to a post in a corner around the walls of the room were shelves upon which in labelled jars stood plants and herbs of astonishing variety many with names kim could not recognize there was little furniture the two chairs a large table a small neat bed in an alcove off the back of the room ysanne sipped at her drink before replying they were drinking something that tasted like camomile i dreamt you the seer said many times that is how i see suchthings as i do see which have grown fewer and more clouded of late you were clear though hair and eyes i saw your face why though what am i that you should dream of me you already know the answer to that from the crossing from the lands pain which is yours child you are a seer as i am and more i think than i have ever been cold suddenly in the hot dry summer kim turned her head away but she said in a small voice i dont know anything which is why i am to teach you what i know that is why you are here there was a complex silence in the room the two women one old the other younger than her years looked at each other through identical grey eyes under white hair and brown and a breeze like a finger blew in upon them from the lake my lady the voice abraded the stillness kim turned to see tyrth in the window thick black hair and a full beard framed eyes so dark they were almost black he was not a big man but his arms on the window sill were corded with muscle and tanned a deep brown by labor in the sun ysanne unstartled turned to him tyrth yes i meant to call you can you make up another bed for me we have a guest tonight this is kimberly who crossed with loren two nights past tyrth met her eyes for an instant only then an awkward hand brushed at the thick hair tumbling over his forehead ill do a proper bed then but in the meanwhile ive seen something you should know of the wolves ysanne asked tranquilly tyrth after a bemused moment nodded i saw them the other night the seer went on while i slept there isnt much we can do i left word in the palace with loren yesterday i dont like it tyrth muttered there havent been wolves this far south in my lifetime big ones too they shouldnt be so big and turning his head he spat in the dust of the yard before touching his forehead again and walking from the window as he moved away kim saw that he limped favoring his left foot ysanne followed her glance a broken bone she said badly set years ago hell walk like that all his life im lucky to have him thoughno one else would serve a witch she smiled your lessons begin tonight i think how ysanne nodded towards the bannion resting on the table top it begins with the flower she said it did for me a long time ago the waning moon rose late and it was full dark when the two women made their way beneath it to stand by the edge of the lake the breeze was delicate and cool and the water lapped the shore gently like a lover over their heads the summer stars were strung like filigree ysannes face had gone austere and remote looking at her kim felt a premonitory tension the axis of her life was swinging and she knew not how or where only that somehow she had lived in order to come to this shore ysanne drew her small figure erect and stepped onto a flat surface of rock jutting out over the lake with a motion almost abrupt she gestured for kim to sit beside her on the stone the only sounds were the stir of the wind in the trees behind them and the quiet slap of water against the rocks then ysanne raised both arms in a gesture of power and invocation and spoke in a voice that rang over the night lake like a bell hear me eilathen she cried hear and be summoned for i have need of you and this is the last time and the deepest eilathen damae sien rabanna den viroth bannion damae and as she spoke the words the flower in her hand burst into flame bluegreen and red like its colors and she threw it spiralling into the lake kim felt the wind die beside her ysanne seemed carved out of marble so still was she the very night seemed gathered into that stillness there was no sound no motion and kim could feel the furious pounding of her heart under the moon the surface of the lake was glassy calm but not with the calm of tranquillity it was coiled waiting kim sensed as if within the pulse of her blood a vibration as of a tuning fork pitched just too high for human ears and then something exploded into motion in the middle of the lake a spinning form whirling too fast for the eye to follow rose over the surface of the water and kim saw that it shone bluegreen under the moon unbelieving she watched it come towards them and as it did so the spinning began to slow so that when it finally halted suspended in air above the water before ysanne kim saw that it had the tall form of a man long seagreen hair lay coiled about his shoulders and his eyes were cold and clear as chips of winter ice his naked body was lithe and lean and it shimmered as if with scales the moonlight glinting where it fell upon him and on his hand burning in the dark like a wound was a ring red as the heart of the flower that had summoned him who calls me from the deep against my desire the voice was cold cold as night waters in early spring and there was danger in it eilathen it is the dreamer i have need forgo your wrath and hear me it is long since we stood here you and i long for you ysanne you have grown old soon the worms will gather you the reedy pleasure in the voice could be heard but i do not age in my green halls and time turns not for me save when the bannion fire troubles the deep and eilathen held out the hand upon which the red ring burned i would not send down the fire without a cause and tonight marks your release from guardianship do this last thing for me and you are free of my call a slight stir of wind the trees were sighing again on your oath eilathen moved closer to the shore he seemed to grow towering above the seer water rippling down his shoulders and thighs the long wet hair pulled back from his face on my oath ysanne replied i bound you against my own desire the wild magic is meant to be free only because my need was great were you given to the flowerfire on my oath you are free tonight and the task eilathens voice was colder than ever more alien he shimmered before them with a green dark power this said ysanne and pointed to kimberly the stab of eilathens eyes was like ice cutting into her kim saw sensed somehow knew the fathomless halls whence ysanne had summoned himthe shaped corridors of seastone and twined seaweed the perfect silence of his deep home she held the gaze as best she could held it until it was eilathen who turned away now i know he said to the seer now i understand and a thread that might have been respect had woven its way into his voice but she does not said ysanne so spin for her eilathen spin the tapestry that she may learn what she is and what has been and release you of the burden that you bear eilathen glittered high above them both his voice was a splintering of ice and this is the last this is the last ysanne replied he did not hear the note of loss in her voice sadness was alien to him not of his world or his being he smiled at her words and tossed his hair back the taste the glide the long green dive of freedom already running through him look then he cried look you to knowand know your last of eilathen and crossing his arms upon his breast so that the ring on his finger burned like a heart afire he began to spin again but somehow as kim watched his eyes were locked on hers all the time even as he whirled so fast that the lake water began to foam beneath him and his cold cold eyes and the bright pain of the red ring he wore were all she knew in the world and then he was inside her deeper than any lover had ever gone more completely and kimberly was given the tapestry she saw the shaping of the worlds fionavar at first then all the othersher own in a fleeting glimpsefollowing it into time the gods she saw and knew their names and she touched but could not hold for no mortal can the purpose and the pattern of the weaver at the loom and as she was whirled away from that bright vision she came abruptly face to face with the oldest dark in his stronghold of starkadh in his eyes she felt herself shrivel felt the thread fray on the loom she knew evil for what it was the live coals of his eyes scorched into her and the talons of his hands seemed to score her flesh and within her heart she was forced to sound the uttermost depths of his hate and she knew him for rakoth the unraveller rakoth maugrim whom the gods themselves feared he who would rend the tapestry and lay his own malignant shadow on all of time to come and flinching away from the vastness of his power she endured an endless passage of despair ysanne ashen and helpless heard her cry out then a cry torn from the ruin of innocence and the seer wept by the shore of her lake but through it all eilathen spun faster than hope or despair colder than night the stone over his heart blazing as he whirled like an unleashed wind towards the freedom he had lost kimberly though was oblivious to time and place to lake rock seer spirit stone locked like a spell into the images eilathens eyes imposed she saw iorweth founder come from oversea saw him greet the lios alfar by sennett strand and her heart caught at the beauty of the lios in that vision and of the tall men the god had called to found the high kingdom and then she learned why the kings of brennin all the high kings from iorweth to ailell were named the children of mörnir for eilathen showed her the summer tree in the godwood under stars the dalrei she saw next in a whirling away to the north and west on the plain she watched them in pursuit of the glorious eltor their long hair tied back the dwarves delving under banir lok and banir tal she was shown and the distant men of wild eridu beyond their mountains eilathens eyes carried her south then across saeren and she saw the gardens of cathal and the unrivalled splendor of the lords across the river the heart of pendaran she touched and in a bright vision bittersweet she saw lisen of the wood meet amairgen whitebranch in the grove and bind herself to him first source to the first mage and she saw her die by the sea tower fairest child of all the turning worlds grieving still for that loss she was taken by eilathen to see the warthe great war against rakoth conary she saw and knew and colan his son the beloved she saw the bright fierce array of the lios and the shining figure of ratermaine greatest of the lords of the lios alfarand she saw that brilliant company torn apart by wolves and svart alfar and most terribly of all by the flying creatures older than nightmare unleashed by maugrim then she watched as coming too late conary and colan were cut off and trapped in their turn by sennett and as a red sun went down on a night conary would die she saw and her heart exploded within her to see the curved ranks of the dalrei ride singing out of daniloth out of the mist behind revor into the sunset she did not know though ysanne did that she was weeping as the riders and the warriors of brennin and cathal terrible in their fury and their grief drove the armies of the dark back north and east through andarien to starkadh where the lion of eridu came to join them and where the blood and smoke cleared at last to show rakoth beaten to his knees in surrender then she was shown the binding and knew the mountain again for the prison it had become and she watched ginserat make the stones faster then the images began to fly and to ysannes eyes the speed of eilathens turning became as a maelstrom of power and she knew that she was losing him the joy of his release she tasted even amid her own deep ache of loss faster he spun and faster the water white beneath his feet and the seer watched as the one beside her who was no longer a girl learned what it was to dream true to be a dreamer of the dream and there came a time when eilathen slowed and stopped kimberly lay sprawled on the rock drained of all color utterly unconscious the water spirit and the seer gazed at each other a long time unspeaking at length eilathens voice was heard high and cold in the moonlight i have done she knows what she is able to know a great power is in her but i do not know if she can bear the burden she is young not anymore ysanne whispered she found it hard to speak perhaps not but it is no care of mine i have spun for you dreamer release me from the fire he was very close the icecrystal eyes gleaming with an inhuman light the seer nodded i did promise it was past time you know why i needed you there was an appeal in her voice i do not forgive but you know why another long silence then yes said eilathen and one listening for it might have imagined gentleness in his tone i know why you bound me ysanne was crying again the tears glinting on her lined face her back was straight though her head high and the command when it came rang clear then go free of me free of guardianship be free of flowerfire now and evermore laith derendel sed bannion echorth and on the last word a sound burst from eilathen a high keening sound beyond joy or release almost beyond hearing and the redstoned ring slid from his finger and fell on the rock at the seers feet she knelt to gather it and when she rose saw through stillfalling tears that he had already spun back out over the lake eilathen she cried forgive me if you can farewell for reply his motion only grew faster wilder somehow than before untamed chaotic and then eilathen reached the middle of the lake and dived but one listening for itwanting praying even to catch itmight have heard or imagined she heard just before he disappeared the sound of her name called out in farewell in a voice cold and free forever she sank to her knees cradling kim and rocked her upon her lap as one rocks a child holding the girl gazing out through almost blinded eyes at the empty lake she did not see the darkhaired darkbearded figure that rose from the cover of a sheltering rock behind them the figure watched long enough to see her take the ring eilathen had guarded and slip it carefully upon kimberlys right hand where it fit her ring finger as perfectly as the seer had dreamt it would after seeing this the watching figure turned still unseen and walked away from them and there was no trace of a limp in his stride she was seventeen that spring not yet accustomed to men calling her beautiful a pretty child she had been but adolescence had found her longlimbed and coltish prone to skinned knees and bruises from rough play in the gardens at larai rigalactivities ultimately deemed unfitting for a princess of the realm the more so when marlen died hunting and she became heir to the ivory throne in a ceremony she scarcely remembered so dazed was she by the speed of it and the death of her brother her knee was hurting from a fall the day before and her fathers face had frightened her there were no falls after that for the play in the gardens and on the lake of the summer palace came to an end she learned to school herself in the ways of a decadent court and in time to deal not unkindly with the suitors who began to come in such numbers and she did grow beautiful the dark rose of cathal and her name was sharra daughter of shalhassan proud she remained as were all of her blood and strongwilled a quality rare in dissolute cathal though not unexpected in her fathers daughter within her too there flickered yet a secret flame of rebelliousness against the demands of position and ritual that trammelled her days and nights even now the flame burned within beloved larai rigal where the scent of calath and myrrh of elphinel and alder enveloped her with memories memories that fired her with brighter longing than had any of the men who had knelt before her fathers throne seeking her hand with the ritual phrase the sun rises in your daughters eyes she was young yet for all her pride and it would have been for all of these reasons the last perhaps more than any of the others that when the letters had begun to appear in her roomhow she knew notshe kept them secret unto herself deeply secret too she kept the suspicion burning like a liena in the gardens at night of who had sent them of desire they spoke and called her fair in words more strung with fire than any she had ever heard a longing was in the lines that sang to her and it awoke within her breast prisoner that she was in the place she would one day rule longings of her own most often she yearned for the simplicity of mornings that were gone leaving this strangeness in their place but sometimes when she was alone at night for other things for the letters grew more bold as time went by and descriptions of desire became promises of what hands and lips might do still they were unsigned finely phrased elegantly penned they bespoke nobility but there never was a name signed at the close until the last one came as spring was spilling calath and anemone all over larai rigal and the name she read at last gave shape and certainty to what she had long guessed and held in her heart as a talisman i know something you dont know was the refrain that had carried her lightly even kindly through mornings in the reception chamber then closely escorted afternoon walks with one suitor or another along the curving pathways and arched bridges of the gardens only at night her ladies at last dismissed her black hair brushed and falling free could she take from its hiding place that last letter and read again by candlelight bright one too long even the stars now speak to me of you and the night wind knows your name i must come death is a dark i seek not to find but if i must walk within its provinces to touch the flower of your body then i must promise only that should the soldiers of cathal end my life it will be your hands that close my eyes and perhapstoo much to ask i knowyour lips that touch my cold ones in farewell there is a lyren tree near the northern wall oflarai rigal ten nights past the full of the moon there should still be light enough at moonrise for us to find each other i will be there you hold my life as a small thing between the fingers of your hands diarmuid dan ailell it was very late earlier in the evening it had rained releasing the scent of elphinel from below her window but now the clouds had drifted and the waning moon shone into her room gently its light touched her face and glinted in the heavy fall of her hair it had been full nine nights before which meant that he had somehow crossed saeren and was hiding somewhere in the dark of the land and tomorrow sharra daughter of shalhassan drew a long breath in the bed where she lay alone and returned the letter to its secret place that evening she did not dream of childhood or of childhood games when at length sleep found her twisting from side to side all night her hair loose and spread upon the pillows venassar of gath was so young and shy he made her feel protective walking the next morning on the circle path she did most of the talking in yellow doublet and hose longfaced and clearly apprehensive he listened with desperate attentiveness tilted alarmingly towards her as she named the flowers and trees past which they walked and told the story of tvaren and the creation of larai rigal her voice pitched low to exclude their retinue which walked a careful ten paces ahead and behind gave no hint of how many interminable times she had done this before they walked slowly past the cedar from which she had fallen the day her brother died the day before she had been named heir to the throne and then following the curve of the path over the seventh bridge past one of the waterfalls she saw the giant lyren near the northern wall venassar of gath gangling and discomfited essayed a series of coughs snorts and comments in a hapless attempt thereafter to revive a dead conversation the princess at his side had withdrawn into a stillness so profound that her beauty seemed to have folded upon itself like a flower dazzling still but closed to him his father he thought despairingly was going to flay him taking pity at last sharra carefully placed her hand on his arm as they crossed the ninth bridge completing the circle and walked up towards the pavilion where shalhassan reclined surrounded by the scented finery of his court the gesture launched venassar into a state of petrified automatism despite the predatory look it elicited from bragon his father who was sitting beside shalhassan under the waving fans of the servants sharra shivered as bragons glance lingered on her and the smile deepened under his dark moustache it was not the smile of a potential fatherinlaw beneath the silk of her gown her body recoiled from the hunger in his eyes her father did not smile he never did she made obeisance to him and moved into the shade where they brought her a glass of mrae deeply chilled and a dish of flavored ices when bragon took his leave she made sure he saw the coldness in her eyes and then smiled at venassar extending a hand he almost forgot to touch to his forehead let the father know she thought with no possibility of mistake why they would not be returning to larai rigal and the anger in her almost showed what she wanted sharra thought bitterly even as she smiled was to climb the cedar again past the branch that had broken under her and reaching the very topmost point to turn into a falcon that could fly over the shining of the lake and the glory of the gardens all alone a brute and the son is a callow fool shalhassan said leaning towards her so only the slaves who didnt matter could hear they all are said his daughter the one or the other the moon thinning down had risen late from her window she could see it surfacing from the eastern arm of the lake still she lingered within her room it would not do to arrive on time this man would have to learn that a princess of cathal did not scurry to a tryst like a servant from rhoden or some such northern place nonetheless the pulse under the fine skin of her wrist was beating far too fast a small thing between the fingers of your hands he had written which was true she could have him taken and garrotted for his effrontery it might even start a war which she told herself was irresponsible shalhassans daughter would greet this man with the courtesy due his rank and the secrecy the passion in him deserved of her he had come a long way through very great peril to see her he would have gracious words to carry back north from the gardens of cathal but no more presumption such as his had a price and this diarmuid of brennin would learn and she thought it would be well if he told her how he had crossed saeren it was a thing of no small importance to the land she would one day rule her breathing seemed to be under control the race of her pulse had slowed the image of the solitary falcon in her mind fell away as on a down drift of wind it was the heiress of cathal well schooled in duty and obligation who descended careful of her skirt down the easy branches of the tree outside her balcony the lienae glowed flying through the dark about her were woven the deep disturbing night scents of the flowers she walked under starlight and the crescent illumination of the moon sure of her way for the walled gardens for all their miles were her oldest home and she knew every step of all the paths a night walk such as this though was a vanished pleasure and she would be severely chastised if discovered and her servants would be flogged no matter she would not be discovered the palace guard patrolled the outer perimeter of the walls with their lanterns the gardens were another world where she walked the only lights were those of moon and stars and the hovering elusive lienae she heard the soft chirring of insects and the plashing of the sculpted waterfalls there was a breath of wind in the leaves and somewhere too in these gardens there was now a man who had written to her of what lips and hands might do she slowed a little on the thought crossing the fourth bridge the ravelle hearing the gentle sound of tamed water over colored stone no one she realized knew where she was and she knew nothing beyond rumor which did not reassure of the man who was waiting in the dark but courage was not lacking in her heart though it might be foolhardy and unwise sharra dressed in azure and gold one lapis lazuli pendant hanging between her breasts came over the bridge and past the curving of the path and saw the lyren tree there was no one there she had never doubted he would be waitingwhich given the hazards that had lain in his path was absurd a besotted romantic might somehow bribe a servant of hers to plant letters might promise an impossible tryst but a prince of brennin the heir even since his brothers exile would not dice his life away on a folly such as this for a woman hed never seen saddened and angry with herself for feeling so she walked the last few steps and stood under the golden branches of the lyren her long fingers smooth finally after years of abuse reached out to caress the bark of the trunk if you werent in a skirt you might join me up here but i dont imagine a princess can climb trees anyhow shall i come down the voice came from directly above her she checked a sudden motion and refused to look up ive climbed every climbable tree in these gardens she said evenly over the acceleration of her heart including this one and often in skirts i do not care to do so now if you are diarmuid of brennin then come down and if im not the tone for a supposedly infatuated lover was far too mocking she thought and she didnt answer nor did he wait there was a rustle in the leaves above then a thump beside her on the ground and then two hands took one of hers quite comprehensively and brought it not to his forehead but to his lips which was all right though he should have knelt what was not all right was that he should turn the hand over to kiss her palm and wrist she snatched her hand away horribly aware of the pounding of her heart she still hadnt even seen him clearly as if reading the thought he moved out of shadow to where the moonlight could find his bright tousled hair and he did drop to a knee thenletting the light fall like benediction on his face and so she did see finally the eyes wideset and deep were very blue under long almost feminine lashes the mouth was wide as well too much so and there was no softness in it or in the lines of the beardless chin he smiled though and not mockingly and she realized that from where he knelt she too was in the light to be seen well she began fools said diarmuid dan ailell they all told me you were beautiful said it sixteen different ways and she stiffened anger ready as a lash and by lisens eyes you are but no one ever told me there was cleverness in you i should have known shalhassans heir would have to have subtlety she was completely unprepared no one had ever said this off balance she fleetingly remembered all her venassars so effortlessly handled forgive me this man said rising to stand beside her very close i didnt know i was expecting to deal with a very young womanwhich you are not not in the ways that matter shall we walk will you show me your gardens and so she found herself in stride with him on the northern perimeter of the circle path and it seemed foolish and young to protest when he took her arm a question however insinuated itself as they moved in the scented darkness haloed by the lienae flying all about them if you thought me so simple how could you write me as you did she asked and felt her heartbeat slow again as a measure of control came back to her in his silence not so easily my friend she thought i am said diarmuid quite calmly somewhat helpless before beauty word of yours reached me some time ago you are more than i was told you were a neat enough answer for a northerner even honeytongued galienth might have approved but it was well within her ability to compass so although he was handsome and disturbing in the shadows beside her and his fingers on her arm kept shifting very slightly and once brushed the edge of her breast sharra now felt secure if there was a twist of regret another downward arc of the minds falcon she paid it no attention tvaren laid out larai rigal in the time of my greatgrandfather thallason whom you have cause to remember in the north the gardens cover many miles and are walled in their entirety including the lake which and so she went on as she had for all the venassars and though it was night now and the man beside her had a hand on her arm it really wasnt so very different after all i might kiss him she thought on the cheek as goodbye they had taken the crossing path at the faille bridge and began curving back north the moon was well clear of the trees now riding high in a sky laced with windblown clouds the breeze off the lake was pleasant and not too chilly she continued to talk easily still but increasingly aware of his silence of that and of the hand on her arm which had tightened and had grazed her breast again as they passed one of the waterfalls there is a bridge for each of the nine provinces she said and the flowers in each part of enough said diarmuid harshly she froze in midsentence he stopped walking and turned to face her on the path there was a calath bush behind her she had hidden there playing as a child he had released her arm when he spoke now after a long cold glance at her he turned and began walking again she moved quickly to keep up when he addressed her it was while staring straight ahead his voice low and intense you are speaking like someone scarcely a person if you want to play gracious princess with the petty lordlings who mince about courting you it is none of my affair but the lords of cathal are not petty sir they do not please insult us both that emasculated whippingboy this afternoon his father i would take great pleasure in killing bragon they are worse than petty all of them and if you speak to me as you do to them you cheapen both of us unbearably they had reached the lyren again somewhere within her a bird was stirring she moved ruthlessly to curb it as she had to my lord prince i must say i am surprised you can hardly expect less formal conversation in this our first but i do expect it i expect to see and hear the woman who was a girl who climbed all the trees in this garden the princess in her role bores me hurts me demeans tonight and what is tonight she asked and bit her lip as soon as she spoke ours he said and his arms were around her waist in the shadows of the lyren and his mouth descending was upon her own his head blocked the moon but her eyes had closed by then anyway and then the wide mouth on hers was moving and his tongue no she broke away violently and almost fell they faced each other a few feet apart her heart was a mad beating winged thing she had to control had to she was sharra daughter of dark rose he said his voice unsteady he took a step towards her no her hands were up to ward him diarmuid stopped looked at her trembling figure what do you fear in me he asked breathing was difficult she was conscious of her breasts of the wind about her the nearness of him and of a dark warmth at her center where how did you cross the river she blurted out she expected mockery again it would have helped his gaze was steady though and he stayed absolutely motionless i used a mages arrow and a rope he said i crossed hand over hand above the water and climbed a ladder cut into the cliff several hundred years ago i give you this as between you and me you will not tell she was princess of cathal i make no such promise for i cannot i will not betray you now in any way but secrets endangering my people and what do you think i did in telling you am i not heir to a throne just as you are she shook her head some voice within was wildly telling her to run but instead she spoke as carefully as she could you must not think my lord prince to win a daughter of shalhassan merely by coming here and sharra he cried speaking her name for the first time so that it rang in the night air like a bell tolling pain listen to yourself it is not just and they both heard it then the jangling clink of armor as the palace guard moved up on the other sideof the wall what was that a gravelly voice exclaimed and she knew it for devorsh captain of the guard there was a murmured reply then no i heard voices two of you go have a look inside take the dogs the sound of armored men walking off jarred the night somehow they were together under the tree she laid a hand on his arm if they find you they will kill you so you had better go incredibly his gaze on hers close and above was undisturbed if they find me they kill me said diarmuid if they can perhaps you will close my eyes as i once asked the expression changed then the voice roughened but i will not leave you now willingly though all of cathal come calling for my blood and gods gods all the gods his mouth on hers was so very sweet the touch of his hands blindingly sure his fingers were busy at the fastenings of her bodice and dear goddess her own hands were behind his head pulling him down to her her tongue sought his in hunger long denied her breasts suddenly released strained towards his touch and there was an ache in her a burning something wild being set free as he laid her down on the deep grass and his fingers touched her here and here and her clothes were gone from about her and his from him as well and then his body along hers was all the night and garden all the worlds and in her mind she saw the shadow of a falcon wings beating wide fly across the face of the high moon sharra from where they were outside the walls they heard the name cried out within the gardens what was that one of them exclaimed i heard voices two of you go have a look inside take the dogs two men moved quickly to obey the sharp command jogging urgently in the direction of the western gate but only for a few jangling strides after that kevin and coll stopped running and looped silently back to the concealing hollow where the others lay erron whose disguised voice had barked the order was already there the soldiers of cathal were at that moment flanked ten minutes walk away on either side the timing and the plan were diarmuids worked out as they lay watching and listening to the patrol in the early evening now they had nothing more to do but wait for him they settled quietly into the dark hollow a few slept using the time to advantage for they would be running back north as soon as the prince rejoined them there was no talk too wound up to rest properly kevin lay on his back and watched the slow transit of the moon several times they heard the guards cross and cross again in their circuit of the walls they waited the moon reached its zenith and began to slide west against the backdrop of summer stars carde saw him first a blackclad brighthaired figure on the top of the wall quickly carde checked right and left for the patrol but the timing again was flawless and rising briefly to be seen he gave a thumbsup sign seeing it diarmuid leaped rolled once and was up running lightly and low to the ground when he dropped into the hollow beside them kevin saw that he was carrying a flower hair dishevelled doublet loose and half unbuttoned the princes eyes flashed with an intoxicated hilarity done he said raising the flower in salute to all of them ive plucked the fairest rose in shalhassans garden chapter he will be found i promise it so he had said a rash promise and uncharacteristic but it had been made so at about the time paul and kevin began their ride south with diarmuid loren silvercloak was galloping north and east alone in search of dave martyniuk it was rare for the mage to be solitaryalone he was stripped of his powersbut hed needed matt to stay in the palace the more so since word had come of the dead svart in the garden it was a bad time to be away but his choices were limited and so too were the people he could trust so north he rode gradually curving eastward through the grain land amid the dry crackle of the ruinous summer all that day and the next he traveled and not slowly for a sense of urgency was strong within him he paused only to ask discreet questions in the farmyards and halfempty towns through which he passed and to note again and despairingly the impact of famine on those to whom he spoke there was no word though no one had seen the tall darkhaired stranger or heard tell of him so on the third morning loren mounted early from where hed passed the night in a copse of trees to the west of lake leinan looking eastward he could see the sun rising from the line of hills past the lake and he knew dun maura lay beyond even by daylight with a blue sky above there was for the mage a darkness about that place there was no love lost between the mormae of gwen ystrat and the mages who had followed amairgens lead out from the dominion of the mother blood magic thought loren shaking his head picturing dun maura and the rites of liadon enacted every year before conary came and forbade them he thought of the flowers strewn by the maidens chanting his death and return as the spring rahod hedai liadon in every world the mage knew but his very soul rebelled against the darkness of this power grimly he turned his horse away from the country of the priestesses and continued north following the latham on the long ride to the plain he would ask aid of the dalrei as he had so often done before if dave martyniuk was somewhere among the great spaces of the plain only the riders could find him so north he rode a tall grey bearded figure no longer young alone on a horse in the wide sweep of the level lands and the baked earth resonated beneath him like a drum he was hoping even though it was summer to find a tribe of the riders in the south plain for if he could speak to even one tribe then word would be sent to celidon and once his message was lodged at the midplain then soon all the dalrei would know and the dalrei he trusted it was a long ride though and there were no villages now among the broad grazing lands in which he could take food or rest and so he was still galloping alone as that third day drew towards sundown and then dark his shadow lay long on the earth beside him and the river had become a glimmering muted presence to the east when the urgency that had lain within him since he had left paras derval exploded into terror grappling at the reins he brought his mount to a rearing halt then held it rigidly still one moment he remained so his face drawn suddenly tight with fear then loren silvercloak cried aloud in the onrushing night and wheeled his horse hard to ride in the dark back back towards paras derval where something overwhelming was about to happen drumming furiously home under the stars he gathered his mind and hurled a desperate warning southward over all the empty leagues that lay between he was too far away though much too far away and without his power he urged his horse faster driving like wind in the darkness but he knew even as he did so that he was going to be too late jennifer was not happy not only was dave missing not only had kevin and paul ridden off that morning on some crazy expedition with diarmuid but now kim had left as well with matt guiding her to the home of the old woman whom people in the great hall the day before had called a witch which left her in a large room on the cooler west side of the palace sitting in a low window seat surrounded by a gaggle of court ladies whose principal yearning in life seemed to be to elicit all they could from her about kevin laine and paul schafer with special and explicit focus on their sexual predilections parrying the questions as best she could she barely managed to conceal a growing irritation on the far side of the room a man was playing a stringed instrument under a tapestry depicting a scene of battle there was a dragon flying over the conflict she hoped profoundly that it was a mythical confrontation the ladies had all been briefly presented to her but only two names had registered laesha was the very young browneyed ladyinwaiting who seemed to have been assigned to her she was quiet which was a blessing the other was the lady rheva a striking darkhaired woman who clearly enjoyed a higher status than the others and to whom jennifer had taken an effortless dislike nor was this in any degree lessened when it became clear because rheva made it clear that shed spent the night before with kevin it was evidently a triumph in a continuing game of oneupmanship and rheva was exploiting it for all it was worth it was aggravating in the extreme and jennifer abandoned was in no mood to be aggravated so when another of the women gave a sulky toss of her hair and inquired whether jennifer had any idea why paul schafer had been so indifferent to herdoes he perhaps prefer to spend his nights with boys she asked with a barb of malicejennifers brief laugh was entirely humorless there are more obvious possibilities i should think she replied aware that she was making an enemy paul is somewhat discriminating thats all there was a brief silence someone tittered then are you suggesting by any chance that kevin is not it was rheva and her voice had gone very soft jennifer could handle this what she could not handle was having it continue she rose abruptly from the window seat and looking down on the other woman smiled no she said judiciously knowing kevin i wouldnt say that at all the trick though is to get him twice and she moved past them all and out the door walking swiftly down the corridor she made a very firm mental note to inform kevin laine that if he took a certain court lady to bed once more she would never speak to him again as long as she lived at the doorway to her room she heard her name being called her long skirt trailing the stone floor laesha came hurrying up jennifer eyed her inimically but the other woman was laughing breathlessly oh my she gasped laying a hand on jennifers arm that was wonderful the cats in that room are spitting with anger rheva hasnt been handled like that for years jennifer shook her head ruefully i dont imagine theyll be very friendly the rest of the time im here they wouldnt have been anyway you are much too beautiful on top of your being new its guaranteed to make them hate you for existing and when diarmuid put out word yesterday that you were reserved for him they he what jennifer exploded laesha eyed her carefully well he is the prince and so i dont care who he is i have no intention of letting him touch me who do they think we are laeshas expression had altered a little you mean that she asked hesitantly you dont want him not at all said jennifer should i i do said laesha simply and flushed to the roots of her brown hair there was an awkward silence speaking carefully jennifer broke it i am only here two weeks she said i will not take him from you or anyone else i need a friend right now more than anything else laeshas eyes were wide she took a short breath why do you think i followed you this time they shared the smile tell me jennifer asked after a moment is there any reason we have to stay in here i havent been outside at all can we see the town of course said laesha of course we can we havent been at war for years despite the heat it was better outside the palace dressed in an outfit much like laeshas jennifer realized that no one knew she was a stranger feeling freed by that she found herself strolling at ease beside her new friend after a short while though she became aware that a man was following them through the dusty twisting streets of the town laesha noticed it too hes one of diarmuids she whispered which was a nuisance but before he had left in the morning kevin had told her about the dead svart alfar in the garden and jennifer had decided that for once she wasnt about to object to having someone watch over her her father she thought wryly would find it amusing the two women walked along a street where blacksmiths iron rang upon anvils overhead balconies of secondfloor houses leaned out over the narrow roadway blocking the sunlight at intervals turning left at a crossing of lanes laesha led her past an open area where the noise and the smell of food announced a market slowing to look jennifer saw that even in a time of festival there didnt seem to be much produce on display following her glance laesha shook her head slightly and continued up a narrow alleyway pausing at length outside a shop door through which could be seen bales and bolts of cloth laesha it seemed wanted a new pair of gloves while her friend went inside jennifer moved on a few steps drawn by the sound of childrens laughter reaching the end of the cobbled lane she saw that it ran into a wide square with a grassy area more brown than green in the center and upon the grass fifteen or twenty children were playing some sort of counting game smiling faintly jennifer stopped to watch the children were gathered in a loose circle about the slim figure of a girl most of them were laughing but the girl in the center was not she gestured suddenly and a boy came forward from the ring with a strip of cloth and with a gravity that matched her own began to bind it over her eyes that done he rejoined the ring at his nod the children linked hands and began to revolve in a silence eerie after the laughter around the motionless figure blindfolded in the center they moved gravely and with dignity a few other people had stopped to watch then without warning the blindfolded girl raised an arm and pointed it towards the moving ring her high clear voice rang out over the green when the wandering fire strikes the heart of stone will you follow and on the last word the circling stopped the girls finger was leveled directly at a stocky boy who without any hesitation released the hands on either side of him and walked into the ring the circle closed itself and began moving again still in silence i never tire of watching this a cool voice said from just behind jennifer she turned quickly to confront a pair of icy green eyes and the long red hair of the high priestess jaelle behind the priestess she could see a group of her greyclad attendants and out of the corner of her eye she noticed diarmuids man edging nervously closer to them jennifer nodded a greeting then turned back to watch the children jaelle stepped forward to stand beside her her white robe brushing the cobblestones of the street the takiena is as old as any ritual we have she murmured in jennifers ear look at the people watching and indeed although the faces of the children seemed almost unnaturally serene the adults who had gathered at the edge of the square or in shop archways wore expressions of wonder and apprehension and there were more people gathering again the girl in the ring raised her arm when the wandering fire strikes the heart of stone will you follow will you leave your home and again the circling stopped on the last word this time the extended finger pointed to another of the boys older and lankier than the first with only a brief almost ironic pause he too released the hands he was holding and walked forward to stand by the other chosen one a murmur rose from the watchers but the children seemingly oblivious were circling again unsettled jennifer turned to the impassive profile of the priestess what is it she asked what are they doing jaelle smiled thinly it is a dance of prophecy their fate lies in when they are called but what watch the blindfolded girl standing straight and tall was chanting again when the wandering fire strikes the heart of stone will you follow will you leave your home will you leave your life this time when the voice and the dancing stopped together a deep sound of protest ran through the watching crowd for the one chosen now was one of the youngest girls with a toss of her honeycolored hair and a cheerful smile she stepped into the ring beside the two boys the taller one placed an arm around her shoulders jennifer turned to jaelle what does it mean she asked what kind of prophecy the question trailed off beside her the priestess was silent there was no gentleness in the lines of her face nor compassion in her eyes as she watched the children begin to move again you ask what it means she said at length not much in these soft times when the takiena is only another game that last one they now say means only that she will leave the life her family has led her expression was unreadable but an irony in the tone reached jennifer what was it before she asked this time jaelle did turn to look at her the dance has been done by children for longer than anyone can remember in harsher days that call meant death of course which would be a pity shes an attractive child isnt she there was a malicious amusement in the voice watch closely jaelle continued this last one they truly fear even now and indeed the people around and behind them had grown suddenly quiet with strained anticipation in the stillness jennifer could hear the sounds of laughter from the market several streets over it seemed farther than that in the circle on the green the blindfolded girl raised her arm and began the chant for the final time when the wandering fire strikes the heart of stone will you follow will you leave your home will you leave your life will you take the longest road the dancing stopped her heart pounding inexplicably jennifer saw that the slim finger was pointing unerringly at the boy who had carried the blindfold raising his head as if hearing some faroff music the boy stepped forward the girl removed her blindfold they regarded each other a long moment then the boy turned laid a hand as if in benediction on the other chosen ones and walked alone from the green jaelle watching him go wore a troubled expression for the first time glancing at her unguarded features jennifer realized with a start how young the woman beside her was about to speak she was checked by the sound of crying and turning her head she saw a woman standing in the doorway of a shop behind them in the lane there were tears pouring down her face jaelle followed jennifers glance his mother the priestess said softly feeling utterly helpless jennifer had an instinctive longing to offer comfort to the woman their eyes met and on the face of the other woman jennifer saw with an aching twist of new understanding a distillation of all a mothers sleepless nights a message a recognition seemed to pass for an instant between the two of them then the mother of the boy chosen for the longest road turned her head away and went into her shop jennifer struggling with something unexpected finally asked jaelle why is she hurting so much the priestess too was a little subdued it is difficult she said and not a thing i understand yet but they have done the dance twice before this summer i am told and both times finn was chosen for the road this is the third and in gwen ystrat we are taught that three times touches destiny jennifers expression drew a smile from the priestess come she said we can talk at the temple her tone was if not exactly friendly at least milder than hitherto on the verge of accepting jennifer was stopped by a cough behind her she turned diarmuids man had moved up to them sharp concern creasing his face my lady he said acutely embarrassed forgive me but might i speak with you in private for a moment you fear me drance jaelles voice was like a knife again she laughed or should i say your master does your absent master the stocky soldier flushed but held his ground i have been ordered to watch over her he said tersely jennifer looked from one to the other there was suddenly an electric hostility shimmering in the air she felt disoriented understanding none of it well she said to drance trying to pick her way i dont want to get you in troublewhy dont you just come with us jaelle threw her head back and laughed again to see the mans terrified recoil yes drance she said her tone coruscating why dont you come to the temple of the mother with us my lady drance stammered appealing to jennifer please i dare not do that but i must guard you you must not go there ah said jaelle her eyebrows arched maliciously it seems that the men here are already saying what you can or cannot do forgive me my invitation i thought i was dealing with a free visitor jennifer was not oblivious to the manipulation and she remembered kevins words that morning as well theres some danger here hed said soberly trust diarmuids men and matt of course paul says be careful of the priestess dont go anywhere on your own in the dawn shadows of the palace it had made a good deal of sense but now in bright afternoon sunlight the whole thing was rankling just a little who was kevin making his way through the court ladies then galloping off with the prince to tell her to sit tight like a dutiful little girl and now this man of diarmuids about to speak she remembered something else she turned to jaelle there seems to be some real concern for our safety here i would like to place myself under your protection while i visit your temple will you name me a guestfriend before i go a frown flicked across jaelles face but it was chased away by a slow smile and there was triumph in her eyes of course she said sweetly of course i will she raised her voice so that her words rang out over the street and people turned to look lifting her arms wide fingers spread she intoned in the name of gwen ystrat and the mormae of the mother i name you guest of the goddess you are welcome in our sanctuaries and your wellbeing shall be my own concern jennifer looked to drance questioningly his expression was not reassuring if possible he appeared even more consternated than before jennifer had no idea if shed done right or wrong or even of exactly what shed done but she was tired of standing in the middle of the street with everyone watching her thank you she said to jaelle in that case i will come with you if you like she added turning to drance and to laesha who had just scurried up her new gloves in hand and an apprehensive look in her eye you can both wait outside for me come then said jaelle and smiled it was a lowset building and even the central dome seemed too close to the ground until jennifer realized as she passed through the arched entrance that most of it was underground the temple of the mother goddess lay east of the town on the palace hill a narrow pathway wound its way further up the hill leading to a gate in the walls surrounding the palace gardens there were trees lining the path they seemed to be dying once they were inside the sanctuary the greyrobed attendants melted away into shadow as jaelle led jennifer forward through another arch it brought them into the room under the dome at the far side of the sunken chamber jennifer saw a great black altar stone behind it resting in a carved block of wood stood a double axe each face ground into the shape of a crescent moon one waxing one waning there was nothing else inexplicably jennifer felt her mouth go dry looking at the axe with its wickedly sharpened blades she fought to repress a shudder do not fight it jaelle said her voice echoing in the empty chamber it is your power ours so it was once and will be again in our time if she should find us worthy jennifer stared at her the flamehaired high priestess in her sanctuary seemed more keenly beautiful than ever her eyes gleamed with an intensity that was the more disturbing because of how cold it was power and pride it spoke nothing of tenderness and no more of her youth glancing at jaelles long fingers jennifer wondered if they had ever gripped that axe had ever brought it sweeping down upon the altar down upon and then she realized that she was in a place of sacrifice jaelle turned without haste i wanted you to see this she said now come my chambers are cool we can drink and talk she adjusted the collar of her robe with a graceful hand and led the way from the room as they left a breeze seemed to slide through the chamber and jennifer thought she saw the axe sway gently in its rest and so the priestess said as they reclined on cushions on the floor in her room your socalled companions have abandoned you for their own pleasures it was not a question jennifer blinked hardly fair she began wondering how the other woman knew you might say ive left them to come here she tried a smile you might jaelle agreed pleasantly but it would be untrue the two men left at dawn with the princeling and your friend has run off to the hag by the lake midway through the sentence her voice had dipped itself into acid leading jennifer to realize abruptly that she was under attack in this room she parried to get her balance kims with the seer yes why do you call her a hag jaelle was no longer so pleasant i am not used to explaining myself she said neither am i replied jennifer quickly which may limit this conversation somewhat she leaned back on the cushions and regarded the other woman jaelles reply when it came was harsh with emotion she is a traitor well thats not the same as a hag you know jennifer said aware that she was arguing like kevin a traitor to the king you mean i wouldnt have thought youd care and yesterday jaelles bitter laugh stopped her no not to the old fool she took a breath the woman you call ysanne was the youngest person ever to be named to the mormae of the goddess in gwen ystrat she left she broke an oath when she left she betrayed her power she betrayed you personally you mean jennifer said staying on the offensive dont be a fool i wasnt even alive no you seem pretty upset about it though why did she leave for no reason that could suffice nothing could suffice the clues were all there she left for a man then i take it jennifer said the ensuing silence was her answer at length jaelle spoke again her voice bitter cold she sold herself for a body at night may the hag die soon and lie lost forever jennifer swallowed a pointscoring exchange had suddenly been turned into something else not very forgiving are you she managed not at all jaelle replied swiftly you would do well to remember it why did loren leave for the north this morning i dont know jennifer stammered shocked by the naked threat you dont a strange thing to do is it not to bring guests to the palace then ride off alone leaving matt behind which is very strange i wonder said jaelle i wonder who he was looking for how many of you really did cross it was too sudden too shrewd jennifer heart pounding was aware that she had flushed you look warm jaelle said all solicitude do have some wine she poured from a longnecked silver decanter really she continued it is most uncharacteristic of loren to abandon guests so suddenly i wouldnt know jennifer said there are four of us none of us knows him very well the wine is excellent it is from morvran i am glad you like it i could swear metran asked him to bring five of you so loren had been wrong someone did know someone knew a great deal indeed who is metran jennifer asked disingenuously was he the old man you frightened so much yesterday balked jaelle leaned back on her own cushions in the silence jennifer sipped her wine pleased to see that her hand was steady you trust him dont you the priestess said bitterly he has warned you against me they all have silvercloak angles for power here as much as anyone but you have aligned yourself with the men it seems tell me which of them is your lover or has diarmuid found your bed yet which was quite sufficient thank you jennifer shot to her feet her wine glass spilled she ignored it is this how you treat a guest she burst out i came here in good faithwhat right have you to say such things to me im not aligned with anyone in your stupid power games im only here for a few daysdo you think i care who wins your little battles ill tell you one thing though she went on breathing hard im not happy about male control in my world either but ive never in my life met anyone as screwed up on the subject as you are if ysanne fell in lovewell i doubt you can even guess what that feels like white and rigid jaelle looked up at her then rose in her turn you may be right she said softly but something tells me that you have no idea what it feels like either which gives us a thing in common doesnt it back in her room a short while later jennifer closed the door on laesha and drance and cried about that for a long time the day crawled forward webbed in heat a dry unsettling wind rose in the north and slid through the high kingdom stirring the dust in the streets of paras derval like an uneasy ghost the sun westering at the end of day shone red only at twilight was there any relief as the wind shifted to the west and the first stars came out in the sky over brennin very late that night north and west of the capital the breeze stirred the waters of a lake to muted murmuring on a wide rock by the shore under the lacework of the stars an old woman knelt cradling the slight form of a younger one on whose finger a red ring shone with a muted glimmering after a long time ysanne rose and called for tyrth limping he came from the cottage and picking up the unconscious girl walked back and laid her down in the bed hed made that afternoon she remained unconscious for the rest of the night and all the next day ysanne did not sleep but watched her through the hours of darkness and then in the searing brightness of the following day and on the face of the old seer was an expression only one man long dead would have recognized kimberly woke at sunset away to the south in that moment kevin and paul were taking up their positions with diarmuids men outside the walls of larai rigal for a moment kim was completely disoriented then the seer watched as a brutal surge of knowledge came flooding into the grey eyes lifting her head kim gazed at the old woman outside tyrth could be heard shutting up the animals for the night the cat lay on the window sill in the last of the evening light welcome back said ysanne kim smiled it took an effort i went so far she shook her head wonderingly then her mouth tightened at another recollection eilathen has gone yes i saw him dive i saw where he went into the green far down it is very beautiful there i know said the seer again kim drew breath before speaking was it hard for you to watch at that ysanne looked away for the first time then yes she said yes it was hard remembering kims hand slipped from the coverlet and covered that of the old woman when ysanne spoke again it was very low raederth was first of the mages before ailell was king he came one day to morvran on the shores of lake leinan you know what lies in gwen ystrat i know said kimberly i saw dun maura he came to the temple by the lake and stayed there a night which was brave for there is no love in that place for any of the mages since amairgens day raederth was a brave man though he saw me there ysanne continued i was seventeen and newly chosen to be of the mormaethe inner circleand no one so young had ever been chosen before but raederth saw me that night and he marked me for something else as you did me as i did you he knew me for a seer and he took me away from the mother and changed my fate or found it for me and you loved him yes ysanne said simply from the first and i miss him still though all the years have run away from us he brought me here at midsummer more than fifty years ago and summoned eilathen with the flowerfire and the spirit spun for me as he did for you last night and raederth kim asked after a moment he died three years after of an arrow ordered by garmisch the high king ysanne said flatly when raederth was slain duke ailell rose in rhoden and began the war that broke the rule of garmisch and the garantae and took him to the throne kimberly nodded again i saw that too i saw him kill the king before the palace gate he was brave and tall ailell and wise a wise king all his days he wedded marrien of the garantae and named metran her cousin first mage to follow raederth which angered me then and i told him so but ailell was trying to knit a sundered kingdom and he did he deserved more love than he has had he had yours late ysanne said and grudgingly and only as king i tried to help him though with his burden and in return he found ways to ensure that i would be left alone here a long time alone kim said softly we all have our tasks the seer said there was a silence in the barn out back a cow lowed plaintively kim heard the click of a gate being shut then tyrths uneven steps crossing the yard she met ysannes gaze a halfsmile tugging at her mouth you told me one lie yesterday she said ysanne nodded i did one it was not my truth to tell i know said kim you have carried a great deal alone i am here now though do you want me to share your burden her mouth crooked i seem to be a chalice what power can you fill me with there was a tear in the old womans eye she wiped it away shaking her head such things as i can teach have little to do with power it is in your dreams now that you must walk as all the seers must and for you as well there is the stone kim glanced down the ring on her right hand was no longer shining as it had when eilathen wore it it glowered deep and dark the color of old blood i did dream this she said a terrible dream the night before we crossed what is it ysanne the baelrath it was named long ago the warstone it is of the wild magic the seer said a thing not made by man and it cannot be controlled like the shapings of ginserat or amairgen or even of the priestesses it has been lost for a very long time which has happened before it is never found without reason or so the old tales say it had grown dark outside as they talked why have you given it to me kim asked in a small voice because i dreamt it on your finger too which somehow she had known would be the answer the ring pulsed balefully inimically and she feared it what was i doing she asked raising the dead ysanne replied and stood to light the candles in the room kim closed her eyes the images were waiting for her the jumbled stones the wide grasslands rolling away in the dark the ring on her hand burning like a fire in the dream and the wind rising over the grass whistling between the stones oh god she cried aloud what is it ysanne the seer returned to her seat beside the bed and gravely regarded the girl who lay there wrestling with what lay upon her i am not sure of this she said so i must be careful but there is a pattern shaping here you see he died in your world the first time who died kim whispered the warrior who always dies and is not allowed to rest it is his doom kims hands were clenched why there was a great wrong done at the very beginning of his days and for that he may not have rest it is told and sung and written in every world where he has fought fought her heart was pounding of course ysanne replied though gently still he is the warrior who may be called only at darkest need and only by magic and only when summoned by name her voice was like wind in the room and his name the secret one no man knows or even where it is to be sought but there is another by which he is always spoken and that is though now she knew and a star was in the window ysanne spoke the name he was probably wrong to be lingering but the commands had not been explicit and he was not overly prone to let it disturb him it intoxicated them all to be abroad in the open spaces using forgotten arts of concealment to observe the festival traffic on the roads to and from paras derval and though by day the charred land dismayed them at night they sang the oldest songs under the unclouded glitter of the stars he himself had a further reason for waiting though he knew the delay could not be prolonged indefinitely one more day he had promised himself and felt extravagantly gratified when the two women and the man crested the ridge above the thicket matt was quietly reassuring kim was in good hands and though he didnt know where diarmuids band had goneand preferred it that way he added with a grimacethey were expected back that night loren he confirmed had indeed gone in search of dave for the first time since her encounter with the high priestess two days before jennifer relaxed a little more unsettled by the strangeness of everything than she liked to admit she had spent yesterday quietly with laesha in jennifers room the two new friends had traded accounts of their lives it was somehow easier jennifer had reflected to approach fionavar in this way than to step out into the heat and confront things such as the childrens chanting on the green the axe swaying in the temple or jaelles cold hostility there had been dancing after the banquet that night she had expected some difficulty in dealing with the men but against her will shed ended up being amused at the careful almost apprehensive propriety of those who danced with her women claimed by prince diarmuid were very clearly off limits to anyone else shed excused herself early and had gone to bed to be awakened by matt sören knocking at her door the dwarf devoted the morning to her an attentive guide through the vastness of the palace roughly garbed with an axe swinging at his side he was a harshly anomalous figure in the hallways and chambers of the castle he showed her rooms with paintings on the walls and inlaid patterns on the floor everywhere there were tapestries she was beginning to see that they had a deeper significance here they climbed to the highest tower where the guards greeted matt with unexpected deference and looking out she saw the high kingdom baking in the rigor of its summer then he led her back to the great hall empty now where she could gaze undisturbed at the windows of delevan as they circled the room she told him about her meeting with jaelle two days ago the dwarf blinked when she explained how she was made guestfriend and again when she described jaelles questions about loren but once more he reassured her she is all malice jaelle all bright bitter malice but she is not evil only ambitious she hates ysanne she hates diarmuid ysanne she would hate diarmuid arouses strong feelings in most people the dwarfs mouth twisted in his difficult smile she seeks to know every secret there is jaelle may suspect we had a fifth person but even if she were certain she would never tell gorlaeswho is someone to be wary of weve hardly seen him he is with ailell almost all the time which is why he is to be feared it was a dark day for brennin matt sören said when the elder prince was sent away the king turned to gorlaes jennifer guessed the dwarfs glance at her was keen you are clever he said that is exactly what happened what about diarmuid what about diarmuid matt repeated in a tone so unexpectedly exasperated she laughed aloud after a moment the dwarf chuckled too low in his chest jennifer smiled there was a solid strength to matt sören a feeling of deeply rooted common sense jennifer lowell had come into adulthood trusting few people entirely especially men but she realized in that moment the dwarf was now one of them in a curious way it made her feel better about herself matt she said as a thought struck her loren left without you did you stay here for us just to keep an eye on things with a gesture at the patch over his right eye he turned it into a kind of joke she smiled but then looked at him a long moment her green eyes sober how did you get that the last war with cathal he said simply thirty years ago youve been here that long longer loren has been a mage for over forty years now so she didnt get the connection he told her there was an easiness to the mood they shared that morning and jennifers beauty had been known to make taciturn men talkative before she listened taking in as paul had three nights before the story of amairgens discovery of the skylore and the secret forging that would bind mage and source for life in a union more complete than any in all the worlds when matt finished jennifer rose and walked a few steps trying to absorb the impact of what she had been told this was more than marriage this went to the very essence of being the mage from what matt had just said was nothing without his source only a repository of knowledge utterly powerless and the source youve surrendered all of your independence she said turning back to the dwarf hurling it almost as a challenge not all he said mildly you give some up any time you share your life with someone the bonding just goes deeper and there are compensations you were a king though you gave up that was before matt interrupted before i met loren i prefer not to talk about it she was abashed im sorry she whispered i was prying the dwarf grimaced but by now she knew it for his smile not really he said and no matter it is a very old wound its just so strange she explained i cant even grasp what it must mean i know even here they do not understand the six of us or the law that governs the council of the mages we are feared respected very seldom loved what law she asked at that he hesitated then rose let us walk matt said i will tell you a story though i warn you you would do better with one of the cyngael for i am a poor talespinner ill take my chances jennifer said with a smile as they started to walk the outer edges of the hall he began four hundred years ago the high king went mad vailerth was his name the only son of lernath who was the last king of brennin to die on the summer tree she had questions about that too but held her peace vailerth was brilliant as a child matt continued or so the records from that time say but it seems something bent in him after his father died and he came to the throne a dark flower blossomed in his brain the dwarves say when such a thing occurs first mage to vailerth was a man called nilsom whose source was a woman aideen was her name and she had loved nilsom all her life or so the records tell matt walked a few strides in silence jennifer had the feeling he was sorry to have begun the story but after a moment he resumed it was rare for a mage to have a woman for source in part because in gwen ystrat where the priestesses of dana are they would curse any woman who did so it was always rare it is rarer still since aideen she looked over at him but the dwarfs features were quite impassive many dark things fell out because of vailerths madness at length there came talk of civil war in the land because he began taking children boys and girls both from their homes and bringing them into the palace by night they would never be seen again and the rumors of what the high king did to them were very bad and in these deeds in all of these deeds of darkness nilsom was with the king and some say it was he who goaded vailerth into them theirs was a dark weaving and nilsom with aideen by his side had power so great none dared openly gainsay them it is my own thought the dwarf added turning his head for the first time that he too was mad but in a cooler more dangerous fashion it was a long time ago however and the records are incomplete because many of our most precious books were destroyed in the war there was war at the last for one day vailerth and nilsom went too far they proposed to go into the godwood and cut down the summer tree the whole of brennin rose up then save for the army vailerth had raised but that army was loyal and strong and nilsom was very strong more so than the five other mages in brennin all together and then on the eve of war there was only one other mage for four of them were found dead and their sources too there was civil war in the high kingdom then only gwen ystrat stayed aloof but the dukes of rhoden and seresh the wardens of the north march and the south the farmers and the townsmen and the mariners from taerlindel all came to war against vailerth and nilsom they were not enough nilsoms power then sourced in aideens strength and her love was greater they say than that of any mage since amairgen he wrought death and ruination among all who opposed them and blood soaked the fields as brother slew brother while vailerth laughed in paras derval once more matt paused and when he resumed there was a flatness in his voice the last battle was fought in the hilly land just west of us between here and the godwood vailerth they say climbed to the topmost towers of this palace to watch nilsom lead his army to the final victory after which nothing but the dead would stand between them and the tree but when the sun rose that morning aideen went before her mage whom she loved and she told him she would no longer drain herself for him in this cause and saying so she drew forth a knife and drained the lifes blood from her veins instead and so died oh no jennifer said oh matt he seemed not to have heard there is little after that he said still very flat with nilsom powerless the army of vailerth was overrun they threw down their swords and spears and sued for peace nilsom would not do so and in the end he was killed by the last mage in brennin vailerth leaped from his tower and died aideen was buried with honor in a grave close by the mörnirwood and duke lagos of seresh was crowned in this hall they had come full circle back to the benches under the last window close to the throne overhead colans yellow hair was brilliant in the sunlight that poured through the windows it remains only to tell you matt sören said gazing directly at her now that when the council of mages gathers at midwinter nilsoms is a name whose memory we curse by ritual i should think said jennifer with some spirit so too said the dwarf softly is the name of aideen what matts gaze was unwavering she betrayed her mage he said in the laws of our order there is no crime so deep none no matter what the cause every year loren and i curse her memory at midwinter and we do so truly and every year he added very low very gently when the snows melt in the spring we lay the first of the wildflowers on her grave from that composed glance jennifer turned her head away she felt close to tears she was too far from home and it was all so difficult and so strange why should such a woman be cursed it was too hard what she needed she realized was exercise fifty hard laps in a pool to clear her head or else and better still oh matt she said i need to move to do something are there horses for us to ride and of all things that cracked the solid composure of the dwarf astonishingly he flushed there are horses of course he said awkwardly but i fear i will not join youdwarves do not ride for pleasure why dont you go with laesha and drance though okay she said but then lingered unwilling suddenly to leave him im sorry if i have troubled you matt said it is a difficult story jennifer shook her head more for you surely than for me thank you for sharing it thanks for a lot and bending swiftly she kissed him on the cheek and ran from the hall to find laesha leaving a normally phlegmatic dwarf in a remarkably unsettled state and so did it come to pass three hours later that the two women had galloped with diarmuids man to the crest of a ridge east of the town where they stilled their tired horses in disbelief as a small party of ethereal figures ascended the slope towards them their tread so light the grass seemed not to bend beneath their feet welcome said their leader as he stopped before them he bowed his long silver hair glinting in the light this hour is brightly woven his voice was like music in a high place he spoke directly to jennifer she was aware that drance beside her the prosaic soldier had tears shining on his transfigured face will you come down among the trees and feast with us this evening the silverhaired figure asked you are most welcome my name is brendel of the kestrel mark from daniloth we are the lios alfar the return to brennin was almost effortless as if they were being propelled homeward by a following wind erron fluid and agile went first again on the climb back up the cliff and he hammered iron spikes into the rock face for the rest of them they came again to the horses mounted and began galloping north once more on the dusty roads of the high kingdom the mood was exhilarated and chaotic joining in the bawdy chorus of a song coll was leading kevin couldnt remember feeling happier after the incident on the river he and paul seemed to have been completely accepted by the band and because he respected these men that acceptance mattered erron was becoming a friend and so too was carde singing away on kevins left side paul on the other side wasnt singing but he didnt seem unhappy and he had a lousy voice anyway just past midday they came to the same inn where they had stopped before diarmuid called a halt for lunch and a quick beer which became given the prevailing mood several slow beers coll kevin noticed had disappeared the extended break meant that they were going to miss the banquet in the great hall that night diarmuid didnt seem to care its the black boar tonight my friends he announced glittering and exhilarated at the head of the table im in no mood for court manners tonight i celebrate with you and let the manners look after themselves tonight we take our pleasure will you drink with me to the dark rose of cathal kevin cheered with the others drank with the others kimberly had dreamt again the same one at first the stones the ring the windand the same grief in her heart and again she woke just as the words of power reached her lips this time though she had fallen asleep again to find another dream waiting as if at the bottom of a pool she was in the room of ailell the king she saw him tossing restlessly on his bed saw the young page asleep on his pallet even as she watched ailell woke in the dark of his chamber a long time he lay still breathing raggedly then she saw him rise painfully as if against his own desire he lit a candle and carried it to an inner doorway in the room through which he passed invisible insubstantial she followed the king down a corridor lit only by the weaving candle he bore and she paused with him before another door into which was set a sliding viewhole when ailell put his eyes to the aperture somehow she was looking with him seeing what he saw and kimberly saw with the high king the white naal fire and the deep blue shining of ginserats stone set into the top of its pillar only after a long time did ailell withdraw and in the dream kim saw herself move to look again standing on tiptoe to gaze with her own eyes into the room of the stone and looking in she saw no stone at all and the room was dark wheeling in terror she saw the high king walking back towards his chamber and waiting there for him in the doorway was a shadowed figure that she knew his face rigid as if it were stone paul schafer stood before ailell and he was holding a chess piece in his outstretched hand and coming nearer to them kim saw that it was the white king and it was broken there was a music all about them that she couldnt recognize although she knew she should ailell spoke words she could not hear because the music was too loud and then paul spoke and she needed desperately to hear but the music and then the king held high his candle and began to speak again and she could not could not could not then everything was blasted to nothingness by the howling of a dog so loud it filled the universe and she awoke to the morning sunlight and the smell of food frying over the cooking fire good morning said ysanne come and eat before malka steals it all then i have something to show you coll rejoined them on the road north of the town paul schafer eased his horse over to the roan stallion the big man rode being discreet he asked above his broken nose coils eyes were guarded not exactly but he wanted to do something which means the man had to die but his wife and children can be helped so youve paid them is that why he delayed just now in the tavern to give you time it wasnt just because he felt like drinking was it coll nodded he often feels like drinking he said wryly but he very rarely acts without reason tell me he went on as schafer remained silent do you think he did wrong pauls expression was unreadable gorlaes would have hanged him coll pressed and had the body torn apart his family would have been dispossessed of their land now his eldest son is going to south keep to be trained as one of us do you really think he did wrong no said schafer slowly im just thinking that with everyone else starving that farmers treason was probably the best way he could find to take care of his family do you have a family coll to which diarmuids lieutenant who didnt and who was still trying to like this strange visitor had no reply at all they rode north through the heat of the afternoon the dry fields baking on either side the far hills shimmering like mirages or the hope of rain the trap door under the table had been invisible until ysanne kneeling had laid her hand on the floor and spoken a word of power there were ten stairs leading down on either side the rough stone walls were damp to the touch there were brackets set into the walls but no torches because from the bottom of the stairs came a pale glow of light wondering kim followed the seer and malka the cat as they went down the chamber was small more a cave than a room another bed a desk a chair a woven carpet on the stone floor some parchments and books very old by the look of them on the desk only one thing more against the far wall was set a cabinet with glass doors and within the cabinet like a captured star lay the source of light there was awe in the seers voice when she broke the silence every time i see this ysanne murmured it is the circlet of lisen she said walking forward it was made for her by the lios alfar in the days when pendaran wood was not yet a place of dread she bound it on her brow after they built the anor for her and she stood in that tower by the sea a light like a star on her brow to show amairgen the way home from cader sedat and he never came kims voice though she whispered felt harsh to her own ears eilathen showed me i saw her die the circlet she saw was purest gold but the light set within it was gentler than moonfall she died and pendaran does not forgive it is one of the deep sorrows of the world so much changed even the light it was brighter once the color of hope they said when it was made then lisen died and the wood changed and the world changed and now it seems to shine with loss it is the most fair thing i know in all the world it is the light against the dark kim looked at the whitehaired figure beside her why is it here she asked why hidden underground raederth brought it to me the year before he died where he went to find it i know notfor it was lost when lisen fell lost long years and he never told me the tale of where he went to bring it back it aged him though something happened on the journey of which he could never speak he asked me to guard it here with the two other things of power until their place should be dreamt who shall wear this next he said after lisen shall have the darkest road to walk of any child of earth or stars and he said nothing more it waits here for the dreaming kimberly shivered for something new within her a singing in the blood told her that the words of the dead mage were true prophecy she felt weighted burdened this was getting to be too much she tore her eyes away from the circlet what are the other two things she asked the baelrath of course the stone on your finger kim looked down the warstone had grown brighter as they spoke the dull blooddark lustre giving way to a pulsating sheen i think the circlet speaks to it ysanne went on it always shone so in this room i kept it here beside the other until the night i dreamt you wearing it from that time i knew its hour was coming and i feared the wakening power would call forces i could not ward so i summoned eilathen again and bound him to guard the stone by the red at the heart of the bannion when was this twentyfive years ago now a little more buti wasnt even born i know child i dreamt your parents first the day they met then you with the baelrath on your hand our gift as seers is to walk the twists that lie in the weave of time and bring their secrets back it is no easy power and you know already that it cannot always be controlled kim pushed her brown hair back with both hands her forehead was creased with anxiety the grey eyes were those of someone being pursued i do know that she said im trying to handle it what i cant i dont understand why you are showing me lisens light not true the seer replied if you stop to think you will understand you are being shown the circlet because it may fall to you to dream who is to wear it next there was a silence then ysanne i dont live here there is a bridge between our worlds child i am telling you that which you know already but thats just it im beginning to understand what i am i saw what eilathen spun but im not of this world it isnt in my blood i dont know its roots the way you do the way all the seers must have known how should how could i ever presume to say who is to bear the circlet of lisen im a stranger ysanne she was breathing hard the old woman looked at her a long time then she smiled now you are you have just come you are right about being incomplete but be easy it is only time her voice like her eyes was gentle as she told her second lie and shielded it time kimberly burst out dont you understand im only here two weeks as soon as they find dave were going home perhaps there is still a bridge and i did dream the baelrath on your hand it is in my heart as wellan old womans heart not a seers visionthat there may be need of a dreamer in your world too before what is to come is fullwoven on the loom kimberly opened her mouth and closed it again speechless because now it was too much too many things too quickly and too hard im sorry she managed to gasp and then whirling ran up the stone stairs and out the doorway of the cottage to where there was sunlight and a blue sky trees too and a path down which she could run to the edge of a lake alone because no one was pursuing her she could stand there throwing pebbles into the water knowing that they were pebbles only pebbles and that no green spirit water dripping from his hair would rise in answer from the lake to change her life again in the chamber from which she had fled the light continued to shine power and hope and loss were in the radiance that bathed ysanne as she sat at the desk stroking the cat in her lap her eyes unfocused and blind ah malka she murmured at last i wish i were wiser what is the use of living so long if one hasnt grown wise the cat pricked up her ears but preferred to continue licking a paw rather than address herself to so thorny a question at length the seer rose lowering the affronted malka to the floor and she walked slowly to the cabinet wherein the circlet shone opening the glass door she reached in and took out an object half hidden on a lower shelf then she stood there a long time gazing at what lay in her hand the third thing of power the one that kimberly throwing pebbles by the lake had not seen ah malka the seer said again and drew the dagger from its sheath a sound like a plucked harpstring ran through the room a thousand years before in the days after the bael rangat when all the free peoples of fionavar had gathered before the mountain to see ginserats stones the dwarves of banir lok had shaped a crafting of their own as a gift for the new high king of brennin with thieren had they wrought rarest of metals found only at the roots of their twin mountains most precious gift of earth to them blueveined silver of eridu and for colan the beloved they had taken thought and fashioned a blade with runes upon the sheath to bind it and an old dark magic spun in their caverns to make a knife unlike any other in all the worlds and they named it lokdal very low bowed conarys son when they handed it to him and silently he listened wiser than his years as seithr the dwarfking told him what had been laid upon the blade then he bowed again lower yet when seithr too fell silent i thank you colan said and his eyes flashed as he spoke doubleedged the knife and doubleedged the gift mörnir grant us the sight to use it truly and he placed lokdal in his belt and bore it south away to the mages he had entrusted it the blade and the magic locked within it like a blessing or a curse and twice only in a thousand years had colans dagger killed from first mage to first mage it had passed until the night raederth died in the middle of that night the woman who loved him had had a dream that shook her to the hidden places of her soul rising in the darkness she came to the place where raederth guarded the blade and she took it away and hid it from those who succeeded him not even loren silvercloak whom she trusted with everything else knew that ysanne had lokdal who strikes with this blade without love in his heart shall surely die had said seithr of the dwarves that is one thing and then softly so that only colan heard he had said the other thing in her hidden chamber ysanne the seer dreamer of the dream turned the bright rippling blade over and over in her hands so the light glinted from it like blue fire on the shore of the lake a young woman stood power within her power beneath her throwing pebbles one by one it was cooler in the wood where the lios alfar led them the food they were offered was delicate and wonderful strange fruits rich bread and a wine that lifted the spirit and sharpened the colors of the sunset throughout there was music one of the lios played at a hightoned wind instrument while others sang their voices twining in the deepening shadows of the trees as the torches of evening were lit at the edge of the glade laesha and drance for whom this was childhood fantasy made true seemed even more enchanted than jennifer was and so when brendel invited them to stay the night in the wood and watch the lios dance under the stars it was with wonder and joy that they accepted brendel dispatched someone to ride swiftly to paras derval and give private word to the king of their whereabouts wrapped in a delicate languor they watched the messenger his hair glowing in the light of the setting sun ride over the hill and they turned back to the wine and the singing in the glade as the shadows lengthened a grace note of long sorrow seemed to weave its way into the songs of the lios alfar a myriad of fireflies moved like shining eyes just beyond the torches lienae they were named brendel said jennifer sipped the wine he poured for her and let herself be carried into a rich sweet sadness by the music cresting the hill west of them the messenger tandem of the kestrel set his horse into an easy canter towards the walled town and the palace a league away he was not quite halfway there when he died soundlessly he fell from his horse four darts in his throat and back after a moment the svarts rose from the hollow beside the path and watched in unblinking silence as the wolves padded up from beside them to the body of the lios when it was clear that he was dead they too went forward and surrounded the fallen rider even in death there was a nimbus of glory clinging to him but when they were done when the wet tearing sounds had ceased and only the quiet stars looked down there was nothing left that anyone would care to see of tandem of the lios alfar most hated by the dark for their name was light and it was in that moment away to the north and east that another solitary rider checked his own mount suddenly a moment he was motionless then with a terrible oath and fear like a fist in his heart loren silvercloak turned his horse and began desperately to thunder home in paras derval the king did not attend the banquet nor did any of the four visitors which caused more than a little talk ailell kept to his chambers and played tabael with gorlaes the chancellor he won easily as was customary and with little pleasure which was also customary they played very late and tarn the page was asleep when the interruption came as they went through the open doorway of the black boar the noise and smoke were like a wall into which they smashed one voice however made itself heard in a prodigious bellow that resounded over the pandemonium diarmuid roared tegid surging to his feet kevin winced at the decibel level engendered by the oak and the moon its himself tegid howled as the tavern sounds briefly resolved themselves into shouted greetings diarmuid in fawncolored breeches and a blue doublet stood grinning sardonically in the doorway as the others fanned out into the dense haze of the room tegid wove his way unsteadily forward to stand swaying before his prince and hurled the contents of a mug of ale full in diarmuids face wretched prince he screamed i shall tear your heart out i shall send your liver to gwen ystrat how dare you slip off and leave great tegid behind with the women and the mewling babes kevin beside the prince had a brief hysterical vision of tegid trying to go hand over hand across saeren before diarmuid dripping wet reached to the nearest table grabbed a silver tankard and threw it violently at tegid someone screamed as the prince followed up the throw which bounced off the big mans shoulder with a short rush at the end of which his lowered head intersected effectively with tegids massive target of a girth tegid staggered back his face momentarily achieving a shade of green he recovered quickly though seized the nearest table top and with one mighty exertion lifted it whole from the trestles spilling mugs and cutlery and sending their erstwhile users scattering as raucous curses exploded around him wheeling for leverage he swung the board in a wide lethal sweep that bade fair to render ailell heirless had it landed diarmuid ducked very neatly so too less smoothly did kevin sprawling on the floor he saw the board whistle over their heads and at the spent end of its sweep clip a reddoubleted man on the shoulder catapulting him into the patron beside him a remarkable human demonstration of the domino effect ensued the noise level was horrific someone elected to deposit his bowl of soup on the reddoubleted gentlemans balding pate someone else regarded this as more than sufficient excuse to deck the souppourer from behind with a hoisted bench the innkeeper prudently began removing bottles from the bar top a barmaid her skirts aswirl slipped under a table kevin saw carde dive to join her there in the meantime diarmuid springing from his crouch butted tegid again before the mountainous one could ready a return scything of the table top the first reaping had comprehensively cleared a wide space about the two of them this time tegid held his ground with a joyous bellow he dropped the board on someones head and enveloped diarmuid in a bearhug now i have you tegid boomed his face flushed with rapture diarmuids features were also shading towards scarlet as his captor tightened a bonecrushing grip watching kevin saw the prince free his arms for a counterblow he had no doubt diarmuid could manage to free himself but tegid was squeezing in earnest and kevin saw that the prince was going to have to use a crippling retort to break the other mans hold he saw diarmuid shift his knee for leverage and knew what would have to follow with a futile shout he rushed forward to intercede and stopped dead as a terrifying cry of outrage exploded from tegids throat still screaming he dropped the prince like a discarded toy on the sandy floor there came a smell of burning flesh leaping spectacularly tegid upended another table rescued a brimming pitcher of ale and proceeded to pour its contents over his posterior the movement revealed somewhat like the drawing of a curtain paul schafer behind him holding rather apologetically a poker from the cooking fire there was a brief silence an awestricken homage to the operatic force of tegids scream then diarmuid still on the floor began to laugh in high short hysterical gasps signaling a resumption of universal pandemonium crying with laughter barely able to stand kevin made his way with erron staggering beside him to embrace the crookedly grinning schafer it was some time before order was restored largely because no one was particularly intent on restoring it the reddoubleted man appeared to have a number of friends and so too it seemed did the souppourer kevin who knew neither threw a token bench into the fray then withdrew towards the bar with erron two serving women joined them there and the press of events greatly facilitated a rapid acquaintance going upstairs hand in hand with marna the taller of the two kevins last glimpse of the tavern floor was of a surging mass of men disappearing in and out of the smoky haze diarmuid was standing atop the bar lobbing whatever came to hand upon the heads of the combatants he didnt seem to be choosing sides kevin looked for paul didnt see him and then a door was opened and closed behind him and in the rush of dark a woman was in his arms her mouth turned up to his and his soul began its familiar spiral downward into longing much later when he had not yet completed the journey back he heard marna ask in a timid whisper is it always so and a good few minutes yet from being capable of speech he stroked her hair once with an effort and closed his eyes again because it was always so the act of love a blind convulsive reaching back into a falling dark every time it took away his very name the shape and movement of his bones and between times he wondered if there would be a night when he would go so far that there was no returning not this night though soon he was able to smile at her and then to give thanks and gentle words and not without sincerity for her sweetness ran deep and he had needed badly to drink of such a thing slipping inside his arm marna laid her head on his shoulder beside his own bright hair and breathing deeply of her scent kevin let the exhaustion of two waking nights carry him to sleep he only had an hour though and so was vulnerable and unfocused when the presence of a third person in the room woke him it was another girl not errons and she was crying her hair disordered about her shoulders what is it tiene marna asked sleepily he sent me to you brownhaired tiene sniffled looking at kevin who kevin grunted groping towards consciousness diarmuid oh no it was the other stranger pwyll it took a moment paul what didwhats happened his tone was evidently too sharp for already tender nerves tiene casting a wideeyed glance of reproach at him sat down on the bed and started crying again he shook her arm tell me what happened he left tiene whispered barely audible he came upstairs with me but he left shaking his head kevin tried desperately to focus what did he was he able to tiene sniffed wiping at the tears on her cheeks you mean to be with me yes of course he was but he took no pleasure at all i could tell it was all for me and i am not i gave him nothing and and and what for gods sake and so i cried tiene said as if it should have been obvious and when i cried he walked out and he sent me to find you my lord she had moved farther onto the bed in part because mania had made room tienes dark eyes were wide like a fawns her robe had fallen open and kevin could see the start of her breasts deep curve then he felt the light stirring of manias hand along his thigh under the sheet there was suddenly a pulsing in his head he drew a deep breath and swung quickly out of bed cursing a hardon he kicked into his breeches and slipped on the loosesleeved doublet diarmuid had given him without bothering to button it he left the room it was dark on the landing moving to the railing he looked down on the ruin of the ground level of the black boar the guttering torches cast flickering shadows over bodies sprawled in sleep on overturned tables and benches or against the walls a few men were talking in muted tones in one corner and he heard a woman giggle suddenly from the near wall and then subside then he heard something else the plucked strings of a guitar his guitar following the sound he turned his head to see diarmuid with coll and carde sitting by the window the prince cradling the guitar in the window seat the others on the floor as he walked downstairs to join them his eyes adjusted to the shadows and he saw other members of the band sprawled nearby with some of the women beside them hello friend kevin diarmuid said softly his eyes bright like an animals in the dark will you show me how you play this i sent coll to bring it i trust you dont mind his voice was lazy with latenight indolence behind him kevin could see a sprinkling of stars aye lad a bulky shadow rumbled do a song for us hed taken tegid for a broken table without speaking kevin picked his way forward over the bodies on the floor he took the guitar from diarmuid who slipped down from the window seat leaving it for him the window had been thrown open he felt a light breeze stir the hairs at the back of his neck as he tuned the guitar it was late and dark and quiet he was a long way from home and tired and hurting in a difficult way paul had gone even tonight he had taken no joy had turned from tears again even tonight even here so many reasons he could give and so this is called rachels song he said fighting a thickness in his throat and began to play it was a music no one there could know but the pull of grief was immediate then after a long time he lifted his voice deep when he sang in words hed decided long ago should never be sung love do you remember my name i was lost in summer turned winter made bitter by frost and when june comes december the heart pays the cost the breaking of waves on a long shore in the grey morning the slow fall of rain and stone lies over youll bury your sorrow deep in the sea but sea tides arent tamed that easily there will come a tomorrow when you weep for me the breaking of waves on a long shore in the grey morning the slow fall of rain oh love remember remember me then the music came alone again transposed worked on harder than anything hed written in his life especially what was coming now with his own stupid tears the part where the melody hurt it was so beautiful so laden with memory the adapted second movement of the brahms f major cello sonata the notes were clean unblurred though the candles were blurred in his sight as kevin played rachel kincaids graduation piece and gave sound to the sorrow that was his and not his into the shadowed room it went rachels song over the sleeping bodies that stirred as sadness touched their dreams among the ones who did not sleep and who felt the pull as they listened remembering losses of their own up the stairway it went to where two women stood at the railing both crying now faintly it reached the bedrooms where bodies lay tangled in the shapes of love and out the open window it went as well into the late night street and the wide dark between the stars and on the unlit cobblestones a figure paused by the doorway of the tavern and did not enter the street was empty the night was dark there was no one to see very silently he listened and when the song came to an end very silently he left having heard the music before so paul schafer who had fled from a womans tears and had cursed himself for a fool and turned back now made his final turning and did not turn again there was darkness for a time a twisting web of streets a gate where he was recognized by torchlight and then darkness again in corridors silent save for the footfalls that he made and through it he carried that music or the music carried him or the memory of music it hardly mattered which he walked a matrix of crossing hallways he had walked before and some were lit and others dark and in some rooms he passed there were sounds again but no one else walked in paras derval that night and in time he came carrying music carrying loss carried by both of them and stood for a second time before a door beyond which a slant of light yet showed it was the brownbearded one called gorlaes who opened to his summons and for a moment he remembered that he did not trust this man but it seemed a concern infinitely removed from where he was and one that didnt matter now not anymore then his eyes found those of the king and he saw that ailell knew somehow knew and was not strong enough to refuse what he would ask and so he asked i will go to the summer tree for you tonight will you grant me leave and do what must be done it seemed to have been written a very long time ago there was music ailell was weeping as he spoke but he said what was needful to be said because it was one thing to die and another to die uselessly he listened to the words and let them join the music in carrying him with gorlaes and two other men out of the palace by a hidden gate there were stars above them and a forest far away there was music in his head that was not going to end it seemed and it seemed he wasnt saying goodbye to kevin after all which was a grief but it was a lost small twisting thing in the place where he had come then the forest was no longer far away and at some point the waning moon had risen as he walked for it brushed the nearest trees with silver the music still was with him and the last words of ailell now i give you to mörnir for three nights and forever the king had said and cried and now with the words and the music in his head there had come again as he had known it would the face for which he could not cry dark eyes like no one else in this world and he went into the godwood and it was dark and all the trees were sighing in the wind of the wood the breath of the god there was fear on the faces of the other three men as the sound rose and fell about them like the sea he walked with them amid the surging and the swaying of the trees and in time he saw that the path they were following had ceased to wander the trees on either side now formed a double row leading him on and so he stepped past gorlaes music carrying him and he came into the place wherein stood the summer tree very great it was dark almost to black its trunk knotted and gnarled wide as a house it stood alone in the clearing in the place of sacrifice and clutched the earth with roots old as the world a challenge to the stars that shone down and there was power in that place beyond the telling standing there he felt it calling for his blood for his life and knowing he could not live three nights on that tree he stepped forward so as not to turn again and the music stopped they stripped him of his garments then and bound him naked to the summer tree at the waning of the moon when they had gone it was silent in the glade save for the ceaseless sighing of the leaves alone upon the tree he felt within his flesh the incalculable vastness of its power and had there been anything left to fear he would have been afraid and this was the first night of pwyll the stranger on the summer tree chapter in another wood east of paras derval the lios alfar were still singing as jennifer drifted towards sleep under the stars and the crescent of the risen moon their voices wove about her a melody of sorrow so old and deep it was almost a luxury she roused herself and turned on the pallet they had made for her brendel he came over to her and knelt his eyes were blue now they had been green like her own the last time she looked and gold on the hillside that afternoon are you immortal she asked sleepily he smiled no lady only the gods are so and there are those who say that even they will die at the end we live very long and age will not kill us but we do die lady by sword or fire or grief of heart and weariness will lead us to sail to our song though that is a different thing sail westward lies a place not found on any map a world shaped by the weaver for the lios alfar alone and there we go when we leave fionavar unless fionavar has killed us first how old are you brendel i was born four hundred years after the bael rangat a little more than six hundred years ago she absorbed it in silence there was nothing really to say on her other side laesha and drance were asleep the singing was very beautiful she let it carry her into simplicity and then sleep he watched her a long time the eyes still blue calm and deeply appreciative of beauty in all its incarnations and in this one there was something more she looked like someone he knew this or he sensed it to be so but although he was quite right he had absolutely no way of knowing whom and so could not warn anyone at length he rose and rejoined the others for the last song which was as it always was ratermaines lament for the lost they sang for those who had just died by pendaran and for all the others long ago who would never now hear this song or their own as the lios sang the stars seemed to grow brighter above the trees but that may have been just the deepening of night when the song ended the fire was banked and they slept they were ancient and wise and beautiful their spirit in their eyes as a manycolored flame their art an homage to the weaver whose most shining children they were a celebation of life was woven into their very essence and they were named in the oldest tongue after the light that stands against the dark but they were not immortal the two guards died of poison arrows and four others had their throats ripped apart by the black onrush of the wolves before they were fully awake one cried out and killed his wolf with a dagger as he died they fought bravely then even brilliantly with bright swords and arrows for their grace could be most deadly when they had need brendel and drance with two others formed a wall about the two women and against the charge of the giant wolves they held firm once and again and yet again their swords rising and falling in desperate silence it was dark though and the wolves were black and the svarts moved like twisted wraiths about the glade even so the shining courage of the lios alfar with drance of brennin fighting in their midst as a man posessed might have prevailed had it not been for the one thing more the cold controlling will that guided the assault there was a power in the glade that night that no one could have foretold and doom was written on the wind that rose before the dawn for jennifer it was a hallucination of terror in the dark she heard snarls and cries saw things in blurred distorted flashesblooddark swords the shadow of a wolf an arrow flying past violence exploding all around her she who had spent her days avoiding such a thing but this was night too terrified to even scream jennifer saw drance fall at last a wolf dying beneath him another rising wetmouthed from his corpse to leap past her to where laesha stood then before she could react even as she heard laesha cry out she felt herself seized brutally as the hideous svarts surged forward into the gap and she was dragged away by them over the body of diarmuids man looking desperately back she saw brendel grappling with three foes at once blood dark on his face in the thin moonlight then she was among the trees surrounded by wolves and svart alfar and there was no light to see by or to hope for anywhere they moved through the forest for what seemed an endless time travelling north and east away from paras derval and everyone she knew in this world twice she stumbled and fell in the dark and each time she was dragged sobbing to her feet and the terrible progress continued they were still in the woods when the sky began to shade towards grey and in the growing light she gradually became aware that amid the shifting movements of her captors one figure never left her side and among the horrors of that headlong night this was the worst coalblack with a splash of silvergrey on his brow he was the largest wolf by far it wasnt the size though or the wet blood on his dark mouth it was the malevolence of the power that hovered about the wolf like an aura his eyes were on her face and they were red in them for the moment she could sustain the glance she saw a degree of intelligence that should not have been there and was more alien than anything else she had come upon in fionavar there was no hatred in the look only a cold merciless will hate she could have understood what she saw was worse it was morning when they reached their destination jennifer saw a small woodcutters cabin set in a clearedout space by the forests edge a moment later she saw what was left of the woodcutter as well they threw her inside she fell from the force of it and then crawled on her knees to a corner where she was violently rackingly sick afterwards shivering uncontrollably she made her way to the cot at the back of the room and lay down we salvage what we can what truly matters to us even at the gates of despair and so jennifer lowell whose father had taught her even as a child to confront the world with pride eventually rose up cleaning herself as best she could and began to wait in the brightening cottage daylight was coming outside but it was not only that courage casts its own light the sun was high in a blank sky when she heard the voices one was low with a note of amusement she could discern even through the door then the other man spoke and jennifer froze in disbelief for this voice she had heard before not hard the first man said and laughed against the lios it is easy to keep them to it i hope you were not followed i absolutely must not be seen galadan you wont be almost all of them were dead and i left behind ten wolves against the stragglers they wont follow in any case enough of them have died they wouldnt risk more for a human she is ours more easily than we might have hoped it is rare indeed that we receive aid from daniloth and he laughed again maliciously amused where is she inside the door was flung open letting in a dazzling shaft of sunlight momentarily blinded jennifer was dragged into the clearing a prize wouldnt you say galadan murmured perhaps the other one said depending on what she tells us about why they are here jennifer turned towards the voice her eyes adjusting and as they did she found herself face to face with metran first mage to the high king of brennin no longer was he the shuffling old man shed seen that first night or watched as he cowered from jaelle in the great hall metran stood straight and tall his eyes bright with malice you traitor jennifer burst out he gestured and she screamed as her nipples were squeezed viciously no one had touched her he had done it himself without moving carefully my dear lady metran said all solicitude as she writhed in pain you must be careful of what you say to me i have the power to do whatever i want with you he nodded towards his source denbarra who stood close by not quite the other voice demurred let her go the tone was very quiet but the pain stopped instantly jennifer turned wiping tears from her face galadan was not tall but there was a sinuous strength to him a sheathed intimation of very great power cold eyes fixed her from a scarred aristocratic face under the thatch of silver hairlike brendels she thought with another sort of pain he bowed to her courtly and graceful and with a veiled amusement then that was gone as he turned to metran she goes north for questioning he said unharmed are you telling me what to do metran said on a rising note and jennifer saw denbarra stiffen actually yes if you put it that way there was mockery in his voice are you going to fight me over it mageling i could kill you galadan metran hissed the one named galadan smiled again but not with his eyes then try but i tell you now you will fail i am outside your taught magic mageling you have some power i know and have been given more and may indeed have greater yet to come but i will still be outside you metran i always will be and if you test it i shall have your heart out for my friends in the silence that followed this jennifer became conscious of the ring of wolves surrounding them there were svart alfar as well but the giant redeyed wolf was gone metran was breathing hard you are not above me galadan i was promised this at that galadan threw back his fierce scarred head and a burst of genuine laughter rang through the clearing promised were you ah well then i must apologize his laughter stopped she is still to go north if it were not so i might take her for myself but look jennifer turning skyward to where galadan was pointing saw a creature so beautiful it lifted her heart in reflexive hope a black swan came swooping down from the high reaches of the sky glorious against the sun the great wings widespread feathered with jet plumage the long neck gracefully extended then it landed and jennifer realized that the true horror had only begun for the swan had unnatural razored teeth and claws and about it for all the stunning beauty there clung an odor of putrescent corruption then the swan spoke in a voice like slithering darkness in a pit i have come she said give her to me far away yet terribly far away loren silvercloak was driving his horse back south cursing his own folly in all the tongues he knew she is yours avaia said galadan unsmiling is she not metran of course said the mage he had moved upwind of the swan i will naturally be anxious to know what she has to say it is vital for me in my place of watch no longer the black swan said ruffling her feathers i have tidings for you the cauldron is ours i am to say you go now to the place of spiraling for the time is upon us across the face of metran there spread then a smile of such cruel triumph that jennifer turned away from it it has come then the mage exulted the day of my revenge oh garmisch my dead king i shall break the usurper into pieces on his throne and make drinking cups of the bones of the house of ailell the swan showed her unnatural teeth i will take pleasure in the sight she hissed no doubt said galadan wryly is there word for me north the swan replied you are asked to go north with your friends make haste there is little time it is well said galadan i have one task left here then i follow make haste avaia said again and now i go no jennifer screamed as cold svart hands grabbed for her her cries cut the air of the clearing and fell into nothingness she was bound across the back of the giant swan and the dense putrefying smell of it overwhelmed her she could not breathe when she opened her mouth the thick black feathers choked her and as they left the earth for the blazing sky jennifer fainted for the first time in her life and so could not have known the glorious curving arc she and the swan made cutting across the sky the figures in the clearing watched avaia bear the girl away until they were lost in the shimmering of the white sky metran turned to the others exultation still in his eyes you heard the cauldron is mine so it seems galadan agreed you are away across the water then immediately it will not be long before you see what i do with it galadan nodded then a thought seemed to strike him i wonder does denbarra understand what all this means he turned to the source tell me my friend do you know what this cauldron is all about denbarra shifted uneasily under the weight of that gaze i understand what is needful for me to know he said sturdily i understand that with its aid the house of garantae will rule again in brennin galadan regarded him a moment longer then his glance flicked away dismissively he is worthy of his destiny he said to metran a thickwitted source is an advantage for you i suppose i should get dreadfully bored myself denbarra flushed but metran was unmoved by the gibe this time my sisterson is loyal it is a virtue he said unconscious of the irony what about you you mentioned a task to be done should i know you should but evidently you dont give thanks that i am less careless there is a death to be consummated metrans mouth twitched at the insult but he did not respond then go your way he said we may not meet for some time alas said galadan the mage raised a hand you mock me he said with intensity you mock us all andain but i tell you this with the cauldron of khath meigol in my hands i will wield a power even you dare not scorn and with it i shall wreak such a vengeance here in brennin that the memory of it will never die galadan lifted his scarred head and regarded the mage perhaps he said finally and very very softly unless the memory of it dies because everything has died which as you know is the wish of my heart on the last words he made a subtle gesture over his breast and a moment later a coalblack wolf with a splash of silver on its head ran swiftly westward from the clearing had he entered the forest farther south a great deal of what ensued might have been very different at the southern edge of the woodcutters clearing a figure lay hidden among the trees bleeding from a dozen wounds behind him on the trail through the forest the last two lios alfar lay dead and ten wolves and in the heart of nabrendel of the kestrel mark lay a grief and a rage that more than anything else had kept him alive so far in the sunlight his eyes were black as night he watched metran and his source mount horses and swing away northwest and he saw the svarts and wolves leave together for the north only when the clearing stood utterly silent did he rise with difficulty and begin his own journey back to paras derval he limped badly from a wound in the thigh and he was weak unto death from loss of blood but he was not going to let himself fall or fail for he was of the lios alfar and the last of his company and with his own eyes he had seen a gathering of the dark that day it was a long way though and he was badly badly hurt so he was still a league from paras derval when twilight fell during the day there were rumblings of thunder in the west a number of the merchants in the city came to their doorways to look at the heavens more out of habit than out of hope the killing sun burned in a bare sky on the green at the end of anvil lane leila had gathered the children again for the takiena one or two had refused out of boredom but she was insistent and the others acceded to her wishes which with leila was always the best thing to do so she was blindfolded again and she made them do it double so she truly could not see then she began the calling and went through the first three almost indifferently because they didnt matter they were only a game when she came to the last one though to the road she felt the now familiar stillness come over her again and she closed her eyes behind the two blindfolds then her mouth went dry and the difficult twisting flowered inside her only when the rushing sound began like waves did she start the chant and as she sang the last word everything stopped she removed the blindfolds and blinking in the brightness saw with no surprise at all that it was finn again as if from far away she heard the voices of the adults watching them and further still she heard a roll of thunder but she looked only at finn he seemed more alone every time she would have been sad but it seemed so destined that sadness didnt fit nor any sense of surprise she didnt know what the longest road was or where it led but she knew it was finns and that she was calling him to it later that afternoon though something did surprise her ordinary people never went to the sanctuary of the mother certainly not at the direct request of the high priestess herself she combed her hair and wore her only gown her mother made her when sharra dreamed now of the falcon it was no longer alone in the sky over larai rigal memory burned in her like a fire under stars she was her fathers daughter though heir to the ivory throne and so there was a matter to be looked into regardless of fires in her heart or falcons overhead devorsh captain of the guard knocked in response to her summons and the mutes admitted him her ladies murmured behind fluttering fans as the tall captain made obeisance and gave homage in his unmistakable voice she dismissed the women enjoying their chagrin and bade him sit in a low chair by the window captain she began without preamble certain documents have come to my attention raising a matter i think we must address highness he was handsome she conceded but not a candle not a candle he would not understand why she was smiling not that it mattered it seems that the archival records make mention of stone handholds cut many years ago in the cliff above saeren due north of us above the river highness in the cliff polite incredulity infused the gravelly voice i think i said that yes he flushed at the rebuke she paused to let it register if those handholds exist they are a danger and we should know about them i want you to take two men you trust and see if this is true for obvious reasonsthough she knew of nonethis is to be kept very quiet yes highness when shall i now of course she rose and so of necessity did he my ladys will he made obeisance and turned to go and because of the falcons the moontouched memory she called him back devorsh one thing more i heard footsteps in the garden the night before last did you notice anything by the walls his face showed real concern highness i went off duty at sundown bashrai took command from me i will speak to him of this without delay off duty yes highness we take turns bashrai and myself in leading the night watch he is most competent i suggest but if how many men patrol the walls at night she leaned on the back of a chair for support there was a pressure behind her eyes twelve highness in peacetime and the dogs he coughed ah no my lady not of late it was felt unnecessary they have been used on the hunt this spring and summer your father knows about this of course his face was animated by unconcealed curiosity if my lady feels they should no it was intolerable that he be in the room another moment that he continue to look at her like this his eyes widening in appraisal i will discuss this with bashrai go now and do as i have told you and quickly devorsh very quickly i go my lady he said in the distinctive voice and went after she bit her tongue tasting blood so as not to scream shalhassan of cathal was reclining on a couch watching two slaves wrestling when word was brought to him his court hedonistic and overbred was enjoying the sight of the oiled bodies writhing naked on the floor in the presence chamber but the king watched the fight as he heard the news expressionlessly raziel appeared just then in the archway behind the throne with the cup in his hand it was midafternoon then and taking the drink shalhassan saw that the jewelled goblet was blue which meant that the northerners stone still shone as it should he nodded to raziel who withdrew their private ritual observed as every day it was it would never ever do for the court to find out that shalhassan was troubled by dreams of red wardstones turning his thoughts to his daughter shalhassan drank he approved her headstrong nature indeed he had nurtured it for no weakling dared sit on the ivory throne tantrums though were irresponsible and this latest tearing apart her chambers and whipping her women were one thing rooms could be restored and servants were servants devorsh was a different matter he was a good soldier in a country with remarkably few and shalhassan was not pleased to hear that his captain of the guard had just been garrotted by his daughters mutes whatever the insult she might say he had given her it was a rash and precipitate response he drained the blue cup and came to a decision she was growing too undisciplined it was time to have her married however strong a woman might be she still needed a man by her side and in her bed and the kingdom needed heirs it was past time the wrestling had grown tedious he gestured and the eidolath stopped the fight the two slaves had been brave though he decided and he freed them both there was a polite murmur from the courtiers an approving rustle of silk turning away he noticed that one of the wrestlers was a little tardy in his obeisance the man may have been exhausted or hurt but the throne could not be compromised at any time in any way he gestured again there were appropriate uses for the mutes and their garrottes sharra would just have to learn to discriminate the knowledge of approaching death can come in many shapes descending as a blessing or rearing up as an apparition of terror it may sever like the sweep of a blade or call as a perfect lover calls for paul schafer who had chosen to be where he was for reasons deeper than loss and more oblique than empathy for an aged king the growing awareness that his body could not survive the summer tree came as a kind of relief in this failure at least there could be no shame there was no unworthiness in yielding to a god he was honest enough to realize that the exposure and the brutal heat the thirst and immobility were themselves enough to kill him and this he had known from the moment they bound him but the summer tree of mörnirwood was more than all of these naked upon it in the blaze of day paul felt the ancient bark all along the planes of his body and in that contact he apprehended power that made what strength he had its own the tree would not break him instead he felt it reaching out pulling him into itself taking everything claiming him he knew as well somehow that this was only the beginning not even the second night it was scarcely awake the god was coming though paul could feel that slow approach along his flesh in the running of his blood and now there was thunder too low yet and muted but there were two whole nights to come and all about him the godwood vibrated soundlessly as it had not for years upon years waiting waiting for the god to come and claim his own in darkness and forever as was his due the genial proprietor of the black boar was in a mood that bade fair to shatter his public image entirely under the circumstances however it was not entirely surprising that his countenance should display a distinctly forbidding mien as he surveyed his demesne in the morning light it was a festival people drank during festivals there were visitors in town visitors with dry throats from the drought and a little money saved for this time money that mightmoney that shouldbe his by all the gods if he hadnt been forced to close the boar for the day to redress the damage of the night before he worked them hard all day even the ones with broken bones and bashed pates from the brawl and he certainly wasted no sympathy on employees bemoaning hangovers or lack of sleep there was money being lost every moment he stayed closed every moment and to add to the choler of his mood there was a vile vile rumor running through the capital that bloody gorlaes the chancellor intended to slap a rationing law down on all liquids as soon as the fortnights festival ended bloody drought he attacked a pile of debris in a corner as if it were the offending chancellor himself rationing indeed hed like to see gorlaes try to ration tegids wine and ale hed like to see him try why the fat one had likely poured a weeks worth of beer over his posterior the night before at the recollection the owner of the black boar succumbed to his first smile of the day almost with relief it was hard work being furious eyeing the room hands on hips he decided that theyd be able to open within an hour or so of sundown the day wouldnt be a total loss so it was that as full dark cloaked the twisting lanes of the old town and torches and candles gleamed through curtained windows a bulky shadow moved ponderously towards the recently reopened door of his favorite tavern it was dark though in the alleys and he was impeded a trifle by the effects of his wars the night before and so tegid almost fell as he stumbled into a slight figure in the lane by the horns of cernan the great one spluttered mind your path few obstruct tegid without peril your pardon the wretched obstacle murmured so low he was scarcely audible i fear i am in some difficulty and i the figure wavered and tegid put out an instinctive hand of support then his bloodshot eyes finally adjusted to the shadows and with a transcendent shock of awe he saw the other speaker oh mörnir tegid whispered in disbelief and then for once was speechless the slim figure before him nodded with an effort yes he managed i am of the lios alfar i he gasped with pain then resumed i have tidings that must must reach the palace and i am sorely hurt at which point tegid became aware that the hand he had laid upon the others shoulder was sticky with fresh blood easy now he said with clumsy tenderness can you walk i have so far all day but brendel slipped to one knee even as he spoke but as you see i am there were tears in tegids eyes come then he murmured like a lover and lifting the mangled body effortlessly tegid of rhoden named breakwind called the boaster cradled the lios alfar in his massive arms and bore him towards the brilliant glitter of the castle i dreamt again kim said a swan it was dark outside the cottage she had been silent all day had walked alone by the lake throwing pebbles what color ysanne asked from the rocking chair by the hearth black i dreamt her as well it is a bad thing what is it eilathen never showed me this there were two candles in the room they flickered and dwindled as ysanne told her about avaia and lauriel the white at intervals they heard thunder far off it was still a festival and though the king looked haggard and desiccated in his seat at the high table the great hall gleamed richly by torchlight festooned as it was with hangings of red and gold silk despite their morose king and his unwontedly bemused chancellor the court of ailell was determined to enjoy itself the players in the musicians gallery overhead were in merry form and even though dinner had not yet begun the pages were being kept busy running back and forth with wine kevin laine eschewing both his seat at the high table as a guest of honor and the notverysubtle invitation of the lady rheva had decided to ignore protocol by opting for a masculine enclave partway down one of the two tables that ran along the hall seated between matt sören and diarmuids big brokennosed lieutenant coll he attempted to preserve a cheerful appearance but the fact that no one had seen paul schafer since last night was building into a real source of anxiety jennifer too where the hell was she on the other hand there were still many people filing into the room and jen he had cause to remember was seldom on time for anything let alone early kevin drained his wine goblet for the third time and decided that he was becoming altogether too much of a worrier at which point matt sören asked have you seen jennifer and kevin abruptly changed his mind no he said i was at the boar last night and then seeing the barracks and the armory with carde and erron today why do you she went riding with one of the ladiesinwaiting yesterday drance was with them hes a good man coll said reassuringly from the other side well has anyone seen them was she in her room last night kevin asked coll grinned that wouldnt prove much would it a lot of us werent in our beds last night he laughed and clapped kevin on the shoulder cheer up kevin shook his head dave paul now jen riding you said he turned to matt has anyone checked the stables are the horses back sören looked at him no he said softly we haventbut i think i want to now come on he was already pushing his chair back they rose together and so were on their feet when the sudden babble of sound came from the east doorway and the courtiers and ladies gathered there moved aside for the torches to reveal the enormous figure with a bloodstained body in his arms everything stopped in the silence tegid moved slowly forward between the long tables to stand before ailell look he cried grief raw in his voice my lord king here is one of the lios alfar and see what they have done to him the king was ashen trembling he rose nabrendel he croaked oh mörnir is he no a faint clear voice replied i am not dead though i might yet wish to be let me stand to give my tidings gently tegid lowered the lios to stand on the mosaicinlaid floor and then kneeling awkwardly he offered his shoulder for support brendel closed his eyes and drew a breath and when he spoke again his voice by some act of pure will rang out strong and clear beneath the windows of delevan treachery high king treachery and death i bring you and tidings of the dark we spoke you and i four nights past of svart alfar outside pendaran wood high king there have been svarts outside your walls this day and wolves with them we were attacked before dawn and all my people are slain he stopped a sound like the moaning of wind before a storm ran through the hall ailell has sunk back into his chair his eyes bleak and hollow brendel lifted his head and looked at him there is an empty seat at your table high king i must tell you that it stands empty for a traitor look to your own hearth ailell metran your first mage is allied with the dark he has deceived you all there were cries at that of anger and dismay hold it was diarmuid on his feet and facing the lios his eyes flashed but his voice was under tight control you said the dark who once more the silence stretched then brendel spoke i would not have ever wanted to bear this tale to the world i spoke of svart alfar and wolves attacking us we would not have died had it been only them there was something else a giant wolf with silver on his head like a brand against the black then i saw him after with metran and i knew him for he had taken back his true form i must tell you that the wolflord of the andain has come among us again galadan has returned accursed be his name someone cried and kevin saw that it was matt how can this be he died at andarien a thousand years ago so thought we all said brendel turning to the dwarf but i saw him today and this wound is his he touched his torn shoulder then there is more something else came today and spoke with both of them once more brendel hesitated and this time his eyes darkhued went to kevins face it was the black swan he said and a stillness fell upon stillness avaia she carried away jennifer your friend the golden one they had come for her why i know not but we were too few too few against the wolflord and so my brethren are all dead and she is gone and the dark is abroad in the world again kevin white with dread looked at the maimed figure of the lios where he gasped in a voice that shocked him brendel shook his head wearily i could not hear their words black avaia took her north could i have stayed her flight i would have died to do so oh believe me the lios alfars voice faltered your grief is mine and mine may tear the fabric of my soul apart twenty of my people have died and it is in my heart that they are not the last we are the children of light and the dark is rising i must return to daniloth but and now his voice grew strong again an oath i will swear before you now she was in my care i shall find her or avenge her or die in the attempt and brendel cried then so that the great hall echoed to the sound we shall fight them as we did before as we always have the words rang among them like a stern bell of defiance and in kevin laine they lit a fire he did not know lay within him not alone he cried his own voice pitched to carry if you share my grief i will share yours and others here will too i think aye boomed matt sören beside him all of us cried diarmuid prince of brennin when the lios are slain in brennin the high kingdom goes to war a mighty roar exploded at those words building and building in a wave of fury it climbed to the highest windows of delevan and resounded through the hall it drowned quite completely the despairing words of the high king oh mörnir whispered ailell clutching his hands together in his lap what have i done where is loren what have i done there had been light now there was not one measured time in such ways there were stars in the space above the trees no moon yet and only a thin one later for tomorrow would be the night of the new moon his last night if he lived through this one the tree was a part of him now another name a summoning he almost heard a meaning in the breathing of the forest all around him but his mind was stretched and flattened he could not reach to it he could only endure and hold the wall of memory as best he might one more night after which there would be no music to be laid open by no highways to forget no rain no sirens none no rachel one more night at most for he wasnt sure he could survive another day like the last though truly he would try for the old king and the slain farmer and the faces hed seen on the roads better to die for a reason and with what one could retain of pride better surely though he could not say why now i give you to mörnir ailell had said which meant he was a gift an offering and it was all waste if he died too soon so he had to hold to life hold the wall hold for the god for he was the gods to claim and there was thunder now it seemed at times to come from within the tree which meant in the way of things from within himself if only there could be rain before he died he might find some kind of peace at the end it had rained though when she died it had rained all night his eyes were hurting now he closed them but that was no good either because she was waiting there with music once earlier he had wanted to call her name in the wood as he had not beside the open grave to feel it on his lips again as he had not since to burn his dry soul with her burn since he could not cry silence of course one did not do any such thing one opened ones eyes instead on the summer tree in the deep of mörnirwood and one saw a man come forward from among the trees it was very dark he could not see who it was but the faint starlight reflected from silver hair and so he thought loren he tried but scarcely any sound escaped his cracked lips he tried to wet them but he had no moisture he was dry then the figure came nearer to stand in the starlight below where he was bound and paul saw that he had been wrong the eyes that met his own were not those of the mage and looking into them he did know fear then for it should not end so truly it should not but the man below stood as if cloaked in power even in that place even in the glade of the summer tree and in the dark eyes paul saw his death then the figure spoke i cannot allow it he said with finality you have courage and something else i think almost you are one of us and it might have been that we could have shared something you and i not now though this i cannot allow you are calling a force too strong for the knowing and it must not be wakened not when i am so near will you believe the voice said low and assured that i am sorry to have to kill you paul moved his lips who he asked the sound a scrape in his throat the other smiled at that names matter to you they should it is galadan who has come and i fear it is the end bound and utterly helpless paul saw the elegant figure draw a knife from his belt it will be clean i promise you he said did you not come here for release i will give it to you their eyes locked once more it was a dream it was so like a dream so dark blurred shadowed he closed his eyes one closed ones eyes to dream she was there of course but it was ending so all right then fine let it end on her a moment passed no blade no severing then galadan spoke again but not to him and in a different voice you he said here now i understand for reply there came only a deep rumbling growl his heart leaping paul opened his eyes in the clearing facing galadan was the grey dog he had seen on the palace wall gazing at the dog galadan spoke again it was written in wind and fire long ago that we should meet he said and here is as fit a place as any in all the worlds would you guard the sacrifice then your blood is the gateway to my desire come and i shall drink it now he placed a hand over his heart and made a twisting gesture and after a brief blurring of space there stood a moment later where he had been a wolf so large it dwarfed the grey figure of the dog and the wolf had a splash of silver between its ears one endless moment the animals faced each other and paul realized that the godwood had gone deathly still then galadan howled so as to chill the heart and leaped to attack there took place then a battle foretold in the first depths of time by the twin goddesses of war who are named in all the worlds as macha and nemain a portent it was to be a presaging of the greatest war of all this coming together in darkness of the wolf who was a man whose spirit was annihilation and the grey dog who had been called by many names but was always the companion the battle the two goddesses foreknewfor war was their demesnebut not the resolution a portent then a presaging a beginning and so it came to pass that wolf and dog met at last in fionavar first of all the worlds and below the summer tree they ripped and tore at one another with such fury that soon dark blood soaked the glade under the stars again and again they hurled themselves upon each other black on grey and paul straining to see felt his heart go out to the dog with all the force of his being he remembered the loss he had seen in its eyes and he saw now even in the shadows as the animals rolled over and over biting and grappling engaging and recoiling in desperate frenzy that the wolf was too large they were both black now for the light grey fur of the dog was matted and dark with its own blood still it fought eluding and atacking summoning a courage embodying a gallantry of defiance that hurt to see it was so noble and so doomed the wolf was bleeding too and its flesh was ripped and torn but it was so much larger and more more than that galadan carried within himself a power that went far deeper than tooth and gashing claw paul became aware that his bound hands were torn and bleeding unconsciously he had been struggling to free himself to go to the aid of the dog who was dying in his defence the bonds held though and so too did the prophecy for this was to be wolf and dog alone and so it was through the night it continued weary and scored with wounds the grey dog fought on but its attacks were parried more easily now its defences were more agonizing more narrowly averting the final closing of jaw on jugular it could only be a question of time paul realized grieving and forced to bear witness it hurt so much so much fight he screamed suddenly his throat raw with effort go on ill hold if you canill make it through tomorrow night in the name of the god i swear it give me till tomorrow and ill bring you rain for a moment the animals were checked by the force of his cry then limp and drained paul saw with agony that it was the wolf who lifted a head to look at him a terrible smile distorting its face then it turned back back for the last attack a force of fury of annihilation galadan who had returned it was a charge of uncoiled power not to be denied or withstood and yet it was the dog too had heard pauls cry without the strength to raise its head in reply it found yet in the words in the desperate scarcely articulate vow a pure white power of its own and reaching back far back into its own long history of battle and loss the grey dog met the wolf for the last time with a spirit of utmost denial and the earth shook beneath them as they crashed together over and over on the sodden ground they rolled indistinguishable one contorted shape that embodied all the endless conflict of light and dark in all the turning worlds then the world turned enough finally for the moon to rise above the trees only a crescent she was the last thin pale sliver before the dark of tomorrow but she was still there still glorious a light and paul looking up understood then from a deep place in his soul that just as the tree belonged to morair so did the moon to the mother and when the crescent moon shone above the summer tree then was the banner of brennin made real in that wood in silence in awe in deepest humility he watched at length as one dark bloodspattered animal disengaged from the other it limped tail down to the edge of the glade and when it turned to look back paul saw a splash of silver between its ears with a snarl of rage galadan fled the wood the dog could barely stand it breathed with a sucking heave of flank and sides that paul ached to see it was so terribly hurt it was scarcely alive the blood so thick upon it he could not see an untorn patch of fur but it was alive and it came haltingly over to gaze up at him lifting its torn head under the light and succor of the moon it had waited for in that moment paul schafer felt his own cracked dry soul open up again to love as he looked down upon the dog for the second time their eyes met and this time paul did not back away he took in the loss he saw all of it the pain endured for him and endured long before him and with the first power of the tree he made it his own oh brave he said finding that he could speak there can never have been a thing so brave go now for it is my turn and i will keep faith ill hold now until tomorrow night for you as much as anything the dog looked at him the eyes clouded with pain but still deep with intelligence and paul knew he was understood goodbye he whispered a kind of caress in the word and in response the grey dog threw back its proud head and howled a cry of triumph and farewell so loud and clear it filled all the godwood and then echoed far beyond it beyond the bounds of the worlds even hurtling into time and space that the goddesses might hear it and know in the taverns of paras derval the rumor of war spread like a fire in dry grass svarts had been seen and giant wolves and lios alfar had walked in the city and been slain in the land diarmuid the prince had sworn vengeance all over the capital swords and spears were rescued from places where they had rusted long years anvil lane would resound in the morning to the clanging sound of fevered preparation for karsh the tanner though there was other news that eclipsed even the rumors and on the crest of it he was engaged in drinking himself happily to incapacity and buying with profoundly uncharacteristic largess drinks for every man in earshot he had cause they all agreed it wasnt every day that saw a mans daughter initiated as an acolyte in the temple of the mother the more so when jaelle the high priestess herself had summoned her it was an honor they all chorused toasting karsh amid the bustle of war talk it was more the tanner said toasting back for a man with four daughters it was a blessing from the gods from the goddess he corrected himself owlishly and brought everyone another round with money marked until that day for her dowry in the sanctuary the newest acolyte drifted towards the sleep of the utterly exhausted in her fourteen years she had never known a day like the one just past tears and pride unexpected fear and then laughter had all been part of it the ceremony she had barely understood for they had given her a drink that made the domed room spin softly though not unpleasantly the axe she remembered the chanting of the greyclad priestesses of whose number she would soon be one and then the voice cold and powerful of the high priestess in her white robe she didnt remember when she had been cut but the wound on her wrist throbbed under the cloth bandage it was necessary they had explained blood to bind leila hadnt bothered telling them that she had always known that long past midnight jaelle woke in the stillness of the temple high priestess of brennin and one of the mormae of gwen ystrat she could not fail to hear though no one else in paras derval would the supernatural howling of a dog as the moon shone down upon the summer tree she could hear it but she did not understand and lying in her bed she chafed and raged at her inability there was something happening forces were abroad she could feel power gathering like a storm she needed a seer by all the names of the mother she needed one but there was only the hag and she had sold herself in the darkness of her room the high priestess clenched her long fingers in deep unending bitterness she had need and was being denied she was blind lost and forever she cursed again and lay awake all the rest of the night feeling it gathering gathering kimberly thought she was dreaming the same dream as two nights before when the howling had shattered her vision of paul and ailell she heard the dog but this time she did not wake had she done so she would have seen the baelrath glowering ominously on her hand in the barn among the close familiar smells of the animals tyrth the servant did awaken one moment he lay motionless disbelieving as the inner echoes of that great cry faded then an expression crossed his face that was composed of many elements but had more of longing than anything else he swung out of bed dressed quickly and left the barn he limped across the yard and through the gate closing it behind him only when he was in the strand of trees and so hidden from the cottage did the limp disappear at which point he began to run very swiftly in the direction of the thunder alone of those who heard the dog ysanne the seer awake in her bed as well knew what that cry of pain and pride truly meant she heard tyrth cross the yard limping west and she knew what that meant too there were so many unexpected griefs she thought so many different things to pity not least what she had now at last to do for the storm was upon them that cry in the wood was the harbinger and so it was full time and this night would see her do what she had seen long ago not for herself did she grieve there had been true fear at her first foreknowledge and an echo of it when she had seen the girl in the great hall but it had passed the thing was very dark but no longer terrifying long ago she had known what would come it would be hard though for the girl it would be hard in every way but against what had begun tonight with the dog and the wolf it was going to be hard for all of them she could not help that one thing only she could do there was a stranger dying on the tree she shook her head that that was the deepest thing of all and he was the one she had not been able to read not that it mattered now as to that only the sporadic thunder mattered thunder in a clear starry sky mörnir would walk tomorrow if the stranger held and no one not one of them could tell what that might mean the god was outside of them but the girl the girl was something else and her ysanne could see had seen many times she rose quietly and walked to stand over kim she saw the vellin stone on the slim wrist and the baelrath glowing on one finger and she thought of macha and red nemain and their prophecy she thought of raederth then for the first time that night an old old sorrow fifty years but still lost once fifty years ago on the far side of night and now but the dog had howled in the wood it was full fullest time and she had known for very long what was to come there was no terror any more only loss and there had always been loss kimberly stirred on her pillow so young the seer thought it was all so sad but she knew truly of no other way for she had lied the day before it was not merely a matter of time before the girl could know the woven patterns of fionavar as she needed to it could not be oh how could it ever be the girl was needed she was a seer and more the crossing bore witness the pain of the land the testimony in eilathens eyes she was needed but not ready not complete and the old woman knew one way and only one to do the last thing necessary the cat was awake watching her with knowing eyes from the window sill it was very dark tomorrow there would be no moon it was time past time she laid a hand then and it was very steady upon kimberlys forehead where the single vertical line showed when she was distressed ysannes fingers still beautiful traced a sign lightly and irrevocably on the unfurrowed brow kimberly slept a gentle smile lit the seers face as she withdrew sleep child she murmured you have need for the way is dark and there will be fire ere the end and a breaking of the heart grieve not in the morning for my soul my dream is done my dreaming may the weaver name you his and shield you from the dark all your days then there was silence in the room the cat watched from the window it is done ysanne said to the room the night the summer stars to all her ghosts and to the one loved man now to be lost forever among the dead with care she opened the secret entrance to the chamber below and went slowly down the stone stairs to where colans dagger lay bright still in its sheath of a thousand years there was a very great deal of pain now the moon had passed from overhead his last moon he realized though thought was difficult consciousness was going to become a transient condition a very hard thing and already with a long way yet to go he was beginning to hallucinate colors sounds the trunk of the tree seemed to have grown fingers rough like bark that wrapped themselves around him he was touching the tree everywhere now once for a long spell he thought he was inside it looking out not bound upon it he thought he was the summer tree he was truly not afraid of dying only of dying too soon he had sworn an oath but it was so hard to hold onto his mind to hold his will to living another night so much easier to let go to leave the pain behind already the dog and wolf seemed to have been half dreamt though he knew the battle had ended only hours before there was dried blood on his wrists from when he had tried to free himself when the second man appeared before him he was sure it was a vision he was so far gone popular attraction a faint fading capacity of his mind mocked come see the hanging man this man had a beard and deepset dark eyes and didnt seem about to change into an animal he just stood there looking up a very boring vision the trees were loud in the wind there was thunder he could feel it paul made an effort moving his head back and forth to clear it his eyes hurt for some reason but he could see and what he saw on the face of the figure below was an expression of such appalling balked desire that the hair rose up on his neck he should know who this was he should if his mind were working he would know but it was too hard it was hopelessly beyond him you have stolen my death the figure said paul closed his eyes he was too far away from this too far down the road he was incapable of explaining unable to do more than try to endure an oath he had sworn an oath what did an oath mean a whole day more it meant and a third night some time later his eyes seemed to be open again and he saw with uttermost relief that he was alone there was grey in the eastern sky one more one last and this was the second night of pwyll the stranger on the summer tree chapter in the morning came something unheard of a hot dry wind bitter and unsettling swept down into paras derval from the north no one could remember a hot north wind before it carried with it the dust of bonebare farms so the air darkened that day even at noon and the high sun shone balefully orange through the obscuring haze the thunder continued almost a mockery there were no clouds with all respect and suchlike sentiments diarmuid said from by the window his tone insolent and angry we are wasting time he looked dishevelled and dangerous he was also kevin realized with dismay a little drunk from his seat at the head of the council table ailell ignored his heir kevin still not sure why hed been invited here saw two bright spots of red on the cheeks of the old king ailell looked terrible he seemed to have shrivelled overnight two more men entered the room a tall cleverlooking man and beside him a portly affable fellow the other mage kevin guessed teyrnon with barak his source gorlaes the chancellor made the introductions and it turned out he was right except the innocuousseeming fat man was the mage and not the other way around loren was still away but matt was in the room and so too were a number of other dignitaries kevin recognized mabon the duke of rhoden ailells cousin and beyond him was niavin of seresh the ruddy man with the saltandpepper beard was ceredur who had been made north warden after diarmuids brother was exiled hed seen them at last nights banquet their expressions were very different now it was jaelle they were waiting for and as the moments passed kevin too began to grow impatient with apprehension my lord he said abruptly to the king while we waitwho is galadan i feel completely ignorant it was gorlaes who answered ailell was sunken in silence and diarmuid was still sulking by the window he is a force of darkness from long ago a very great power though he did not always serve the dark the chancellor said he is one of the andainchild of a mortal woman and a god in older days there were not a few such unions the andain are a difficult race moving easily in no world at all galadan became their lord by far the most powerful of them all and said to be the most subtle mind in fionavar then something changed him an understatement that murmured teyrnon i suppose said gorlaes what happened is that he fell in love with lisen of the wood and when she rejected him and bound herself instead to a mortal amairgen whitebranch first of the mages galadan vowed the most complete vengeance ever sworn the chancellors voice took on a note of awe galadan swore that the world that witnessed his humiliation would cease to exist there was a silence kevin could think of nothing to say nothing at all teyrnon took up the tale in the time of the bael rangat he was first lieutenant to rakoth and most terrible of his servants he had the power to take on the shape of a wolf and so he commanded them all his purposes though were at odds with his masters for though the unraveller sought rule for lust of power and domination galadan would have conquered to utterly destroy they fought kevin hazarded teyrnon shook his head one did not pitch oneself against rakoth galadan has very great powers and if he has joined the svart alfar to his wolves in war upon us then we are in danger indeed but rakoth whom the stones bind is outside the tapestry there is no thread with his name upon it he cannot die and none could ever set his will against him amairgen did said diarmuid from the window and died teyrnon replied not ungently there are worse things the prince snapped at that ailell stirred before he could speak though the door opened and jaelle swept into the room she nodded briefly to the king acknowledged no one else and slipped into the chair left for her at one end of the long table thank you for hurrying diarmuid murmured coming to take his chair at ailells right hand jaelle merely smiled it was not a pleasant smile well now said the king clearing his throat it seems to me that the best way to proceed is to spend this morning in a careful review in the name of the weaver and the loom father diarmuids fist crashed on the table we all know what has happened what is there to review i swore an oath last night we would aid the lios and a premature oath prince diarmuid gorlaes interrupted and not one within your power to swear no said the prince softly then let me remind youlet us indeed carefully review he amended delicately what has happened one of my men is dead one of the ladies of this court is dead a svart alfar was within the palace grounds six nights ago he was ticking them off on his fingers lios alfar have died in brennin galadan has returned avaia has returned our first mage is a proven traitor a guestfriend of this house has been torn away from usa guestfriend i pause to point out of our radiant high priestess as well which should mean something unless she takes such things to be meaningless i do not jaelle snapped through clenched teeth no the prince said his eyebrows raised what a surprise i thought you might regard it as of the same importance as arriving to a war council on time it isnt yet a council of war duke ceredur said bluntly though to be truthful i am with the prince i think we should have the country on war footing immediately there was a grunt of agreement from matt sören teyrnon though shook his round honest head there is too much fear in the city he demurred and it is going to spread within days throughout the country niavin duke of seresh was nodding agreement unless we know exactly what we are doing and what we face i think we must take care not to panic them the chubby mage concluded we do know what we face diarmuid shot back galadan was seen he was seen i say we summon the dalrei make league with the lios and seek the wolflord wherever he goes and crush him now amazing jaelle murmured drily in the pause that ensued how impetuous younger sons tend to be especially when they have been drinking go gently sweetling the prince said softly i will not brook that from anyone you least of all my midnight moonchild kevin exploded will you two listen to yourselves dont you understand jennifer is gone weve got to do something besides bicker for gods sake i quite agree teyrnon said sternly may i suggest that we invite our friend from daniloth to join us if he is able we should seek the views of the lios on this you may seek their views said ailell dan art suddenly rising to tower above them all and i would have his thoughts reported to me later teyrnon but i have decided to adjourn this council until this same time tomorrow you all have leave to go father diarmuid began stammering with consternation no words ailell said harshly and his eyes gleamed in his bony face i am still high king in brennin let all of you remember it we do my dearest lord said a familiar voice from the door we all do loren silvercloak went on but galadan is far too great a power for us to delay without cause dusty and travelstained his eyes hollow with exhaustion the mage ignored the fierce reaction to his arrival and gazed only at the king there was kevin realized a sudden surge of relief in the room he felt it within himself loren was back it made a very great difference matt sören had risen to stand beside the mage eyeing his friend with a grimly worried expression lorens weariness was palpable but he seemed to gather his resources and turned among all that company to look at kevin i am sorry he said simply i am deeply sorry kevin nodded jerkily i know he whispered that was all they both turned to the king since when need the high king explain himself ailell said but his brief assertion of control seemed to have drained him his tone was querulous not commanding he need not my lord but if he does his subjects and advisers may sometimes be of greater aid the mage had come several steps into the room sometimes the king replied but at other times there are things they do not and should not know kevin saw gorlaes shift in his seat he took a chance but the chancellor knows my lord should not your other counsellors forgive my presumption but a woman i love is gone high king ailell regarded him for a long time without speaking then he gave a small nod well spoken he said indeed the only person here who truly has a right to be told is you but i will do as you ask my lord gorlaes began urgently ailell raised a hand quelling him in the ensuing silence there came a distant roll of thunder can you not hear it the high king whispered on a rising note listen the god is coming if the offering holds he comes tonight this will be the third night how can we act before we know they were all on their feet someone is on the tree loren said flatly the king nodded my brother asked diarmuid his face ashen no said ailell and turned to kevin it took a moment then everything fell into place oh god kevin cried its paul and he lowered his face into his hands kimberly woke knowing who kills without love shall surely die seithr the dwarfking had said to colan the beloved long ago and then lowering his voice he had added for only the son of conary to hear who dies with love may make of his soul a gift to the one marked with the pattern on the daggers haft a rich gift had murmured colan richer than you know once given the soul is gone it is lost to time there can be no passage beyond the walls of night to find light at the weavers side conary s son had bowed very low i thank you he said doubleedged the knife and doubleedged the gift mörnir grant us the sight to use it truly even before she looked kim knew that her hair was white lying in bed that first morning she cried though silently and not for long there was much to be done even with the vellin on her wrist she felt the day like a fever she would be unworthy of the gift if she were undone by mourning so she rose up seer of brennin newest dreamer of the dream to begin what ysanne had died to allow her to do more than died there are kinds of action for good or ill that lie so far outside the boundaries of normal behavior that they force us in acknowledging that they have occurred to restructure our own understanding of reality we have to make room for them this kim thought is what ysanne had done with an act of love so greatand not just for herit could scarcely be assimilated she had stripped her soul of any place it held in time she was gone utterly not just from life but more much more as kim now knewfrom death as well from what lay after in the patterns of the weaver for his children instead the seer had given all she could to kim had given all no longer could kim say she was not of fionavar for within her now pulsed an intuitive understanding of this world more deep even than the knowledge of her own looking now at a bannion she would know what it was she understood the vellin on her wrist something of the wild baelrath on her finger and one day she would know who was to bear the circlet of lisen and tread the darkest path of all raederths words raederth whom ysanne had lost again that kim might have this which was so unfair what right what possible right had the seer had to make such a sacrifice to impose with this impossible gift such a burden how had she presumed to decide for kim the answer though was easy enough after a while she hadnt kim could go leave deny she could cross home as planed and dye her hair or leave it as it was and go new wave if she preferred nothing had changed except of course that everything had how can you tell the dancer from the dance she had read somewhere or the dreamer from the dream she amended feeling a little lost because the answer to that was easiest of all you cant some time later she laid her hand in the way she now knew upon the slab below the table and saw the door appear down the worn stone stairs she went in her turn lisens light showed her the way the dagger would be there she knew with red blood on the silverblue thieren of the blade there would be no body though for ysanne the seer having died with love and by that blade had taken herself beyond the walls of time where she could not be followed lost and forever it was final absolute it was ended and she was left here in the first world of them all bearing the burden of that she cleaned lokdal and sheathed it to a sound like a harpstring she put it back in the cabinet then she went up the stairs again towards the world that needed her all the worlds that needed what it seemed she was oh god kevin said its paul a stunned silence descended overwhelming in its import this was something for which none of them could have prepared i should have known kevin was thinking though i should have figured it out when he first told me about the tree a bitterness scaling towards rage pulled his head up that must have been some chess game he said savagely to the king it was ailell said simply then he came to me and offered i would never have asked or even thought to ask will you believe this and of course he did it fit too well the attack was unfair because paul would have done what he wanted to exactly what he wanted to and this was a better way to die than falling from a rope down a cliff as such things were measured and he supposed they could be measured it hurt though it really hurt and no said loren decisively it must be stopped this we cannot do he is not even one of us my lord we cannot lay our griefs upon him in this way he must be taken down this is a guest of your house ailell of our world what were you thinking of of our world of my house of my people he came to me silvercloak and should have been refused loren it was a true offering the speaker was gorlaes his voice unwontedly diffident you were there the mage bristled i bound him he walked past us to the tree it was as if he were alone i know not how and i am afraid here speaking of it as i was in the godwood but i swear it is a proper offering no loren said again his face sharp with emotion he cannot possibly understand what he is doing my lord he must be taken down before he dies it is his own death loren his chosen gift would you presume to strip it from him ailells eyes were so old so weary i would the mage replied he was not brought here to die for us it was time to speak maybe not kevin said forcing the words out stumbling and in pain but i think that is why he came he was losing them both jennifer now paul too his heart was sore if he went he went knowing and because he wanted to let him die for you if he cant live for himself leave him loren let him go he didnt bother trying to hide the tears not even from jaelle whose eyes on his face were so cold kevin said the mage gently it is a very bad death no one lasts the threeit will be waste and to no point let me take him down it is not for you to choose silvercloak jaelle spoke then nor for this one either loren turned his eyes hard as flint if i decide to bring him down he said driving the words into her then it will be necessary for you to kill me to prevent it careful mage gorlaes cautioned though mildly that is close to treason the high king has acted here would you undo what he has done none of them seemed to be getting the point no one has acted but paul kevin said he felt drained now but completely unsurprised he really should have known this was coming loren if anyone understood this it was him if he lasts three nights will there be rain there might be it was the king this is wild magic we cannot know blood magic loren amended bitterly teyrnon shook his head the god is wild though there may be blood he cant last though diarmuid said his voice sober he looked at kevin you said yourself hes been ill a cracked high laugh escaped kevin at that never stopped him he said fiercely feeling it so hard the stubborn brave son of a bitch the love in the harsh words reached through to all of them it could not help but do so and it had to be acknowledged even by jaelle and in a very different way by loren silvercloak very well said the mage at last he sank into a chair oh kevin they will sing of him here as long as brennin lasts regardless of the end songs said kevin songs only mess you up it was too much effort not to ache he let it sweep over him sometimes his father had said you cant do anything oh abba he thought far away and alone inside the hurt tomorrow ailell the high king said rising again gaunt and tall i will meet you here at sunrise tomorrow we will see what the night brings it was a dismissal they withdrew leaving the king sitting at the last alone in his council chamber with his years his selfcontempt and the image of the stranger on the tree in his name in the name of the god in his name they went outside into the central courtyard diarmuid loren matt and kevin laine in silence they walked together the same face in their minds and kevin was grateful for the presence of friends the heat was brutal and the sour wind abraded them under the sickly filtered sun a prickly tension seemed woven into the texture of the day and then suddenly there was more hold cried matt the dwarf whose people were of the caverns of the earth the roots of mountains the ancient rocks hold something comes and in the same instant north and west of them kim ford rose a blinding pulse in her head an apprehension of enormity and moved as if compelled out back of the cottage where tyrth was laboring oh god she whispered oh my god seeing with distorted vision the vellin bracelet writhing on her wrist knowing it could not ward what was coming what had been coming for so long so terribly what none of them had seen none what was here now right now she screamed in overwhelming agony and the roof of the world blew up far far in the north among the ice rangat cloudshouldered rose up ten miles into the heavens towering above the whole of fionavar master of the world prison of a god for a thousand years but no more a vast geyser of bloodred fire catapulted skyward with a detonation heard even in cathal rangat exploded with a column of fire so high the curving world could not hide it and at the apex of its ascent the flame was seen to form itself into the five fingers of a hand taloned oh taloned and curving southward on the wind to bring them all within its grasp to tear them all to shreds a gauntlet hurled it was a wild proclamation of release to all the cowering ones who would be his slaves forever after now for if they had feared the svart alfar trembled before a renegade mage and the power of galadan what would they do now to see the fingers of this fire raking heaven to know rakoth maugrim was unchained and free and could bend the very mountain to his vengeance and on the north wind there came then the triumphant laughter of the first and fallen god who was coming down on them like a hammer bringing fire bringing war the explosion hit the king like a fist in the heart he tottered from the window of the council chamber and fell into a chair his face grey his hands opening and closing spasmodically as he gasped for breath my lord tarn the page rushed into the room and knelt terror in his eyes my lord but ailell was beyond speech he heard only the laughter on the wind saw only the fingers curving to clutch them enormous and bloodcolored a death cloud in the sky bringing not rain but ruin he seemed to be alone tarn must have run for aid with a great effort ailell rose breathing in high short gasps and made his way down the short hallway to his rooms there he stumbled to the inner door and opened it down the familiar corridor he went at the end of the passageway the king stopped before the viewing slot his vision was troubled there seemed to be a girl beside him she had white hair which was unnatural her eyes were kind though as marriens had been at the end he had managed to win love there after all it was patience that power taught he had told that to the stranger he remembered after tabael where was the stranger he had something else to say to him something important then he remembered opening the slot ailell the king looked into the room of the stone and saw that it was dark the fire was dead the sacred naal fire the pillar carved with images of conary bore nothing upon its crown and on the floor shattered forever into fragments like his heart lay the stone of ginserat he felt himself falling it seemed to take a very long time the girl was there her eyes were so sorrowful he almost wanted to comfort her aileron he thought diarmuid oh aileron very far off he heard thunder a god was coming yes of course but what fools they all wereit was the wrong god it was so funny so funny it was and on that thought he died so passed on the eve of war ailell dan art high king of brennin and the rule passed to his son in a time of darkness when fear moved across the face of all the lands a good king and wise ysanne the seer had called him once what he had fallen from jennifer was flying straight at the mountain when it went up a harsh cry of triumph burst from the throat of the black swan as the blast of fire rose far above to separate high in the air and form the taloned hand bending south like smoke on the wind but not dissolving hanging there reaching there was laughter in the sky all around her is the person under the mountain dead paul schafer had asked before they crossed he wasnt dead nor was he under the mountain anymore and though she didnt understand jennifer knew that he wasnt a person either you had to be something more to shape a hand of fire and send mad laughter down the wind the swan increased her speed for a day and a night avaia had borne her north the giant wings beating with exquisite grace the odor of corruption surrounding her even in the high thin reaches of the sky all through this second day they flew but late that night they set down on the shores of a lake north of the wide grasslands that had unrolled beneath their flight there were svart alfar waiting for them a large band this time and with them were other creatures huge and savage with fangs and carrying swords she was pulled roughly from the swan and thrown on the ground they didnt bother tying hershe couldnt move in any case her limbs were brutally stiff with cramp after so long bound and motionless after a time they brought her food the halfcooked carcass of some prairie rodent when she shook her head in mute refusal they laughed later they did tie her tearing her blouse in the process a few of them began pinching and playing with her body but some leader made them stop she hardly registered it a far corner of her mind it seemed to be as remote as her life said that she was in shock and that it was probably a blessing when morning came they would bind her to the swan again and avaia would fly all that third day angling northwest now so the stillsmoldering mountain gradually slid around towards the east then toward sunset in a region of great cold jennifer would see starkadh like a giant ziggurat of hell among the ice and she would begin to understand for the second time kimberly came to in her bed in the cottage this time though there was no ysanne to watch over her instead the eyes gazing at her were the dark ones deepset of the servant tyrth as awareness returned she became conscious of a pain on her wrist looking she saw a scoring of black where the vellin bracelet had twisted into her skin that she remembered she shook her head i think i would have died without this she made a small movement of her hand to show him he didnt reply but a great tension seemed to dissolve from his compact muscled frame as he heard her speak she looked around by the shadows it was late afternoon thats twice now youve had to carry me here she said you must not let that bother you my lady he said in his rough shy voice well im not in the habit of fainting i would never think that he cast his eyes down what happened with the mountain she asked almost unwilling to know it is over he replied just before you woke she nodded that made sense have you been watching me all day he looked apologetic not always my lady i am sorry but the animals were frightened and at that she smiled inwardly he was pushing it a bit there is boiling water tyrth said after a short silence could i make you a drink please she watched as he limped to the fire with neat economical motions he prepared a pot of some herbal infusion and carried it back to the table by the bed it was she decided time you dont have to fake the limp anymore she said he was very cool you had to give him credit only the briefest flicker of uncertainty had touched the dark eyes and his hands pouring her drink were absolutely steady only when he finished did he sit down for the first time and regard her for a long time in silence did she tell you he asked finally and she heard his true voice for the first time no she lied actually said it wasnt her secret to tell she hesitated i learned from eilathen by the lake i watched that i wondered kim could feel her forehead creasing with its incongruous vertical line ysanne is gone you know she said it as calmly as she could he nodded that much i know but i dont understand what has happened your hair she had lokdal down below kim said bluntly almost she wanted to hurt him with it she used it on herself he did react and she was sorry for the thought behind her words a hand came up to cover his mouth a curious gesture in such a man no he breathed oh ysanne no she could hear the loss you understand what she has done she asked there was a catch in her voice she controlled it there was so much pain i know what the dagger does yes i didnt know she had it here she must have come to love you very much not just me all of us she hesitated she dreamt me twentyfive years ago before i was born did that make it easier did anything his eyes widened that i never knew how could you he seemed to regard gaps in his awareness as deeply felt affronts but there was something else that had to be said there is more kim said his name is not to be spoken she thought then your father died this afternoon aileron there was a silence old news the elder prince of brennin said listen and after a moment she heard them all the bells in paras derval tolling the death bells for the passing of a king im sorry she said his mouth twitched then he looked out the window you cold bastard she thought old news he deserved more than that surely surely he did she was about to say as much when aileron turned back to her and she saw the river of tears pouring and pouring down his face dear god she thought shakily enduring a paroxysm of selfcondemnation he may be hard to read but how can you be that far off it would have been funny a kim ford classic except that people were going to be relying on her now for so much it was no good no good at all she was an impulsive undisciplined halfwaydecent intern from toronto what the hell was she going to do nothing at any rate for the moment she held herself very still on the bed and after a minute aileron lifted his tanned bearded face and spoke after my mother died he was never the same he dwindled will you believe that he was once a very great man this she could help him with i saw by the lake i know he was aileron i watched him until i could hardly bear it he said under control now then factions formed in the palace that wanted him to step aside for me i killed two men who spoke of it in my presence but my father grew suspicious and frightened i could not talk to him anymore and diarmuid the question seemed to genuinely surprise him my brother he was drunk most of the time and taking ladies to south keep the rest playing march warden down there there seems to be more to him than that kim said mildly to a woman perhaps she blinked that she said is insulting he considered it i suppose it is he said im sorry then he surprised her again i am not good aileron said his eyes averted at making myself liked men will usually end up respecting me if against their will because at some things they value i have a little skill but i have no skill with women the eyes almost black swung back to hers i am also hard to shake from desires i have and i am not patient with interference he was not finished i tell you these things not because i expect to change but so you will know i am aware of them there will be people i must trust and if you are a seer then you must be one of them and im afraid you will have to deal with me as i am a silence followed this not surprisingly for the first time she noticed malka and called her softly the black cat leaped to the bed and curled up on her lap ill think about it she said finally no promises im fairly stubborn myself may i point out on the original issue that loren seems to value your brother quite a bit and unless ive missed something silvercloak isnt a woman too much asperity she thought you must go carefully here ailerons eyes were unreadable he was our teacher as boys he said he has hopes still of salvaging something in diarmuid and in fairness my brother does elicit love from his followers which must mean something something she echoed gravely you dont see anything to salvage it was ironic actually she hadnt liked diarmuid at all and here she was aileron for reply merely shrugged expressively leave it then she said will you finish your story there is little left to tell when the rains receded last year and stopped absolutely this spring i suspected it was not chance i wanted to die for him so i would not have to watch him fading or see the expression in his eyes i couldnt live with him mistrusting me so i asked to be allowed to go to the summer tree and he refused again i asked again he refused then word came to paras derval of children dying on the farms and i asked again before all the court and once more he refused to grant me leave and so and so you told him exactly what you thought she could picture the scene i did and he exiled me not very effectively she said wryly would you have me leave my land seer he snapped the voice suddenly commanding it pleased her he had some caring then more than some if she were being fair so she said aileron he did right you must know that how could the high king let another die for him and knew immediately that there was something wrong you dont know then it was not a question the sudden gentleness in his voice unsettled her more than anything what please you had better tell me my father did let another go aileron said listen to the thunder your friend is on the tree pwyll he has lasted two nights this is the last if he is still alive pwyll paul it fit it fit too perfectly she was brushing tears away but others kept falling i saw him she whispered i saw him with your father in my dream but i couldnt hear what they said because there was this music and then that too fell into place oh paul she breathed it was the brahms wasnt it rachels brahms piece how could i not have remembered would you have changed anything aileron asked would you have been right to too hard that one just then she concentrated on the cat do you hate him she asked in a small voice surprising herself with the question it drove him to his feet with a startled exposed gesture he strode to the window and looked out over the lake there were bells and then thunder a day so charged with power and it wasnt over night to come the third night i will try not to he said at last so softly kim could scarcely hear it please she said feeling that somehow it mattered if only to her to ease her own gathering harvest of griefs she rose from the bed holding the cat in both arms he turned to face her the light was strange behind him then it is to be my war said aileron dan ailell she nodded you have seen this he pushed again she nodded the wind had died outside it was very quiet you would have thrown it away on the tree not thrown away but yes it was a foolishness in me not in your friend he added after a moment i went to see him there last night i could not help myself in him it is something else grief pride a dark kind it is a dark place can he last slowly aileron shook his head i dont think so he was almost gone last night paul when she thought had she last heard him laugh hes been sick she said it sounded almost irrelevant her own voice was funny too aileron touched her shoulder awkwardly i will not hate him kim he used her name for the first time i cannot it is so bravely done he has that she said she was not going to cry again he has that she repeated lifting her head and we have a war to fight we aileron asked and in his eyes she could see the entreaty he would not speak youre going to need a seer she said matteroffactly i seem to be the best youve got and i have the baelrath too he came a step towards her i am he took a breath i am pleased he managed a laugh escaped her she couldnt help it god she said on a rising note god aileron ive never met anyone who had so much trouble saying thankyou what do you do when someone passes you the salt his mouth opened and closed he looked very young anyhow she said briskly youre welcome and now wed better get going you should be in paras derval tonight dont you think it seemed that he had already saddled the horse in the barn and had only been waiting for her while aileron went out back to bring the stallion around she set about closing up the cottage the dagger and the circlet would be safest in the chamber down below she knew that sort of thing now it was instinctive she thought of raederth then and wondered if it was folly to sorrow for a man so long dead but it wasnt she knew she now knew for the dead are still in time they are travelling they are not lost ysanne was lost she still needed a long time alone kim realized but she didnt have it so there was no point even thinking the mountain had taken that kind of luxury away from all of them from all of them she did pause at that she was numbering herself among them she realized even in her thoughts are you aware she asked herself with a kind of awe that you are now the seer of the high kingdom of brennin in fionavar she was holy cow she thought talk about overachievers but then her mind swung back to aileron and the flared levity faded aileron whom she was going to help become king if she could even though his brother was the heir she would do it because her blood sang to her that this was right and that she knew by now was part of what being a seer meant she was quiet and ready when he came round the side on the horse he had a sword now and a bow slung in the saddle and he rode the black charger with an easy grace she was she had to admit impressed there was a slight issue at the outset over her refusal to leave malka behind but when she threatened to walk aileron a stony expression on his face reached a hand down and swung her up behind him with the cat he was very strong she realized he also had a scratched shoulder a minute later malka it seemed didnt like riding horseback aileron it also seemed could be remarkably articulate when swearing she told him as much sweetly and was rewarded with a quite communicative silence with the dying of the wind the haze of the day seemed to be lifting it was still light and the sun setting almost directly behind them cast its long rays along the path which was one reason the ambush failed they were attacked at the bend where she and matt had first seen the lake before the first of the svarts had leaped to the road aileron some sixth sense triggered had already kicked the stallion into a gallop there were no darts this time they had been ordered to take the whitehaired woman alive and she had only one servant as a guard it should have been easy there were fifteen of them twelve after the first rush of the horse as ailerons blade scythed on both sides she was hampering him though with a concise movement he leaped from the saddle killing another svart as he landed go on he shouted of its own accord the horse sped into a trot and then a gallop down the path no way kim thought and holding the terrified cat as best she could grappled for the reins and pulled the stallion to a halt turning she watched the battle her heart leaping into her throat though not with fear by the light of the setting sun kimberly bore witness to the first battle of aileron dan ailell in his war and a stunning a nearly debilitating grace was displayed for her then upon that lonely path to see him with a sword in his hand was almost heartbreaking it was a dance it was more some men it seemed were born to do a thing it was true because awesomely stupefyingly she saw that it had been a mismatch from the first fifteen of them with weapons and sharp teeth for close fighting against the one man with the long blade flashing in his hand and she understood that he was going to win effortlessly he was going to win it didnt last very long not one of the fifteen svart alfar survived breathing only a little quickly he cleaned his sword and sheathed it before walking toward her up the path the sun low behind him it was very quiet now his dark eyes she saw were sombre i told you to go he said i know i dont always do what im told i thought i warned you he was silent looking up at her a little skill she mimicked quite precisely his face she saw with delight had suddenly gone shy why kim ford asked did that take you so long for the first time she heard him laugh they reached paras derval at twilight with aileron hooded for concealment once inside the town they made their way quickly and quietly to lorens quarters the mage was there with matt and kevin laine kim and aileron told their stories as succinctly as they could there was little time they spoke of paul in whispers hearing the thunder gathering in the west and then when it became clear that there was something important neither she nor the prince knew they were told about jennifer at which point it was made evident that notwithstanding a frightened cat or a kingdom that needed her the new seer of brennin could still fall apart with the best of them twice during the day he thought it was the end there was very great pain he was badly sunburned now and so dry dry as the land which he had thought earlierhow much earlier was probably the point the nexus it all seemed so simple at times it came down to such basic correspondences but then his mind would start to spin to slide and with the slide all the clarity went too he may have been the only person in fionavar who didnt see the mountain send up its fire the sun was fire enough for him he heard the laughter but was so far gone he placed it elsewhere in his own hell it hurt there too he was not spared that time it was the bells that brought him back he was lucid then for an interval and knew where they were ringing though not why his eyes hurt they were puffy with sunburn and he was desperately dehydrated the sun seemed to be a different color today seemed what did he know he was so skewed nothing could be taken for what it was though the bells were ringing in paras derval he was sure of that except except that after a while listening he seemed to hear a harp sounding too and that was very bad as bad as it could be because it was a thing from his own place from behind the bolted door it wasnt out there the bells were yes but they were fading he was going again there was nothing to grab hold of no branch no hand he was bound and dry and sliding going under he saw the bolts shatter and the door opening and the room oh lady lady lady he thought then no bolts anymore nothing to bar the door under undersea down they were in bed the night before his trip of course it would be that memory because of the harp it would be his room spring night almost summer weather window open curtains blowing her hair around them both the covers back so he could see her by candlelight her candle a gift the very light was hers do you know rachel said that you are a musician after all i wish he heard himself say you know i cant even sing but no she said pursuing a conceit playing with the hairs on his chest you are youre a harper paul you have harpers hands wheres my harp then straight man and rachel said me of course my hearts your harpstring what could he do but smile the very light you know she said when i play next month the brahms itll be for you no for yourself keep that for yourself she smiled he couldnt see it but he knew by now when rachel smiled stubborn man she touched him lightly with her mouth share it then can i play the second movement for you will you take that let me play that part because i love you to tell oh lady he had said hand of the harper heart of the harpstring lady lady lady what had brought him back this time he didnt know the sun was gone though dark coming down fireflies third night then last for three nights and forever the king had said the king was dead how did he know that and after a moment it seemed that very far down below the burnt strungout place of pain he had become a part of him remained that could fear how did he know ailell was dead the tree had told him it knew the passing of high kings it always did it had been rooted here to summon them far back in the soil of time from iorweth to ailell they were the children of mörnir and the tree knew when they died and now he knew as well he understood now i give you to mörnir the other part of the consecration he was given he was becoming root branch he was naked there skin to bark naked in all the ways there were it seemed because the dark was coming down inside again the door unbolting he was so open the wind could pass through him light shine shadow fall like a child again light and shade simplicity when had all the twisting started he could remember a different door this playing baseball on the street as darkness fell playing even after the streetlights kicked on so that the ball would come flashing like a comet out of brightness and into dark elusive but attainable the smell of cut grass and porch flowers the leather of a new fielders glove summer twilight summer dark all the continuities when had it turned why did it have to turn the process changing to disjunctions abortings endings all of them raining down like arrows unlit and inescapable and then love love the deepest discontinuity because it seemed that this door had turned into the other one after all the one he couldnt face not even childhood was safe anymore not tonight nowhere would be safe tonight not here at the end naked on the tree and he understood then finally understood that it had to be naked truly so that one went to the god it was the tree that was stripping him layer by layer down to what he was hiding from to whathadnt there once been a thing called irony he had come here hiding from music her name tears rain the highway he was skewed again going down the fireflies among the trees had become headlights of approaching cars which was so absurd but then it wasnt after all because now he was in the car driving her eastward on lakeshore boulevard in the rain it had rained the night she died i dont i dont want to go herehe thought clinging to nothing his minds last despairing effort to pull away please just let me die let me be rain for them but no he was the arrow now the arrow on the tree of mörnir and he was to be given naked or not at all or not at all there was that he realized he could die that was still his choice he could let go it was there for him and so on the third night paul schafer came to the last test the one that was always failed the opening where the kings of brennin or those coming in their name discovered that the courage to be here the strength to endure even love of their land were none of them enough on the tree one could no longer hide from the living or the dead from ones own soul naked or not at all one went to mörnir and oh that was too much for them too hard too unfair after all that had been endured to be forced to go into the darkest places then so weak so impossibly vulnerable and so they would let go brave kings of the sword wise ones gallant princes all would turn away from so much nakedness and die too soon but not that night because of pride of pure stubbornness and because most surely of the dog paul schafer found the courage not to turn down he went arrow of the god so open the wind could pass light shine through him last door the dvorak he heard his own voice laughing the dvorak with the symphony kincaid are you a star she laughed nervously its only at ontario place outdoors with a baseball game in the background at the stadium no one will hear a thing wally will hear wally loves you already since when have you and walter langside been so close since the recital lady since his review hes my main man now wally she had won everything won them all she had dazzled all three papers had been there because of advance rumor of what she was it was unheardof for a graduate recital the second movement langside of the globe had written could not be played more beautifully she had won everything had eclipsed every cellist ever to come out of edward johnson hall and today the toronto symphony had called the dvorak cello concerto august at ontario place unheardof so they had gone to winstons for dinner to blow a hundred dollars of his bursary money from the history department itll probably rain she said the wipers slapped their steady tattoo on the windshield it was really coming down the bandstands covered he replied airily and the first ten rows besides if it rains you dont have to fight the blue jays cant lose kid well youre pretty high tonight i am indeed he heard the person he had been say pretty high tonight i am very high he passed a laboring chevy oh shit rachel said please a lost small voice within the godwood pleaded his oh please but he was inside it now had taken himself there all the way there was no pity on the summer tree how could there be so open he was the rain could fall through him oh shit she said what he heard himself say startled saw it start right then right there the moment wipers at the top of their sweep lakeshore east just past a blue chevrolet she was silent glancing he could see her hands clasped tightly together her head was down what was this ive got something to tell you evidently oh god his defences she looked over at that dark eyes like no one else i promised she said i promised id talk to you tonight promised he tried watched himself try rachel what is it eyes front again her hands you were away for a month paul i was away for a month yes you know why hed gone four weeks before her recital had convinced them both it made sensethe time was too huge for her it meant too much she was playing eight hours a day he wanted to let her focus he flew to calgary with kev and drove his brothers car through the rockies and then south down the california coast had phoned her twice a week you know why he heard himself say again it had begun well i did some thinking one should always do some thinking paul dont be like what do you want from me he snapped what is this rach so so so mark asked me to marry him mark mark rogers was her accompanist lastyear piano student goodlooking mild a little effeminate it didnt fit he couldnt make it fit all right he said that happens it happens when youve got a common goal for a while theatre romance he fell in love rachel youre easy to fall in love with but why are you telling me this way because im going to say yes no warning at all pointblank nothing had ever prepared him for this kick summer night but god he was so cold so cold suddenly just like that reflex no not just like that dont be so cold paul he heard himself make a sound a gasp a laugh halfway he was actually shivering dont be so cold paul thats just the sort of thing she said twisting her hands together youre always so controlled thinking figuring out like figuring out i needed to be alone a month or why mark fell in love with me so much logic marks not so strong he needs me i can see the ways he needs me he cries paul cries nothing held together anymore what did crying have to do with it i didnt know you liked a niobe number it was important to stop shivering i dont please dont be nasty i cant handle it paul its that you never truly let go you never made me feel i was indispensable i guess im not but mark puts his head on my chest sometimes after oh jesus rachel dont its true it was raining harder trouble breathing now so he plays harp too versatile i must say god such a kick he was so cold she was crying i didnt want it to be she didnt want it to be like this how had she wanted it to be oh lady lady lady its okay he found himself saying incredibly where had that come from trouble breathing still rain on the roof on the windshield itll be all right no rachel said weeping still rain drumming sometimes it cant be all right smart smart girl once he would have reached to touch her once ten minutes ago only that before the cold love love the deepest discontinuity or not quite the deepest because this precisely was when the mazda in front blew a tire the road was wet it skidded sideways and hit the ford in the next lane then rebounded and threesixtied as the ford caromed off the guard rail there was no room to brake he was going to plough them both except there was a foot twelve inches clearance if he went by on the left he knew thered been a foot had seen the movie in slow motion in his head so many times twelve inches not impossible very bad in rain but he went for it sliced the whirling mazda banged the rail spun and rolled across the road and into the sliding ford he was belted she wasnt that was all there was to it except for the truth the truth was that there had indeed been twelve inches perhaps ten as likely fourteen enough enough if he had gone for it as soon as he saw the hole but he hadnt had he by the time hed moved there were three inches clear four not enough at night in rain at forty miles an hour not nearly question how did one measure time there at the end answer by how much room there was over and over hed watched the film in his mind over and over hed seen them roll off the rail into the ford over because he hadnt moved fast enough and whydo pay attention mr schaferwhy hadnt he moved fast enough well class modern techniques now allow us to examine the thought patterns of that driver in the scintillalovely word thatof time between the seeing and the moving between the desire and the spasm as mr eliot so happily put it once and where on close examination was the desire not that we can be sure class this is most hazardous terrain it was raining after all but careful scrutiny of the data does seem to elicit a curious lacuna in the drivers responses he moved oh yes indeed he did and in fairnessdo lets be fairfaster than most drivers would have done but was itand theres the rubwas it as fast as he could move is it possible just a hypothesis now but is it possible that he delayed that scintilla of timeonly that no more but stillbecause he wasnt entirely sure he wanted to move the desire and the spasm mr schafer your thoughts was there perhaps a slight shall we say lag in the desire dead on st michaels emergency ward the deepest discontinuity it should have been me hed said to kevin you had to pay the price one way or another you certainly werent allowed to weep too much hypocrisy that would be part of the price then no tears no release what had crying to do with it he had asked her or no he had thought that niobe he had said a niobe number witty witty defenses up so fast seatbelt buckled so cold though hed been so very cold crying it seemed had a lot to do with it after all but there was more one played the tape over and over like the inner film like the rolling car over and over the tape of her recital and one listened always in the second movement for the lie his she had said that part because she loved him so it had to be a lie one should be able to hear that despite walter langside and everyone else surely one could hear the lie not so her love for him in that sound that perfect sound incandescent and this was beyond him how it could be done and so each time there came a point where he couldnt listen anymore and not cry and he wasnt permitted to cry so so she had left him and he had killed her and you werent allowed to weep when you have done that you pay the price so so he had come to fionavar to the summer tree class dismissed time to die this time it was the silence complete and utter stillness in the wood the thunder had stopped he was cinder husk what is left at the end at the end one came back because it seemed this much was granted that one would go in ones own self from this place knowing it was an unexpected dispensation drained a shell he could still feel gratitude for dignity allowed it was unnaturally silent in the darkness even the pulsing of the tree itself had stopped there was no wind no sound the fireflies had gone nothing moved it was as if the earth itself had stopped moving then it came he saw that inexplicably a mist was rising from the floor of the forest but no not inexplicably a mist was rising because it was meant to rise what could be explained in this place with difficulty he turned his head first one way then the other there were two birds on the branches ravens both of them i know these he thought no longer capable of surprise they are named thought and memory i learned this long ago it was true they were named so in all the worlds and this was their nesting place they were the gods even the birds were still though each bright yellow eye steady motionless waiting as the trees were waiting only the mist was moving it was higher now there was no sound the whole of the godwood seemed to have gathered itself as if time were somehow opening making a placeand only then finally did paul realize that it was not the god they were waiting for it was something else not truly part of the ritual something outside and he remembered an image then thought memory of something far back another life it seemed another person almost who had had a dream no a vision a searching yes that was it of mist yes and a wood and waiting yes waiting for the moon to rise when something something but the moon could not rise it was the dark of moon new moon night the last crescent had saved the dog the night before had saved him for this they were waiting the godwood the whole night was waiting coiled like a spring but there could be no moonrise that night and then there was above the eastern trees of the glade of the summer tree there came the rising of the light and on the night of the new moon there shone down on fionavar the light of a full moon as the trees of the forest began to murmur and sway in the sudden wind paul saw that the moon was red like fire or blood and power shaped that moment to its name dana the mother come to intercede goddess of all the living in all the worlds mother sister daughter bride of the god and paul saw then in a blaze of insight that it didnt matter which all were true that at this level of power this absoluteness of degree hierarchies ceased to signify only the might did the awe the presence made manifest red moon in the sky on new moon night so that the glade of the godwood could shine and the summer tree be wrapped below in mist above in light paul looked up beyond surprise beyond disbelief the sacrifice the shell rain to be and in that moment it seemed to him as if he heard a voice in the sky in the wood in the running of his own mooncolored blood and the voice spoke so that all the trees vibrated like living wands to the sound it was not so will not have been so and when the reverberations ceased paul was on the highway again rachel with him in the rain and once more he saw the mazda blow and skid into the ford he saw the spinning impossible obstruction he saw twelve inches clearance on the left but dana was with him now the goddess taking him there to truth and in a crescendo a heartsearing blaze of final dispensation he saw that he had missed the gap and only just oh only just not because of any hesitation shaped by lack of desire by death or murder wish but because in the end he was human oh lady he was only only human and he missed because of hurt grief shock and rain because of these which could be forgiven and were he understood truly truly were deny not your own mortality the voice was within him like a wind one of her voices only one he knew and in the sound was love he was loved you failed because humans fail it is a gift as much as anything else and then deep within him like the low sound of a harp which no longer hurt this last go easy and in peace it is well his throat ached his heart was a bound constrained thing too large for him for what was left of his body dimly through the risen mist he saw a figure at the edge of the glade in the form of a man but bearing the proud antlers of a stag and through the mist he saw the figure bow to him and then disappear time was the pain was gone his being was shaped of light he knew his eyes were shining he had not killed her then it was all right it was loss but loss was allowed it was demanded so much light there seemed to be even in that moment when the mist rose to his feet and at last it came at last sweet sweet release of mourning he thought of kevins song then remembered it with love there will come a tomorrow when you weep for me tomorrow and so so it seemed that this was tomorrow and here at the end at the last he was weeping for rachel kincaid who had died so paul cried on the summer tree and there came then a roll of thunder like the tread of doom of worlds cracking asunder and the god was there in the glade he had come and he spoke again in his place in the one unchanging voice that was his and forged by the power of that thundering the mist began to flow together then faster and faster to the one place to the summer tree upwards it boiled the mist of the godwood up through the sacrifice the great trunk of the tree hurled into the night sky by the god like a spear and in the heavens above brennin as the thunder crashed and rolled suddenly there were clouds piling higher and higher upon each other spreading from the mörnirwood to cover all the land paul felt it going through him his his and the gods whose he was he felt the tears on his face he felt himself claimed going mist boiling through him ravens rising to fly the god in the tree in him the moon above the clouds riding in and out never lost rachel the summer tree the wood the world and oh the god the god and then one last thing more before the dark ram rain rain rain rain in paras derval that night the people went down into the streets in villages all over brennin they did so and farmers bore their children out of doors only half awake that they might see the miraculous moon that was answer of the mother to the fire of maugrim and that they might feel upon their faces and remember though it might seem to them a dream the return of rain which was the blessing of the god upon the children of mörnir in the street with loren and matt with kim and the exiled prince kevin laine wept in his turn for he knew what this must mean and paul was the closest thing to a brother hed ever had he did it whispered loren silvercloak in a voice choked and roughened with awe kevin saw with some surprise that the mage too was crying oh bright loren said oh most brave oh paul but there was more look matt sören said and turning to where the dwarf was pointing kevin saw that when the red moon that should never have been shone through the scudding clouds the stone in the ring kim wore leaped into responding light it burned on kims finger like a carried fire the color of the moon what is this aileron asked kim instinctively raising her hand high so that light could speak to light realized that she both knew and didnt know the baelrath was wild untamed so was that moon the stone is being charged she said quietly that is the war moon overhead this is the warstone the others were silent hearing her and suddenly her own voice intoning her role seemed so heavy kim reached back almost desperately for some trace of the lightness that had once defined her i think she tried hoping that kevin at least would catch it would play along help her please to remember what she was i think wed better have a new flag made kevin wrestling with things of his own missed it completely all he heard was kim saying we to this new prince of brennin looking at her he thought he was seeing a stranger in the courtyard behind the sanctuary jaelle the high priestess lifted her face to the sky and gave praise and with the teachings of gwen ystrat in her heart she looked at the moon understanding far better than anyone else west of lake leinan what it meant she gave careful thought for a time then called six of her women to her and led them secretly out of paras derval westward in the rain in cathal too they had seen the mountains fire in the morning and trembled to hear the laughter on the wind now the red moon shone above larai rigal as well power on power a gauntlet hurled into the sky and answered in the sky this shalhassan could understand he summoned a council in the dead of night and ordered an embassy to leave for cynan and then brennin immediately no not in the morning he snapped in response to a rash question immediately one did not sleep when war began or one slept forever when it ended a good phrase he thought dismissing them he made a mental note to dictate it to raziel when time allowed then he went to bed over eridu the red moon rose and the plain and down upon daniloth it cast its light and the lios alfar alone of all the guardian peoples had lore stretching back sufficiently far to say with certainty that no such moon had ever shone before it was a reply to rakoth their elders agreed gathered before ratenniel on the mound at atronel to the one the younger gods had named sathain the hooded one long long ago it was an intercession as well the wisest of them added though for what or as to what they could not say nor could they say what the third power of the moon was though all the lios knew there was a third the goddess worked by threes there was another glade in another wood a glade where one man alone had dared to walk in ten centuries since amairgen had died the glade was small the trees of the grove about were very old extremely tall the moon was almost overhead before she could shine down upon pendarans sacred grove when she did it began a play of light first a shimmering and then a sound following unearthly like a flute among the leaves the air itself seemed to quiver to that tune to dance to form and reform coalesce to shape finally a creature of light and sound of pendaran and the moon when it was ended there was silence and something stood in the glade where nothing had stood before with the wide eyes of the newly born dewed so that her coat glistened in the birthing light she rose on unsteady legs and stood a moment as one more sound like a single string plucked ran through pendaran wood slowly then delicately as all her kind she moved from the glade from the sacred grove eastward she went for though but newly birthed she knew already that to the west lay the sea lightly lightly did she tread the grass and the powers of pendaran all the creatures gathered there grew still as she passed more beautiful more terrible than any one of them the goddess worked by threes this was the third to the highest battlement he had climbed so that all of black starkadh lay below him starkadh rebuilt his fortress and his fastness for the blasting of rangat had not signified his freedomthough let the fools think so yet awhilehe had been free a long time now the mountain had been exploded because he was ready at last for war with the place of his power rising anew to tower over the northland over daniloth a blur to the south where his hearts hate would forever lie but he did not look down upon it instead his eyes were riveted on the impossible response the night sky held up to him and in that moment he tasted doubt with his one good hand he reached upwards as if his talons might rake the moon from heaven and it was a long time before his rage passed but he had changed in a thousand years under rangat hate had driven him to move too fast the last time this time it would not let the moon shine tonight he would have it down before the end he would smash brennin like a toy and uproot the summer tree the riders would be scattered larai rigal burned to waste calor diman defiled in eridu and gwen ystrat he would level let the moon shine then let dana try to show forth empty signs in heavens choked with his smoke her too he would have kneeling before him he had had a thousand years to consider all of this he smiled then for the last was best when all else was done when fionavar lay crushed beneath his fist only then would he turn to daniloth one by one he would have them brought to him the lios alfar the children of light one by one by one to starkadh he would know what to do with them the thunder was almost spent the rain a thin drizzle the wind was wind no more a taste of salt on it from the sea far away the clouds were breaking up the red moon stood directly over the tree lady said the god muting the thunder of his voice lady this you have never done before it was needful she replied a chiming on wind he is very strong this time he is very strong the thunder echoed why did you speak to my sacrifice a slight reproach the ladys voice grew deeper woven of hearth smoke and caves do you mind she murmured there came a sound that might have been a god amused not if you beg forgiveness no it has been long lady a deeper sound and meaningful do you know what i have done in pendaran she asked eluding voice gossamer like dawn i do though for good or ill i do not know it may burn the hand that lays hold of it all my gifts are doubleedged the goddess said and he was aware of ancient blood in that tone there was a silence then she was finest lace again cajoling i have interceded lord will you not do so for them and to please me said the moon might we please each other we might so a roll of thunder then laughter i have interceded mörnir said not the rain she protested seasound the rain was bought not the rain the god replied i have done what i have done let us go then said dana the moon passed away behind the trees to the west shortly thereafter the thunder ceased and the clouds began to break up overhead and so at the last at the end of night in the sky above the summer tree there were only the stars to look down upon the sacrifice upon the stranger hanging naked on the tree only the stars only them before dawn it rained again though the glade was empty by then and silent save for the sound of water falling and dripping from the leaves and this was the last night of pwyll the stranger on the summer tree part iiithe children of ivor chapter he landed badly but the reflexes of an athlete took him rolling through the fall and at the end of it he was on his feet unhurt very angry though he had opted out damn it what the hell right did kim ford have to grab his arm and haul him to another world what the he stopped the fury draining as realization came down hard she had she really had taken him to another world a moment ago he had been in a room in the park plaza hotel now he found himself outdoors in darkness with a cool wind blowing and a forest nearby looking the other way he saw wide rolling grasslands stretching away as far as he could see in the moonlight he looked around for the others and then as the fact of isolation slowly came home dave martyniuks anger gave way to fear they werent friends of his that was for sure but this was no time or place to have ended up alone they couldnt be far he thought managing to keep control kim ford had had his arm surely that meant she couldnt be far away her and the others and that lorenzo marcus guy whod got him into this in the first place and was going to get him out or deal with severe bodily pain martyniuk vowed notwithstanding the provisions of the criminal code which reminded him looking down he saw that he was still clutching kevin laines evidence notes the absurdity the utter incongruousness in this night place of wind and grass acted somehow to loosen him he took a deep breath like before the opening jump in a game it was time to get his bearings boy scout time paras derval where ailell reigns the old man had said any cities on the horizon as the moon slipped from behind a drift of cloud dave turned north into the wind and saw rangat clear he was not as it happened anywhere near the others all kim had been able to do with her desperate grab for his arm was keep him in the same plane as them the same world he was in fionavar but a long way north and the mountain loomed fortyfive thousand feet up into the moonlight white and dazzling holy mother dave exclaimed involuntarily it saved his life of the nine tribes of the dalrei all but one had moved east and south that season though the best grazing for the eltor was still in the northwest as it always was in summer the messages the auberei brought back from celidon were clear though svart alfar and wolves in the edgings of pendaran were enough for most chieftains to take their people away there had been rumors of urgach among the svarts as well it was enough south of adein and rienna they went to the leaner smaller herds and the safety of the country around cynmere and the latham ivor dan banor chieftain of the third tribe was as often the exception not that he did not care for the safety of his tribe his children no man who knew him could think that it was just that there were other things to consider ivor thought awake late at night in the chieftains house for one the plain and the eltor herds belonged to the dalrei and not just symbolically colan had given them to revor after the bael rangat to hold he and his people for so long as the high kingdom stood it had been earned by the mad ride in terror through pendaran and the shadowland and a loop in the thread of time to explode singing into battle on a sunset field that else had been lost ivor stirred just thinking on it for the horsemen the children of peace to have done this thing there had been giants in the old days giants who had earned the plain to have and to hold ivor thought not to scurry to sheltered pockets of land at the merest rumor of danger it stuck in ivors craw to run from svart alfar so the third tribe stayed not on the edge of pendaranthat would have been foolhardy and unnecessary there was a good camp five leagues from the forest and they had the dense herds of the eltor to themselves it was the hunters agreed a luxury he noticed that they still made the sign against evil though when the chase took them within sight of the great wood there were some ivor knew who would rather have been elsewhere he had other reasons though for staying it was bad in the south the auberei reported from celidon brennin was locked in a drought and cryptic word had come from his friend tulger of the eighth tribe that there was trouble in the high kingdom what ivor thought did they need to go into that for after a harsh winter what the tribe needed was a mild sweet summer in the north they needed the cool breeze and the fat herds for feasting and warm coats against the coming of fall there was another reason too more than the usual number of boys would be coming up to their fasts this year spring and summer were the time for the totem fasts among the dalrei and the third tribe had always been luckiest in a certain copse of trees here in the northwest it was a tradition here ivor had seen his own hawk gazing with bright eyes back at him from the top of an elm on his second night it was a good place faelinn grove and the young ones deserved to lie there if they could tabor too his younger son was fourteen past time it might be this summer ivor had been twelve when he found his hawk levon his older sonhis heir chieftain after himhad seen his totem at thirteen it was whispered among the girls who were always competing for him that levon had seen a king horse on his fast this ivor knew was not true but there was something of the stallion about levon in the brown eyes the unbridled carriage the open guileless nature even his long thick yellow hair which he wore unbound tabor though tabor was different although that was unfair ivor told himselfhis intense younger son was only a boy yet he hadnt had his fasting this summer perhaps and he wanted tabor to have the lucky wood and above and beyond all of these ivor had another reason still a vague presence at the back of his mind as yet undefined he left it there such things he knew from experience would be made clear to him in their time he was a patient man so they stayed even now there were two boys in faelinn grove gereint had spoken their names two days ago and the shamans word began the passage from boy to man among the dalrei there were two in the wood then fasting but though faelinn was lucky it was also close to pendaran and ivor father to all his tribe had taken quiet steps to guard them they would be shamed and their fathers if they knew so it had been only with a look in his eye that he had alerted tore to ride out with them unseen tore was often away from the camps at night it was his way the younger ones joked that his animal had been a wolf they laughed too hard at that a little afraid tore he did look like a wolf with his lean body his long straight black hair and the dark unrevealing eyes he never wore a shirt or moccasins only his eltor skin leggings dyed black to be unseen at night the outcast no fault of his own ivor knew and resolved for the hundredth time to do something about that name it hadnt been any fault of tores father sorcha either just sheerest bad luck but sorcha had slain an eltor doe that was carrying young an accident the hunters agreed at the gathering the buck hed slashed had fallen freakishly into the path of the doe beside it the doe had stumbled over him and broken her neck when the hunters came up they had seen that she was bearing an accident which let ivor make it exile and not death he could not do more no chieftain could rise above the laws and hold his people exile then for sorcha a lonely dark fate to be driven from the plain the next morning they had found meisse his wife dead by her own hand tore at eleven only child had been left doubly scarred by tragedy he had been named by gereint that summer the same summer as levon barely twelve he had found his animal and had remained ever after a loner on the fringes of the tribe as good a hunter as any of ivors people as good even honesty made ivor concede as levon or perhaps not quite not quite as good the chieftan smiled to himself in the dark that he thought was selfindulgent tore was his son as well the whole tribe were his children he liked the dark man too though tore could be difficult he also trusted him tore was discreet and competent with tasks like the one tonight awake beside leith his people all about him in the camp the horses shut in for the night ivor felt better knowing tore was out there in the dark with the boys he turned on his side to try to sleep after a moment the chieftain recognized a muffled sound and realized that someone else was awake in the house he could hear tabors stifled sobbing from the room he shared with levon it was hard for the boy he knew fourteen was late not to be named especially for the chieftains son for levons brother he would have comforted his younger son but knew it was wiser to leave the boy alone it was not a bad thing to learn what hurt meant and mastering it alone helped engender selfrespect tabor would be all right in a little while the crying stopped eventually ivor too fell asleep though first he did something hed not done for a long time he left the warmth of his bed of leith sound asleep beside him and went to look in on his children first the boys fair uncomplicated levon nutbrown wiry tabor and then he walked into lianes room cordeliane his daughter with a bemused pride he gazed at her dark brown hair at the long lashes of her closed eyes the upturned nose laughing mouth even in sleep she smiled how had he stocky square plain ivor come to have such handsome sons a daughter so fair all of the third tribe were his children but these these tore had been having a bad night first the two idiots who had come to fast had managed to end up totally oblivious within twenty feet of each other on precisely opposite sides of a clump of bushes in the wood it was ridiculous what sort of babies were they sending out these days he had managed with a series of snuffling grunts that really were rather unnerving to scare one of them into moving a quarter of a mile away it was an interference with the ritual he supposed but the fast had barely begun and in any case the babies needed all the help they could get the man smell in those bushes had been so strong theyd have likely ended up finding only each other for totem animals that he thought was funny tore didnt find many things funny but the image of two fasting thirteenyearolds becoming each others sacred beasts made him smile in the dark he stopped smiling when his sweep of the grove turned up a spoor he didnt recognize after a moment though he realized that it had to be an urgach which was worse than bad svart alfar would not have disturbed him unless there were a great many he had seen small numbers of them on his solitary forays westward towards pendaran hed also found the trail of a very large band with wolves among them it had been a week before and they were moving south fairly quickly it had not been a pleasant thing to find and hed reported it to ivor and to levon as leader of the hunt but it was for the time being no direct concern of theirs this was hed never seen one of the urgach no one in the tribe had but there were legends enough and night stories to make him very cautious indeed he remembered the tales very well from before the bad time when hed been only a child in the third tribe a child like all the others shivering with pleasurable fear by the fire dreading his mothers summons to bed while the old ones told their stories kneeling over the spoor tores lean face was grim this was not pendaran wood where creatures of darkness were known to walk an urgach or more than one in faelinn grove the lucky wood of the third tribe was serious it was more than serious there were two babies fasting tonight moving silently tore followed the heavy almost overpowering spoor and dismayed he saw that it led eastward out of the grove urgach on the plain dark things were abroad for the first time he wondered about the chieftains decision to stay in the northwest this summer they were alone far from celidon far from any other tribe that might have joined numbers with them against what evils might be moving here the children of peace the dalrei were named but sometimes peace had been hard won tore had no problems with being alone he had been so all his adult life outcast the young ones called him in mockery the wolf stupid babies wolves ran in packs when had he ever the solitude had made for some bitterness for he was young yet and the memory of other times was fresh enough to be a wound it had also given him a certain dour reflectiveness born of long nights in the dark and an outsiders view of what humans did another kind of animal if he lacked tolerance it was not a surprising flaw he had very quick reflexes the knife was in his hand and he was low to the gully and crawling from the trees as soon as he glimpsed the bulky shadow in a brief unsheathing of moonlight there were clouds or else he would have seen it earlier it was very big he was downwind which was good moving with honed speed and silence tore traversed the open ground towards the figure hed seen his bow and sword were on his horse a stupidity can you kill an urgach with a knife a part of him wondered the rest of him was concentrating he had moved to within ten feet the creature hadnt noticed him but it was obviously angry and it was very largealmost a foot taller than he was bulking hugely in the shadows of the night he decided to wait for moonlight and throw for the head one didnt stop to talk with creatures from ones nightmares the size of it made his heart racetearing fangs on a creature that big the moon slanted out he was ready he drew back his arm to throw the dark head was clearly outlined against the silvered plain looking the other way north holy mother the urgach said tores arm had already begun its descent with a brutal effort he retained control of the dagger cutting himself in the process creatures of evil did not invoke the goddess not in that voice looking again in the bright moonlight tore saw that the creature before him was a man strangely garbed and very big but he seemed to be unarmed drawing breath tore called out in a voice as courteous as the circumstances seemed to permit move slowly and declare yourself at the snarled command daves heart hit his throat and jackknifed back into his ribcage who the hell rather than pursue this inquiry however he elected to move slowly and declare himself turning toward the voice with his hands outspread and bearing only evidence notes he said as levelly as he could my name is martyniuk dave martyniuk i dont know where i am and im looking for someone named loren he brought me here a moment passed he felt the wind from the north ruffling his hair he was he realized very frightened then a shadow rose from a hollow he hadnt even seen and moved towards him silvercloak the shadow asked materializing in the moonlight as a young man shirtless despite the wind barefoot and clad in leggings of black he carried a long quite lethallooking blade in his hand oh god dave thought what have they done to me carefully his eyes on the knife he replied yes loren silvercloak thats his name he took a breath trying to calm down please dont misunderstand anything im here in peace i dont even want to be here i got separated were supposed to be in a place called paras derval do you know it the other man seemed to relax a little i know it how is it that you dont because im not from here dave exclaimed frustration hitting his voice we crossed from my world earth he said hopefully then realized how stupid that was where is silvercloak then arent you listening martyniuk exploded i told you i got separated i need him to go home all i want to do is get home as fast as i can cant you understand that there was another silence why the other man asked shouldnt i just kill you daves breath escaped in a hiss he hadnt handled this too well it seemed god he wasnt a diplomat why hadnt kevin laine been separated from the others dave considered jumping the other man but something told him this lean person knew how to use that blade extremely well he had a sudden inspiration because he gambled loren wouldnt like it im his friend hell be looking for me you are too quick to renounce friendship the mage had said the night before not always dave thought not tonight boy it seemed to work too martyniuk lowered his hands slowly im unarmed he said im lost will you help me please the other man sheathed his blade at last ill take you to ivor he said and gereint they both know silvercloak well go to the camp in the morning why not now because the other said i have a job to do and i suppose youll have to do it with me now how what there are two babies in that wood fasting for their animals weve got to watch over them make sure they dont cut themselves or something he held up a bleeding hand like i did not killing you you are among the dalrei ivors tribe the third and lucky for you he is a stubborn man or the only thing you would find here would be eltor and svart alfar and the one would flee you and the other kill my name he said is tore now come the babies as tore insisted on calling the two thirteenyearolds seemed to be all right if they were lucky tore explained they would each see an animal before dawn if not the fast would continue and he would have to watch another night they were sitting with their backs against a tree in a small clearing midway between the two boys tores horse a small dark gray stallion grazed nearby what are we watching for dave asked a little nervously night forests were not his usual habitat i told you there are svart alfar around here word of them has driven all the other tribes south there was a svart alfar in our world dave volunteered it followed loren matt sören killed it loren said they werent dangerous and there werent many of them tore raised his eyebrows there are more than there used to be he said and though they may not be dangerous to a mage they were bred to kill and they do it very well dave had an uncomfortable prickly feeling suddenly tore spoke of killing with disquieting frequency the svarts would be enough to worry about tore went on but just before i saw you i found the spoor of an urgachi took you for it back there i was going to kill first and investigate after such creatures have not been seen for hundreds of years it is very bad that they are back i dont know what it means what are they tore made a strange gesture and shook his head not at night he said we shouldnt be talking of them out here he repeated the gesture dave settled back against the tree it was late he supposed he should try to sleep but he was far too keyed up tore no longer seemed to be in a talking mood that was okay by him on the whole it looked all right could have been a lot worse he appeared to have landed among people who knew the mage the others couldnt be too far away it would probably work out if he didnt get eaten by something in these woods on the other hand tore obviously knew what he was doing roll with it he thought after about threequarters of an hour tore rose to check on his babies he looped east and came back ten minutes later nodding his head barth is all right and well hidden now too not as stupid as most of them he continued west to look hi on the other one a few minutes later he reappeared again well tore began approaching the tree only an athlete could have done it with purest reflex dave launched himself at the apparition that had emerged from the trees beside tore he hit the hairy apelike creature with the hardest crossbody block he could throw and the sword swinging to decapitate tore was deflected away sprawled flat with the breath knocked out of him dave saw the huge creatures other hand coming down he managed to parry with his left forearm and felt a numbing sensation from the contact god he thought staring into the enraged red eyes of what had to be the urgach this sucker is strong he didnt even have time to be afraid rolling clumsily away from the urgachs shortrange sword thrust he saw a body hurtle past him tore knife in hand had hurled himself straight at the creatures head the urgach dropped its awkward sword and with a terrifying snarl easily blocked tores arm shifting its grip it threw the rider bodily away to smash into a tree senseless for a moment one on one dave thought tores dive had given him time to get to his feet but everything was moving so fast whirling he fled to where tores tethered horse was neighing in terror and he grabbed the sword resting by the saddlecloth a sword he thought what the hell do i do with a sword parry like crazy the urgach weapon reclaimed was right on top of him and it levelled a great twohanded sweep of its own giant blade dave was a strong man but the jarring impact of blocking that blow made his right arm go almost as numb as his left he staggered backwards tore he cried desperately i cant he stopped because there was suddenly no need to say anything more the urgach was swaying like a toppling rock and a moment later it fell forward with a crash tores dagger embedded to the hilt in the back of its skull the two men gazed at each other across the dead body of the monstrous creature well said tore finally still breathing hard now i know why i didnt kill you what dave felt then was so rare and unexpected it took him a moment to recognize it ivor up with the sun and watching by the southwest gate saw barth and navon come walking back together he could tellit was not hardfrom the way they moved that they had both found something in the wood found or been found by as gereint said they had gone out as boys and were coming back to him his children still but riders now riders of the dalrei so he lifted his voice in greeting that they should be welcomed by their chieftain back from the dreamworld to the tribe hola cried ivor that all should hear see who comes let there be rejoicing for see the weaver sends two new riders to us they all rushed out then having waited with suppressed excitement so that the chieftain should be first to announce the return it was a tradition of the third tribe since the days of lahor his grandfather barth and navon were welcomed home with honor and jubilation their eyes were wide yet with wonder not yet fully returned from the other world from the visions that fasting and night and gereints secret drink had given them they seemed untouched fresh which was as it should be ivor led them one on either side letting them walk beside him now as was fit for men to the quarters set apart for gereint he went inside with them and watched as they knelt before the shaman that he might confirm and consecrate their animals never had one of ivors children tried to dissemble about his fast to claim a totem when there had been none or pretend in his mind that an eltor had been an eagle or a boar it was still the task of the shaman to find in them the truth of their vigil so that in the tribe gereint knew the totems of every rider it was thus in all the tribes so it was written at celidon so was the law at length gereint lifted his head from where he sat crosslegged on his mat he turned unerringly to where ivor stood the light from outside silhouetting him their hour knows their name the shaman said it was done the words that defined a rider had been spoken the hour that none could avoid and the sanctity of their secret name ivor was assailed suddenly by a sense of the sweep the vastness of time for twelve hundred years the dalrei had ridden on the plain for twelve hundred years each new rider had been so proclaimed should we feast he asked gereint formally indeed we should came the placid reply we should have the feast of the new hunters it shall be so ivor said so many times he and gereint had done this summer after summer was he getting old he took the two newest riders and led them into the sunlight to where all the tribe was gathered before the door of the shamans house their hour knows he said and smiled to hear the roar that went up he gave navon and barth back to their families at last sleep he urged them both knowing what the morrow would be like knowing he would not be heeded who slept on this day levon had he remembered but he had been three nights in the grove and had come out at the last hollowed and otherworldly a difficult farvoyaging fast it had been as was fitting for one who would one day lead the tribe thinking so he watched his people stream away then ducked back into the darkness of gereints house there was never any light in that house no matter which camp they occupied the shaman had not moved it is well ivor said hunkering down beside the old one gereint nodded it is well i think they should both do and barth may be something more it was the closest he ever came to giving the chieftain a hint of what he had seen in the new ones always ivor marvelled at the shamans gift at his power he still remembered the night they had blinded gereint a child ivor had been four summers from his hawk but as banors only son he had been taken out with the men to see it done power for him all his life would be symbolized by deepvoiced chanting and torches weaving on the night plain under the stars of midsummer for some moments the two men sat quietly each wrapped in his own thoughts then ivor rose i should speak to levon about tomorrows hunt he said sixteen i think at least the shaman said in an aggrieved tone i could eat a whole one myself we havent feasted in a long time ivor ivor snorted a very long time you greedy old man twelve whole days since walen was named why arent you fat because the wisest one explained patiently you never have enough food at the feasts seventeen then ivor laughed ill see you in the morning before they go its up to levon but im going to suggest east east gereint agreed gravely but youll see me later today this too ivor had grown accustomed to the sight comes when the light goes the dalrei said it was not law but had the same force it seemed to ivor at times they found their totems in the dark and all their shamans came to their power in blindness with that ceremony on midsummer night the bright torches and the stars suddenly going black he found levon with the horses of course tending to a mare with a bad fetlock levon rose at his fathers footstep and came over pushing the yellow hair back from his eyes it was long and he never tied it back seeing levon lifted ivors heart it always did he remembered probably because hed been thinking of it earlier the morning levon had returned from his threeday fast all day he had slept boneweary the fair skin almost translucent with exhaustion late at night he had arisen and sought his father ivor and his thirteenyearold son had walked out alone into the sleeping camp i saw a cerne father levon had said suddenly a gift to him the deepest rarest gift his animal his secret name a cerne was very good ivor thought with pride strong and brave proudly horned like the god for which it was named legendary for how it would defend its young a cerne was as good as could be he nodded there had been a difficulty in his throat leith was always teasing him about how quick he was to cry he wanted to put an arm about the boy but levon was a rider now a man and had given him a mans gift mine was a hawk ivor had said and had stood beside his son their shoulders touching as they looked together at the summer sky above their sleeping people eastward right levon said now coming up there was laughter in his brown eyes i think ivor replied lets not be foolhardy its up to you though he added quickly i know east is fine ill have the two new ones anyhow its easier country to hunt how many i thought sixteen but gereint wants an eltor to himself levon threw back his head and laughed and he complained about not enough feasting didnt he always his father chuckled how many hunters then for seventeen twenty levon said immediately it was five fewer than he would have taken it put great pressure on the hunters especially with the two new ones in the band but ivor held his peace the hunting was levons now and his son knew the horses and hunters and the eltor like no one else did he believed in putting pressure on them too ivor knew it kept them sharp revor was said to have done the same thing so good was all he said choose well ill see you at home later levon raised a hand he was already turning back to the mare ivor hadnt eaten yet or talked to leith and the sun was already high he went home they were waiting for him in the front room because of gereints parting words he wasnt totally surprised this said tore without ceremony is davor he crossed from another world with loren silvercloak last night but was separated from him we killed an urgach together in faelinn last night yes ivor thought i knew there was something more he looked at the two young men the stranger a very big man bristled with a certain aggressiveness but was not truly so ivor judged tores terse words had both frightened and pleased the chieftain an urgach was unheardof news but the outcasts saying we made ivor smile inwardly the two of them had shared something in that killing he thought welcome he said to the stranger and then formally your coming is a bright thread in what is woven for us you will have to tell me as much as you care to of your story killing an urgachthat was bravely done we shall eat first though he added hastily knowing leiths rules with guests liane he called his daughter materialized instantaneously she had of course been listening behind the door ivor suppressed a smile we have guests for the morning meal he said will you find tabor and have him request gereint to come levon too gereint wont want to she said impertinently its too far hell say ivor observed that she was keeping her back to tore it was shameful that a child of his should treat a tribesman so he would have to speak to her of it this business of the outcast must be ended for the moment he said merely have tabor say that he was right this morning about what liane demanded go child ivor said there were limits with a predictable toss of her hair liane spun and left the room the stranger ivor saw had an amused look on his face and no longer clutched the sheaf of papers he carried quite so defensively it was well for the moment loren silvercloak though and an urgach in faelinn grove not for five hundred years had such a creature been reported to celidon i knew ivor thought there was another reason why we stayed this it seemed was it chapter they had found a horse for him not an easy task the dalrei tended to be smallish people quick and wiry and their mounts were much the same in winter though they traded with the men of brennin in the land where the high kingdom ran into the plain near the latham and there were always one or two larger mounts in every tribe used usually for carrying goods from camp to camp riding the placidtempered grey they had given him and with ivors younger son tabor as a guide dave had come out at dawn with levon and the hunters to watch an eltor chase his arms were in pretty rough shape but tore had to be just as bad or worse and he was hunting so dave figured he could manage to ride a horse and watch tabor skinny and tanned dark brown rode a chestnut pony beside him he wore his hair tied back like tore and most of the riders but it wasnt really long enough for that and the tied part stuck up on the back of his head like a tree stump dave remembered himself at fourteen and found an uncharacteristic empathy for the kid beside him tabor talked a lotin fact he hadnt shut up since theyd ridden outbut dave was interested and didnt mind for once we used to carry our houses with us when we moved tabor was saying as they jogged along up front levon was setting an easy pace eastward into the rising sun tore was beside him and there seemed to be about twenty other riders it was a glorious mild summer morning they werent houses like we have now of course tabor went on we made them of eltor skin and poles so they were easy to carry we have things like that in my world too dave said why did you change revor did it tabor explained whos he the boy looked pained as if appalled to discover that the fame of this revor hadnt reached toronto yet fourteen was a funny age dave thought suppressing a grin he was surprised at how cheerful he felt revor is our brightest hero tabor explained reverently he saved the high king in battle during the bael rangat by riding through daniloth and was rewarded with the land of the plain for the dalrei forever after that tabor went on earnestly revor called a great gathering of all the dalrei at celidon the midplain and said that if this was now our land we should have some mark of ourselves upon it so the camps were built in those days that our tribes might have true homes to come to as they followed the eltor about the plain how far back dave asked oh forever and ever tabor replied waving a hand forever and revor said dave surprising himself tabor looked blank for a second then giggled he was a good kid dave decided the ponytail was hilarious though the camps have been rebuilt many times since then tabor resumed his lecture he was taking his guide duties seriously we always cut wood when we are near a forestexcept pendaran of courseand we carry it to the next camp when we move sometimes the camps have been completely destroyed there are fires when the plain is dry dave nodded it made sense and i guess you have to clear out the damage the weather and animals do in between times anyway weather yes tabor said but never the animals the shamans were given a spell as a gift from gwen ystrat nothing wild ever enters the camps that dave still had problems with he remembered the old blind shaman gereint being led into the chieftains house the morning before gereint had trained his sightless eye sockets right on him dave had met the look as best he coulda staring duel with a blind manbut when gereint had turned away expressionless hed felt like crying out what did you see damn you the whole thing unnerved him it had been the only bad moment though ivor the chieftain a small leathery guy with crinkly eyes and a considered way of speaking had been all right if silvercloak was going to paras derval hed said then that is where hell be i will send word of you with the auberei to celidon and a party of us will guide you south to brennin it will be a good thing for some of our younger men to make that journey and i have tidings for ailell the high king the urgach a voice had said then from by the door and dave had turned to see liane again ivors brownhaired daughter levon had laughed father hed said we may as well make her part of the tribal council shes going to listen anyhow ivor had looked displeased and proud both it was at that point that dave had decided he liked the chieftain liane ivor had said doesnt your mother need you she said i was in her way how can you be in her way we have guests there must be things for you to do ivor had saidbemusedly i break dishes liane had explained is it the urgach dave had laughed aloud then flushed at the look shed given him yes ivor had said but then he added looking levelly at liane my daughter you are being indulged because i dislike chastising my children before guests but you go too far it ill becomes you to listen at doors it is the action of a spoiled child not a woman lianes flippant manner had disappeared completely she paled and her lip trembled im sorry she had gasped and spinning on her heel had fled the home she hates missing things levon had said stating the obvious there they are tabor was pointing southeast and dave squinting into the sun saw the eltor moving northward across their path he had been expecting buffalo he now realized for what he saw made him catch his breath in sudden understanding of why the dalrei spoke not of a herd but of a swift of eltor they were like antelope graceful manyhorned sleek and very very fast most were colored in shadings of brown but one or two were purest white the speed of their sweep across the plain was dazzling there had to be five hundred of them moving like wind over the grass their heads carried high arrogant and beautiful the hair of their manes lifting back in the wind of their running a small swift tabor said the kid was trying to be cool but dave could hear the excitement in his voice even as he felt his own heartbeat accelerate god they were beautiful the riders around him in response to levons concise command picked up speed and changed approach slightly to intersect the swift at an angle come tabor said as their slower mounts fell behind i know where he will have them do it he cut away sharply northward and dave followed in a moment they crested a small knoll in the otherwise level sweep of the prairie turning back dave saw the eltor swift and the hunters converge and he watched the dalrei hunt as tabor told him of the law an eltor could be killed by knife blade only nothing else any other killing meant death or exile to the man who did so such for twelve hundred years had been the law inscribed on the parchments at celidon more one eltor to one man and one chance only for the hunter a doe could be killed but at risk for a bearing does death meant execution or exile again this dave learned was what had happened to tores father ivor had exiled him having no other mercy to grant for in the preservation of the great eltor swifts lay the preservation of the dalrei themselves dave nodded to hear it somehow out here on the plain under that high sky harsh clear laws seemed to fit it was not a world shaped for nuance or subtlety then tabor drew silent for one by one in response to levons gesture the hunters of the third tribe set out after their prey dave saw the first of them low and melded to his flying horse intersect the edge of the racing swift the man picked his target slid into place beside it then dave his jaw dropping saw the hunter leap from horse to eltor dagger flashing and with a succinct slash sever the beasts jugular the eltor fell the weight of the dalrei pulling it away from the body of the swift the hunter disengaged from the falling beast hit the ground himself at frightening speed rolled and was up his dagger raised in red triumph levon raised his own blade in response but most of the other men were already flying alongside the swift dave saw the next man kill with a short deadly throw his eltor fell almost in its tracks another hunter riding with unbelievable skill held to his mount with his legs only leaning far out over the back of a madly racing eltor to stab from horseback and bring down his beast uhoh tabor said sharply navons trying to be fancy shifting his glance dave saw that one of the boys hed guarded the night before was showing off on his first hunt riding his horse while standing up navon smoothly cut in close to one of the eltor taking careful aim he threw from his standing positionand missed the flung blade whipped just over the neck of the prey and fell harmlessly idiot tabor exclaimed as navon slumped down on his mount even at a distance dave could see the young riders dejection it was a good try he offered no tabor snapped his eyes never leaving the hunters he shouldnt be doing that on his first hunt especially when levon has trusted him by taking only twenty for seventeen now if anyone else is unlucky turning back to the hunt dave picked out the other new rider barth on a brown stallion went in with cool efficiency picked out his eltor and wasting no time pulled alongside leaped from his horse and stabbing as the first hunter had done brought his beast down good tabor muttered a little grudgingly he did well see he even pulled it down to the outside away from the others the leap is the surest way though you can get hurt doing it and sure enough though barth rose holding a dagger aloft it was in his left hand and his right hung down at his side levon saluted him back dave turned to tabor to ask a question but was stopped cold by the stricken expression on his companions face please tabor whispered almost a prayer let it be soon oh davor if gereint doesnt name me this summer i will die of shame dave couldnt think of a single thing to say so after a moment he just asked his question does levon go in too or will he just watch tabor collected himself he only kills if the others have failed then he must make up the numbers himself it is a shameful thing though if the leader must kill which is why most tribes take many more hunters than they need there was pride in tabors voice again it is a thing of great honor to take only a few extra riders or none though no one does that the third tribe is known now over all the plain for how bold we are on the hunt i wish though that levon had been more careful with two new ones today my father would haveoh no dave saw it too the eltor picked out by the fifteenth rider stumbled just as the hunter threw and the blade hit an antler only and glanced away the eltor recovered and raced off head high its mane blown gracefully back tabor was suddenly very still and after a quick calculation dave realized why no one else could miss levon had cut it very fine the sixteenth hunter an older man had already peeled off from the small group remaining dave saw that the riders who had already killed were racing along on the far side of the swift they had turned the eltor so the beasts were now running back south along the other side of the knoll all the kills he realized would be close together it was an efficient process well judged if no one else missed the sixteenth hunter played no games in fast his blade high he picked a slower animal leaped and stabbed pulling it clear he rose dagger lifted a fat one tabor said trying to mask his tension gereintll want that one tonight the seventeenth man killed too throwing from almost directly over top of his eltor he made it look easy tore wont miss dave heard tabor say and saw the now familiar shiftless figure whip past their knoll tore singled out an eltor raced south with it for several strides then threw with arrogant assurance the eltor dropped almost at their feet tore saluted briefly then sped off to join the other riders on the far side of the swift seeing that throw dave remembered the urgach falling two nights before he felt like cheering for tore but there was one more to go and he could feel tabors anxiety cechtars very good the boy breathed dave saw a big man on a chestnut horse leave levons sidethe leader was alone now just below them cechtar galloped confidently towards the racing swift that the others were steering past the knoll his knife was drawn already and the mans carriage on his horse was solid and reassuring then the horse hit a tummock of grass and stumbled cechtar kept his seat but the damage was donethe knife prematurely upraised had flown from his hand to fall harmlessly short of the nearest animal hardly breathing dave turned to see what levon would do beside him tabor was moaning in an agony of distress oh no oh no he repeated we are shamed its a disgrace for all three riders and levon especially for misjudging theres nothing he can do i feel sick he has to kill now yes and he will but it doesnt make any difference theres nothing he canoh tabor stopped for levon moving his horse forward very deliberately had shouted a command to tore and the others watching dave saw the hunters race to turn the eltor yet again so that after a wide arc had been described the swift a quarter of a mile away now were flying back north five hundred strong on the east side of the knoll whats he doing dave asked softly i dont know i dont understand unless levon began to ride slowly eastward but after a few strides he turned his horse to stand motionless square in the path of the swift what the hell dave breathed oh levon no tabor screamed suddenly the boy clutched daves arm his face white with terrified understanding hes trying revors kill hes going to kill himself dave felt his own rush of fear hit as he grasped what levon was trying to do it was impossible though it was insanity was the hunt leader committing suicide out of shame in frozen silence they watched from the knoll as the massed swift slightly wedgeshaped behind a huge lead animal raced over the grass towards the still figure of tabors yellowhaired brother the other hunters too dave was dimly aware had stopped riding the only sound was the rapidly growing thunder of the onrushing eltor unable to take his eyes away from the hunt leader dave saw levon moving without haste dismount to stand in front of his horse the eltor were very close now flying the sound of the drumming hooves filled the air the horse was utterly still that too dave registered then he saw levon unhurriedly draw his blade the lead eltor was fifty yards away then twenty levon raised his arm and without pausing the whole thing one seamless motion threw the blade hit the giant animal directly between the eyes it broke stride staggered then fell at levons feet right at levons feet his fists clenched tightly with raw emotion dave saw the other animals instantly scythe out away from the fallen leader and form two smaller swifts one angling east one west dividing in a cloud of dust precisely at the point where the fallen eltor lay where levon his yellow hair blowing free stood quietly stroking his horses muzzle having stolen in that moment with an act of incandescent gallantry great honor for his people from the teeth of shame as a leader should dave became aware that he was shouting wildly that tabor tears in his eyes was hugging him fiercely and pounding his sore shoulders and that he had an arm around the boy and was hugging him back it was not it never had been the sort of thing he did but it was all right now it was more than all right ivor was astonished at the fury he felt a rage such as this he could not remember levon had almost died he told himself that was why a foolhardy piece of bravado it had been ivor should have insisted on twentyfive riders he ivor was still chieftain of the third tribe and that vehement thought gave him pause was it only fear for levon that sparked his anger after all it was over now levon was fine he was better than fine the whole tribe was afire with what he had done revors kill levons reputation was made his deed would dominate the midwinter gathering of the nine tribes at celidon his name would soon be ringing the length of the plain i feel old ivor realized im jealous ive got a son who can do revors kill what did that make him was he just levons father now the last part of his name which led to another thought did all fathers feel this way when their sons became men men of achievement of names that eclipsed the fathers was there always the sting of envy to temper the burst of pride had banor felt that way when twentyyearold ivor had made his first speech at celidon and earned the praise of all the elders for the wisdom of his words probably he thought remembering his father with love probably he had and ivor realized it didnt matter it really didnt it was part of the way of things part of the procession all men made towards the knowing hour if he had a virtue ivor reflected something of his nature he wanted his sons to have it was tolerance he smiled wryly it would be ironic if that tolerance could not be extended to himself which reminded him his sons and his daughter he had to have a talk with liane feelingly decidedly better ivor went looking for his middle child revors kill oh by ceinwens bow he was proud the feast of the new hunters started formally at sundown the tribe gathering in the huge central area of the camp from where the smell of slowly roasting game had been wafting all afternoon truly this would be a celebration two new riders and levons deed that morning a feat that had obliterated the failures before no one not even gereint could remember the last time it had been done not since revor himself one of the hunters had shouted a little drunkenly all the hunters from the morning were a little drunk they had started early dave among them on the clear harsh liquor the dalrei brewed the mood of mingled relief and euphoria on the ride home had been completely infectious and dave had let himself go with it there didnt seem to be any reason to hold back through it all drinking round for round with them levon seemed almost unaffected by what he had done looking for it dave could find no arrogance no hidden sense of superiority in ivors older son it had to be there he thought suspicious as he always was but looking one more time at levon as he walked between him and ivor to the feasthe was guest of honor it seemeddave found himself reluctantly changing his mind is a horse arrogant or superior he didnt think so proud yes there was great pride in the bay stallion that had stood so still with levon that morning but it wasnt a pride that diminished anything or anyone else it was simply part of what the stallion was levon was like that dave decided it was one of his last really coherent thoughts for with the sunset the feast began the eltor meat was superlative broiled slowly over open fires seasoned with spices he didnt recognize it was better than anything hed ever tasted in his life when the sizzling slices of meat started to go around the drinking among the tribesmen got quite serious as well dave was seldom drunk he didnt like surrendering the edge of control but he was in a strange space that evening a whole other country a whole other world even he didnt hold back sitting by ivors side he suddenly realized that he hadnt seen tore since the hunt looking around the firelit pandemonium he finally spotted the dark man standing by himself off on the edge of the circle of light cast by the fires dave rose not too steadily ivor raised an inquiring eyebrow its tore dave mumbled whys he on his own shouldnt be he should be here hell we we killed an urgach together me and him ivor nodded as if the stumbling discourse had been lucid explanation truly the chieftain said quietly turning to his daughter who was serving him just then he added liane will you go and bring tore to sit by me cant liane said sorry have to go get ready for the dancing and she was gone quick mercurial into the confused shadows ivor dave saw did not look happy he strode off to fetch tore himself stupid girl he thought with some anger shes avoiding him because his father was exiled and shes chiefs daughter he came up to tore in the halfdark just beyond the cast glow of the many fires the other man chewing on an eltor haunch merely grunted a hello that was okay didnt need to talk talkers bugged dave anyhow they stood awhile in silence it was cooler beyond the fires the wind felt easy refreshing it sobered him a little how do you feel he asked finally better tore said and after a moment your shoulder better dave replied when you didnt say a lot he thought you said the important things in the shadows with tore he felt no real desire to go back to the center of the clearing it was better here feeling the wind you could see the stars too you couldnt in the firelight or in toronto either he thought on impulse he turned around there it was tore turned to look with him together they gazed at the white magnificence of rangat theres someone under there dave asked softly yes said tore briefly bound loren told us he cannot die which was not comforting who is he dave asked with some diffidence for a moment tore was silent then we do not name him by his name in brennin they do i am told and in cathal but it is the dalrei who dwell under the shadow of rangat when we speak of him it is as maugrim the unraveller dave shivered though it wasnt cold the mountain was shining in the moonlight its peak so high he had to tilt his head back to take it in he wrestled then with a difficult thought its so great he said so tremendous whyd they put him under something so beautiful now every time you look at it you have to think about he trailed off words were too tough sometimes most of the time tore was looking at him with sharp understanding though that he said softly is why they did it and he turned back to the lights turning with him dave saw that some of the fires were being put out leaving a ring of flame around which the dalrei were gathering he looked at tore dancing his companion said the women and boys and a moment later dave saw a number of young girls enter the ring of fire and begin an intricate weaving dance to a tune laid down by two old men with curiously shaped stringed instruments it was pretty he supposed but dancing wasnt really his thing his eyes wandered away and he spotted the old shaman gereint gereint was holding a piece of meat in each hand one light one dark he was taking turns biting from each dave snorted and nudged tore to look tore laughed too softly he should be fat he said i dont know why he isnt dave grinned just then navon still looking sheepish about his failure that morning came by with a flask dave and tore each drank then watched the new rider walk off still a boy dave thought but hes a hunter now hell be all right tore murmured i think he learned his lesson this morning he wouldnt be around to have learned it if you didnt use a knife as well as you do that dave said for the first time was some throw the other night i wouldnt have been around to throw it if you hadnt saved my life tore said then after a moment he grinned his teeth white in the darkness we did all right back there damn right said dave grinning back the young girls had gone to cheerful applause a larger operation began now with the older boys joining a number of the women dave saw tabor move to the center of the circle and after a moment he realized that they were dancing the mornings hunt the music was louder now more compelling another man had joined the two musicians they danced it all with stylized ritual gestures the women their hair loose and flowing were the eltor and the boys mimed the riders they would one day be it was beautifully done even to the individual quirks and traits of the hunters dave recognized the characteristic head tilt of the second rider in the boy who imitated him there was enthusiastic applause for that then there was laughter as another boy danced navons flashy failure it was indulgent laughter though and even the other two misses were greeted with only brief regret because everyone knew what was coming tabor had untied his hair for this he looked older more assuredor was it just the role dave wondered as he saw ivors younger son dance with palpable pride and surprisingly graceful restraint his older brothers kill seeing it again in the dance dave cheered as loudly as everyone else when the young woman dancing the lead eltor fell at tabors feet and all the other women streamed around him turning at the edge of the circle defined by the fires to form a whirling kaleidoscope of movement about the still figure of tabor dan ivor it was well done dave thought really well done a head taller than everyone there he could see it all when tabor glanced at him across the massed people in between dave gave him a high clenchedfist gesture of approval he saw tabor despite his role flush with pleasure good kid solid when it ended the crowd grew restive again the dancing seemed to be over dave looked at tore and mimed a drinking motion tore shook his head and pointed looking back dave saw that liane had entered the circle of fire she was dressed in red and had done something to her face her color was high and striking she wore golden jewelry on each arm and about her throat it glinted and flashed in the firelight as she moved and it seemed to dave as if she had suddenly become a creature of flame herself the crowd grew quiet as she waited then liane instead of dancing spoke we have cause to celebrate she sang out the kill of levon dan ivor will be told at celidon this winter and for many winters after there was a roar of approval liane let it die down that kill she said may not be the brightest deed we have reason to honor tonight the crowd hushed in perplexity there was another act of courage done liane continued a darker one in the night wood and it should be known and celebrated by all of the third tribe what dave thought uhoh it was all he had time for bring forth tore dan sorcha cried liane and with him davor our guest that we may honor them here they are a high voice cried from behind dave and suddenly goddamn tabor was pushing him forward and levon smiling broadly had tore by the arm and the two sons of ivor led them through the parting crowd to stand beside the chieftain with excruciating selfconsciousness dave stood exposed in the light of the fires and heard liane continue in the rapt silence you do not know she cried to the tribe of what i speak so i will dance it for you oh god dave thought he was he knew beetred let us do them honor liane said more softly and let tore dan sorcha no more be named outcast in this tribe for know you that these two killed an urgach in faelinn grove two nights ago they hadnt known dave realized wishing he could find a place to disappear knowing tore felt the same from the electric response of the tribe it was clear that they hadnt had a clue then the music began and gradually his color receded for no one was looking at him anymore liane was dancing between the fires she was doing it all he marveled spellbound doing it all herself the two sleeping boys in the wood tore himself the very texture the mood of faelinn grove at nightand then somehow unbelievably whether it was alcohol or firelight or some alchemy of art he saw the urgach again huge terrifying swinging its giant sword but there was only a girl in the ring of fire only a girl and her shadow dancing miming becoming the scene she shaped offering it to all of them he saw his own instinctive leap then tores the urgachs brutal blow that had sent tore smashing into a tree she had it deadon he realized astonished then he smiled even through his wonder and stirring pride of course shed listened in while they told ivor he felt like laughing suddenly like crying like some kind any kind of articulation of emotion as he watched liane dance his own desperate parry of the urgachs sword and then finally tores hurled daggershe was tore she was the blade and then the toppling like a mighty tree of the beast she was all of it entire and she wasnt a stupid girl after all ivor saw the urgach sway and fall and then the dancer was herself again liane and she was whirling between the fires her bare feet flying jewelry flashing on her arms moving so fast her hair short as it was lifted behind her as she exploded in a wild celebration of dance of the deed in the night wood of this night and the next and the days all of them of everything there was before the hour came that knew your name with a lump in his throat he saw her slow the motion winding down until she stopped her hands across her breasts her head lowered motionless the still point between the fires between the stars it seemed to him a moment the third tribe was still with her then there came an explosion of cheering that must have rocketed beyond the camp ivor thought beyond the lights of men far out into the wide dark of the night plain he looked for leith in that moment and saw her standing among the women on the other side of the fires no tears for her she was not that sort of woman but he knew her well enough after so many years to read the expression on her face let the tribe think the chieftains wife cool efficient unruffled he knew better he grinned at her and laughed when she flushed and looked away as if unmasked the tribe was still buzzing with the catharsis of the dance and the killing that had led to it even in this liane had been wilful for he was not at all sure this was how he would have chosen to tell them of the urgach and it was his place to decide it couldnt be kept hidden for the auberei would have to take word on their ride to celidon tomorrow but once more it seemed his middle child had gone her own way how could he be angry though after this it was always so hard ivor found to stay angry with liane leith was better at it mothers and daughters there was less indulgence there she had judged it rightly though he thought watching her walk over to tore and the stranger and kiss them both seeing tore redden ivor decided that not the least cause for joy this night might be the reclaiming of the outcast by this tribe and then gereint rose it was remarkable how tuned the tribe was to him as soon as the blind shaman moved forward into the space between the fires some collective thread of instinct alerted even the most intoxicated hunter gereint never had to gesture or wait for silence hed looked silly before ivor reflected watching the shaman move unassisted between the flames not anymore however he might look with eltor juice dripping from his chin when gereint rose in the night to address the tribe his voice was the voice of power he spoke for ceinwen and cernan for the night wind and the dawn wind all the unseen world the hollowed sockets of his eyes gave testimony he had paid the price cernan came to me with the greyness of dawn gereint said quietly cernan thought ivor god of the wild things of wood and plain lord of the eltor brother and twin to ceinwen of the bow i saw him clear gereint went on the horns upon his head seventined for a king the dark flash of his eyes the majesty of him a sound like wind in tall grass swept through the tribe he spoke a name to me gereint said a thing that has never happened in all my days cernan named to me this morning tabor dan ivor and called him to his fast tabor and not just named by the shaman after a dream summoned by the god himself a thrill of awe touched ivor like a ghostly finger in the dark for a moment he felt as if he were alone on the plain there was a shadow with him only a shadow but it was the god cernan knew his name tabor dan ivor he had called the chieftain was brought unceremoniously back to the reality of the camp by the high scream of a woman liane of course he knew without looking flying across the ring almost knocking over the shaman in her haste she sped to tabors side no longer a red spirit of dance and flame only a quicksilver coltish girl fiercely hugging her brother levon was there too ivor saw more quietly but as fast his open face flashing a broad smile of delight the three of them together fair and brown and brown his so tabor was in faelinn tomorrow at that thought he looked over and saw tore gazing at him he received a smile and a reassuring nod from the dark man and then with surprise and pleasure another from giant davor who had been so lucky for them tabor would be guarded in the wood he looked for leith again across the ring of fire and with a twist in his heart ivor saw how beautiful she was how very beautiful still and then he saw the tears in her eyes youngest child he thought a mother and her youngest he had a sudden overwhelming sense of the wonder the strangeness the deep deep richness of things it filled him it expanded within his breast he couldnt hold it in it was so much so very much moving within the ring to a music of his own ivor the chieftain not so old after all not so very danced his joy for his children all of them chapter tabor at least was no baby ivors son levons brother he knew where to lie in the wood at night he was sheltered and hidden and could move easily at need tore approved he and davor were in faelinn grove again their guest had surprisingly elected to delay his journey south in order to watch over the boy with him tabor tore thought had made a strong impression it wasnt unusual he liked the boy himself characteristically tore gave no thought to the possibility that he himself might be another reason for daves reluctance to leave tore had other things to think about in fact he had been of two minds about being accompanied that night he had been looking forward to solitude and dark since the festival too much had happened there and too quickly too many people had come over to embrace him after lianes dance and in the night long after the fires had burned down kerrin dal ragin had slipped into the room levon had insisted he take in the camp levon had been smiling when they talked and when kerrin appeared in the doorway tore had belatedly understood why kerrin was very pretty and much talked about among the hunters her giggling scented arrival was not the sort of thing an outcast grew accustomed to it had been very nice more than that in fact but what had followed her arrival in his bed did not admit of leisure or tranquillity to let him reflect on all that had occurred hed needed to be alone but davors company was the next best thing the big man was inclined to silence himself and tore could sense that the stranger had things of his own to think about in any case they were there to guard tabor and hed not have wanted to meet another urgach alone the chieftain had given davor an axethe best weapon for one of his size without training in the sword so weapons to hand this time the two of them had settled down against a pair of trees close to where tabor lay it was a mild easy night tore outcast no longer it seemed let his mind go back past kerrins fair silken hair past the naming of tabor by the god the tumult of the tribes response to what he and davor had done to the still point the heart of everything the moment for which he needed the dark and solitude liane had kissed him when her dance was done fingering the haft of his axe enjoying the balanced solid feel of it dave realized that he even liked the name they had given him davor it sounded far more formidable than dave davor of the axe axewielder davor dan ivor which stopped him from that thought he could feel himself backing away it was too exposed to even let it surface inside beside him tore sat quietly his dark eyes hidden he seemed lost in reverie well dave thought i guess he wont be an outcast anymore not after last night which took him back his too had been a tiring night three girls no less had made their way through ivors doorway to the room where dave slept or didnt after all sleep god he remembered thinking at one point ill bet theres a lot of kids born nine months after one of these feasts a good life he decided being a rider of the dalrei of the third tribe of the children of ivorhe sat up abruptly tore glanced at him but made no comment you have a father dave told himself sternly and a mother and brother youre a law student in toronto and a basketball player for gods sake in that order he remembered kim ford teasing the first time theyd met or had kevin laine put it the other way around he couldnt remember already the time before the crossing seemed astonishingly remote the dalrei were real martyniuk thought this axe the wood torehis kind of person and there was more his mind looped back again to the night before and this time it zeroed in on the thing that mattered much more than it should more he knew than he could allow it to still it did he leaned back against the tree again going with the memory liane had kissed him when her dance was done they heard it at the same time something crashing loudly through the trees tore child of night and woods knew immediatelyonly someone who wanted to be heard would make so much noise he didnt bother moving dave however felt his heart lurch with apprehension what the hell is that he whispered fiercely grabbing for his axe her brother i think tore said inadvisedly and felt himself go crimson in the dark even dave far from a perceptive man could hardly miss that one when levon finally emerged through the trees he found the two of them sitting in an awkward silence i couldnt sleep he offered apologetically i thought i might watch with you not that you need me but there was truly no guile no hauteur in levon the man who had just done revors kill who would one day lead the tribe was sheepishly requesting their indulgence sure dave said hes your brother come sit down tore managed a short nod his heartbeat was slowing though and after a time he decided he didnt really mind if davor knew ive never had a friend he thought suddenly this is the sort of thing you talk to friends about it was all right that levon had come levon was unlike anyone else and he had done something the morning before that tore was not sure he would have dared to try the realization was a hard one for a proud man and a different person might have hated levon for it tore however measured out his respect in terms of such things two friends he thought i have two friends here though he could only speak of her to one of them that one was having problems tores slip had registered and dave felt a need to walk the implications out he rose im going to check on him he said right back he didnt do much thinking though this wasnt the sort of situation dave martyniuk could handle so he ducked it he carried the axe careful not to make a noise with it he tried to move as quietly as tore did in the wood its not even a situation he told himself abruptly im leaving tomorrow he had spoken aloud a night bird whirred suddenly from a branch overhead startling him he came to the place where tabor was hiddenand well hidden too it had taken tore almost an hour to find him even looking straight at the spot dave could barely make out the shape of the boy in the hollow hed chosen tabor would be asleep tore had explained earlier the shaman had made a drink that would ensure this and open the mind to receive what might come to wake him good kid dave thought hed never had a younger brother wondered how he would have behaved toward one a lot better than vince did the bitter thought came a hell of a lot better than vincent a moment longer he watched tabors hollow then assured there was no danger to be seen he turned away not quite ready to rejoin the other two dave took an angled route back through the grove he hadnt seen the glade before he almost stumbled into it checked himself barely in time then he crouched down as silently as he could there was a small pool glittering silver in the moonlight the grass too was tinted silver it seemed dewy and fragrant new somehow and there was a stag a fullgrown buck drinking from the pool dave found he was holding his breath keeping his body utterly still the moonlit scene was so beautiful so serene it seemed to be a gift a bestowing he was leaving tomorrow riding south to paras derval the first stage of the road home he would never be here again see anything like this should i not weep he thought aware that even such a question was a world away from the normal workings of his mind but he was he was a world away and then as the hairs rose up on the back of his neck dave became aware that there was someone else beside the glade he knew before he even looked which is what caused the awe her presence had been made manifest in ways he scarcely comprehended the very air the moonlight now reflected it turning in silence and dread dave saw a woman with a bow standing partway around the glade from where he crouched in darkness she was clad in green all in green and her hair was the same silver as the moonlight very tall she was queenly and he could not have said if she was young or old or the color of her eyes because there was a light in her face that made him avert his face abashed and afraid it happened very quickly a second bird flew suddenly flapping its wings loudly from a tree the stag raised its head in momentary alarm a magnificent creature a king of the wood out of the corner of his eyefor he dared not look directlydave saw the woman string an arrow to her bow a moment a bare pulsation of time slipped past as the frieze held the stag with its head high poised to flee the moonlight on the glade on the water the huntress with her bow then the arrow was loosed and it found the long exposed throat of the stag dave hurt for the beast for blood on that silvered grass for the crumpled fall of a thing so noble what happened next tore a gasp of wonder from the core of his being where the dead stag lay a shimmer appeared in the glade a sheen of moonlight it seemed at first then it darkened took shape and then substance and finally dave saw another stag identical stand unafraid unwounded majestic beside the body of the slain one a moment it stood thus then the great horns were lowered in homage to the huntress and it was gone from the glade it was a thing of too much moonlit power too much transcendency there was an ache within him an appalled awareness of his own stand for i would see you before you die of his own mortality with trembling limbs dave martyniuk rose to stand before the goddess with her bow he saw without surprise the arrow leveled on his heart knew with certainty that he would not rise to bow to her once that shaft was in his breast come forward a curious otherworldly calm descended upon dave as he moved into the moonlight he dropped the axe before his feet it glittered on the grass look at me drawing a deep breath dave raised his eyes and looked as best he could upon the shining of her face she was beautiful he saw more beautiful than hope no man of fionavar the goddess said may see ceinwen hunt it gave him an out but it was cheap shallow demeaning he didnt want it goddess he heard himself say wondering at his own calm it was not intentional but if there is a price to be paid i will pay it a wind stirred the grass there is another answer you could have made dave martyniuk ceinwen said dave was silent an owl suddenly burst from the tree behind him cutting like a shadow across the crescent of the moon and away the third one a corner of his mind said then he heard the bowstring sing i am dead he had time amazingly to think before the arrow thudded into the tree inches above his head his heart was sore there was so much he could feel the quivering of the long shaft the feathers touched his hair not all need die green ceinwen said courage will be needed you have sworn to pay a price to me though and one day i will claim it remember dave sank to his knees his legs would not bear him up before her any longer there was such a glory in her face in the shining of her hair one thing more he heard her say he dared not look up she is not for you so his very heart lay open and how should it be otherwise but this this he had decided for himself he wanted her to know he reached for the power of speech a long way no he said i know shes tores and the goddess laughed has she no other choice ceinwen said mockingly and disappeared dave on his knees lowered his head into his hands his whole body began to shake violently he was still like that when tore and levon came looking for him when tabor woke he was ready there was no disorientation he was in faelinn and fasting and he was awake because it was time he looked about opening himself prepared to receive what had come his secret name the ambit of his soul at which point disorientation did set in he was still in faelinn still in his hollow even but the wood had changed surely there had been no cleared space before him he would never have chosen such a place there was no such place near this hollow then he saw that the night sky had a strange color to it and with a tremor of fear he understood that he was still asleep he was dreaming and would find his animal in the strange country of this dream it was not usual he knew usually you woke to see your totem mastering fear as best he could tabor waited it came from the sky not a bird no hawk or eaglehe had hoped they all didnor even an owl no his heart working strangely tabor realized then that the clearing was needed for the creature to land she did so lightly the grass seemed scarcely to be supporting her lying very still tabor confronted his animal with an effort then a very great effort he stretched himself out mind and soul to the impossible creature that had come for him it did not exist this exquisite thing that stood gazing calmly back at him in the strangely hued night it did not exist but it would he knew as he felt her enter him become a part of him as he of her and he learned her name even as he learned what it was the god had summoned him to find and be found by for a last moment the very last the youngest child of ivor heard as if someone else were speaking a part of himself whisper an eagle would have been enough it was true it would have been more than enough but it was not so standing very still before him the creature appeared to understand his thought he felt her then gently in his mind do not reject me he heard as from within while her great astonishing eyes never left his own we will have only each other at the last he understood it was in his mind and then in his heart also it was very deep he hadnt known he went so deep in response he stretched forth a hand the creature lowered her head and tabor touched the offered horn imraithnimphais he said remembered saying before the universe went dark hola cried ivor joyously see who comes let there be rejoicing for see the weaver sends a new rider to us but as tabor drew nearer ivor could see that it had been a difficult fast he had found his animalsuch was written in every movement he madebut he had clearly gone a long way it was not unusual it was good even a sign of a deeper merger with the totem it was only when tabor walked up close to him that ivor felt the first touch of apprehension no boy came back from a true fast looking quite the same they were boys no longer it had to show in their faces but what he saw in his sons eyes chilled ivor to the core even in the morning sunshine of the camp no one else seemed to notice the tumult of welcome resounded as it always did louder even for the son of the chieftain who had been called by the god called to what ivor was thinking as he walked beside his youngest child towards gereints house called to what he smiled though to mask his concern and saw that tabor did so as well with his mouth only not the eyes and ivor could feel a muscle jumping spasmodically where he gripped his sons arm arriving at gereints door he knocked and the two of them entered it was dark inside as always and the noise from without faded to a distant murmur of anticipation steadily but with some care tabor walked forward and knelt before the shaman gereint touched him affectionately on the shoulder then tabor lifted his head even in the darkness ivor saw gereints harshly checked motion of shock he and tabor faced each other for what seemed a very long time at length gereint spoke but not the words of ritual this does not exist the shaman said ivor clenched his fists tabor said not yet it is a true finding gereint went on as if he hadnt heard but there is no such animal you have encompassed it i think so tabor said and in his voice now was utter weariness i tried i think i did i think so too gereint said and there was wonder in his voice it is a very great thing tabor dan ivor tabor made a gesture of deprecation it seemed to drain what reserves of endurance he had left it just came he said and toppled sideways to his fathers feet as he knelt to cradle his unconscious son ivor heard the shaman say in his voice of ritual his hour knows his name and then differently may all the powers of the plain defend him from what ivor asked knowing he should not gereint swung to face him this one i would tell you if i could old friend but truly i do not know he went so far the sky was changed ivor swallowed is it good he asked the shaman who was supposed to know such things is it good gereint after too long a silence gereint only repeated it is a very great thing which was not what he needed to hear ivor looked down at tabor almost weightless in his arms he saw the tanned skin straight nose unlined brow of youth the unruly shock of brown hair not long enough to tie properly too long to wear looseit always seemed to be that way with tabor he thought oh my son ivor murmured and then again rocking him back and forth as he always used to not so many years ago chapter towards sundown they pulled the horses to a halt in a small gully only a depression really defined by a series of low tummocks on the plain dave was a little unnerved by all the openness only the dark stretch of pendaran brooding to the west broke the long monotony of the prairie and pendaran wasnt a reassuring sight the dalrei were undisturbed though for them clearly this exposed spot on the darkening earth was home the plain was their home all of it for twelve hundred years dave remembered levon would allow no fires supper was cold eltor meat and hard cheese with river water in flasks to wash it down it was good though partly because dave was ravenous after the days ride he was brutally tired as well he realized unfolding his sleeping roll beside tores overtired he soon amended for once inside the blanket he found that sleep eluded him instead he lay awake under the wide sky his mind circling restlessly back over the day tabor had still been unconscious when they left in the morning he went far was all the chieftain would say but his eyes could not mask concern even in the dark of gereints house but then the question of tabor was put aside for a moment as dave told his own story of the night glade and the huntress except for the very last which was his alone there was a silence when he was done crosslegged on his mat gereint asked courage will be neededshe said exactly that dave nodded then remembered it was the shaman and grunted a yes gereint rocked back and forth after that humming tunelessly to himself for a long time so long that it startled dave when he finally spoke you must go south quickly then and quietly i think something grows and if silvercloak brought you then you should be with him it was only for the kings festival dave said nervousness made it sound sharper than he meant perhaps gereint said but there are other threads appearing now which wasnt all that wonderful turning on his side dave could see the raised silhouette of levon against the night sky it was deeply comforting to have that calm figure standing guard levon hadnt wanted to come at first he remembered concern for his brother had left him visibly torn it was the chieftain asserting himself with absolute firmness who had settled the issue levon would be useless at home tabor was being cared for it was not in any case unusual for a faster to sleep a long time on his return levon ivor reminded his older son had done the same cechtar could lead the hunt for ten days or two weeksit would be good for him in any case after the loss of face caused by his failure two days ago no ivor had said decisively given gereints injunction as to speed and secrecy it was important to get davedavor he said as they all didsouth to paras derval safely levon would lead with tore beside him in a band of twenty it was decided logical and controlling dave had thought and coolly efficient but then he remembered his own last conversation with ivor the horses had been readied he had bidden formal slightly stiff farewells to leith and then lianehe was very bad at goodbyes hed been embarrassed too by the knot of girls standing nearby ivors daughter had been elusive and remote after hed looked in on tabor the boy was feverish and restless with it dave wasnt good with this either hed made a confused gesture to leith whod come in with him he hoped shed understand not that he could have said exactly what hed wanted to convey it was after this that ivor had taken him for that last stroll around the perimeter of the camp the axe is yours the chieftain had begun from what you have described i doubt you will have great use for it in your own world but perhaps it will serve to remind you of the dalrei ivor had frowned then a warlike remembrance alas of the children of peace is there anything else you would no dave had said flustered no its fine its great ill ah treasure it words they had walked a few paces in silence before dave thought of a thing he did want to say say goodbye to tabor for me eh i think hes a good kid hell be all right wont he i dont know ivor had replied with disturbing frankness they had turned at the edge of the camp to walk north facing the mountain by daylight rangat was just as dazzling the white slopes reflecting the sunlight so brightly it hurt the eye to see im sure hell be fine dave had said lamely aware of how asinine that sounded to cover it he pushed on youve been you know really good to me here ive learned a lot as he said it he realized it was true for the first time ivor smiled that pleases me he said i like to believe we have things to teach oh yeah for sure dave said earnestly of course you do if i could stay longer if you could stay ivor had said stopping and looking directly at dave i think you would make a rider dave swallowed hard and flushed with intense selfconscious pleasure he was speechless ivor had noticed if the chieftain had added with a grin we could ever find a proper horse for you sharing the laugh they resumed their walk god dave was thinking really really like this man it would have been nice to be able to say it but then ivor had thrown him the curve i dont know what your encounter last night means he had said softly but it means a good deal i think i am sending levon south with you davor it is the right thing though i hate to see him go he is young yet and i love him very much will you take care of him forme mean unbalancing curve ball what dave had exclaimed bridling reflexively at the implications what are you talking about hes the one who knows where hes going you want me to guard him shouldnt it be the other way around ivors expression was sad ah my son he had said gently you have far to go in some ways you too are young of course i told him to guard you as well and with everything he has i tell you both dont you see davor he did see too late of course and clearly hed been an idiot again again and with no time to make it up for they had looped full circle by then and levon tore and seventeen other riders were already mounted with what seemed to be the whole third tribe turning out to see them off so there had been no last private word hed hugged ivor hard though hoping the chieftain would somehow know that it meant a lot for him to do that hoping but not knowing if then he had left south for brennin and the way home the axe at his saddle side sleeping roll behind a few other things behind as well too far behind for anything to be done on the starlit dark of the plain dave opened his eyes again levon was still there watching over them over him kevin laine would have known how to handle that last talk he thought surprisingly and slept on the second day they started just before sunrise levon set a brisk but not a killing pace the horses would have to last and the dalrei knew how to judge these things they rode in a tight cluster with three men rotating every second hour sent ahead a halfmile quickly and quietly gereint had advised and they all knew tore had seen svart alfar heading south two weeks before levon might take calculated risks on the hunt but he was not a rash man ivors son could hardly be so he kept them moving in a state of watchful speed and the trees at the outreaches of pendaran rolled steadily by on their right as the sun climbed in the sky gazing at the woods less than a mile away dave was bothered by something kicking his horse forward he caught up with levon at the head of the main party why he asked without preamble are we riding so close to the forest levon smiled you are the seventh man to ask me that he said cheerfully it isnt very complex im taking the fastest route if we swing farther east well have to ford two rivers and deal with hilly land between them this line takes us to adein west of the fork where rienna joins it only one river and as you see the riding is easy but the forest its supposed to be pendaran is deadly to those who enter it no one does but the wood is angry not evil and unless we trespass the powers within it will not be stirred by our riding here there are superstitions otherwise but i have been taught by gereint that this is so what about an ambush like from those svart alfar levon was no longer smiling a svart would sooner die than enter pendaran he said the wood forgives none of us for what dave asked lisen levon said shall i tell the story im not going anywhere said dave i have to explain magic to you first i think you were brought here by silvercloak you would have seen matt sören the dwarf sure do you know how they are bound to each other havent a clue are they assuredly said levon and as they rode south over the prairie dave learned as paul schafer had four nights before about the binding of mage and source and how magic was made of that union then as levon began his tale tore came up quietly on his other side the three of them rode together bound by the rhythm and cadence of lisens tragedy it is a long story levon began and much of import comes into it and has grown out of iti do not know nearly the whole but it begins in the days before the bael rangat in those days the days before magic was as i have told you it now is amairgen a counselor to conary the high king in paras derval rode forth alone from brennin magic in that time was governed by the earthroot the avarlith and so it was within the domain of the priestesses of the mother in gwen ystrat and jealously they guarded their control amairgen was a proud and brilliant man and he chafed at this so he went forth one morning in the spring of the year to see if it need always be so in time he came after many adventures that are all part of the full talethough most of them i do not knowto the sacred grove in pendaran the wood was not angry then but it was a place of power and never one that welcomed the presence of men especially in the grove amairgen was brave though and he had been journeying long without answer to his quest so he dared greatly and passed a night alone in that place there are songs about that night about the three visitations he had and his mind battle with the earth demon that came up through the grass it was a long and terrible night and it is sung that no man else would have lived or been whole of mind to see the dawn be that as it may just before morning there came a fourth visitation to amairgen and this one was from the god from mörnir and it was beneficent for it taught to amairgen the runes of the skylore that freed the mages ever after from the mother there was war among the gods after that it is told for the goddess was wrathful at what mörnir had done and it was long before she would let herself be placated some say though i would not know if it is true that it was the discord and the chaos of this conflict that gave maugrim the unraveller the chance to slip from the watch of the younger gods he came from the places where they have their home and took root in the north lands of fionavar so some songs and stories have it others say he was always here or that he slipped into fionavar when the weavers eye was dimmed with love at the first emergence of the lios alfarthe children of the light still others tell that it was as the weaver wept when first man slew his brother i know not there are many stories he is here and he cannot be killed the gods grant he be always bound be all of that as it may in the morning when amairgen rose up the runes in his heart and great power waiting there he was in mortal danger yet for the wood having its own guardians was greatly angered at his having dared the grove at night and lisen was sent forth to break his heart and kill him of that meeting there is one song only it was made not long after by ratermaine greatest of all singers lord then of the lios alfar and he crafted it in homage and remembrance of amairgen it is the most beautiful lay ever fashioned and no poet since has ever touched the theme there were very mighty peoples on the earth in those days and among them all lisen of the wood was as a queen a wood spirit she was a deiena of which there are many but lisen was more it is said that on the night she was born in pendaran the evening star shone as brightly as the moon and all the goddesses from ceinwen to nemain gave grant of their beauty to that child in the grove and the flowers bloomed at night in the shining that arose when they all came together in that place no one has ever been or will be more fair than was lisen and though the deiena live very long dana and mörnir that night as their joint gift made her immortal that this beauty might never be lost these gifts she was given at her birth but not even the gods may shape exactly what they will and some say that this truth is at the heart of the whole long tale be that so or not in the morning after his battles she came to amairgen to break him with her beauty and slay him for his presumption of the night but as ratermaines song tells amairgen was as one exalted that morning clothed in power and lore and the presence of mörnir was in his eyes so did the design of the god act to undo the design of the god for coming to him then wrapped in her own beauty like a star lisen fell in love and he with her and so their doom was woven that morning in the grove she became his source before the sun had set that day he had taught her the runes they were made mage and source by the ritual and the first sky magic was wrought in the grove that day that night they lay down together and as the one song tells amairgen slept at length a second night in the sacred grove but this time within the mantle of her hair they went forth together in the morning from that place bound as no living creatures to that day had been yet because amairgens place was at the right hand of conary and there were other men to whom he had to teach the skylore he returned to paras derval and founded the council of the mages and lisen went with him and so left the shelter of the wood levon was silent they rode thus for a long time then the tale is truly very complex now and it picks up many other tales from the great years it was in those days that the one we call the unraveler raised his fortress of starkadh in the ice and came down on all the lands with war there are so many deeds to tell of from that time the one the dalrei sing is of revors ride and it is very far from the least of the great things that were done but amairgen whitebranch as he came to be called for the staff lisen found for him in pendaran was ever at the center of the war and lisen was at his side source of his power and his soul there are so many tales davor but at length it came to pass that amairgen learned by his art that maugrim had taken for his own a place of great power hidden far out at sea and was drawing upon it mightily for his strength he determined then that this island must be found and wrested away from the dark so amairgen gathered to him a company of one hundred lios alfar and men with three mages among them and they set sail west from taerlindel to find cader sedat and lisen was left behind what why dave rasped stunned it was tore who answered she was a deiena he said his own voice sounding difficult a deiena dies at sea her immortality was subject to the nature of her kind it is so levon resumed quietly they built in that time for her the anor lisen at the westernmost part of pendaran even in the midst of war men and lios alfar and the powers of the wood came together to do this for her out of love then she placed upon her brow the circlet of lisen amairgens parting gift the light against the dark it was called for it shone of its own self and with that light upon her browso great a beauty never else having been in any worldlisen turned her back on the war and the wood and climbing to the summit of the tower she set her face westward to the sea that the light she bore might show amairgen the way home no man knows what happened to him or those who sailed in that ship only that one night lisen saw and those who stood guard beside the anor saw as well a dark ship sailing slowly along the coast in the moonlight and it is told that the moon setting west in that hour shone through its tattered sails with a ghostly light and it could be seen that the ship was amairgens and it was empty then when the moon sank into the sea that ship disappeared forever lisen took the circlet from her brow and laid it down then she unbound her hair that it might be as it was when first they had come together in the grove having done these things she leaped into the darkness of the sea and so died the sun was high in the sky dave noticed it seemed wrong somehow that this should be so that the day should be so bright i think levon whispered that i will go ride up front for a time he kicked his horse to a gallop dave and tore looked at each other neither spoke a word the plain was east the wood west the sun was high in the sky levon took a double shift up front late in the day dave went forward himself to relieve him towards sunset they saw a black swan flying north almost directly overhead very high the sight filled them all with a vague inexplicable sense of disquiet without a word being spoken they picked up speed as they continued south pendaran gradually began to fell away westward dave knew it was there but by the time darkness fell the wood could no longer be seen when they stopped for the night there was only grassland stretching away in every direction under the profligate dazzle of the summer stars scarcely dimmed by the last thin crescent of the moon later that night a dog and a wolf would battle in mörnirwood and colans dagger later still would be unsheathed with a sound like a harpstring in a stone chamber underground beside eilathens lake at dawn the sun rose red and a dry prickly heat came with it from first mounting the company was going faster than before levon increased the point men to four and pulled them back a little closer so both parties could see each other all the time late in the morning the mountain exploded behind them with the deepest terror of his life dave turned with the dalrei to see the tongue of flame rising to master the sky they saw it divide to shape the taloned hand and then they heard the laughter of maugrim the gods grant he be always bound levon had said only yesterday no dice it seemed there was nothing within dave that could surmount the brutal sound of that laughter on the wind they were small exposed they were open to him and he was free in a kind of trance dave saw the point men galloping frantically back to join them levon levon we must go home one of them was shouting as he came nearer dave turned to ivors son and looking at him his heart slowed towards normality and he marveled again there was no expression on levons face his profile seemed chiseled from stone as he gazed at the towering fire above rangat but in that very calm that impassive acceptance dave found a steadfastness of his own without moving a muscle levon seemed to be growing to be willing himself to grow large enough to match to overmatch the terror in the sky and on the wind and somehow in that moment dave had a flashing image of ivor doing the selfsame thing two days ride back north under the very shadow of that grasping hand he looked for tore and found the dark man gazing back at him and in tores eyes dave saw not the stern resistance of levon but a fierce bright passionate defiance a bitter hatred of what that hand meant but not fear your hour knows your name dave martyniuk thought and then in that moment of apocalypse had another thought i love these people the realization hit him for dave was what he was almost as hard as the mountain had struggling to regain his inner balance he realized that levon was speaking quelling the babble of voices around him we do not go back my father will be caring for the tribe they will go to celidon all the tribes will and so will we after davor is with silvercloak two days ago gereint said that something was coming this is it we go south as fast as we can to brennin and there said levon i will take counsel with the high king even as he spoke ailell dan art was dying in paras derval when levon finished not another word was said the dalrei regrouped and began riding very fast now and all together they rode henceforth with a hard unyielding intensity turning their backs on their tribe without a demur to follow levon though every one of them knew even as they galloped that if there was war with maugrim it would be fought on the plain it was that alert tension that gave them warning though in the end it would not be enough to save them tore it was who late in the afternoon sped a distance ahead bending sideways in his saddle he rode low to the ground for a time before wheeling back to levons side the wood was close again on their right we are coming to trouble tore said shortly there is a party of svart alfar not far ahead of us how many levon asked calmly signaling a halt forty sixty levon nodded we can beat them but there will be losses they know we are here of course if they have eyes tore agreed we are very exposed very well we are close to adein but i do not want a fight now it will waste us some time but we are going to flank around them and cross both rivers farther east i dont think we can levon tore murmured why levon had gone very still look dave turned east with levon to where tore was pointing and after a moment he too saw the dark mass moving over the grass low about a mile away and coming nearer what are they he asked his voice tight wolves levon snapped very many he drew his sword we cant go aroundthey will slow us by the rivers for the svarts we must fight through south before they reach us he raised his voice we fight on the gallop my friends kill and ride no lingering when you reach adein you cross we can outrun them on the other side he paused then i said before there would be war it seems that we are to fight the first battle of our people let the servants of maugrim now learn to fear the dalrei again as they did when revor rode with an answering shout the riders dave among them loosed their weapons and sprang into gallop his heart thudding dave followed levon over a low tummock on the other side he could see the river glistening less than a mile away but in their path stood the svart alfar and as soon as the dalrei crested the rise a shower of arrows was launched towards them a moment later dave saw a rider fall beside him blood flowering from his breast a rage came over dave then kicking his horse to greater speed he crashed with tore and levon on either side into the line of svarts leaning in the saddle he whistled the great axe down to cleave one of the ugly dark green creatures where it stood lightheaded with fury he pulled the axe clear and turned to swing it again no tore screamed kill and ride come on the wolves dave saw in a flying glance were less than half a mile away wheeling hard he thundered with the others towards the adein they were through it seemed one man dead two others nursing wounds but the river was close now and once across they would be safe they would have been they should have been it was only sheerest bitterest bad luck that the band of svarts that had ambushed brendel and the lios alfar were there waiting they were though and there were almost a hundred of them left to rise from the shallows of adein and block the path of the dalrei so with the wolves on their flank and svarts before and behind levon was forced into a standing fight under that red sun the children of peace fought their first battle in a thousand years with courage fueled by rage they fought on their land launching arrows of their own angling their horses in jagged lethal movements scything with swords soon red with blood revor dave heard levon scream and the very name seemed to cow the massed forces of the dark only for a moment though and there were so many in the chaos of the melee dave saw face after face of the nightmare svarts appear before him with lifted swords and razor teeth bared and in a frenzy of battle fury he raised and lowered the axe again and again all he could do was fight and so he did he scarcely knew how many svarts had died under his iron but then pulling the axe free from a mashed skull dave saw that the wolves had come and he suddenly understood that death was here by the adein river on the plain death at the hands of these loathsome creatures death for levon for tore no dave martyniuk cried then his voice a mighty bellow over the battle sounds as inspiration blasted him to the wood come on and punching levons shoulder he reined his own horse so that it reared high above the encircling enemy on the way down he swung the axe once on either side of the descending hooves and on each side he killed for a moment the svarts hesitated and using the moment dave kicked his horse again and pounded into them the axe sweeping red once and again and again then suddenly he was clear as their ranks broke before him and he cut sharply away west west where pendaran lay brooding and unforgiving where none of them man or svart alfar or even the giant twisted wolves of galadan dared go three of them did dare though looking back dave saw levon and tore knife through the gap his rush had carved and follow him in a flatout race west with the wolves at their heels and arrows falling about them in the growing dark three only no more though not for lack of courage the rest were dead nor had there been a scanting of gallant bravery in any one of the dalrei who died that day seventeen of them by adein where it runs into llewenmere by pendaran wood they were devoured by the svart alfar as the sun went down the dead always were it was not the same as if it were the lios they had killed of course but blood was blood and the red joy of killing was thick within them all that night after the two groups them so happily come together made a pile of bones cleanpicked and otherwise and started in letting the wolves join them now on their own dead blood was blood there was a lake on their left dark waters glimpsed through a lattice of trees as they whipped by dave had a fleeting image of hurtful beauty but the wolves were close behind and they could not linger at full tilt they hurtled into the outreaches of the forest leaping a fallen branch dodging sudden trees not slacking pace at all until at last dave became aware that the wolves were no longer chasing them the twisting halftrail they followed became rougher forcing them to slow and then it was merely an illusion not really a path the three of them stopped breathing with harsh effort amid the lengthening shadows of trees no one spoke levons face dave saw was like stone again but not as before this he recognized not the steadfastness of resolution but a rigid control locking the muscles the heart against the pain inside you held it in dave thought had always thought it didnt belong to anyone else he couldnt look at levons face very long though it twisted him somehow on top of everything else turning to tore he saw something different youre bleeding he said looking at the blood welling from the dark mans thigh get down lets have a look he of course hadnt a clue what to do it was levon glad of the need for action who tore his sleeping roll into strips and made a tourniquet for the wound which was messy but after cleaning could be seen to be shallow by the time levon finished it was dark and they had all been deeply conscious for some moments of something pulsing in the woods around them nor was there anything remotely vague about it what they sensed was anger and it could be heard in the sound of the leaves felt in the vibrations of the earth beneath their feet they were in pendaran and men and the wood did not forgive we cant stay here tore said abruptly it sounded loud in the dark for the first time dave heard strain in his voice can you walk levon asked i will said tore grimly i would rather be on my feet and moving when we meet whatever is sent for us the leaves were louder now and there seemedor was that imagination to be a rhythm to their sound we will leave the horses then levon said they will be all right i agree with youi dont think we can lie down tonight we will walk south until we meet what until were out dave said strongly come on both of you levon you said before this place isnt evil it doesnt have to be to kill us said tore listen it was not imagination there was a pattern to the sound of the leaves would you prefer dave snapped to go back and try to make nice to the wolves hes right tore levon said in the dark only his long yellow hair could be seen tore in black was almost invisible and davor levon went on in a different voice you wove something very bright back there i dont think any man in the tribe could have forced that opening whatever happens after you saved our lives then i just swung the thing dave muttered at which tore astonishingly laughed aloud for a moment the listening trees were stilled no mortal had laughed in pendaran for a millennium you are said tore dan sorcha as bad as me as bad as him not one of us can deal with praise is your face red right now my friend of course it was for gods sake what do you think he mumbled then feeling the ridiculousness of it hearing levons snort of amusement dave felt something let go inside tension fear grief all of them and he laughed with his friends in the wood where no man went it lasted for some time they were all young had fought their first battle seen comrades slaughtered beside them there was a cutting edge of hysteria to the moment levon took them past it tore is right he said finally we are alike in this and in other ways before we leave this place there is a thing i want to do friends of mine have died today it would be good to have two new brothers will you mingle blood with me i have no brothers tore said softly it would be good daves heart was racing for sure he said and so the ritual was enacted in the wood tore made the incisions with his blade and they touched their wrists each to each in the dark no one spoke after levon made bandages then they freed the horses took their gear and weapons and set forth together south through the forest tore leading levon last dave between his brothers as it happened they had done more than they knew they had been watched and pendaran understood these things bindings wrought of blood it did not assuage the anger or the hate for she was forever lost who should never have died but though these three had still to be slain they could be spared madness before the end so it was decided as they walked oblivious to the meaning of the whispering around them wrapped in it though as in a net of sound for tore nothing had ever been so difficult or shaken him so deeply as that progression over and above the horrors of the slaughter by adein the deep terror of being in pendaran there was another thing for him he was a night mover a woods person this was his milieu and all he had to do was lead his companions south yet he could not roots appeared inexplicably for him to stumble over fallen branches blocked paths other trails simply ended without apparent cause once he almost fell south thats all he snarled to himself oblivious in his concentration to the aching of his leg it was no good thoughevery trail that seemed to hold promise soon turned against all sense or reason to the west are the trees moving he asked himself once and pulled sharply away from the implications of that or am i just being incredibly stupid for whichever cause supernatural or psychological after a little while it was clear to him that hard as he might trycutting right through a thicket onceto keep them on the eastern edges of the great wood they were being drawn slowly very patiently but quite inescapably westward into the heart of the forest it was not of course his fault at all none of what happened was pendaran had had a thousand years to shape the paths and patterns of its response to intrusions such as theirs it is well the trees whispered to the spirits of the wood very well the deiena replied leaves leaves tore heard leaves and wind for dave that night walk was very different he was not of fionavar knew no legends of the wood to appal beyond the story levon had told the day before and that was more sorrowful than frightening with tore before and levon behind he felt quite certain that they were going as they should he was blissfully unaware of tores desperate maneuverings ahead of him and after a time he grew accustomed to even sedated by the murmurings all around them so sedated that he had been walking alone due west for about ten minutes before he realized it tore he cried as sudden fear swept over him levon there was of course no reply he was utterly alone in pendaran wood at night chapter had it been any other night they would have died not badly for the forest would do this much honor to their exchange of blood but their deaths had been quite certain from the moment they had ridden past haunted llewenmere into the trees one man alone had walked in pendaran and come out alive since maugrim whom the powers called sathain had been bound all others had died badly screaming before the end pity was not a thing the wood could feel any other night but away south of them in another wood this was paul schafers third night on the summer tree even as the three intruders were being delicately separated from each other the focus of pendaran was torn utterly away from them by something impossible and humbling even for the ancient nameless powers of the wood a red moon rose in the sky in the forest it was as if a fire had started every power and spirit of the wild magic of tree and flower or beast even the dark oldest ones that seldom woke and that all the others feared the powers of night and the dancing ones of dawn those of music and those who moved in deadly silence all of them began a mad rush away away to the sacred grove for they had to be there before that moon was high enough to shed her light upon the glade dave heard the whispering of the leaves stop it frightened him everything did now but then there came a swift sense of release as if he were no longer being watched in the next instant he felt a great sweep as of wind but not wind as something rushed over him through him hurtling away to the north understanding nothing only that the wood seemed to be simply a wood now the trees merely trees dave turned to the east and he saw the full moon resting red and stupefying atop the highest trees such was the nature of the mothers power that even dave martyniuk alone and lost unspeakably far from home and a world he somewhat comprehended could look upon that moon and take heart from it even dave could see it for an answer to the challenge of the mountain not release only an answer for that red moon meant war as much as anything ever could it meant blood and war but not a hopeless conflict now not with danas intercession overhead higher than even rangats fires could be made to climb all this was inchoate confused struggling for some inner articulation in dave that never quite came together the sense was there though the intuitive awareness that the lord of the dark might be free but he would not be unopposed it was thus with most of those across fionavar who saw that symbol in the heavens the mother works has always worked along the tracings of the blood so that we know things of her we do not realize we know in very great awe hope stirring in his heart dave looked into the eastern sky and the thought that came to him with absolute incongruity was that his father would have liked to see this thing for three days tabor had not opened his eyes when the mountain unleashed its terror he only stirred on his bed and murmured words that his mother watching could not understand she adjusted the cloth on his forehead and the blankets over him unable to do more she had to leave him for a while after that for ivor had given orders swift and controlled to quell the panic caused by the laughter riding on the wind they were starting east for celidon at first light tomorrow they were too alone here too exposed under the very palm it seemed of the hand that hung above rangat even through the loud tumult of preparation with the camp a barely contained whirlwind of chaos tabor slept nor did the rising of a red full moon on new moon night cause him to wake though all the tribe stopped what they were doing wonder shining in their eyes to see it swing up above the plain this gives us time gereint said when ivor snatched a minute to talk with him the work continued at night by the strange moonlight he will not move quickly now i think nor will we ivor said it is going to take us time to get there i want us out by dawn ill be ready the old shaman said just put me on a horse and point it the right way ivor felt a surge of affection for gereint the shaman had been whitehaired and wrinkled for so long he seemed to be timeless he wasnt though and the rapid journey of the coming days would be a hardship for him as so often gereint seemed to read his mind i never thought he said very low i would live so long those who died before this day may be the fortunate ones maybe so ivor said soberly there will be war and have we any revors or colans any ratermaines or seithrs among us have we amairgen or lisen gereint asked painfully we shall have to find them ivor said simply he laid a hand on the shamans shoulder i must go tomorrow tomorrow but see to tabor ivor had planned to supervise the last stages of the wagon loading but instead he detailed cechtar to that and went to sit quietly by his son two hours later tabor woke though not truly he rose up from his bed but ivor checked his cry of joy for he saw that his son was wrapped in a waking trance and it was known to be dangerous to disturb such a thing tabor dressed quickly and in silence and left the house outside the camp was finally still asleep in troubled anticipation of grey dawn the moon was very high almost overhead it was in fact now high enough west of them a dance of light was beginning in the clearing of the sacred grove while the gathered powers of pendaran watched walking very quickly tabor went around to the stockade found his horse and mounted lifting the gate he rode out and began to gallop west ivor running to his own horse leaped astride bareback and followed alone on the plain father and son rode towards the great wood and ivor watching the straight back and easy riding of his youngest child felt his heart grow sore tabor had gone far indeed it seemed he had farther yet to go the weaver shelter him ivor prayed looking north to the now quiescent glory of rangat more than an hour they rode ghosts on the night plain before the massive presence of pendaran loomed ahead of them and then ivor prayed again let him not go into it let it not be there for i love him does that count for anything he wondered striving to master the deep fear the wood always aroused in him it seemed that it might for tabor stopped his horse fifty yards from the trees and sat quietly watching the dark forest ivor halted some distance behind he felt a longing to call his sons name to call him back from wherever he had gone was going he did not instead when tabor murmuring something his father could not hear slipped from his mount and walked into the forest ivor did the bravest deed of all his days and followed no call of any god could make ivor dan banor let his son walk tranced into pendaran wood alone and thus did it come to pass that father and both sons entered into the great wood that night tabor did not go far the trees were thin yet at the edge of the forest and the red moon lit their path with a strangely befitting light none of this ivor thought belonged to the daylight world it was very quiet too quiet he realized for there was a breeze he could feel it on his skin and yet it made no sound among the leaves the hair rose up on the back of ivors neck fighting for calm in the enchanted silence he saw tabor suddenly stop ten paces ahead holding himself very still and a moment later ivor saw a glory step from the trees to stand before his son westward was the sea she had known that though but newly born so east she had walked from the birthing place she shared with lisenthough that she did not knowand as she passed among the gathered powers seen and unseen a murmur like the forests answer to the sea had risen up and fallen like a wave in the wood very lightly she went knowing no other way to tread the earth and on either side the creatures of the forest did her homage for she was danas and a gift in time of war and so was much more than beautiful and as she traveled there came a face into the eye of her mindhow she knew not nor would everbut from the time that was before she was a face appeared to her nutbrown very young with dark unruly hair and eyes she needed to look into besides and more than anything this one knew her name so here and there her path turned as she sought all unknowing delicate and cloaked in majesty a certain place within the trees then she was there and he was there before her waiting a welcome in those eyes and a final acceptance of what she was all of her both edges of the gift she felt his mind in hers like a caress and nudged him back as if with her horn only each other at the last she thought her first such thought whence had it come i knew his mind answered her there will be war for this was i birthed she replied aware of a sudden of what lay sheathed within the light light grace of her form it frightened her he saw this and came nearer she was the color of the risen moon but the horn that brushed the grass when she lowered her head for his touch was silver my name she asked imraithnimphais he told her and she felt power burst within her like a star joyously she asked would you fly she felt him hesitate i would not let you fallshe told him a little hurt she felt his laughter then oh i know bright one he said but if we fly you may be seen and our time is not yet come she tossed her head impatiently her mane rippling the trees were thinner here she could see the stars the moon she wanted them there is no one to see but one man she told him the sky was calling her my father he said i love him then so will i she answered but now i would fty come and within her then he said i willand moved to mount astride her back he was no weight at all she was very strong and would be stronger yet she bore him past the other older man and because tabor loved him she lowered her horn to him as they went by then they were clear of the trees and there was open grass and oh the sky all the sky above for the first time she released her wings and they rose in a rush of joy to greet the stars and the moon whose child she was she could feel his mind within hers the exulting of his heart for they were bound forever and she knew that they were glorious wheeling across the wide night sky imraithnimphais and the rider who knew her name when the chestnut unicorn his son rode lowered her head to him as they passed ivor could not keep the tears from his eyes he always cried too easily leith used to scold but this surely this transcendency and then turning to follow them he saw it become even more for the unicorn took flight ivor lost all track of time then seeing tabor and the creature of his fast go soaring across the night he could almost share the joy they felt in the discovery of flight and he felt blessed in his heart he had walked into pendaran and come out alive to see this creature of the goddess bear his son like a comet above the plain he was too much a chieftain and too wise to forget that there was a darkness coming even this creature this gift could not be an easy thing not colored as she was like the moon like blood nor would tabor ever be the same he knew but these sorrows were for the daylighttonight he could let his heart fly with the two of them the two young ones at play in the wind between him and the stars ivor laughed as he had not in years like a child after an unknown time they came down gently not far from where he stood he saw his son lay his head against that of the unicorn beside the silver shining of its horn then tabor stepped back and the creature turned moving with terrible grace and went back into the darkness of the wood when tabor turned to him his eyes were his own again wordlessly for there were no words ivor held out his arms and his youngest child ran into them you saw tabor asked finally his head against his fathers chest i did you were glorious tabor straightened his eyes reclaiming their dance their youth she bowed to you i didnt ask i just said you were my father and i loved you so she said she would love you too and she bowed ivors heart was full of light come he said gruffly it is time to go home your mother will be weeping with anxiety mother tabor asked in a tone so comical ivor had to laugh they mounted and rode back slowly now and together over their plain on this eve of war a curious peace seemed to descend upon ivor here was his land the land of his people for so long that the years lost meaning from andarien to brennin from the mountains to pendaran all the grass was theirs the plain was the dalrei and they it he let that knowledge flow through him like a chord of music sustaining and enduring it would have to endure in the days to come he knew the full power of the dark coming down and he also knew that it might not tomorrow ivor thought i will worry tomorrow and riding in peace over the prairie beside his son he came back to the camp and saw leith waiting for them by the western gate seeing her tabor slipped from his horse and ran into her arms ivor willed his eyes to stay dry as he watched sentimental fool he castigated himself she was right when leith still holding the boy looked a question up at him he nodded as briskly as he could to bed young man she said firmly were riding in a few hours you need sleep oh mother tabor complained ive done nothing but sleep for the bed leith said in a voice all her children knew yes mother labor replied with such pure happiness that even leith smiled watching him go into the camp fourteen ivor thought regardless of everything absolutely regardless he looked down at his wife she met the look in silence it was he realized their first moment alone since the mountain it was all right she asked it was it is something very bright i dont think i want to know just yet he nodded seeing once more discovering it anew how beautiful she was why did you marry me he asked impulsively she shrugged you asked laughing he dismounted and with each of them leading a horse his and tabors they went back into the camp they put the animals in the stockade and turned home at the doorway ivor looked up for the last time at that moon low now in the west over where pendaran was i lied leith said quietly i married you because no other man i know or can imagine could have made my heart leap so when he asked he turned from the moon to her the sun rises in your eyes he said the formal proposal it always always has my love he kissed her she was sweet and fragrant in his arms and she could kindle his desire so the sun rises in three hours she said disengaging come to bed indeed said ivor to sleep she said warningly i am not ivor said fourteen years old nor am i tired she looked at him sternly a moment then the smile lit her face as from within good said leith his wife neither am i she took his hand and drew him inside dave had no idea where he was nor beyond a vague notion of heading south where to go there werent likely to be signposts in pendaran wood indicating the mileage to paras derval on the other hand he was absolutely certain that if tore and levon were alive theyd be looking for him so the best course seemed to be to stay put and call out at intervals this raised the possibility of other things answering but there wasnt a lot he could do about that remembering tores comments on the babies in faelinn grove he sat down against a tree on the upwind side of a clearing where he could see anything coming across with a chance of hearing or smelling something approaching from behind he then proceeded to negate this bit of concealment by shouting levons name several times at the top of his voice he looked around afterwards but there was nothing stirring indeed as the echoes of his cry faded dave became deeply aware of the silence of the forest that wild rush as of wind seemed to have carried everything with it he appeared to be very much alone but not quite you make it a deep voice sounded from almost directly beneath him very hard for honest folk to sleep leaping violently to his feet dave raised his axe and watched apprehensively as a large fallen tree trunk was rolled aside to reveal a series of steps leading down and a figure emerging to look up at him a long way up the creature hed awakened resembled a portly gnome more than anything else a very long white beard offset a bald crown and rested comfortably on a formidable paunch the figure wore some sort of loose hooded robe and the whole ensemble stood not much more than four feet high could you trouble yourself the bass voice continued to summon this levon person from some other locality checking a bizarre impulse to apologize and another to swing first and query later dave raised the axe to shoulder height and growled who are you disconcertingly the little man laughed names already six days with the dalrei should have taught you to go slower with a question like that call me flidais if you like and put that down the axe a live thing suddenly leaped from daves hands and fell on the grass flidais hadnt even moved his mouth open dave stared at the little man i am testy when awakened flidais said mildly and you should know better than to bring an axe in here id leave it there if i were you dave found his voice not unless you take it from me he rasped it was a gift from ivor dan banor of the dalrei and i want it ah said flidais ivor as if that explained a good deal dave had a sense one that always irritated him that he was being mocked on the other hand he didnt seem in a position to do much about it controlling his temper he said if you know ivor you know levon hes in here somewhere too we were ambushed by svart alfar and escaped into the forest can you help me i am pied for protection dappled for deception flidais replied with sublime inconsequentiality how do you know im not in league with those svarts once more dave forced himself to be calm i dont he said but i need help and youre the only thing around whoever you are now that at least is true flidais nodded sagely all the others have gone north to the grove or he amended judiciously south to the grove if they were north of it to start with cuckoo dave thought i have found a certifiable loon wonderful just wonderful i have been the blade of a sword flidais confided confirming the hypothesis i have been a star at night an eagle a stag in another wood than this i have been in your world and died twice i have been a harp and a harper both in spite of himself dave was drawn into it in the redtinted shadows of the forest there was an eerie power to the chant i know flidais intoned how many worlds there are and i know the skylore that amairgen learned i have seen the moon from undersea and i heard the great dog howl last night i know the answer to all the riddles there are save one and a dead man guards that gateway in your world davor of the axe dave martyniuk against his will dave asked what riddle is that he hated this sort of thing god did he hate it ah said flidais tilting his head would you come to salmon knowledge so easily be careful or you will burn your tongue i have told you a thing already forget it not though the whitehaired one will know beware the boar beware the swan the salt sea bore her body on adrift in a sea of his own dave grabbed for a floating spar lisens body he asked flidais stopped and regarded him there was a slight sound in the trees good flidais said at last very good for that you may keep the axe come down and i will give you food and drink at the mention of food dave became overwhelmingly aware that he was ravenous with a sense of having accomplished something though by luck as much as anything else he followed flidais down the crumbling earthen stairs at the bottom there opened out a catacomb of chambers shaped of earth and threaded through twisting tree roots twice he banged his head before following his small host into a comfortable room with a rough table and stools around it there was a cheery light though from no discernible source i have been a tree flidais said almost as if answering a question i know the earthroots deepest name avarlith dave hazarded greatly daring not that flidais replied but good good he seemed to be in a genial mood now as he puttered about domestically feeling curiously heartened dave pushed a little i came here with loren silvercloak and four others i got separated from them levon and lore were taking me to paras derval then there was that explosion and we got ambushed flidais looked aggrieved i know all that he said a little petulantly there shall be a shaking of the mountain well there was dave said taking a pull at the drink flidais offered having done which he pitched forward on the table quite unconscious flidais regarded him a long time a speculative look in his eye he no longer seemed quite so genial and certainly not mad after a while the air registered the presence hed been awaiting gently he said this is one of my homes and tonight you owe me very well she muted a little the shining from within her is it born even now he replied they will return soon it is well she said satisfied i am here now and was here at lisens birth where were you her smile was capricious unsettling elsewhere he admitted as if she had scored a point i was taliesen i have been a salmon i know she said her presence filled the room as if a star were underground despite his request it was still hard to look upon her face the one riddle she said would you know the answer he was very old and extremely wise and he was half a god himself but this was the deepest longing of his soul goddess he said a helpless streaming of hope within him i would so would i she said cruelly if you find the summoning name do not fail to tell me and said ceinwen letting a blinding light well up from within her so that he closed his eyes in pain and dread speak not ever to me again of what i owe i owe nothing ever but what has been promised and if i promise it is not a debt but a gift never forget he was on his knees the brightness was overpowering i have known flidais said a trembling in his deep voice the shining of the huntress in the wood it was an apology she took it for such it is well she said for the second time muting her presence once more so that he might look upon her countenance i go now she said this one i will take you did well to summon me for i have laid claim to him why goddess flidais asked softly looking at the sprawled form of dave martyniuk her smile was secret and immortal it pleases me she said but just before she vanished with the man ceinwen spoke again so low it was almost not a sound hear me forest one if i learn what name calls the warrior i will tell it thee a promise stricken silent he knelt again on his earthen floor it was had always been his hearts desire when he looked up he was alone they woke all three of them on soft grass in the morning light the horses grazed nearby they were on the very fringes of the forest southward a road ran from east to west and beyond it lay low hills one farmhouse could be seen past the road and overhead birds sang as if it were the newest morning of the world which it was in more ways than the obvious after the cataclysms that the night had known such powers had moved across the face of fionavar as had not been gathered since the worlds were spun and the weaver named the gods iorweth founder had not endured that blast of rangat seen that hand in the sky nor had conary known such thunder in mörnirwood or the white power of the mist that exploded up from the summer tree through the body of the sacrifice neither revor nor amairgen had ever seen a moon like the one that had sailed that night nor had the baelrath blazed so in answer on any other hand in the long telling of its tale and no man but ivor dan banor had ever seen imraithnimphais bear her rider across the glitter of the stars given such a gathering a concatenation of powers such that the worlds might never be the same how small a miracle might it be said to be that dave awoke with his friends in the freshness of that morning on the southern edge of pendaran with the high road from north keep to rhoden running past and a horn lying by his side a small miracle in the light of all that had shaken the day and night before but that which grants life where death was seen as certain can never be inconsequential or even less than wondrous to those who are the objects of its intercession so the three of them rose up in awe and great joy and told their stories to each other while mornings birdsong spun and warbled overhead for tore there had been a blinding flash with a shape behind it apprehended but not seen then darkness until this place levon had heard music all around him strong and summoning a wild cry of invocation as of a hunt passing overhead then it had changed so gradually he could not tell how or when but there came a moment when it was so very sad and restful he had to sleepto wake with his new brothers on the grass brennin spread before them in a mild sunlight hey you two cried dave exuberantly will you look at this he held up the carved horn ivorycolored with workmanship in gold and silver and runes engraved along the curve of it in a spirit of euphoria and delight he set the horn to his lips and blew it was a rash precipitate act but one that could cause no harm for ceinwen had intended him to have this and to learn the thing they all learned as that shining note burst into the morning she had presumed for this treasure was not truly hers to bestow they were to blow the horn and learn the first property of it then ride forth from the place where it had lain so long that was how she had intended it to be but it is a part of the design of the tapestry that not even a goddess may shape exactly what she wills and ceinwen had reckoned without levon dan ivor the sound was light they knew it all three of them as soon as dave blew the horn it was bright and clean and carrying and dave understood even as he took it from his lips to gaze in wonder at what he held that no agent of the dark could ever hear that sound in his heart this came to him and it was a true knowing for such was the first property of that horn come on said tore as the golden echoes died away were still in the wood lets move obediently dave turned to mount his horse still dazzled by the sound he had made hold said levon there were perhaps five men in fionavar who might have known the second power of that gift and none in any other world but one of the five was gereint the shaman of the third tribe of the dalrei who had knowledge of many lost things and who had been the teacher of levon dan ivor she had not known or intended this but not even a goddess can know all things she had intended a small gift what happened was otherwise and not small for a moment the weavers hands were still at his loom then levon said there should be a forked tree here and a thread came back with his words into the tapestry of all the worlds one that had been lost a very long time it was tore who found it an enormous ash had been split by lightningthey could have no glimmering how long agoand its trunk lay forked now at about the height of a man in silence levon walked over dave beside him to where tore was standing dave could see a muscle jumping in his face then levon spoke again and now the rock standing together the three of them looked through the wishbone fork of the ash dave had the angle there he said pointing levon looked and a great wonder was in his eyes there was indeed a rock set flush into a low mound at the edge of the wood do you know he said in a hushed whisper that we have found the cave of the sleepers i dont understand said tore the wild hunt levon replied dave felt a prickling at the back of his neck the wildest magic that ever was lies in that place asleep the strain in levons usually unruffled voice was so great it cracked oweins horn is what you just blew davor if we could ever find the flame they would ride again oh by all the gods tell me dave pleaded he too was whispering for a moment levon was silent then as they stared at the rock through the gap in the ash he began to chant the flame will wake from sleep the kings the horn will call but though they answer from the deep you may never hold in thrall those who ride from oweins keep with a child before them all the wild hunt levon repeated as the sound of his chanting died away i have not words to tell how far beyond the three of us this is and he would say no more they rode then from that place from the great stone and the torn tree with the horn slung at daves side they crossed the road and by tacit agreement rode in such a way as to be seen by no men until they should come to silvercloak and the high king all morning they rode through hilly farmland and at intervals a fine rain fell it was badly needed they could see for the land was dry it was shortly after midday that they crested a series of ascending ridges running to the southeast and saw gleaming below them a lake set like a jewel within the encircling hills it was very beautiful and they stopped a moment to take it in there was a small farmhouse by the water more a cottage really with a yard and a barn behind it riding slowly down they would have passed by as they had all the other farms except that as they descended an old whitehaired woman came out in back of the cottage to gaze at them looking at her as they approached dave saw that she was not in fact so old after all she made a gesture of her hand to her mouth that he seemed inexplicably to know then she was running towards them over the grass and with an explosion of joy in his heart dave leaped shouting from his horse and ran and ran and ran until kimberly was in his arms part ivthe unraveller chapter diarmuid the prince as warden of south keep had a house allocated to him in the capital a small barracks really for those of his men who might for any reason be quartered there it was here that he preferred to spend his own nights when in paras derval and it was here that kevin laine sought him out in the morning after the cataclysms having wrestled with his conscience a good part of the night and it was still giving him trouble as he walked from the palace in the rain he couldnt think very clearly either for grief was a wound in him that dawn the only thing keeping him going forcing resolution was the terrible image of jennifer bound to the black swan and flying north into the grasp of that hand the mountain had sent up the problem though was where to go where loyalty took him both loren and kim unnervingly transformed were clearly supporting this grim prepossessing older prince who had suddenly returned it is my war aileron had told loren and the mage had nodded quietly which on one level left kevin with no issue at all to wrestle with on the other hand diarmuid was the heir to the throne and kevin was if he was anything at all here one of diarmuids band after saeren and cathal after especially the look he and the prince had exchanged when hed finished his song in the black boar he needed paul to talk it over with god he needed him but paul was dead and his closest friends here were erron and carde and coll and their prince so he entered the barracks and asked as briskly as he could wheres diarmuid then he stopped dead in his tracks they were all there tegid the company from the journey south and others he didnt know they were sitting soberly around the tables in the large front room but they rose when he entered every one of them was dressed in black with a red band on his left arm diarmuid too come in he said i see you have news let it wait kevin there was quiet emotion in the usually acerbic voice the grief i know is yours most of all but the men of the south marches have always worn a red armband when one of their own dies and we have lost two now drance and pwyll he was one of uswe all feel it here will you let us mourn for paul with you there was no briskness left in kevin only a compounding of sorrows he nodded almost afraid to speak he collected himself though and said swallowing hard of course and thank you but there is business first i have information and you should know it now tell me then the prince said though i may know it already i dont think so your brother came back last night sardonic amusement registered in diarmuids face but it had indeed been news and the mocking reaction had been preceded by another expression ah said the prince in his most acid tones i should have guessed from the grayness of the sky and of course he went on ignoring the rising murmur from his men there is now a throne up for the taking he would return aileron likes thrones it is not up for the taking the speaker redfaced and vehement was coll diar you are the heir i will cut him apart before i see him take it from you no one said diarmuid playing delicately with a knife on the table is going to take anything from me at all certainly not aileron is there more kevin there was of course he told them about ysannes death and kims transformation and then reluctantly about lorens tacit endorsement of the older prince diarmuids eyes never left his own nor did the hint of laughter sheathed in their depths ever quite disappear he continued to toy with the dagger when kevin had finished there was a silence in the room broken only by coils furious pacing back and forth i owe you again said diarmuid at length i knew none of this kevin nodded even as he did there came a knocking at the door carde opened it in the entranceway rain dripping from his hat and cloak stood the broad square figure of gorlaes the chancellor before kevin could assimilate his presence there gorlaes had stepped into the room prince diarmuid he said without preamble my sources tell me your brother has returned from exile for the crown i think you my lord are the heir to the throne i swore to serve i have come to offer you my services and at that diarmuids laughter exploded unchecked and abrasive in a room full of mourners of course you have he cried come in do come in gorlaes i have great need of youwere short a cook at south keep even as the princes sarcastic hilarity filled the room kevins mind cut back to the pulse beat of time that had followed his first announcement of ailerons return there had been sharp irony in diarmuid then too but only after the first instant in the first instant kevin thought he had seen something very different flash across the princes face and he was almost certain he knew what it was loren and matt had gone with teyrnon and barak to bring the body home from the tree the godwood was not a place where soldiers would willingly go and in any case on the eve of war the last two mages in paras derval saw it as fit that they walk together with their sources apart from other men and share their thoughts on what would lie in the days ahead they were agreed on the kingship though in some ways it was a pity for all ailerons harsh abrasiveness there was in his driven nature the stuff of a war king of old diarmuids mercurial glitter made him simply too unreliable they had been wrong about things before but not often in concert barak concurred matt kept his own counsel but the other three were used to that besides they were in the wood by then and being men acquainted with power and deeply tuned to what had happened in the night they walked in silence to the summer tree and then in a different kind of silence walked back away under leaves dripping with the morning rain it was taught and they all knew the teachings that mörnir if he came for the sacrifice laid claim only to the soul the body was husk dross not for the god and it was left behind except it hadnt been a mystery but it was solved when loren and matt returned to paras derval and saw the girl in the dun robes of an acolyte of the sanctuary waiting outside their quarters in the town my lord she said as they walked up the high priestess bade me tell you to come to her in the temple so soon as you might tell him matt growled the child was remarkably composed she did say that the matter is important ah said loren she brought back the body the girl nodded because of the moon he went on thinking aloud it fits surprisingly the acolyte nodded again of course it does she said coolly will you come now exchanging a raisedeyebrows look the two of them followed jaelles messenger through the streets to the eastern gate once beyond the town she stopped there is something i would warn you about she said loren silvercloak looked down from his great height upon the child did the priestess tell you to do so of course not her tone was impatient then you should not speak other than what you were charged to say how long have you been an acolyte i am leila she replied gazing up at him with tranquil eyes too tranquil he wondered at the answer was her mind touched sometimes the temple took such children that isnt what i asked he said kindly i know what you asked she said with some asperity i am leila i called finn dan shahar to the longest road four times this summer in the takiena his eyes narrowed he had heard about this and jaelle has made you an acolyte two days ago she is very wise an arrogant child it was time to assert control not he said sternly if her acolytes presume to judge her and her messengers offer messages of their own it didnt faze her with a shrug of acceptance leila turned and continued up the slope to the sanctuary he wrestled with it for several strides then admitted a rare defeat hold loren said and heard matts snort of laughter beside him what is your news the dwarf he was aware was finding this whole exchange richly amusing it was he supposed he is alive leila said and suddenly there was nothing amusing about anything at all there had been darkness a sense of movement of being moved the stars very close then impossibly far away and receding everything receding the next time there was an impression blurred as through rain on glass of candles wavering with gray shapes moving ambiguously beyond their arc he was still now but soon he felt himself slipping back again as a tide withdraws to the dark sea wherein there lie no discontinuities except the fact of his presence of his being alive paul opened his eyes having come a long way and it seemed after all the journeying that he was lying on a bed in a room where there were indeed candles burning he was very weak there was astonishingly little physical pain though and the other kind of pain was so newly allowed it was almost a luxury he took one slow breath that meant life and then another to welcome back sorrow oh rachel he breathed scarcely a sound forbidden once the most forbidden name but then intercession had come before he died and absolution allowing grief except that he hadnt died a thought like a blade pierced him at that was he alive because hed failed was that it with an effort he turned his head the movement revealed a tall figure standing by the bed gazing down at him from between the candles you are in the temple of the mother jaelle said it is raining outside rain there was a bitter challenge in her eyes but it couldnt touch him in that moment he was beyond her he turned his head away it was raining he was alive sent back arrow of the god he felt the presence of mörnir then within himself latent tacit there was a burden in that and soon it would have to be addressed but not yet not yet now was for lying still tasting the sense of being himself again for the first time in so very long ten months and three nights that had been forever oh he could go with joy a little ways it was allowed eyes closed he sank deep into the pillow he was desperately weak but weakness was all right now there was rain dana spoke to you he could hear the vivid rage in her voice too much of it he ignored her kevin he thought i want to see kev soonhe told himself after i sleep she slapped him hard across the face he felt a raking nail draw blood you are in the sanctuary answer paul schafer opened his eyes with cold scorn of his own he confronted her fury this time jaelle looked away after a moment she spoke gazing at one of the long candles all my life i have dreamt of hearing the goddess speak of seeing her face bitterness had drained her voice not me though not anything at all yet you a man and one who turned from her entirely for the god in his wood have been allowed grant of her grace do you wonder why i hate you the utter flatness of her tone made the words more chilling than any explosion of anger would have been paul was silent a moment then he said i am her child too do not begrudge the gift she offered me your life you mean she was looking at him again tall and slender between the candles he shook his head it was still an effort not that in the beginning perhaps but not now it was the god who gave me this not so you are a greater fool than i thought if you know not dana when she comes actually he said but gently for it was a matter too high for wrangling i do know in this case better than you priestess the goddess was there yes and she did intercede though not for my life for something else before the end but it was mörnir who saved me it was his to choose the summer tree is the gods jaelle for the first time he read a flicker of doubt in the wideset eyes she was there though she did speak tell me what she said no said paul with finality you must but it was not a command now he had a vague sense that there was something he should something he wanted to say to her but he was so weary so utterly drained which triggered a completely different realization you know he said with feeling that i havent had food or drink for three days is there she stood still a moment but when she moved it was to a tray on a low table by the far wall she brought a bowl of cool soup to the bed unfortunately it seemed that his hands didnt work very well yet he thought she would send for one of the grayclad priestesses but in the end she sat stiffly on the bed beside him and fed him herself he ate in silence leaning back against the pillows when he was done she made as if to get up but then with an expression of distaste used the sleeve of her white gown to wipe the blood from his cheek she did rise then to stand tall and queenly by his bed her hair the color of the candlelight looking up at her he felt at a disadvantage suddenly why he asked am i here i read the signs you didnt expect to find me alive she shook her head no but it was the third night and then the moon rose he nodded but why he asked why bother her eyes flashed dont be such a child there is a war now you will be needed he felt his heart skip what do you mean what war you dont know ive been somewhat out of touch he said sharply what has happened it may have taken an effort but her voice was controlled rangat exploded yesterday a hand of fire in the sky the wardstone is shattered rakoth is free he was very still the king is dead she said that i know he said i heard the bells but for the first time now her expression was strained something difficult moved in her eyes there is more said jaelle a party of lios alfar were ambushed here by svarts and wolves your friend was with them jennifer i am sorry but she was captured and taken north a black swan bore her away so he closed his eyes again feeling the burdens coming down it seemed they could not be deferred after all arrow of the god spear of the god three nights and forever the king had said the king was dead and jen he looked up again now i know why he sent me back as if against her will jaelle nodded twiceborn she murmured wordlessly he asked with his eyes there is a saying she whispered a very old one no man shall be lord of the summer tree who has not twice been born and so by candlelight in the sanctuary he heard the words for the first time i didnt ask for this paul schafer said she was very beautiful very stern a flame as the candles were are you asking me for pity his mouth crooked wryly at that hardly at this point he smiled a little why is it so much easier for you to strike a defenseless man than to wipe the blood from his face her reply was formal reflexive but he had seen her eyes flinch away there is mercy in the goddess sometimes she said but not gentleness is that how you know her he asked what if i tell you that i had from her last night a compassion so tender there are no words to compass it she was silent arent we two human beings first he went on with very great burdens and support to share you are jaelle surely as well as her priestess there you are wrong she said i am only her priestess there is no one else that seems to me very sad you are only a man jaelle replied and paul was abashed by what blazed in her eyes before she turned and left the room kim had lain awake for most of the night alone in her room in the palace achingly aware of the other empty bed even inside the baelrath was responding to the moon glowing brightly enough to cast shadows on the wall a branch outside the window swaying in the rain wind the outline of her own white hair the shape of a candle by the bed but no jen no shadow of her kim tried utterly unaware of what her power was of how to use the stone she closed her eyes and reached out in the wild night north as far as she might as clearly as she might and found only the darkness of her own apprehensions when the stone grew dim again only a red ring on her finger she knew the moon had set it was very late then little left of the night kim lay back in weariness and dreamt of a desire she hadnt known she had it is in your dreams that you must walk ysanne had said was saying still as she dropped far down into the dream again and this time she knew the place she knew where lay those jumbled mighty arches of broken stone and who was buried there for her to wake not him not the one she sought too easy were it so that path was darker even than it was now and it led through the dead in the dreaming place this she now knew it was very sad though she understood that the gods would not think it so the sins of the sons she thought in her dream knowing the place feeling the wind rising and her hair oh her white hair blown back the way to the warrior led through the grave and the risen bones of the father who had never seen him alive what was she that she should know this but then she was somewhere else with no space to wonder she was in the room under the cottage where the circlet of lisen still shone colans dagger beside it where ysanne had died and more than died the seer was with her though was within her for she knew the book the parchment page within the book where the invocation could be found to raise the father whole from his grave and make him name the name of his son to the one who knew the place of summoning there was no peace no serenity anywhere she carried none had none to grant she wore the warstone on her hand she would drag the dead from their rest and the undead to their doom what was she that this should be so at the mornings first light she made them take her back in the rain an armed guard of thirty men went with her troops from north keep who had been ailerons before he was exiled with cool efficiency they compassed her about on the ride to the lake at the last curve the bodies of ailerons victims still lay on the path did he do that alone the leader of the guard asked when they were past his voice was reverent yes she said he will be our king yes she said they waited by the lake while she went inside and then down the now familiar stairs into the glow cast by lisens light she left it where it lay though and walking to the table she opened one of the books oh it was a glory and a terror that she knew where to look but she did and sitting there alone she slowly read the words that she would have to speak but only when she knew the place that no one knew the tumbled stones were only the starting point there was a long way yet to walk along this path a long way but she was on it now preoccupied tangled among interstices of time and place the seer of brennin went back up the stairs ailerons men awaited her in disciplined alertness by the lake it was time to go there was a very great deal to be done she lingered though in the cottage seeing the fire the hearth the worn table the herbs in jars along the wall she read the labels unstoppered one container to smell its contents there was so much to be done the seer of brennin knew but still she lingered tasting the aloneness it was bittersweet and when she moved at last kimberly went out the back door still alone into the yard away from where the soldiers were and she saw three men picking their way on horseback down the slope north of her and one of them she knew oh she knew and it seemed that amid all the burdens and sorrows joy could still flower like a bannion in the wood they buried ailell dan art in a time of rain it fell upon the windows of delevan high above the great hall where the king lay in state robed in white and gold his sword upon his breast his great gnarled hands closed upon the hilt it fell softly upon the gorgeous woven covering of the bier when the nobility of brennin who had gathered for celebration and stayed for mourning and war bore him out of the palace and to the doors of the temple where the women took him it fell too upon the dome of that sanctuary while jaelle the high priestess performed the rites of the mother to send back home to her one of the kings no man was in that place loren had taken paul away shed had hopes of seeing silvercloak shaken but had been disappointed for the mage had shown no surprise at all and she had been forced to cloak her own discomfiture at that and at his bowing to the twiceborn no man was in that place save for the dead king when they lifted the great axe from its rest and no man saw what they did then dana was not mocked nor denied when she took her child home whom she had sent forth so long ago on the circling path that led ever back to her it was the place of the high priestess to bury the high king and so jaelle led them forth when the rites were done into the rain she went clad in white among all the black and they bore ailell shoulderhigh behind her to the crypt wherein the kings of brennin were laid to rest east of the palace it lay north of the temple before the body went jaelle with the key to the gates in her hands behind the bier fair and solitary walked diarmuid the kings heir and after him came all the lesser nobility of brennin among them there walked though with aid a prince of the lios alfar and there were come as well two men of the dalrei from the plain and with these walked two men from another world one very tall and dark another fair and between them was a woman with white hair the common folk lined the path six deep in the rain and they bowed their heads to see ailell go by then they came to the great gates of the burying place and jaelle saw that they were open already and that a man clad in black stood waiting there for them and she saw who it was come said aileron let us lay my father by my mother whom he loved and while she was trying to mask her shock another voice spoke welcome home exile diarmuid said his tone mild unsurprised and he moved lightly past her to kiss aileron on the cheek shall we lead him back to her it was greatly wrong for she had right of precedence here but in spite of herself the high priestess felt a strange emotion to see the two of them the dark son and the bright pass through the gates of the dead side by side while all the people of brennin murmured behind them in the falling rain on a spur of hill high above that place three men watched one would be first mage of brennin before the sun had set one had been made king of the dwarves by a sunrise long ago and the third had caused the rain and been sent back by the god we are gathered gorlaes began standing beside the throne but two careful steps below it in a time of sorrow and need they were in the great hall tomaz lals masterpiece and there were gathered that afternoon all the mighty of brennin save one the two dalrei and dave as well so fortuitously arrived had been greeted with honor and shown to their chambers and even brendel of daniloth was absent from this assemblage for what brennin had now to do was matter for brennin alone in any normal time our loss would demand space for mourning but this is no such time it is needful for us now the chancellor continued seeing that jaelle had not contested his right to speak first to take swift counsel amongst one another and go forth from this hall united with a new king to lead us into hold gorlaes we will wait for silvercloak it was teyrnon the mage and he had risen to stand with barak his source and matt sören trouble already and they had not even begun surely jaelle murmured it is rather his duty to be here when others are we have waited long enough we will wait longer the dwarf growled as we waited for you yesterday there was something in his tone that made gorlaes glad it was jaelle whod raised objection and not himself where is he niavin of seresh asked he is coming he had to go slowly why it was diarmuid he had stopped his feline pacing at the edges of the hall and come forward wait was all the dwarf replied gorlaes was about to remonstrate but someone else came in first no said aileron for all the love i bear him i will not wait on this there is in truth little to discuss kim ford in that room as the newest the only seer of brennin watched him stride to stand by gorlaes and a step above him directly before the throne he will always be like this she thought there is only the force of him and with force cold unyielding force aileron looked over them all and spoke again in time of council lorens wisdom will be sorely needed but this is not a time of council whatever you may have thought diarmuid was no longer pacing he had moved at ailerons first words to stand directly in front of his brother an unruffled contrast to ailerons coiled intensity i came here said aileron dan ailell flatly for the crown and to lead us into war the throne is minehe was looking directly at his brotherand i will kill for it or die for it before we leave this hall the rigid silence that followed this was broken a moment later by the jarring sound of one man clapping elegantly put my dear said diarmuid as he continued to applaud so utterly succinct then he lowered his hands the sons of ailell faced each other as if alone in the vast hall mockery said aileron softly is easy it was ever your retreat understand me though brother this for once is no idle sport i want your fealty this hour in this place or there are six archers in the musicians gallery who will kill you if i raise my hand no kim exclaimed shocked out of silence this is preposterous teyrnon shouted at the same time striding forward i forbid you cannot forbid me aileron rode over him rakoth is free what lies ahead is too large for me to trifle with diarmuid had cocked his head quizzically to one side as if considering an abstract proposition then he spoke his voice so soft they had to strain to hear you would truly do this thing i would aileron replied with no hesitation at all truly diarmuid asked a second time all i have to do is raise my arm aileron said and i will if i must believe it diarmuid shook his head slowly back and forth he sighed heavily then coll he said and pitched it to carry my lord prince the big mans voice boomed instantly from overhead from the musicians gallery diarmuid lifted his head his expression tranquil almost indifferent report he did do it my lord coils voice was thick with anger he moved forward to the railing he really did there were seven men up here say the word and i will slay him now diarmuid smiled that he said is reassuring then he turned back to aileronand his eyes were no longer so aloof the older brother had changed too he seemed to have uncoiled himself into readiness and he broke the silence i sent six aileron said who is the seventh they were all scrambling to grasp the import of this when the seventh leaped from the gallery overhead it was a long jump but the dark figure was lithe and landing rolled instantly and was up five feet from diarmuid with a dagger back to throw only aileron moved in time with the unleashed reflexes of a pure fighter he grabbed for the first thing that came to hand as the assassins dagger went back aileron flung the heavy object hard across the space between it hit the intruder square in the back the flung blade was sent awry just awry enough so as not to pierce the heart it was intended for diarmuid had not even moved he stood swaying a little with a peculiar halfsmile on his face and a jeweled dagger deep in his left shoulder he had time kim saw to murmur something very low indistinguishable as if to himself before all the swords were out and the assassin was ringed by steel ceredur of north keep drew back his blade to kill hold swords diarmuid ordered sharply hold ceredur slowly lowered his weapon the only sound in the whole great room was made by the object aileron had flung rolling in diminishing circles on the mosaicinlaid floor it happened to be the oak crown of brennin diarmuid with a frightening glint of hilarity in his face bent to pick it up he bore it his footsteps echoing to the long table in the center of the room setting it down he unstoppered a decanter using one hand only they all watched as he poured himself a drink quite deliberately then he carried his glass slowly back towards them all it is my pleasure said diarmuid dan ailell prince of brennin to propose a toast the wide mouth smiled there was blood dripping from his arm will you all drink with me he said raising high the glass to the dark rose of cathal and walking forward he lifted his other arm with obvious pain and removed the cap and pins she wore so that sharras dark hair tumbled free having devorsh killed had been a mistake for two reasons first it gave her father far too much leverage in his campaign to foist one of the lords on her the lordlings leverage he had already begun to use secondly he was the wrong man by the time rangat sent up its fiery handvisible even in cathal though the mountain itself was nother own explosion of rage had metamorphosed into something else something quite as deadly or even more so since it was sheathed within exquisitely simulated repentance she had agreed that she would walk the next morning with evien of lagos in the gardens and then receive two other men in the afternoon she had been agreeing to everything but when the red moon rose that night she bound up her hair knowing her father very very well and in the strangely hued darkness and the haste of departure she joined the embassy to paras derval it was easy too easy a part of her thought as they rode to cynan discipline was shockingly lax among the troops of the garden country still it served her purpose now as had the mountain and the moon for whatever the larger cataclysms might mean whatever chaos lay before them all sharra had her own matter to deal with first and the falcon is a hunting bird at cynan there was pandemonium when they finally tracked down the harbormaster he flashed a code of lights across the delta to seresh and was quickly answered he took them across himself horses and all on a wide river barge from the familiarity of the greetings exchanged on the other side of saeren it was clear that rumors of quite improper intercourse between the river fortresses were true it was increasingly evident how certain letters had gotten into cathal there had been rumblings of thunder in the north as they rode to cynan but as they came ashore in seresh in the dark hours before dawn all was still and the red moon hung low over the sea sailing in and out of scudding clouds all about her flowed the apprehensive murmurings of war mingled with a desperate relief among the men of brennin at the rain that was softly falling there had been a drought she gathered shalhassans emissaries accepted with some relief an invitation from the garrison commander at seresh to stay for what remained of the night the duke they learned was in paras derval already and something else they learned ailell was dead this morning word had come at sundown there would be a funeral and then a coronation on the morrow who why prince diarmuid of course the heir you know a little wild the commander conceded but a gallant prince there were none in cathal to match him hed wager only a daughter for shalhassan what a shame that she slipped from the party as it rode towards seresh castle and circling the town to the northeast set out alone on the road to paras derval she reached it late in the morning it was easy there too amid the hysteria of an interrupted overcrowded festival a dead king and the terror of rakoth unchained she should a part of her mind said be feeling that terror too for as shalhassans heir she had an idea of what was to come and she had seen her fathers face as he looked upon the shattered wardstone shalhassans frightened face which never ever showed his thought oh there was terror enough to be found but not yet she was on a hunt the doors of the palace were wide open the funeral had so many people coming and going back and forth that sharra was able to slip inside without trouble she thought briefly of going to the tombs but there would be too many people there too great a press fighting the first numbings of fatigue she forced herself to clarity they were having a coronation after the burial they would have to in time of war there was no space to linger where even in cathal the great hall of tomaz lal was a byword it would have to be there she had spent all her life in palaces no other assassin could have navigated with such instinctive ease the maze of corridors and stairwells indeed it was the very certainty of her bearing that precluded any challenge all so very easy she found the musicians gallery and it was even unlocked she could have picked the lock in any case her brother had taught her how years and years ago entering she sat down in a dark corner and composed herself to wait from the high shadows she could see servants below making ready glasses and decanters trays of food deep chairs for nobility it was a fine hall she conceded and the windows were indeed something rare and special larai rigal was better though nothing matched the gardens she knew so well the gardens she might never see again for the first time now that she was unbelievably here and had only to wait a tendril of fear snaked insidiously through her mind she banished it leaning forward she gauged the leap it was long longer than from high branches of familiar trees but it could be done it would be done and he would see her face before he died and die knowing else there was no point a noise startled her pressing quickly back into her corner she caught her breath as six archers slipped through the unlocked door and ranged themselves along the gallery it was wide and deep she was not seen though one of them was very close to her in silence she crouched in the corner and so learned from their low talk that there was more than a simple coronation to take place that day and that there were others in that hall with designs on the life she had claimed as her own she had a moment to think on the nature of this returned prince aileron who could send men hither with orders to kill his only brother on command briefly she remembered marlen her own brother whom she had loved and who was dead only briefly though because such thoughts were too soft for what she had still to do despite this new difficulty it had been easy to this point she had no right to have expected no hindrance at all in the next moments though difficulty became something more for ten men burst through the two doors of the high gallery in pairs they came with knives and swords drawn and in cold efficient silence they disarmed the archers and found her she had the presence of mind to keep her head down as they threw her together with the six archers the gallery had been designed to be shadowed and torchlit with only the flames visible from below so that music emanating therefrom would seem disembodied born of fire it was this that saved her from being exposed in the moments before the nobles of brennin began to file in over the mosaicinlaid floor below them every man in that gallery and the one woman watched absorbed as the foreshortened figures moved to the end of the hall where stood a carved wooden throne it was oak she knew and so was the crown resting on the table beside it then he came forward into view from the perimeter of the room and it was clear that he had to die because she was still in spite of all having trouble breathing at the sight of him the golden hair was bright above the black of his mourning he wore a red armband so she abruptly realized did the ten men encircling her and the archers an understanding came then and though she fought it very hard a sharp pleasure at his mastery oh it was clear it was clear he had to die the broadshouldered man with the chancellors seal about his neck was speaking now then he was interrupted once and more intensely a second time it was hard to hear but when a darkbearded man strode to stand in front of the throne she knew it was aileron the exile returned he didnt look like diarmuid kevin by all the gods i want his blood for this the leader of her captors hissed fiercely easy a fairhaired man replied listen they all did diarmuid she saw was no longer pacing he had come to stand his posture indolent before his brother the throne is mine the dark prince announced i will kill for it or die for it before we leave this hall even in the high gallery the intensity of it reached them there was a silence raucously broken by diarmuids lazy applause god the one called kevin murmured i could have told you she thought and then checked it brutally he was speaking now something too soft to be caught which was maddening but ailerons reply they all heard and stiffened there are six archers in the musicians gallery he said who will kill you if i raise my hand time seemed to slow impossibly it was upon her she knew words were spoken very softly down below then more words then coll diarmuid said clearly and the big man moved forward to be seen and speak and say as she had known he would there were seven men up here it all seemed to be quite peculiarly slow she had a great deal of time to think to know what was about to happen long long it seemed before aileron said i sent six who is the seventhand she jumped catching them utterly by surprise drawing her dagger even as she fell so slowly with so much clarity to land and roll and rise to face her lover she had intended to give him an instant to recognize her she prayed she had that much time before they killed her he didnt need it his eyes were wide on hers knowing right away knowing probably even as she fell and oh curse him forever quite unafraid so she threw she had to throw before he smiled it would have killed him for she knew how to use a dagger if something had not struck her from behind as she released she staggered but kept her feet so did he her dagger in his left arm to the hilt just above the red armband and then in a longedfor terrifying access to what lay underneath the command and the glitter she heard him murmur so low no one else could possibly hear both of you and in that moment he was undisguised only for the moment so brief she almost doubted it had taken place because immediately he was smiling again elusive controlling with vivid laughter in his eyes he took the crown his brother had thrown to save his life and set it down then he poured his wine and came back to salute her extravagantly and set free her hair so that she was revealed and though her dagger was in his arm it seemed that it was he who held her as a small thing in the palm of his hand and not the other way around at all both of them coll exclaimed they both wanted him dead and now he has them both oh by the gods he will do it now i dont think so said kevin soberly i dont think he will what demanded coll taken aback watch we will treat this lady diarmuid was saying with all dignity due to her if i am not mistaken she comes as the vanguard of an embassy from shalhassan of cathal we are honored that he sends his daughter and heir to consult with us it was so smoothly done that he took them all with him for a moment standing the reality on its head but spluttered ceredur redfaced with indignation she tried to kill you she had cause diarmuid replied calmly will you explain prince diarmuid it was mabon of rhoden speaking with deference kevin noted now said coll grinning again now thought sharra whatever happens i will not live with this shame diarmuid said i stole a flower from larai rigal four nights ago in such a way that the princess would know it was an irresponsible thing for those gardens as we all know are sacred to them it seems that sharra of cathal valued the honor of her country above her own lifefor which we in turn must honor her sharras world spun for a dizzy instant then righted itself she felt herself flushing tried to control it he was giving her an out setting her free but she asked herself even then with a racing heart of what worth was freedom if it came only as his gift she had no time to pursue it for ailerons voice cut abrasively through his brothers spell just as diarmuids applause had destroyed his own moments before you are lying the older prince said tersely even you would not go through seresh and cynan as kings heir risking so much exposure for a flower do not toy with us diarmuid eyebrows raised turned to his brother should i he said in a voice like velvet kill you instead score one kevin thought seeing even high as he was how aileron paled at that and a neat diversion too as it happens diarmuid went on i didnt go near the river fortresses you flew i suppose jaelle interjected acidly diarmuid bestowed his most benign smile upon her no we crossed saeren below the dael slope and climbed up the handholds carved in the rock on the other side this is disgraceful aileron snapped recovering how can you lie at such a time there was a murmur among the gathering as it happens kevin laine called down moving forward to be seen hes telling the truth they all looked up the absolute truth kevin went on pushing it there were nine of us do you remember diarmuid asked his brother the book of nygath that we read as boys reluctantly aileron nodded i broke the code diarmuid said cheerfully the one we could never solve it told of steps carved into the cliff in cathal five hundred years ago by alon before he was king we crossed the river and climbed them it isnt quite as foolish as it soundsit was a useful training expedition and something more she kept her head high her eyes fixed on the windows but every timbre of his voice registered within her something more is a falcon not a falcon if it does not fly alone how did you cross the river duke niavin of seresh asked with no little interest he had them all now kevin saw the first great lie now covered with successive layers of truth with lorens arrows actually and a taut rope across but dont tell him diarmuid grinned easily despite a dagger in his arm or ill never ever hear the end of it too late someone said from behind them halfway down the hall they all turned loren was there clad for the first time since the crossing in his cloak of power shot through with many colors that shaded into silver and beside him was the one who had spoken behold said loren silvercloak i bring you the twiceborn of the prophecy here is pwyll the stranger who has come back to us lord of the summer tree he had time to finish barely before there came an utterly undecorous scream from the seer of brennin and a second figure hurtled over the balcony of the overhead gallery shouting with relief and joy as he fell kim got there first to envelop paul in a fierce strangling embrace that was returned as hard by him there were tears of happiness in her eyes as she stepped aside to let kevin and paul stand face to face she was grinning she knew like a fool amigo said paul and smiled welcome back said kevin simply and then all the nobility of brennin watched in respectful silence as the two of them embraced kevin stepped back his eyes bright you did it he said flatly youre clear now arent you and paul smiled again i am he said sharra watching not understanding anything beyond the intensity saw diarmuid walk forward then to the two of them and she marked the pleasure in his eyes which was unfeigned and absolute paul he said this is a bright thread unlookedfor we were mourning you schafer nodded im sorry about your father it was time i think said diarmuid they too embraced and as they did so the stillness of the hall was shattered by a great noise over their heads as diarmuids men roared and clattered their swords paul raised a hand to salute them back then the mood changed the interlude was over for aileron had come forward too to stand in front of paul as diarmuid stepped aside for what seemed like forever the two men gazed at each other their expressions equally unreadable no one there could know what had passed between them in the godwood two nights before but what lay in the room was palpable and a thing very deep mörnir be praised aileron said and dropped to his knees before paul a moment later everyone in the room but kevin laine and the three women had done the same his heart tight with emotion kevin suddenly understood a truth about aileron this this was how he led by pure force of example and conviction even diarmuid he saw had followed his brothers lead his eyes met kims across the heads of the kneeling brothers not clearly knowing what it was he was acquiescing to he nodded and was moved to see the relief that showed in her face she wasnt it seemed such a stranger after all white hair notwithstanding aileron rose again and so did all the others paul had not moved or spoken he seemed to be conserving his strength quietly the prince said we are grateful beyond measure for what you have woven schafers mouth moved in what was only half a smile i didnt take your death after all he said aileron stiffened without responding he spun and walked back to the throne ascending the steps he turned again to face them all his eyes compelling rakoth is free he said the stones are broken and we are at war with the dark i say to all of you to you my brothera sudden rawness in the voicei tell you that this conflict is what i was born for i have sensed it all my life without knowing now i know it is my destiny it is cried aileron passion blazing in his face my war the power of it was overwhelming a cry of conviction torn whole from the heart even jaelles bitter eyes held a kind of acceptance and there was no mockery at all in diarmuids face you arrogant bastard paul schafer said it was like a kick in the teeth even kevin felt it he saw ailerons head snap back his eyes go wide with shock how presumptuous can you get paul went on stepping forward to stand before aileron your death your crown your destiny your war your war his voice skirled upward he put a hand on the table for support pwyll said loren paul wait no schafer snapped i hate this and i hate giving in to it he turned back to aileron what about the lios alfar he demanded loren tells me twenty of them have died already what about cathal isnt it their war too he pointed to sharra and eridu and the dwarves isnt this matt sörens war and what about the dalrei there are two of them here now and seventeen of them have died seventeen of the dalrei are dead dead isnt it their war prince aileron and look at us look at kimlook at her at what shes taken on for you andhis voice roughenedthink about jen if you will just for a second before you lay sole claim to this there was a difficult silence ailerons eyes had never left pauls while he spoke nor did they now when he began to speak his tone was very different a plea almost i understand he said stiffly i understand all of what you are saying but i cannot change what else i know pwyll i was born into the world to fight this war with a strange lightheadedness kim ford spoke then for the first time in public as seer of brennin paul she said everyone i have to tell you that ive seen this so did ysanne thats why she sheltered him paul what hes saying is true schafer looked at her and the crusading anger she remembered from what he had been before rachel died faded in the face of her own certitude oh ysanne she thought seeing it happen how did you stand up under so much weight if you tell me i will believe it paul said obviously drained but you know it remains his war even if he is not high king of brennin hes still going to fight it it seems a wrong way to choose a king do you have a suggestion loren asked surprising them all yes i do paul said he let them wait then i suggest you let the goddess decide she who sent the moon let her priestess speak her will said the arrow of the god looking at jaelle they all turned with him it seemed in the end to have a kind of inevitability to it the goddess taking back one king and sending forth another in his stead she had been waiting amid the tense dialogue back and forth for the moment to stop them all and say this thing now he had done it for her she gazed at him a moment before she rose tall and beautiful to let them know the will of dana and gwen ystrat as had been done long ago in the naming of the kings in a room dense with power hers was not the least and it was the oldest by far it is a matter for sorrow she began blistering them with a glance that it should take a stranger to fionavar to remind you of the true order of things but howsoever that may be know ye the will of the goddess no said diarmuid and it appeared that there was nothing inevitable after all sorry sweetling with all deference to the dazzle of your smile i dont want to know ye the will of the goddess fool she exclaimed do you want to be cursed i have been cursed diarmuid said with some feeling rather a good deal lately i have had quite a lot happen to me today and i need a pint of ale very badly it has only just occurred to me that as high king i couldnt very easily drop in to the boar at night which is what i propose to do as soon as weve crowned my brother and i get this dagger out of my arm even paul schafer was humbled by the relief that flashed in that moment across the bearded face of aileron dan ailell whose mother was marrien of the garantae and who would be crowned later that day by jaelle the priestess as high king of brennin to lead that realm and its allies into war against rakoth maugrim and all the legions of the dark there was no banquet or celebration it was a time of mourning and of war and so at sundown loren gathered the four of them with the two young dalrei dave refused to be parted from in the mages quarters in the town one of the dalrei had a leg wound that at least his magic had been able to deal with a small consolation given how much seemed to be beyond him of late looking at his guests loren counted it off inwardly eight days only eight days since he had brought them here yet so much had overtaken them he could read changes in dave martyniuks face and in the tacit bonds that united him to the two riders then when the big man told his story loren began to understand and he marveled ceinwen flidais in pendaran and oweins horn hanging at daves side whatever power had been flowing through him when he chose to bring these five had been a true one and deep there had been five though not four there were only four in the room however and absence resonated among them like a chord and then was given voice time to start thinking about how to get her back kevin laine said soberly it was interesting loren noted that it was still kevin who could speak instinctively for all of them it was a hard thing but it had to be said we will do everything we can loren stated flatly but you must be told that if the black swan bore her north she has been taken by rakoth himself there was a pain in the mages heart despite his premonitions he had deceived her into coming given her over to the svart alfar bound her beauty as if with his own hands to the putrescence of avaia and consigned her to maugrim if there was a judgement waiting for him in the weavers halls jennifer would be someone he had to answer for did you say a swan the fairhaired rider asked levon ivors son whom he remembered from fully ten years ago as a boy on the eve of his fast a man now though young and bearing the always difficult weight of the first men killed under his command they were all so young he realized suddenly even aileron we are going to war against a god he thought and tasted a terrible doubt he masked it yes he said a swan avaia the black she was named long ago why do you ask we saw her levon said the evening before the mountains fire for no good reason that seemed to make it hurt even more kimberly stirred a little and they turned to her the white hair above the young eyes was still disturbing i dreamt her she said so did ysanne and with that there was another lost woman in the room for loren another ghost you and i will not meet again on this side of the night ysanne had told ailell on this side or on the other now it seemed she had gone so far it could not be compassed he thought about lokdal colans dagger seithrs gift oh the dwarves did dark things with power under their mountains kevin straining a little punctured the grimness of the silence ye gods and little fishes he exclaimed this is some reunion weve got to do better than this a good try dave martyniuk thought surprising himself with how well he understood what kevin was trying to do it wasnt going to get more than a smile though it wasnt access to inspiration came then with blinding suddenness uhuh he said slowly choosing his words cant do it kevin weve got another problem here he paused enjoying a new sensation as their concerned eyes swung to him then reaching into the pocket of his saddlebag on the floor beside him he withdrew something hed carried a long way i think youve misinterpreted the judgement in the mckay case he told kevin and tossed the travelstained evidence notes down on the table hell dave thought watching them all even levon even tore give way to hilarity and relief theres nothing to this a wide grin he knew was splashed across his face funny funny man kevin laine said with unstinted approval he was still laughing i need a drink kevin exclaimed we all do and you he pointed to dave havent met diarmuid yet i think youll like him even more than you like me which was a funny kind of dig dave thought as they rose to go and one hed have to think about he had a feeling though that this at least would turn out to be all right the five young men departed for the black boar kim however following an instinct that had been building since the coronation begged off and returned to the palace once there she knocked at a door down the corridor from her own she made a suggestion which was accepted a short while later in her own room it emerged that her intuitions on this sort of thing had not been affected at all by anything in fionavar matt sören closed the door behind them he and loren looked at each other alone for the first time that day oweins horn now the mage said finally as if concluding a lengthy exchange the dwarf shook his head that is deep he said will you try to wake them loren rose and crossed to the window it was raining again he put out his hand to feel it like a gift on his palm i wont he said at last but they might the dwarf said softly you have been holding yourself back havent you loren turned his eyes deepset under the thick gray eyebrows were tranquil but there was power in them still i have he said there is a force flowing through all of diem i think the strangers and our own we have to give them room they are very young matt sören said i know they are you are sure of this you are going to let them carry it i am sure of nothing the mage said but yes i am going to let them carry it we will be there silvercloak smiled then oh my friend he said we will have our battle never fear we must let the young ones carry it but before the end you and i may have to fight the greatest battle of them all you and i the dwarf growled in his deep tones by which the mage understood a number of things not least of which was love in the end the prince had had a great many pints of ale there were an infinity of reasons all good he had been named ailerons heir in the ceremony that afternoon this hed said is getting to be a habit the obvious line they were quoting it all over the black boar though he drained another pint oh an infinity of reasons he had eventually it seemed that he was alone and in his own chambers in the palace the chambers of prince diarmuid dan ailell the kings heir in brennin indeed it was far too late to bother going to sleep using the outer walls though with difficulty because of his arm he made his way to sharras balcony her room was empty on a hunch he looped two rooms along to where kim ford was sleeping it was hard work with the wound when he finally climbed up over the balustrade having to use the tree for awkward leverage he was greeted by two pitchers of icy water in the face no one deflected them either or the laughter of shalhassans daughter and the seer of brennin who were a long way down the road to an unexpected friendship mourning his fate somewhat the heir to the throne finally slipped back into the palace and made his way dripping to the room of the lady rheva one took comfort where one could at times like this he did in fact eventually fall asleep looking complacently down on him rheva heard him murmur as in a dream both of them she didnt really understand but he had praised her breasts earlier and she was not displeased kevin laine who might have been able to explain it to her was awake as well hearing a very long very private story from paul who could talk again it seemed and who wanted to when schafer was done kevin spoke himself also for a long time at the end of it they looked at each other dawn was breaking eventually they had to smile despite rachel despite jen despite everything chapter he came for her in the morning she thought she had sounded the depths of despair the night before when the swan had set down before the iron gates of starkadh from the air she had seen it a long way off a brutally superimposed black upon the white plateaus of the glaciers then as they flew nearer she had felt herself almost physically battered by the nature of it the huge piled slabs of windowless stone lightless unyielding fortress of a god in the darkness and the cold his servants had unbound her from the swan with grasping hands she had been draggedfor her legs were numbinto the bowels of starkadh where the odor was of decay and corrupting flesh even among the cold and the only lights gleamed a baneful green they had thrown her into a room alone and filthy exhausted she had fallen onto the one stained pallet on the icy floor it smelt of svart alfar she lay awake though shivering with the bitter cold for a long time when she did sleep it was fitfully and the swan flew through her dreams crying in cold triumph when she woke it was to the certitude that the terrors she had endured were but a shelf on the long way down and the bottom was invisible yet in the darkness but waiting she was going there it wasnt dark in the room now though there was a bright fire blazing on the opposite wall and in the middle of the room she saw a wide bed standing and with a constriction of the heart she recognized her parents bed a foreboding came upon her complete and very clear she was here to be broken and there was no mercy in this place there was a god and in that moment he was there he had come and she felt her mind shockingly peeled open like a fruit for an instant she fought it and then was enveloped stricken by the ease with which she was exposed she was in his fortress she was his it was made known to her she would be smashed on the anvil of his hate it ended as suddenly as it had begun her sight returned slowly blurred her whole body trembled violently she had no control over it she turned her head and saw rakoth she had vowed not to cry out but all vows in this place were as nothing before what he was from out of time he had come from beyond the weavers halls and into the pattern of the tapestry a presence in all the worlds he was but incarnate here in fionavar which was the first the one that mattered here he had set his feet upon the ice and so made the northland the place of his power and here he had raised up jagged starkadh and when it was fullwrought a claw a cancer in the north he had risen to the topmost tower and screamed his name that the wind might bear it to the tamed gods whom he feared not being stronger by far than any one of them rakoth maugrim the unraveller it was cernan the staghorned forest god who set the trees whispering in mockery of that claim and in mockery they named him otherwise sathain the hooded one and mörnir of the thunder sent lightning down to drive him from the tower and all the while the lios alfar newly wakened sang in daniloth of light and light was in their eyes their name and he hated them with an undying hate too soon had he attacked though the years may have seemed long to mortal men and indeed there were men in fionavar then for iorweth had come from oversea in answer to a dream sent by mörnir with sanction of the mother to found paras derval in brennin by the summer tree and his son had ruled and his sons son and then conary had ascended to the throne and in that time had rakoth come down in fury from the ice and after bitter war been beaten back not by the godsfor in the waiting time the weaver had spoken the first and only time he had done so he said that the worlds had not been woven to be a battleground for powers outside of time and that if maugrim were to be mastered it would be by the children with only mildest intercession of the gods and it had been so they had bound him under the mountain though he could not die and they had shaped the wardstones to burn red if he but assayed the smallest trial of his powers this time it would be otherwise now his patience would bear ripe fruit for the crushing for this time he had been patient even when the circle of the guardians had been broken he had lain still under rangat enduring the torment of the chain savoring it then to sweeten the taste of vengeance to come not until starkadh had been raised high again from the rubble of its fall had he come out from under the mountain and with red exploding triumph let them know he was free oh this time he would go slowly he would break them all one by one he would crush them with his hand his one hand for the other lay black and festering under rangat with ginserats unbroken chain around it still and for that as much as anything would they pay full fullest measure before they were allowed to die starting with this one who knew nothing he saw and so was trash a toy first flesh for his hunger and fair like the lios a presaging of his oldest desire he reached into her it was so easy in starkadh he knew her whole and began she had been right the bottom was so far down the truest depths of night lay beyond where she could ever have apprehended them to be facing hate in that moment a blank obliterating power jennifer saw that he was huge towering over her with one hand taloned gray like disease and the other gone leaving only a stump that forever dripped black blood his robe was black darker even somehow a swallowing of light and within the hood he wore there wasmost terribleno face only eyes that burned her like dry ice so cold they were though red like hellfire oh what sin what sin would they say had been hers that she be given over to this pride for she was proud she knew had been raised to be so but if that was it then be it so still here at the end at the fall of dark upon her a sweet child she had been strong a kindness in her nature if hidden behind caution not opening easily to other souls because she trusted only her own a pride in that which kevin laine first of all men had seen for what it was and laid open for her to understand before he stepped back to let her grow in that understanding a gift and not without pain for himself a long way off he was and what oh what did any of it matter in this place what did it matter why it didnt clearly except that at the end we only have ourselves anyway wherever it comes down so jennifer rose from the mattress on the floor her hair tangled filthy the odor of avaia on her torn clothes her face stained body bruised and cut and she mastered the tremor in her voice and said to him you will have nothing of me that you do not take and in that foul place a beauty blazed like light unleashed white with courage and fierce clarity but this was the stronghold of the dark the deepest place of his power and he said but i will take everything and changed his shape before her eyes to become her father and after that it was very bad you send your mind away she remembered reading once when youre tortured when youre raped you send your mind after a while into another place far from where pain is you send it as far as you can to love the memory of it a spar for clinging to but she couldnt because everywhere she went he was there there was no escape to love not even in childhood because it was her father naked on the bed with herher mothers bedand there was nothing clean in any place you wanted to be princess one james lowell whispered tenderly oh you are now you are let me do this to you and this you have no choice you always wanted this everything he was taking everything and through it all he had one hand only and the other the rotting stump dripped his black blood on her body and it burned wherever it fell then he started the changes again and again tracking her through all the corridors of her soul nowhere nowhere to even try to hide for father laughlin was above her then tearing her excoriating her penetrating whose gentleness had been an island all her life and after him she should have been prepared butoh mary mother what was her sin what had she done that evil could have power over her like this for now it was kevin brutal ravaging burning her with the blood of his missing hand nowhere for her to go where else was there in all the worlds she was so far so far and he was so vast he was all places everywhere and the only thing he could not do was reclaim his hand and what good would that do her oh what good it went on so long that time unhinged among the pain the voices the probing of her deepest places as with a trowel effortlessly once he was a man she did not know very tall dark a squarejawed face distorted now with hatred brown eyes distendedbut she did not know him she knew she did not know and then he was most shockingly himself at the end giant upon her the hood terribly thrown back and nothing there only the eyes endlessly only them raking her into shreds first sweet fruit of his long revenge it had been over for a long time before she became aware she kept her eyes closed she breathed she was still alive and no she told herself her soul on a spar in a darkest place the only light her own and so dim but no she said again within her being and opening her eyes she looked full upon him and spoke for the second time you can take them jennifer said her voice a scrape of pain but i will not give them to you and every one of them has two hands and he laughed for resistance here was a joy an intensifying of pleasure unimagined you shall he said give all of yourself for that i shall make of your will my gift she didnt understand but a time later there was someone else in the room and for a hallucinatory instant she thought it was matt sören when i leave this room said rakoth you are blods for he brought me a thing i coveted the dwarf who was not matt after all smiled there was a hunger in his expression she was naked she knew open you will give him everything he asks the unraveller said he need take nothing you will give and give again until you die he turned to the dwarf she pleases you blod could only nod his eyes were terrifying rakoth laughed again it was the laughter on the wind she will do anything you ask at mornings end you are to kill her though any way you like but she must die there is a reason and moving forward as he spoke sathain the hooded one touched her once with his one hand between the eyes and oh it was not over after all for the spar was gone the clinging place for what she was for jennifer he left the room he left her with the dwarf what was left of her blod wet his lips get up he said and she rose she could not do otherwise there was no spar there was no light beg me he said and oh what sin had it been even as the pleading spilled helplessly from her as his filthy abuse rained down and then real pain which excited himeven through it all she found something not a spar of light for there was no light anymore it was drowned but here at the last the very last thing was pride she would not scream she would not go mad unless he said for her to do so and if he did that it was still being taken after all she was not giving it but at length he tired and mindful of his instructions turned his mind to killing her he was inventive and it appeared after a time that pain did impose impossibilities pride can only carry one so far and golden girls can die so when the dwarf began to truly hurt her she started to scream after all no spar no light no name nothing left but the dark when the embassy from cathal entered the great hall of paras derval in the morning it was with a degree of stupefaction quite spectacular that they discovered their princess waiting to greet them kim ford was fighting a shameful case of the giggles sharras description of the probable reactions on the part of the embassy dovetailed so wonderfully with the reality that she knew with certainty that if she but glanced at the princess she would disgrace herself she kept her eyes carefully lowered until diarmuid strolled up the business with the water pitchers the night before had generated the sort of hilarity between the two women that cements a developing friendship they had laughed for a long time it was only afterwards that kim had remembered that he was a wounded man and perhaps in more ways than one he had also acted in the afternoon to save both sharras life and her pride and he had told them to crown his brother she should have remembered all of that she supposed but then she couldnt she simply could not be serious and sensitive all the time in any case the prince showed no traces of affliction at the moment using the drone of gorlaess voice as coveraileron had a little surprisingly reappointed the chancellorhe approached the two of them his eyes were clear very blue and his manner gave no hint of extreme intoxication a few hours before unless it lay in the slightly edged quality of his gaze i hope he murmured to sharra that yesterday discharged all your impulses to throw things at me i wouldnt count on it sharra said defiantly he was very good at this kim realized he paused to flick her with a brief sardonic glance as to an erring child before turning back to the princess that he said simply would be a pity adults do have better things to do and he moved off elegant and assured to stand beside his brother as the heir to the throne should kim felt obscurely chastened the water had been awfully childish on the other hand she abruptly recalled he had been climbing into their rooms he deserved whatever he got and more which though manifestly true didnt seem to count for much she still felt like a kid at the moment god hes cool she thought and felt a stirring of sympathy for her newest friend sympathy and because she was honest with herself the slightest flicker of envy in the meantime she was beginning to understand why gorlaes was still chancellor no one else would have put such a flourish into the necessary rituals that accompanied procedures of this sort or even remembered them for that matter he was still going and aileron was waiting with surprising patience when a second man in his own way as handsome as the first came up to her what asked levon without preamble or greeting direct as wind is the ring you have this was different it was the seer of brennin who looked up at him appraisingly the baelrath she answered quietly the warstone it is called it is of the wild magic he reacted to that forgive me but why are you wearing it because the last seer gave it to me she dreamt it on my hand he nodded his eyes widening gereint told me of such things do you know what it is not entirely do you levon shook his head no how should i it is far from my world lady i know the eltor and the plain but i have one thought may we talk after he really was extraordinarily attractive a restless stallion in the confines of the hall sure she said as it happened they never got the chance kevin standing with paul beside one of the pillars opposite the women was quietly pleased at how clearheaded he felt theyd done a lot of ale the night before paying close attention he saw gorlaes and then galienth the cathalian emissary conclude their formal speeches aileron rose i thank you he said levelly for coming here and for your gracious words about my father we are grateful to shalhassan that he saw fit to send his daughter and heir to take counsel with us it is a trust we honor and it is an emblem of the trust we all must share in the days to come the emissary who kevin knew was utterly clueless as to how sharra had got there nodded sage agreement the king still standing spoke again in this counseltaking all shall be granted speech for it cannot be otherwise it comes to me though that first right of address here belongs not to myself but rather to the eldest of us and the one whose people best know the fury of rakoth nabrendel of daniloth will you speak for the lios alfar for a moment after he had ended ailerons glance met that of paul schafer in an enigmatic exchange then all eyes were on the lios still limping from his wounds brendel advanced and with him for support came the one who had seldom left his side in three days tegid took brendel carefully forward and then withdrew unwontedly diffident and the lios alfar stood alone in the midst of them all his eyes the color of the sea under rain i thank you high king he said you do me and my people honor in this hall he paused the lios have never been known for brevity of discourse since time runs more slowly for us than for you but there is urgency upon us now and i will not be overlong two thoughts i have he looked around there were five guardian peoples named one thousand years ago before the mountain four are here today brennin and cathal the dalrei and the lios alfar none of our wardstones turned red yet rakoth is free we had no warning at all the circle was broken my friends and so he hesitated then spoke aloud the thought they all shared and so we must beware of eridu eridu kim thought remembering it from eilathens whirling vision wild beautiful land where lived a race of dark fierce violent men and the dwarves she turned to see matt sören gazing at brendel with an impassive face that is my first counsel the lios continued the other is more to the point if rakoth is but newly free then even with his power black starkadh cannot be raised again for some time he has announced himself too soon we must attack before that fortress anchors his might in the ice again i say to all of you that we should go forth from this council and carry war to the unraveller ourselves we bound him once and we will do so again he was a flame he fired them all with the burning in him even jaelle kevin saw had a blaze of color in her face no one said aileron rising again could have spoken more clearly my own thought what say the dalrei in the now charged ambience levon walked forward uncomfortable but not abashed and dave felt a surge of pride to hear his new brother say never in our long history have the riders failed the high kingdom in time of need i can say to you all that the sons of revor will follow the sons of conary and colan into the riik barrens and beyond against maugrim aileron high king i pledge my life to you and my sword do with them what you will the dalrei shall not fail you quietly tore stepped forward and i he said my life my sword stern and erect aileron nodded to them accepting it he looked a king kevin thought in that moment he came into it and cathal aileron asked turning to galienth but it was another voice that answered him a thousand years ago said sharra daughter of shalhassan heir of shalhassan the men of the garden country fought and died in the bael rangat they fought at celidon and among the tall trees of gwynir they were at sennett strand when the last battle began and at starkadh when it ended they will do as much again her bearing was proud before them all her beauty dazzling they will fight and die but before i accede to this counsel of attack there is another voice i would hear throughout cathal the wisdom of the lios alfar is a byword but so too and often it has been said with a woven curse is the knowledge of the followers of amairgen what say the mages of brennin i would hear the words of loren silvercloak and with a jolt of dismay kevin realized that she was right the mage hadnt said a thing he had barely made his presence known and only sharra had noticed aileron he saw seemed to have followed the same line of thought he wore a sudden expression of concern and even now loren was hesitating paul gripped kevins arm he doesnt want to speak schafer whispered i think im going to but whatever intervention he had planned was forestalled for there came then a loud hammering on the great doors at the end of the hall and as they turned startled the doors were opened and a figure walked with two of the palace guard between the high pillars towards them all he walked with the flat halting steps of absolute exhaustion and as he drew nearer kevin saw that it was a dwarf in the loud silence it was matt sören who stepped forward brock he whispered the other dwarf did not speak he just kept walking and walking as if by willpower alone until he had come the length of the great hall to where matt stood and there he dropped to his knees at last and in a voice of rawest grief cried aloud oh my king in that moment the one eye of matt sören truly became a window to his soul and in it they all saw a hunger unassuageable the deepest bitterest most forsaken longing of the heart why matt kim remembered asking after her tranced vision of calor diman on that first walk to ysannes lake why did you leave and now it seemed they were to learn a chair had been set for brock before the throne and he had collapsed into it it was matt who spoke though as they gathered around the two dwarves brock has a tale to tell matt sören said in his deep tones but i fear it will mean little to you unless i first tell you mine it seems the time for privacy is past listen then in the time of the passing of march king of the dwarves in his onehundredandfortyseventh year only one man could be found who would assay the test of full moon night by calor diman the crystal lake which is how we choose our king or have the powers choose him for us know you that he who would rule under the twin mountains must first lie at full moon night beside the lake if he lives to see the dawn and is not mad he is crowned under banir lok it is a dark ordeal though and many of our greatest warriors and artisans have been broken shards when the sun rose on their vigil kim began to feel the first pulsings of a migraine behind her eyes blocking it as best she could she focused hard on what matt was saying when march to whom i was sisterson died i gathered what courage i hada youthful courage it was i confessand according to the ritual i shaped a crystal of my own devising and dropped it as a token of intention in crystal lake on new moon night two weeks later the door from banir tal which is the one entrance to the meadow by calor diman was opened for me and then bolted behind my back matts voice had dropped almost to a whisper i saw the full moon rise above that lake he said i saw many things besides i did not go mad in the end i offered and was bound to the waters they crowned me king two days after it was building up to a grandfather of a headache kim realized she sat down on the steps before the throne and put her head in her hands listening straining to concentrate i did not fail by the lake matt said and they could all hear the bitterness but in every other way i did fail for the dwarves were not what once we had been not your fault brock murmured looking up oh my lord truly not your fault matt was silent a moment then shook his head in rejection i was king he said shortly just like that kevin thought he looked at aileron but matt was continuing two things the dwarves have always had he said a knowledge of secret things in the earth and a lust to know more in the last days of king march a faction formed within our halls around two brothers foremost of our artisans their desire which became a passion and then in the first weeks of my reign a crusade was to find and unlock the secrets of a dark thing the cauldron of khath meigol a murmur rose in the hall at that kim had her eyes closed there was a lot of pain and the light was hurting now lancing against her eyeballs she bent all her will to matt what he was saying was too important to lose because of a headache i ordered them to stop the dwarf said they did or so i thought but then i found kaen the older combing the oldest books again and his brother had gone away without my leave i grew wrathful then and in my folly and pride i called a gathering of all dwarves in the moot hall and demanded they choose between kaens desires and my own which were to let the black thing lie where it was lost while we moved from spells and powers of the old ways and sought the light i had been shown by the lake kaen spoke after me he said many things i do not care to repeat them before he lied brock exclaimed fiercely he lied and he lied again matt shrugged he did it well though in the end the dwarfmoot chose that he be allowed to go on with his search and they voted as well that all our energies should be bent to his aid i threw down my scepter matt sören said i left the moot hall and the twin mountains and i vowed i would not come back they might search for the key to this dark thing but not while i was king under banir lok god it was hurting her skin felt too tight her mouth was dry she pressed her hands to her eyes and held her head as motionless as she could wandering in the mountains and the wooded slopes that summer matt continued i met loren who was not yet silvercloak nor yet a mage though his training was done what passed between us is still matter for we two alone but in the end i told the one lie of my life to him because it involved a pain i had resolved to bear alone i told loren that i was free to become his source that i wanted nothing more and indeed there was already something woven into our coming together a night by calor diman had taught me to see that but it had given me something elsesomething i lied about loren could not have known it indeed until i met kimberly i thought no one who was not a dwarf could know this thing kim lifted her head feeling the movement like a knife they would be looking at her though so she opened her eyes for a moment trying to mask the nausea flooding over her when she thought no one was watching she closed her eyes again it was very bad and getting worse when the king is bound to crystal lake matt was explaining softly he is forever bound there is no breaking it he may leave but he is not free the lake is in him like another heartbeat and it never stops calling i lie down at night fighting this and rise up in the morning fighting it and it is with me through the day and the evening and will be until i die this is my burden and it is mine alone and i would have you know else i would not have spoken before you that it was freely chosen and is not regretted the great hall was silent as matt sören fixed each of them in challenge with his one dark eye all but kim who couldnt even look up now she was seriously wondering if she was going to pass out brock said matt at length you have tidings for us are you able to tell them now the other dwarf looked at him and noting the regained composure in his eyes kevin realized that there had been a second reason why matt had spoken first and at length within himself he still felt the deep hurting of sörens tale and it was as an echo of his own thought that he heard brock murmur my king will you not come back to us it has been forty years but matt was ready for it this time once only would he expose his soul i am he said source to loren silvercloak first mage to the high king of brennin kaen is king of the dwarves tell us your news brock brock looked at him then said i would not add to your burdens but i must tell you that what you say is untrue kaen reigns in banir lok but he is not king matt raised a hand do you tell me he has not slept by calor diman i do we have a ruler but not a king unless it be you my lord oh by seithrs memory matt sören cried how far have we fallen from what we were very far brock said in a harsh whisper they found the cauldron at the last they found it and restored it there was something in his voice something terrible yes matt said there was a price brock whispered kaen needed help in the end yes matt said again a man came metran was his name a mage from brennin and together he and kaen unlocked the power of the cauldron kaens soul i think had been twisted utterly by then there was a price and he paid it what price asked matt sören kim knew pain was splintering her mind he broke the wardstone of eridu said brock and delivered the cauldron to rakoth maugrim we did it my king the dwarves have freed the unraveller and casting his cloak over his face brock wept as if his heart would break in the uproar that followed the terror and the fury matt sören turned slowly very slowly as if the world were a calm still place and looked at loren silvercloak who was looking back at him we will have our battle loren had said the night before never fear and now most terribly it was clear what that battle would be her head was being torn apart there were white detonations within her brain she was going to scream what is it a voice whispered urgently at her side a woman but not sharra it was jaelle who knelt beside her she was too agonized to feel surprise leaning on the other woman she whispered on a thinstretched note dont know my head as if somethings crashing ini dont open your eyes jaelle commanded look at the baelrath she did the pain was almost blinding but she could see the stone on her hand throbbing with red fire pulsing to the rhythm of the explosions behind her eyes and looking into it her hand held close to her face kim saw something else then a face a name written in fire a room a crescendo of dark of dark and jennifer she screamed oh jen no she was on her feet the ring was a wild burning uncontrollable thing she staggered but jaelle supported her hardly knowing what she was doing she screamed again loren i need you kevin was there kim what she shook her head tore away from his touch she was blind with agony she could scarcely speak dave she scraped paul come on the circle now there was so much urgency they seemed to move so slowly and jen jen oh jen come on she screamed again then they were around her the three of them and loren and matt unquestioning were beside them and she held up the ring again instinctively and opening herself her mind cutting through the claws of pain she found loren and linked to him and thenoh a giftjaelle was there as well tapping into the avarlith for her and with the two of them as ballast as bedrock she cast her mind her soul to its farthest most impossible compassing oh far and there was so much dark between so much hate and oh so very great a power in starkadh to stay her but there was also a spar of light a dying spar so nearly gone but it was there and kim reached with everything she had with all she was to the lost island of that light and she found jennifer oh love she said inside and aloud oh love im here come the baelrath was unleashed it was so bright they had to close their eyes against the blazing of that wildest magic as kimberly pulled them out and out all the way out with jennifer held to the circle only by her mind the spar pride last dying light and love then as the shimmering grew in the great hall and the humming before the crossing time as they started to go and the cold of the space between worlds entered the five of them kim drew one breath again and cried the last desperate warning not knowing oh not if she was heard aileron dont attack hes waiting in starkadh and then it was cold cold and completely dark as she took them through alone
