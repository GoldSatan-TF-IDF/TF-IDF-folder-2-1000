the confession charles todd chapter the essex marshes summer the body rolled in the current gently as if still alive it was facedown only the back and hips visible it had been floating that way for some time the men in the ancient skiff had watched it for a quarter of an hour as if half expecting it to rise up and walk away before their eyes hes dead right enough one said one of ours do you think this far up the hawking its a german spy the second man said nodding as if that explained everything bound to be i say leave him to the fish we wont know who he is until we pull him out will we the third said and leaned out to touch the corpse with the boat hook here the first man cried out as if this were sacrilege the body bobbed a little under the weight of the hook he doesnt care the third man said why should you still and all turning the hook a little he put the end under the dead mans collar and pulled under the impetus of the hook the corpse came out of the reeds obediently as if called and floated toward the skiff until the shoulder of his dark watersodden uniform bumped lightly into the hull a bloody officer hes been shot the third man said as the body shifted look at that turn him over the second man ordered after peering at the back of the mans head with some difficulty that was done and all three stared into the dead face flaccid from hours in the water none of our fishermen the second man went on dont know him atall you the first man shook his head i dunno theres something familiar about him i just cant put a name to him lets have a look the third man said and reached out to clutch the front of the sodden uniform pulling him close enough to thrust his fingers into the mans breast pocket he came away with a wallet stuffed with pound notes he whistled in surprise the second man was already stretching out a hand for the trouser pocket nearest him swearing as the skiff dipped alarmingly and he had to kneel in the bottom of the boat as the skiff steadied he managed to dig into the wet cloth and extract more pound notes ill be damned opening the wallet the third man searched for identification ah he pulled out a card from behind the wet notes squinting a little he read justin fowler london whats he doing here dead then i told you a german spy youve got spies on the brain the third man snapped get over it there had been a spy scare not long before several waiters in london restaurants bore german names and it was reported to the authorities that these men had been listening to private conversations while guests dined looking for information to be sent back to berlin nothing had come of it as far as anyone in this part of essex could discover mr newly had not been back to the city to visit his daughter and thus the source of this bit of news had dried up before the spies had been arrested shot or deported allowing for considerable speculation in the rowing boat at night much had been said about what should be done with such men if they were caught out here far from london who do you suppose killed him the first man ventured someone who followed him from london its not likely to have been anyone from the airfield ive never seen them this far upriver most likely whoever shot him shoved him into the water out of sight out of mind the third man counted the wet notes a second time theres almost a hundred pounds here flotsam and jetsam the second man said we found it we keep it like a shipwreck he gazed round at the desolate sweep of water and marsh and gray sky as if half expecting to see a ships hull half sunk in the deeper reaches beyond it was an unfortunate reference they knew all of them what a shipwreck could lead to what do we do with mr fowler the first man asked dubiously if we bring him in well have to summon the police someone is bound to want to know whats become of his money tow him out to sea let him wash ashore somewhere else the third man said scrabbling in the bottom of the skiff for a length of rope this he proceeded to loop around the dead mans neck and then he ordered pick up yon oars i cant row and pull at the same time now can i the first man sat where he was were towing him nowhere until theres some understanding here the money is evenly divided i saw him first the second man ventured finders fee the hell with that the third man retorted share and share alike i say and then theres no room for one of us to feel denied and start trouble were all in this together if one must hang well all hang if i walk home today with this much money in my pocket my wife will ask questions what do i say then the first man demanded shell start the trouble mark my words then dont march home with the money stuffed in your pocket you fool put it by and use it a little at a time you dont go waving it about first thing think of your old age or your daughters wedding when a bit of the ready will come in handy this poor devil doesnt need pounds wherever hes gone to and its a sheer waste to let the sea have it weve done nothing wrong have we we didnt kill him we didnt leave him here to be found by a schoolboy looking to fish for his dinner we just took what hed got no use for simple as that half persuaded the first man said still ive never kept a secret from my wife thatll take some doing he picked up his oar from the bottom of the skiff and put it in the water the third man laughed youve never needed to lie before now theres a reason they began to pull against the incoming tide heading for the mouth of the inlet towing the body behind them the first man scanned the shoreline as they passed i dont see anyone about looking this way do you think they can see whats at the end of the rope it just appears that weve forgot to bring the rope inboard what if he comes back again the first man asked glancing over his shoulder he was finding it a struggle to row against the current with that sluggish weight pulling at the rope attached to it he wont the third man promised he hasnt been in the water all that long you can tell the fishes havent truly got at him yet but they will and no one will be the wiser but there he was wrong chapter london summer sergeant hampton had brought the man to rutledges office saying only inspector rutledge will help you sir before vanishing back down the passage the visitor was a walking skeleton pale except for his dark hair and his painridden dark eyes sitting down gingerly in the chair that rutledge offered he seemed to feel the hardness of the seat in his bones for he moved a little as if hoping to find a more comfortable spot my name is wyatt russell he began in a voice thinned by illness im dying of cancer and i want to clear my conscience before i go i killed a man in and got away with it i want to confess to that murder now there wont be time to try me and hang me but at least youll be able to close the file and ill be able to sleep again rutledge considered him people confessed for a good many reasons not the least of which was to salve their conscience before facing a more lasting justice than that of the crown sometimes they confessed to protect someone else i was in france in he said after a moment if this is where the murder occurred you should speak to the army not to scotland yard it isnt an army matter russell replied shortly perhaps we should start at the beginning if im to make use of your confession where do you live mr russell i have a house in the essex marshes ive lived there all my life until the war i have money of my own and have never needed to seek employment was the yard called in to investigate this murder or was it handled by the essex police the man smiled i really cant say i didnt hang about to see in that case can you be certain you killed this man he could have been wounded and recovered yes im absolutely certain you see hes my cousin id have known if hed cropped up again later his name iswasjustin fowler not to speak ill of the dead but we had our differences he and i and in the end they were serious enough that i had to make a decision that doesnt excuse killing him i realize that im simply trying to set the record straight was a woman involved russell was disconcerted a woman ah a love triangle sorry to disappoint you but it wasnt that simple and im not prepared to go into any more detail suffice it to say i killed him and got rid of the body it was during the war people were enlisting going to work in the factories a time of upheaval change no one noticed when he went missing the more we learn about a murder the sooner we can determine who is guilty and who isnt establishing motive is an important part of an inquiry but ive just told youive confessed to killing him i can show you how and where and what became of the body i cant believe you need any more than that his face had flushed adding ugly blotches of red to his gray complexion youve come to the police rutledge said wondering what was behind the mans sudden anger of your own free will now its necessary for the yard to look into your confession and draw its own conclusions a motive will tell us to what extent you are guilty of this crime what role the victim played in antagonizing you damn it man dead is dead he glanced around as if expecting to find answers in the plain walls and dusty window glass or was he searching for a way to retreat from what hed confessed to rutledge thought it likely and russells next words proved him right i shouldnt have come it was selfish of me i just didnt want to die with this knowledge on my soul his gaze returned to rutledge if you cant help me ill leave and we can forget i ever walked through your door youve admitted to murder he began have i the mans mouth quirked my doctor will tell you its just the morphine speaking i have hallucinations you know its difficult sometimes to tell true from false he rose to go im sorry to have taken up your time mr rutledge dying is not something to relish it is something to endure no matter what the poets may tell you he reached for the back of the chair to steady himself then said i doubt well meet again he went out the door without looking back a man in great pain walking upright by an effort of will rutledge thought pride was sometimes the last vanity to go after a moment rutledge stood up and went after him is there somewhere you must go or will you have lunch with me he asked as he caught russell up lunch i can hardly swallow a mouthful of tea without nausea it doesnt matter id like your company russell considered him why should you wish to sit across a table from this gaunt wasteland of a man if you think youll convince me to change my mind about coming here youre wrong i have a strong will it has kept me going longer than my doctors thought possible he smiled at that transforming his face to a shadow of what it might have been before his illness i was in the war rutledge said simply i have seen death before after a moment russell nodded im at the marlborough they do a decent roast lamb with mint sauce i can enjoy the sauce still the marlborough would not have been rutledges choice he had gone there last with meredith channing it wasnt a memory he cared to revisit but he had a feeling that if he suggested another restaurant he could well lose wyatt russell the hotel was not very far away but rutledge drove them there and russell sat beside him in silence he got out of the motorcar with some difficulty but rutledge wisely stayed where he was offering no assistance inside reception was busy but the dining room was still mostly empty since it was early for a meal they were conducted to a table in a corner and russell sat down on the damask upholstered chair with a sigh of relief i should take a cushion with me these days sitting on wood has become a trial for me will you have something to drink its my treat because i shall be able then to set the rules as you wish ill have a whisky hoping to loosen russells tongue russell nodded gave the order for two and looked around i dont know half these people before the war i could have put a name to most of them in london often then were you i was young unmarried just down from cambridge full of myself full of the future in love essex was dull boring london was busy exciting if i even thought about it life seemed to stretch ahead in an endless golden haze and i expected to be happy forever or at least looking back on thats how i recall it now it may not have been such a blissfully happy time but it does no harm to think so were you in london then i was i seem to remember it in the same way were you in the war oh yes rushing to sign up before it was over chafing at the bit afraid the kaiser would fold before id learned how to fight him properly writing letters home from training filled with patriotism and an eagerness to kill a people id never met well i did know a few germans at cambridge nice enough chaps i didnt picture them when i was hot to shoot the hun they werent the sort to bayonet belgian babies and rape belgian women my cousin was fond of one of them in fact but the man was called home shortly before hostilities were declared and we dont know if he survived the fighting or not if you were in the war how is it that you were in essex to commit murder yes thats a bit confusing isnt it i was sent to london with dispatches the house had been closed up but i went down to have a look at it fowler was there we quarreled opportunity presented itself and temptation did the rest there was a temporary airfield nearby zeppelin watch and night flights the only risk was that if the body was discovered one of the new chaps would be blamed for what happened but apparently i was lucky no one stumbled over him were you married when you went to war ah too many questions rutledges whisky came still probing he said i decided not to marry the girl i thought i was in love with and a good thingi think she loved the uniform more than she loved the man the marriage wouldnt have lasted and he was reminded again of meredith channing whose marriage had lasted on the cold ashes of duty russell studied rutledge for a moment over the rim of his glass did it turn out well your war not at all well yes it seldom does i expect i found that killing people wasnt to my liking after all but i did my duty to my men and to my country i was damned glad when it was over all the same did being a soldier make it any easier killing your cousin there was a moments hesitation the policeman again do you never leave him at home it must be a bloody nuisance at dinner parties wondering what subtle undercurrent of meaning there might be when someone asks you to pass the salt rutledge laughed what made you decide to join the police why not become a lawyer instead if you were hellbent on punishing evildoers my father was a solicitor i considered his profession and then decided against it the waiter brought their lamb and russell inspected it im hungry enough to chew the table but swallowing is another matter he sopped up a little of the sauce with a corner of bread and tasted it ah yes i remember why i always liked this so much they spoke of other things during the meal and rutledge waited until they had finished their pudding before asking why did you decide to come to the yard in person rather than to write a letter that would be opened after your death he had once known a murderer who did just that the policeman is back is he we could have been great friends save for him all right i suppose you deserve the answer to one question it seemed rather cowardly to tell someone after the fact i suppose i had a religious upbringing of sorts and realized that to confess was not enough to admit wrongdoing and to show contrition while i was alive had more meaning somehow and do you feel better for having unburdened your soul russell frowned do you know i thought i would ive kept my secret for a very long time or so it seemed to me screwing up the courage to come to the yard while i could still manage the effort was a test of my intent my strength of character as it were but it wasnt quiteas id expected would you have been happier if id clapped you in irons and taken you to trial would hanging make a difference i had rather not hang although it would shorten a lingering death and perhaps i felt after a fashion that my crime was not as horrific as it had seemed at the time thats the war speaking of course when one has killed thousandswell hundreds although it sometimes seemed like thousandswhats one more life taken but do you know it does make a difference i think it matters because i had a choice you see i could have not killed him and yet i did and so i have come to you to confess and set the record straight only he added frowning at the remnants of his pudding it hasnt been set straight has it are you quite certain that you must know more about why i killed him it will have to come out if there is an inquiry youll be questioned and if you fail to answer those questions satisfactorily then we will go in search of the answers ourselves it will not be pleasant i hadnt expected it to be pleasant russell told him i had just not anticipated that it would be so very personal or public least of all that anyone else would have to be involved with any luck i shall be dead before it reaches that stage tell the policeman to mind his own business until then ive no doubt youll not let this matter drop but once im not there to answer your questions you wont be able to do any harm he signaled the waiter and then said to rutledge im very tired its one of the curses of my condition i shant be able to see you out is there anything that i can do help you to your room thank you no i can still manage that rutledge rose and held out his hand if you change your mind at any point you know where to find me yes i do thank you inspector rutledge turned to walk away and russell said actuallythere is one thing you might do for me facing russell again rutledge asked what is it pray for my soul it might help a little m otoring back to the yard rutledge considered wyatt russell if hed been telling the truth that hed come to confess a murder that was weighing on his soul why had he been so reluctant to tell the whole truth and not just a part of it was someone else involved and that was very likely the answer but then why not simply continue to live with the secret and die without confessing it when russell learned he couldnt have it both ways he had retreated from that confession was that someone else a partner in the crime or the reason for it as he got out of his motorcar at the yard he was examining a map of essex in his head north of the thames north of kent on the other side of that river it was threaded with marshes the coastline a fringe of inlets and a maze of tidal rivers that isolated the inhabitants in a world little changed with the passage of time until the war the people of that part of essex had known little about the rest of their county much less their country content with their own ways in no need of modern conveniences or interference in a life that contented them as essex moved inland it was a different story entirely with towns villages and a plethora of roads basildon chelmsford colchester might as well be the antipodes as far as the marsh dwellers were concerned as distant to their way of thinking as london itself and rutledge nodding to the sergeant on duty and mounting the stairs to his office was certain that a murder in villages even in that part of the countryside wouldnt go unnoticed unless of course russell had been very clever indeed at disposing of an unwanted body something had been said about an airfield rutledge walked on past his office and went to find constable greene who had served with a squadron based near caen greene a spare affable man with unruly fair hair that to his chagrin curled when the weather was damp was thirtythree coming late to police work after the armistice he had decided to join the metropolitan police and it wasnt long before he had come to the attention of the yard before the war he had owned a bicycle shop in reading that had just begun to cater to motorcars when hostilities broke out he had been mad to fly but heights had made him ill and so he had maintained and repaired the machines he loved in the constant struggle to find parts to keep his pilots flying he knew most of the other airfields in france he might well know one in essex looking up as rutledge came toward his desk he smiled afternoon sir what can i do for you id like to borrow your memory from the war he described what little russell had told him about the airfield and asked can you possibly place it greene frowned after a moment he said there were several out there at a guess id say youre looking at furnham on the river hawking they had a good deal of trouble there not the least from locals wanting them out what sort of trouble wind for one thing and lowlying mists on the water and then there was the burning of hay ricks sending smoke across the field petty theft quarrels among the men posted there and their neighbors mind you many of the local girls didnt object to the newcomers that mayve had something to do with it from what i was told furnham is fairly isolated change wouldnt be welcomed what became of the airfield when the war ended i expect it was turned back to the farmer who owned it rutledge nodded makes sense all right thank you greene anything come up about furnham i cant say id mind going there to see it for myself some mention was made of the airfield over lunch i was curious rutledge said easily and went to his office he debated whether to initiate an official inquiry into the murder that russell had confessed to and then decided against it he wasnt completely certain about the mans motive in coming to the yard but his own curiosity had been aroused and it would do no harm he told himself to look into it unofficially if more information turned up he could bring in the yard two hours later the reports on his desk finished he went to somerset house to look up justin fowler and wyatt russell chapter set on the banks of the thames below the strand somerset house had become the repository of records for births and deaths and marriages in england and wales named for a tudor palace long since demolished it had been designed with the intent to collect in one place offices of government formerly scattered across london from inland revenue to the admiralty nelson was said to have had rooms there although it was unlikely rutledge spent threequarters of an hour looking for justin fowler the name had been passed down through three generations in one family and there were six more unrelated fowlers who could also have been the murder victim finally settling on justin arthur ambrose fowler who was only two years older than russell appeared to be he discovered that there was no date of death registered and no marriage wyatt russell was easier to find again with no date of death but he had been married to a louisa mary harmon who had died barely a year later in childbirth there appeared to be a connection between fowler and russelltheir grandmothers shared the same maiden namesudbury and from what rutledge could determine going back through records the women were cousins fowlers parents died in the same year and within two days of each other when fowler was eleven russell had been born at rivers edge in essex fowler in colchester he spent another half hour looking at various branches of the family but found nothing else that seemed to connect the two men in any way thanking the clerk for his assistance rutledge went back to the yard to find a map of essex rivers edge was not shown which very likely meant it was the name of a house just as russell had indicated and not a village but he did find furnham at the mouth of the river hawking set on a hook of land that curled out into the water like the thames the blackwater and the crouch zeppelin navigators used the hawking to find their way to london for raids but unlike the thames the blackwater and the crouch the hawking had never become popular with yachtsmen or possessed a coastguard station at its mouth until the airfield had been built it had probably remained little changed for hundreds of years so far it appeared the story russell had told seemed to hold up where was justin fowler alive and well in colchester or even cornwall for that matter or was he dead his body as yet undiscovered rutledge considered the upcoming weekend hed promised his sister frances to take her to a concert on friday eveningshe was an accomplished pianist in her own right like their mother and the program included liszt one of her favorite composers but once that duty was done the rest of the weekend was his it turned out not to be as simple as hed expected frances enjoyed the concert immensely as well as the light supper hed arranged when it was over finishing her wine she said ian do you think we could drive into kent tomorrow to call on melinda melinda crawford was the elderly woman who had been a friend of rutledges parents rutledge had known her since he was a small boy fascinated by the treasures in her house for she had lived in india until her husbands death and traveled widely thereafter collecting whatever struck her fancy from jewels to swords to ivory figures of chinese immortals he had avoided melinda since the war although he had been thrust into her company from time to time by unexpected events she knew him too well and he feared that she would read in his face more than he cared for her to know about his war as a child she had survived the great indian mutiny and having seen death at first hand she was not as easily put off by his assurances that he was whole if anyone could have understood about hamish macleod it was undoubtedly melinda crawford and yet rutledge couldnt bring himself to confide in her he still carried the shame of hamishs death and that was something he could not confess to anyone much less the widow of an officer twice decorated for gallantry i was thinking of driving into essex instead he said lightly his sister put down her glass and turned to face him essex she said and he could almost read the list of names passing through her mind as she considered their acquaintances failing to come up with a possible connection she added where in essex and in her eyes he could see speculation that her unmarried brother had met someone of interest he laughed the marshes out along the river hawking then its related to yard business no put it down to curiosity intrigued she said is lunch on offer if it is ill go with you ill do my best but i have no idea what well find in the way of likely places to dine she considered the warning ill take the risk she answered finally and so it was that at eight on the saturday morning he arrived at his sisters housewhich had belonged to their parentsand found her dressed for the country and ready to go as he held the door of the motorcar for her she said the day doesnt look promising it was true clouds had banked over the city and as they drove east toward essex the clouds seemed to follow at their heels the brightness far out over the north sea dimmed and by the time they were well out into the countryside the sky was slate gray over their heads and the increasingly marshy landscape was colorless and drab with no features of interest it wasnt suitable for cultivation or pasturage and rutledge decided the people who lived farther out on the hook of land that followed the length of the river must make their living from the sea frances said is this where your curiosity is taking you rutledge found the turning he was after call it a sudden and irresistible desire to explore i dont know this part of essex then how did you know that turning was there ah as it happens i was looking at a map just here the river was out of sight beyond the widening stretch of marsh grass and a few windstunted trees but they could see it glinting like pewter from time to time and knew it was there moving silently and swiftly the current dark and smooth im not sure i like this place frances said after a while gazing out toward the river whatever possessed you to want to come here curiosity he answered i told you yes well you must be in desperate need of entertainment couldnt we have explored in surrey or perhaps oxfordshire there are some lovely restaurants in surrey and oxford as well i think youll change your mind before the day is out he said but he had a feeling that she wouldnt the road had begun to narrow before he saw the gates he thought there had probably been more traffic here during the war but now the verges were overgrown and uneven the tall stone posts were overgrown as well a rusted chain stretched between them to bar visitors a handsome pair of stone pineapples the symbol of hospitality capped the posts a vine had twisted itself around the pineapple on the left while the one on the right was chipped and white with bird droppings his first thought was that someone had shot off the top it had that sort of look to it drawing up in the shallow space before the gates rutledge said wait here do you mind id like to explore a little i can just see the roof of a house behind those trees is that where youre going yes ill come with you she replied id rather not sit here alone i could almost believe eyes are watching our every move you could hide half a battalion in that grass across the way i should have thought german spies by the dozens would have found this to be a wonderful landing place how far is the north sea do you think a few miles im sure this part of essex was heavily patrolled by the coastguard for that very reason he said im told there was an aerodrome somewhere out here theyd have been doubly watchful are you certain you want to trek through that tangle she smiled of course i dont he helped her out of the motorcar and lifted the heavy chain for her to pass under it they tramped through the high grass and weeds rutledge leading the way to break a path for her and moved up what had once been the drive briars caught at her skirts and pulled at the hem of her short jacket really ian she said at one point but they followed the drive for perhaps a quarter of a mile before they reached the trees walking through them was easier but the undergrowth hadnt been cleared for some time and at one point a fallen tree blocked their way helping her over it he looked beyond where they were standing and realized that he could see the house clearly now it was tall brick built with peaked roofs long windows facing him and an array of chimneys he could just pick out the swing of the drive before the main door the windows were blank gray spaces against a gray sunless day giving the house an abandoned look by the time they reached the broad steps up to the black painted door it was clear that the house hadnt been lived in for some time looking up at the date incised into a plain scroll set into stone above the door frances read its really a rather handsome house isnt it what a pity that its been left to wrack and ruin i wonder what happened to the family that lived here the heir probably died in the war sadly yes very likely a pair of unclipped bushy evergreens grew to either side of the steps and he pushed his way through the scraggly branches of the one to his left in order to peer through the nearest window dust sheets he reported but theres a wide entry with doors to either side and a staircase rising just beyond elegant ceiling what i can see of it from the condition of the drive and the closed look to the house it was clear that wyatt russell was not living here now and it was obvious the house hadnt been reopened after the war why had he given essex as his address if he was currently living in the marlborough hotel not just staying a few days there rejoining frances rutledge added shall we walk round to the water there may be a bench or two where we can sit and admire the view im withholding all expectations she said dubiously but lead on a broad terrace faced the river with long windows looking out to it and large urns marking either side of the steps whatever had once been planted in them they were empty now from here across the overgrown lawn running down to the rivers edge the view was spectacular a broad sweep to marshes on the far side that seemed to come alive with color when the sun broke through the clouds for a moment on the rotting boards of a landing stage at the bottom of the lawn a heron stared down at his reflection in the mirrored darkness of the silently moving water then in one swift fluid action his neck stretched down and came up with a small fish silvery in his beak and then the sun went behind the clouds once more and the view seemed diminished but there were neither chairs nor benches what a lovely spot frances said standing beside her brother i can imagine sitting here on a summers evening watching the water and talking to friends did you know the people who lived here is that why you came no he turned to look up at the house scanning the windows but if there was someone inside on the upper floors heor shecouldnt be seen from the terrace below heavy drapes had been drawn across the panes on this side of the house their faded colors somehow sad after a time rutledge turned and they walked back the way theyd come halfway up the long drive frances said ian ive been meaning to ask you have you seen meredith channing recently she appears to have gone away only the other day maryanne browning was asking if id had any news of her rutledge knew where meredith channing had gone but he shook his head scotland perhaps he said there was mention of a brotherinlaw there yes that must be it frances said but there was a touch of doubt in her voice at the gates he inspected the pillars the name of the house hadnt been incised here but he was nearly certain it would have been rivers edge unless there was another house ahead in the motorcar once more they drove on in another mile or so a dead tree lifted bare twisted arms toward the sky and just beyond there was a church a short tower rising from the plain upright brick facade early victorian at a guess rutledge thought looking up at the tower and not a very happy example of village church at that he wondered what his godfather the architect david trevor would make of it and he smiled the sign between the porch and the road was almost preraphaelite in its design and would have done justice to an arthurian legend it read in elegant letters set out in gold leaf the church of st edward the confessor rutledge regarded that with wry amusement very fitting he thought beneath were the times of services and the name of the pastor morrison below that was a quotation from the psalms i will lift mine eyes unto the hills what is it doing out here in the middle of nowhere frances asked as they drew even with the signboard and theres no rectory no churchyard how very odd it was not strictly speaking ugly but there was something about the church that stirred the voice in rutledges head hamish had been quiet all morning and now he was a restive presence in the back of rutledges mind rutledge tried to ignore him he said to his sister perhaps the village was moved yes that could be of course but surely not the churchyard as well he braked the engine idling a gust of wind hit the motorcar shaking it it may serve a scattered population it looks as if its been exiled she remarked then turning to her brother she asked ian what brought you here and dont tell me again that its curiosity actually it was that much is true i wanted to have a look at this part of essex then it has to do with an inquiry more a bit of intuition heaped on suspicion and doubt above their heads wind swirled around the tower and the clapper touched the mouth of the bell with a sound almost like that of a distant buoy the church was in good repair it appeared that there was a priest who conducted services here but who were his parishioners the house theyd passed was too far away and there was no sign of a village in any direction it makes me sad to look at that church is there anything beyond here lets find out driving on once more they traveled at least another three miles before they reached the first outposts of a village which he realized surely meant that the deserted house theyd seen must indeed be rivers edge there were no stragglers one minute nothing but tall grass sweeping in waves before the wind and then the first dwelling appeared square brick and squat beneath its roof seven more bungalows and they were in the high street where on the left others were interspersed among the shops beyond stood a small twostorey inn and where the road curved to the north a large plane tree towered over the cottages nearest to it to the righthand side of the road other buildings stood with their backs to the river among them what appeared to be a schoolhouse and just after the pub he glimpsed the water stairs on the strand beyond there were fishing boats drawn up waiting for the tide to turn one or two were flatterbottomed craft used to hunt waterfowl although it was a saturday afternoon the village street was deserted and as they reached the bend in the road rutledge recognized the hook of land hed seen on the map at the yard the wind had continued to pick up and as they followed the bend that took the road inland the motorcar swayed with the force of it here the village ended with a house or two like afterthoughts and to the right beyond the last of the houses the road rose a little telling him that this hook of land was higher than the village and therefore possessed better drainage in proof of it he saw farms ahead and counted three of them before the road turned inland again and the marshy ground reappeared in the distance which of the farms had been the site of the airfield there were no derelict buildings to tell him which had been commandeered and all three offered broad stretches of pasturage and a few fields of corn for livestock that were flat enough for aircraft to take off and land ideal then for a small squadron of night fighters and zeppelin patrols whats more it was right on the north sea with excellent visibility when the sea mists werent rolling in frances was saying did you notice theres no church to be seen in the village and no churchyard how odd where do they bury their dead and theres no real hotel is there only that tiny inn it cant have more than six rooms and most likely only four and the way people stared at us they arent used to strangers are they i doubt well be dining here after all she was right he thought there was no welcome in furnham he turned the motorcar and drove back to the village a few weathered sheds stood back above the tide line beyond where the boats were drawn up and a track led out to them he pulled up the brake and got out frances came to join him and quickly put her hand on her hat here the sweep of the wind was fierce she hurried back to the motorcar saying you arent walking down to the water are you its about to rain no he could see all he needed to see from where he stood the windwhipped water was frothy as if seething just below the surface looking over his shoulder he could see that rain was imminent and with it would come colder air he stayed for a moment longer watching the boats rock as the tide toyed with them beyond was the narrow estuary and a line of mild turbulence where the river met the sea returning to the motorcar he drove on behind the pub he glimpsed a seawall where larger craft were tied up bobbing at anchor their masts swaying slowing again he watched as a man in a heavy fishermans sweater and wool cap came up between two houses moving briskly along what must be a path without looking in their direction he turned toward the shops and disappeared into one of them i feel overwhelmed by the warmth of our reception frances commented wryly are we leaving do you think not just yet rutledge answered he wasnt sure what hed hoped to find here in furnham whatever it was he was still unsatisfied there were others on the street now and the feeling that the village must be as deserted as rivers edge lessened but the air of friendliness often encountered in summer was still missing frances was a very attractive young woman and yet none of the men had even glanced her way it was almost as if they wished to discourage any excuse for personal contact hed no more than thought that when a short heavyset man coming their way stopped and said brusquely looking for someone not can i help you or new to furnham are you actually rutledge answered pulling up we were wondering where we might have lunch the man considered them we dont run to restaurants he replied not here you might find something more to your liking back the way youve come but there was nothing back the way theyd come not for miles while over the mans shoulder rutledge could see what appeared to be a small shop of no particular distinction perhaps but most certainly catering to the local people he thanked the man who walked on without another word rutledge pulled to the far side of the street indicating the shop we might try our luck here he suggested not precisely the michelin guide but we could do with a cup of tea dont you think ian frances said quietly i really feel we ought to take the nonetoosubtle hint and be on our way in fact ive rather lost any appetite i might have had quite he answered but nodded toward the shop as two women stepped out and turned up the street not looking at them all the same it could be two hours or more before we find a suitable restaurant lets take our courage in our hands and go inside those women seem to have survived the experience frances laughed you are impossibly optimistic coming around to open her door for her he added surely not everyone in furnham is churlish there could even be a friendly smile inside that door but as they stepped into what turned out to be a small tearoomcumbakery he caught the quick look the woman behind the counter gave them and watched her mouth turn down as if she resented their intrusion it was cozy enough inside out of the wind pretty blue checkered linen covered the tables and the chairs were painted white a large mural along the back wall showed the sea on a sunny day the water as blue as the sky and white puffs of cloud sailing along the horizon a man and a woman sat on the strand a picnic basket between them while three children splashed in the water or built sand castles with the aid of a small green bucket and a white shovel it was unexpectedly good workmanship a local artist or someone from the flying field the woman was saying sorry love were just closing in spite of the friendly words her voice was cold the three elderly women sitting in the far corner turned to look in rutledges direction taking in what his sister was wearing and then turning away as if theyd lost interest i expect he said pleasantly that you could provide a cup of tea for two travelers who have lost their way he ushered frances to a table and stood waiting for the woman to answer with poor grace she said a cup of tea then frances was about to protest saw her brothers expression and sat down in the chair he was holding for her as he joined her at the table to await their tea frances said quietly this is yard business isnt it without denying it rutledge looked out the window at the buildings straggling along the riverfront across the way one he thought was indeed a small schoolhouse and another appeared to be a shoemakers shop a third a chandlers furnham gave him the impression that it hadnt changed since queen victorias day and its inhabitants seemed to be intent on keeping it that way and yet the airfield must have provided the decent if overgrown road that he had followed out here keeping to the river most of the way and turning only when it opened into the sea beyond there would have been officers to house and the pilots had there also been an antiaircraft battery the crews who kept the aircraft flying the men who fed all of them saw to their needs maintained the fields they used for runways and kept up the buildings they lived in must at a guess have doubled the population of furnham they must also have brought with them the breath of an outside world the local people were so intent on shutting out yet there was no sign as far as he could tell that the airfield had ever existed as if on the day the war ended those who had lived and worked there were as eager to make their escape from this isolation as their neighbors were to be rid of them and like the arabs folded their tents and quietly melted away he could almost envisage furnham mustering to a man to tear down and obliterate this thorn in their side their tea was brought on a tray painted with wildflowers tied in a bunch by a pretty ribbon the woman set down a pot and two cups spoons a bowl of sugar and a small jug of milk without a word as she went back to her counter rutledge saw a young couple start to enter the shop notice the strangers by the window and turn away frances drank her tea with an air of enjoying it and rutledge was amused he rather thought she was determined to make the shop owner if that was who she was suffer their presence for as long as possible he caught the glint in her eyes as she leisurely accepted a second cup and made light conversation as she drank it finally with no tea left in pot or cup she smiled at him and thanked him that was lovely ian not quite the luncheon i was promised but a very nice interlude indeed she added sweetly just loud enough for the woman behind the counter to hear he paid for the tea then escorted his sister from the shop outside she said in a low voice i swear there must be at least a dozen daggers in my back will you pull them out if looks could kill i ought to be dead by now and you as well laughing he said thanks for being a good sport they were walking back to their car when another man dressed in corduroy trousers and an old shirt stopped them and asked looking to find property hereabouts are you surprised rutledge said why do you think were interested in property people like you who come here generally are possibilities thats what they said at the end of the war turn furnham into a holiday town for the east end of london looking to enjoy the seaside well you can see for yourself theres not much in the way of seaside is there the rivers swift and the marshes run down to it save for here in furnham where weve had boats as long as anyone can remember we make our living from the river its true but theres not much on offer for strangers wanting to amuse themselves a friend rutledge said slowly was here during the war he told me that furnham was a very unfriendly village thats not likely to bring holidaymakers rushing to visit here is it yet you came didnt you the man retorted in spite of our being unfriendly yes well i thought he might have been mistaken i wascurious you see the mans eyes narrowed just why did you come then he glanced at frances standing to one side then turned back to rutledge were at the end of a long road it wasnt happenstance brought you here i told you curiosity was it the house with the gates the ones with pineapples on the posts its not for sale whatever you may have heard someone saw you walking there a fine view to the river rutledge said as if agreeing with him but i prefer neighbors whose rooftops i can see then youll be on your way back to wherever it is you came from ill bid you and your lady good day and he walked on leaving them standing there frances said ian its not amusing any longer id like to go as he walked with her to the motorcar she added what are they hiding for surely it must be that a murder he said at a guess but whose and when and why i dont know then i was right there in the shop it was yard business that brought you here he shut her door and went to turn the crank im not quite sure what made me come here he said joining her in the motorcar a man walked into my office recently and confessed to a murder im not sure i believe him but why would he confess if there was no truth to it a good question to protect someone else to cover up another crime to settle a property dispute or just to see what we knewor didnt knowabout someones death were back to curiosity again hisand yours exactly but the yard cant investigate a crime just because someone tells us it happened theres no body for one thing nor proof that it ever existed the rain arrived at last with steady lightning and heavy thunder explosive drops striking the windscreen and blinding him as he concentrated on following the nearly invisible road they ran out of the storm into a winddriven downpour that pounded the motorcar ending any conversation eventually that passed as well leaving behind a steady drizzle that was more manageable he was glad to be out of the marshes now low lying and no bulwark against a rising river frances said replying to what rutledge had been explaining just as the storm broke and yet you drove all the way out here there must have been something about him that made you wonder he told me he was dying from the look of him that part may well be true you think once hes dead the thread will be lost is that why you are looking into this on your own i expect i didnt care to be made a fool of with the truthor with lies but what have you learned how did this jaunt help you i now have a feeling for this part of essex that i didnt have before and i was grateful for your company a man on his own would have drawn far more attention and the last thing i wanted to suggest was scotland yards interest his reply satisfied her but as he drove on he wasnt sure hed satisfied himself chapter ten days later rutledge was in his office finishing reports when sergeant gibson knocked at the open door and came in looking up rutledge said ill have these ready in another half an hour gibson answered its not the reports sir theres a dead man found in the thames and brought into gravesend he didnt drown and no ones claimed the body theyve sent along a photograph in the hope that the yard can help out its likely he went into the thames in london hes not known in gravesend at any rate he took a photograph from the folder he was carrying and set it down on rutledges desk rutledges first glance was cursory he didnt expect to recognize the thin face staring back at him from the photograph his gaze sharpened looking at it a second time he said is this the man who came to the yard a fortnight ago surely not he hadnt expected russell to end his suffering quite so soon it was twelve days sir as i remember sergeant hampton spotted the likenesshe was the one brought the man up to see youand in my view hes usually right about such things a good memory for faces has the sergeant thats why i brought the photograph up to show you i thought you might want to know theres a strong resemblance sergeant hampton says although the water hasnt been kind to him no what did the postmortem show he hadnt long to live an abdominal cancer inoperable it could well have been a suicide given that except for the fact that someone shot him in the back of the head did they indeed he studied the photograph the man who came to the yard was dying of cancer given this photograph i should think the body must be his who is handling the inquiry in gravesend inspector adams sir ive heard of him a good man very thorough he shuffled the papers in front of him into a folder and set it aside these can wait and its as well to see the body for myself to be sure gibson said will you be asking the chief superintendent hes having lunch with the lord mayor ill leave a message it will be late afternoon before hes back at the yard rutledge took out a sheet of paper and after a moments thought wrote a few lines on it capping his pen he passed the sheet to sergeant gibson glancing at his watch he said i should be back before theyve reached the last course as the sergeant left rutledge collected his hat and notebook and walked out of his office five minutes later he was in his motorcar and threading his way through the busy london traffic as he headed east gravesend was an old town on the south bank of the thames settled where a break in a long stretch of marshes provided the only landing stage for centuries ferrymen here held the charter to transport passengers to and from london if anyone knew the river it was the people of gravesend on the outskirts of the town rutledge stopped for directions at a coaching inn that had been refurbished then followed the omnipresent windmill hill into town where he found the police station inspector adams a slender man with hornrimmed glasses perched on the top of his head looked up as rutledge was ushered into his office scotland yard he said as rutledge gave his name youre here about our corpse i think it was an educated guess sending that photograph to london hes not one of ours were fairly certain of that and the most likely place he came from was somewhere south of the tower rutledge asked any idea how long hed been in the water at a guess a good four and twenty hours and there was nothing in his pockets to help with identification a hotel key medicine bottle even a handkerchief there should at least have been a key from the marlborough hotel nothing adams pulled his glasses down and searched for a paper in the clutter on his desk here we are white male approximately thirty years of age fair five feet eleven inches tall he said reading from the sheet he finally located under a stack of books no distinguishing marks suffering from terminal stomach tumor that has metastasized pockets empty shot at close range most likely with a service revolver judging from the caliber clothes those of a gentleman in the water for a day day and a half he looked up over the rims of his glasses if his killer had waited a few months more nature would have dispatched our victim for him hasty i should say he admitted that he didnt have long to live you know him then does he have a name as a matter of fact he does wyatt russell furnham road essex its the name he gave when he came to the yard recently to report a crime at this stage we havent found any evidence to indicate that his information is true but we also cant prove that it isnt the question is does his murder nearly a fortnight later have any bearing on what he told us what did he intentionallyor unintentionallystir up who else is involved in this hamish spoke his voice jarring in the small office ye ken ye asked yoursel that same question when the man wouldna gie ye any details about the murder rutledge nearly lost track of adamss reply he had to repeat himself what sort of crime was he reporting a murder well there you are someone will have taken exception to that except that my visitor claimed he was the killer did he by god adams pushed his glasses back to the top of his head he sat there for a moment then asked have you considered the extent of his cancer he must have been in almost intolerable pain and taking a fair amount of drugs you have to wonder if he was in his right mind he could have felt responsible for a mans death and finally convinced himself that hed actually killed him guilt can take many forms rutledge was all too aware of that wed have to ask a medical man russell himself had made some remark about the morphine speaking im glad its your case and not mine will you want the body no one so far has claimed it potters field seems an ignominious end he must have a family somewhere he opened his desk drawer and fished out a small packet this was around his neck whoever killed him missed it when going through his pockets he tossed the packet to rutledge who caught it deftly and unwrapped the brown paper inside was an oval gold locket on a gold chain an ornately scrolled e graced the front the locket itself was either old or worn possibly both rutledge found the clasp and opened it inside were two small spaces for photographs the righthand oval was empty but on the left there was a womans face despite the water stains he could see that she was pretty young the just visible collar of her dress fashionable her hair drawn softly back into a knot behind her head it was impossible to judge her coloring but he rather thought her hair was a light brown i wondered if this was hers and she was dead that would explain why hes wearing a womans necklace adams said a sentimental gesture russell lost his wife in childbirth a little less than a year after they were married neither her christian name nor her maiden name began with an e so much for sentiment adams said dryly still considering the face in the locket rutledge said he knew he was dying that means hed seen a doctor possibly in london well need to find him and speak to him i thought you told me he lived on the furnham road in essex thats on the hawking isnt it the house there is closed when i met him he was staying in the marlborough hotel someone there should be able to tell us more rutledge frowned are we absolutely certain that russell didnt fire that bullet into his own brain to avoid a worse death impossible according to the doctor unless the man was a contortionist would you like to see the remains rutledge accompanied adams to the hospital where the body had been taken down in the bowels of the building they walked through a series of passages to where a small morgue had been set up the other three bodies had died in the hospital adams explained and were awaiting the undertaker in the far corner lay their murder victim when rutledge pulled back the covering over the body he recognized russell instantly the likeness was stronger than that of the photograph which must have been taken in poor light yes id swear to his identity in the witness box he moved the dead mans head slightly to look at the entry wound of the bullet your doctor is right he couldnt have shot himself who did you say found the body a waterman by the name of acton he got it into his boat and brought it in you can speak to him if you like he should be back in gravesend in about five hours you have his statement its satisfactory on my desk and yes acton has been on the river for years no reason to think he had anything to do with russells death then ill take the statement rather than wait as he replaced the sheet over the dead man rutledge said if you learn any more about himif anyone in kent comes to you searching for himlet me know but i rather think youre right about london being the place to begin ive already gone through our list of missing people no one fits his description and hed have been missed by now surely someone would have come looking for him what about tilbury across the thames from you rutledge asked as they left the hospital we sent a photograph to the police there at the same time we sent one to the yard i followed it up with a telephone call and my opposite number didnt know him or have him on any lists there still ill ask again now that i have a name to give them and i know he once lived in essex rutledge thanked him taking with him the locket a copy of the statement from the ferryman and the report of the postmortem they lay in an envelope on the seat beside him as he drove back to london and from the rear of the motorcar came the voice he knew as well as his own and dreaded to hear hamish said you didna believe him russell ye ken if ye had he might well be alive no he made his choice he wouldnt tell me what i needed to know he made a mystery of what he had to say because he didnt want to incriminate himself or betray someone else there was a derisive chuckle hamish wasnt there rutledge had told himself that a thousand times but it was no comfort hamish was dead and buried in france and that was no comfort either the doctors had called it shell shock this hearing of a voice that was so real rutledge answered it in his heador sometimes to his absolute horror aloud corporal hamish macleod had fought beside rutledge almost from the start a young scot but with a grasp of military tactics well beyond his years a bond had grown between the two of them officer and man because each knew he could trust the other implicitly and both knew that the care of the men under them was paramount watching the maimed and the dying through two years of heavy fighting had taught them that green men facing battle for the first time had only a slim chance of survival if their officers could double those odds it counted for much and then on the somme in those first bloody weeks of fighting hamish macleod had put rutledge in an untenable position he had refused an order outright in front of his men his reasons were soundhe knew going over the top one more time after a wellconcealed german machinegun nest was insane that more men would die needlessly and yet hq had ordered that it be taken out at any cost before the next assault and rutledge had had no alternative but to try for the sake of the hundreds of british soldiers who would be crossing no mans land in only a matter of hours the good of the fewor the good of the many that was the choice hamish had chosen his bleeding and exhausted company no amount of argument could sway him even when as an example to other weary and dispirited men rutledge had to threaten his corporal with a firing squad it had not changed his mind and rutledge had had to carry out that threat against his better judgment and against the weight of his own guilt he had had to deliver the coup de grace to the dying man taking out his pistol and firing it pointblank and watching the anguished eyes go dull he hadnt wanted this he hadnt wanted hamish macleod on his soul even his own mind had refused to accept what he had done the burden of guilt had been insupportable and in the way of damaged minds his had created a living hamish proof that the young corporal hadnt died keeping him alive through two more years of grinding stalemate and death bringing him home in the only way he could military necessity had been paramount rutledge had almost hated hamish for breaking for forcing his own hand but close as he was to breaking himself he had known that the young corporal was right still duty was all compassion had no place on a battlefield obeying orders was the paramount rule there had been times when rutledge himself had wanted to die to shut out the voice hammering at him and he couldnt because when he himself died hamish would finally be dead as well hed led a charmed life in the trenches those last two years of the warhis men had commented on that again and again but rutledge had understood it for what it was god had not wanted him a murderer to put an end to the memories threatening to overwhelm him rutledge pulled to the verge and stopped the motorcar reaching for the envelope on the seat beside him he took out the locket opening it he looked down at the face of the woman whose photograph had been so carefully placed inside who was she why had she been important in the life of one wyatt russell the woman staring up at him was silent and after a moment he closed the locket and returned it to the envelope why had the dead man been wearing it perhaps if he knew the answer to that he told himself he would know why wyatt russell had died when he reached london rutledge went directly to the marlborough hotel where he and russell had dined if russells belongings were still in his rooms there it was possible they could tell him more about the man than hed wanted to reveal when he was alive there was a couple just arrived and it took several minutes before they had registered and relinquished their luggage to the man waiting to carry it to their room as they walked away rutledge stepped forward and asked to see the register for the date twelve days ago when hed come here with russell the clerk was reluctant at first until rutledge quietly identified himself as scotland yard and then he insisted on checking the register himself after going through the guest book the clerk shook his head i dont find a mr russell for that date or any other close to it he said im sorry if you would go back through it again he indicated hed taken a room here he wasnt well the clerk ran his finger down the list of hotel guests turning the pages slowly no inspector im sorry i dont see that name either russell had lied about where he was stayingor he had lied about his name rutledge thanked the clerk and left by the time hed returned to the yard chief superintendent bowles was waiting for him gibson gave him a warning with an itoldyouso expression on his face knocking on the chief superintendents door rutledge stepped inside you wished to see me sir whats this business about gravesend and a cadaver i recognized the photograph they sent to the yard and i went to see the body for myself he gave a brief account of russells visit and the information hed learned in gravesend but he said nothing about the lunch with russell or stopping at the hotel before returning to the yard and youre sure of this dead mans identity im sure hes the same person who came to my office rutledge answered carefully id like to go to essex to verify the information i was given and there may be people there who can tell me more about russell yes yes by all means i dont put much stock in his confession i suggest that you not waste your time in that direction its his death that concerns us he paused taking up his pen and rolling it in his fingers as if it might produce answers for rutledge if he stared at it long enough then he said im acquainted with inspector adamss superior it wouldnt do to let this matter drag on if you take my meaning rutledge did bowles was pleased to take over the inquiry bring it to a swift and certain end and put his opposite numbers nose out of joint an hour later rutledge was on his way to essex this time he didnt have frances to keep him company this time it was hamish although the sun was shining and the day was fair the journey seemed to drag and he would have sworn that furnham was twice as far as it had been earlier hed decided that perhaps the place to begin his inquiries was with the clergyman in charge of the isolated church that he and frances had seen it was roughly halfway between the deserted house at rivers edge and the village of furnham if anyone knew something about russells background it would likely be the man who had ministered to his family as he passed the gates to the estate he wondered again why russell had deserted it because of his wifes death or because he had committed murder there and got away with it until someone had found him out and come for him an eye for an eye ahead he could just see the peaked roof of the church standing out like a sentinel in the long reaches of the marshes the grasses had more color today varied in texture as well as shade and the river beyond was intensely blue as it mirrored the sky and yet the warm late summers day was chilled by the whispers of the wind through the grasses setting them to move and rustle as if hidden among them were crowds of people talking together frances had noted it as well but alone now he realized that it was defining this place in a way that he hadnt expected as if im being watched frances had said it would tend he thought to make a man with a guilty conscience nervous was that why the house stood empty the whispers that a mans mind turned to accusation he drew up before the church he had no idea where to look for the rectory although there must be one but with luck he might find someone inside who could direct him the sign announcing that this was the church of st edward the confessor had a new message today on the hoarding below seek and ye shall find he will welcome all who come to him rutledge hoped that a welcome would prove to be true it had not in furnham he opened the door listening to the squeal of rusty hinges as he stepped into the plain victorian interior ye willna have to seek anyone yon caterwauling will bring them running and hamish was right a door at the rear of the sanctuary opened and a man stepped through he was wearing a clerical collar and an anxious expression on his square sunbrowned face it was difficult to judge his age he was one of those men who would appear boyish well into their forties rutledge found himself thinking that this must be a drawback for a clergyman trying to project an image of experience and wisdom he didnt come forward he merely stopped where he was seeing a stranger and asked in a strong voice that belied his anxiety are you lost mr morrison im from london scotland yard id like to speak to you about one of your parishioners indeed it was a question not a statement we have the usual number of reprobates here but i cant recall that any of them has lately come to the attention of scotland yard is there somewhere we could talk rutledge asked the man gestured to the pews that filled the sanctuary there are seats aplenty here shall we take one of them rutledge walked forward and the other man didnt move until he had come to the last row but one will this do yes thank you the man stepped forward and finally held out his hand im afraid you have the advantage of me inspector rutledge ah well mr rutledge i must confess that im not in the confidence of many of my flock but ill do what i can to help they sat down on the hard wood of the pew facing each other rutledge reached into his pocket and took out the locket on its delicate chain opening it he held it out but he already knew the answer to his question before he asked it do you know this woman yes yes i did morrison replied slowly reaching for the locket although it was clear he didnt require a closer look she once lived nearby could you tell me her name where did you find this locket may i ask in gravesend rutledge answered when the rector said nothing more his eyes on the photograph rutledge added the police found it around the neck of a body taken from the thames dear god the rector closed the locket with a snap as if he couldnt bear to look at it any longer he turned his gaze toward the altar whohas the body been identified we have reason to believe that it is was one wyatt russell the relief filling in the rectors eyes was almost painful to watch rutledge looked away did you know him he asked iyes i knew him he lived not far from here at rivers edge in fact yes how did you know he came to see me shortly before his death you havent told me who the woman is was he a suicide he was murdered rutledge replied shortly what is her name rector god rest his soul morrison said fervently crossing himself as to the woman in the photograph her name is cynthia farraday she came to live at rivers edge when her parents died of typhoid her father and the late malcolm russell were cousins i believe she was too young to live on her own and mrs russell his widow was made her guardian she was alive then mrs russell i mean wyatts mother and then one day in the summer of august it wasmrs russell simply disappeared were the police called in yes the police from tilbury when it was realized that she was missing there was a frantic search for her by the family and the staff and then someone was sent posthaste to tilbury men were brought out from furnham to help because they knew the marshes so well but she was never found the inquest concluded that she had drowned herself for fear her son would die in the war shed lost her husband in the boer war her son remembered that when she was a girl a gypsy had read her hand and predicted that war would take all she loved from her her husbands death convinced her that the prediction was true there had been a great deal of speculation that summer after the austrian archduke and heir to the hapsburg throne had been assassinated in sarajevo rutledge remembered it well would austria demand a reckoning with the serbs and what would germany do if russia insisted on protecting her fellow slavs would france be drawn in as an ally of russia governments began to mobilize and in the end armies began to march and belgium tiny belgium with open borders and only a small army had been overrun by the kaisers forces on their way to france in spite of britains pledge to protect her britain had had no choice then but to declare war on germany and all europe burst into flame no one had believed it would happen and then everyone had believed that it would all be over by christmas that the heads of state would come to their senses instead the war had dragged on for four bloody years mrs russell had had every reason to be afraid for her son although no one could have guessed it at the time was this a strong enough reason for her to kill herself surely further inquiry would uncover a better motive for her disappearance and i should think that if she had drowned sooner or later her body would have surfaced you didnt know her morrison said wearily elizabeth russell was obsessed with the news reading everything she could find she had daily newspapers sent down from london by special messenger she corresponded with a friend whod married a frenchman and a telegram was sent telling her when the germans had marched and in spite of everything her son joined the army not a fortnight after she vanished he shrugged the local people in their wisdom were just as glad she hadnt been found the stigma of suicide you see and where to bury the body they put up quite a fuss even when russell wanted to set up a memorial to his mother in the familys mausoleum i must say that surprised me furnham is not a very religious parish as a rule you said the local people had helped in the search could they have seen to it that her body wasnt discovered dear god he was shocked i never thought of that where is this furnham mausoleum is there a churchyard associated with your parish ah the churchyard the water table is too high this near the river its the reason there isnt a crypt in this church theres a turning between here and the village it doesnt appear to be more than a dusty cart path it leads to higher ground the rectory is there as well forgive me rector but isnt it odd to have a church this far from a village and the churchyard in another place its a long story morrison answered and not a very pleasant one i dont know all of it myself suffice it to say this church was built several years before victoria ascended the throne it was felt by the bishop of that day that one was needed in furnham parish but over the years very few people in furnham have availed themselves of it i have a handful of elderly farmers wives a few young children preparing for their first communion often a bride and groom and occasionally those who have nowhere else to turn in their misery but to god i hadnt expected to serve in a parish like this it has tried my spirit i can tell you and morrison had very skillfully directed rutledge away from his questions about russell and the woman in the locket when was the last time you saw russell i dont believe he came home again once hed joined the army or if he did i never saw him i did learn that he was a major his name appeared on a list of wounded and miss farraday without mrs russell there to act as chaperone miss farraday went to london a sad state of affairs that with russell off to war she might have stayed in the house without any criticism but when she came to see me to say goodbye she told me that the house was haunted literally i asked her that question myself she answered that it was filled with the ghosts of what might have been it was not a happy house to use her words i understand that russell was married yes on his last leave before sailing for france i dont believe he ever brought his bride to rivers edge id have liked to meet her later i heard she died from complications of childbirth and the baby with her perhaps that was why miss farraday chose to leave because of the marriage morrison smiled a sadness in his eyes if anything it was the other way around russell would have married her on the instant it was my understanding that she refused him i feared that hed married just to provide an heir for rivers edge if he did it was not given to him was it but i understand he survived the war so much for his mothers superstitions rutledge reached for the envelope again and brought out the photograph of the dead man taken in gravesend i need confirmation that this is indeed wyatt russell if you have any reservations ill be happy to take you to tilbury for the ferry to gravesend let me see the photograph first rutledge passed it to him morrison took it and held it to the faint rays of sunlight coming through the plain glass windows high up in the sanctuary wall but this isnt russell he exclaimed what led you to believe it was its not russell youre quite sure of that you havent seen him in six years rutledge countered making an effort to conceal his consternation id stake my life on it chapter could this be justin fowler rutledge asked im afraid not then you knew fowler too he was a connection of mrs russells although i dont believe she had known his family very well she told me before he came that shed lost touch with his mother after she married mr fowler i had the feeling that mrs russell didnt approve of him thats to say of the husband this was just after the solicitor had come to ask her to take the boy in she said that god in his wisdom had seen fit to give her only one child but to make up for it god had sent her the daughter shed never have and now a second son i wondered later if she was as happy as shed expected to be they werent that easy to mother they werent hers after all then she was gone and the boysthey were young men by that timeleft to join the army i dont know if justin fowler survived or not i drove him in mrs russells motorcar to meet the train to london and that was the last time i saw him a quiet boy kept to himself i didnt know him well but he was afraid of something i never knew what it was then who is the man in this photograph morrison frowned as he considered the face again im sorry i dont believe ive ever seen him before but you said hed come to call on you at the yard the man in this photograph how did you come to believe he was major russell it was the name he gave me rutledge said trenchantly how very odd and you tell me he was wearing the locket with miss farradays likeness in it when his body was pulled from the river according to those who found him then i should think you ought to find her and ask her if she knows this man before i do what else can you tell me about the russell household are there any of the staff still living in the vicinity perhaps in furnham there was only a small staff a housekeeper of course and several maids a cook an elderly groom and i believe there was a man who acted as butler when there were guests but generally drove mrs russell when she went out the household didnt get on well with the local people and kept to themselves more often than not the groom died soon after mrs russell disappeared and the cook went to live with a member of her family when the house was closed mrs broadley i remember how apt her name was an excellent cook i dont know what became of the housekeeper mrs dunner i was told she found employment in the midlands haroldthe chauffeurstayed on as caretaker in the first few weeks of the war then was called up there was no one at rivers edge after that the maids id nearly forgot nancy married a farmers son on the other side of furnham samuel brothers the others went their ways tell me how to find this farm you must drive through furnham and when the road curves to the left just continue along it the second farm you come to belongs to brothers rutledge thanked him and took his leave morrison walked with him up the single aisle of the church and to the door like a good host seeing a guest on his way he said as they reached the door i hope you can identify that poor man in the photograph i shall pray for him thank you rector and then the door was closed behind him and the rectors footsteps seemed to echo in the emptiness of the sanctuary as he walked back down the aisle he was in love with the lass in yon locket hamish said as rutledge crossed the narrow strip of lawn to his motorcar morrison aye the priest rutledge remembered the sadness in the rectors eyes as he said that russell would have married cynthia farraday russell was more her equal than a country parson it could explain why morrison had found it difficult to discuss her he paused as he reached for the crank and in the silence he could hear the whispers in the grass it was easy to imagine people hidden among the reeds some of them taller than a man for that matter it would be hard to find someone even twenty feet away from where one stood it explained the difficulty in searching for mrs russell he left the church turning toward furnham who the hell was the man who had come into his office claiming to be wyatt russell and swearing hed murdered justin fowler more to the point who had killed that man not a fortnight later and were the two events related or was there something else in the victims past that had led to his death hamish said the lass in the locket will know yes very likely but finding her was going to be another matter making a point to look for the turning morrison had spoken of he saw it to his left threequarters of a mile from the church he drove on passing through furnham and out the other side turning away from the rivers mouth toward the farms and pasturage wrested from the marshes the farms were not large but they appeared to be prosperous enough dairy herds mostly he thought judging from the cows grazing quietly with only enough acreage for the corn and hay to feed them he could just see the green tips of the corn in a field beyond moving with the light sea breeze he found the brothers farm and took the rutted turning that led to the house beyond it stood a weathered barn and several outbuildings no one answered his knock and after a moment he walked round to the kitchen door at the rear there he found a woman in a black dress that had seen happier days inside a wire pen scattering feed for the chickens bunched and clucking around her ankles she looked up as rutledge came toward her her eyes wary it was an expression he was growing accustomed to here on the river hawking she said politely enough can i help you sir good morning my name is rutledge im looking for mrs brothers and what would you be wanting with her when youve found her im trying to locate anyone who knew the family at rivers edge the rector at st edwards mr morrison has told me mrs brothers was once a housemaid there nodding she emptied the bowl she was holding in the crook of her arm and walked out of the pen latching the gate behind her come into the kitchen then he followed her down the path and over the steppingstones that led between the beds of herbs flowers and vegetables flanking the kitchen entrance someone he noted took pride in the gardens for they were weeded and the soil between the rows had recently been hoed inside the kitchen he saw the same care the cloth over the table was not only clean but also ironed and both the sink and the cabinets below it were spotless as was the floor im nancy brothers she said offering him a chair and going to stand in front of the broad dresser why are you looking for anyone from the house im not precisely sure rutledge answered her this locket has been found and im trying to trace the woman shown inside he took it from his pocket and held it out to her by the gold chain i was told she might have lived at rivers edge instead of reaching for the locket mrs brothers asked are you a lawyer then or a policeman he told her the truth im from scotland yard we dont ordinarily search for the owner of lost property but in this case it could help us in another matter of some importance mrs brothers took the locket found the clasp and opened it oh you recognize her rutledge prompted as she stood there staring at the tiny photograph the locket it brings back memories she replied slowly i thought id put all that behind me what had you put behind you she sighed and turned her head to look out the window in the end it was a troubled house she said finally id have left if there had been anywhere to go its not as if this was london or even tilbury where i could have found another position was she making excuses for staying on despite her feelings about the house he wondered whether she was lying to herself or to him how troubled nancy brothers took a deep breath its not my place to gossip about my betters i understand thats commendable in fact he told her gently but its not a matter of gossip you see in a police inquiry its your duty to help the authorities in any way you can if you know something you must let us decide if its important or not mrs russell was wearing this locket the day she disappeared i know i helped her put it on and i saw it at noon that day when she came in for lunch she was still wearing it what happened to mrs russell did the police find her or failing that her body that was the odd thing they never found any trace of her her son saw her walking toward the landing stage at two oclock but no one knew she was missing until i went up to help her dress for dinner she turned to set a bowl that had been draining in the sink up on a shelf they questioned all of us the police did was she anxious about anything was she worried was she frightened did anyone harbor hard feelings toward her she could be a trial sometimes to tell you the truth but she was getting older and crotchety at least it seemed so to me at the time young as i was sometimes she fussed over her hair until i was fit to be tied wanting it to be thick and pretty as it was when she was eighteen or the ashes hadnt been swept out proper when i could see they had but you dont do someone a harm for that do you was this same photograph in the locket when mrs russell wore it last no it wasnt it was her and her late husband on their wedding day then how can you be sure this is the same locket i must have touched it a thousand times settling it around her throat under her hair making sure it was hanging proper she took it off each evening and put it on each morning even if she was wearing other jewelry this was still around her throat she reached for the kettle and filled it with cold water can you tell me how you came to have it does this mean youve found her body and who put that other photograph in it we havent found mrs russell someone else was wearing the locket how did she come by it before i answer your question will you give me the name of this woman she was measuring tea for the pot but she lifted the spoon and pointed with it thats cynthia farraday she came to live with mrs russell when her own parents died what became of her she went to live in london after mrs russell disappeared she said it wasnt fitting to live in the house without a chaperone mr russell proposed marriage but she didnt want that she wanted to be free she said to live her own life who else was in the housebesides the staff mr justin of course he was another cousin come to live at rivers edge after miss cynthia came they werent related those two she was connected through the russell side while mr justins grandmother and mrs russells were cousins i heard it said that mr justins mother had died of the consumption her lungs was bad i never heard anything about his father what became of mr fowler he went off to war and as far as i know never come back i see as the kettle began to whistle mrs brothers turned to fill the teapot watching her rutledge said and mr russell himself she stirred the leaves in the pot peering at them as she spoke all i know is he survived the war but i dont know that he ever came back to the house a shame that was it was a lovely house i wish you could have seen it when i was in service there they had money the russells did i often wondered how it was the family built that house out here in the marshes it could have been set down anywhere while the tea steeped rutledge said i have a photograph to show you it isnt a pleasant photograph but perhaps you will be able to identify the man in it he took out the envelope from gravesend opened the flap and passed it to her she reached inside tentatively and pulled out the photograph he saw her grimace as she looked down at it hes dead isnt he this man yes he was found in the river the hawking she glanced from the photograph to rutledges face my husband never said anything to me about a body being found it was the thames do you know him hes changed so much i hardly recognized him at first he was just a lad when last i saw him all arms and legs and polite enough she said slowly i didnt go into furnham that often but he came to rivers edge a time or two from the village as i remember his father was a fisherman im sorry i cant put a name to him after all this time she turned away from the photograph and rutledge put it back in the envelope do you remember anything else about him when she hesitated he added was he a troublemaker was there gossip about him if there was i dont remember it now she answered but of course we didnt mix all that much with the villagers the staff at rivers edge she smiled wryly we thought ourselves above them and here i wound up marrying one of them you never know do you but at the time mrs russell encouraged us not to go into furnham on our days off every other week shed let us go into tilbury for the day let us have the use of the cart even as long as harold finley drove it and she cautioned us to stay well away from the docks you are sure this man isnt major russell oh no id know mr russell anywhere even after all this time i was a maid in that house for fifteen years until mr brothers come along yes id recognize him even today for certain throughout the questioning hamish had been silent now he interjected a comment catching rutledge off guard as he was setting the envelope down by the leg of his chair out of sight mrs brothers was bringing the teapot to the table and he glanced up quickly certain she must have heard the voice as well but she had turned away to pick up two cups and saucers ye ken yon dead man knew the people at rivers edge well enough to accuse the one of killing the ither it was an excellent point what was the relationship between fowler and russell did they get on they did well enough except where miss cynthia was concerned then it wasnt so friendly was it and some of it was her doing flirting with first one and then the other it wasnt serious ill say that for her mind you i know the difference she didnt fancy either of them but she was the sort to like their attentions you didnt care for her not to say didnt care for her mrs brothers replied thats too harsh a word isnt it but i was not taken in by her ways she even flirted with harold finley not in quite the same fashion but enough to turn his head that wasnt fair was it to lead him on but he was a fine figure of a man tall and strong and clever as well she couldnt resist proving he was under her spell too harold finley the drivercumbutler when the need arose how did she flirt with him shed invent little errands where he was to drive her here and everywhere to tilbury to return a book to the lending library in the bookshop to furnham to find a ribbon that matched her hat once to london to see a friend but mrs russell put a stop to london visits a young girl like that it wasnt wise was it london the den of iniquity no it must not have been he answered i dont suppose you know how that man came by mrs russells locket or had miss cynthias photograph in it no but when i find miss farraday perhaps she can tell me yes and shell lead you up the garden path if i know her unless shes changed as if shed said more than she intended mrs brothers added but to be fair she wasnt wicked just lively and sometimes trying did you by any chance keep in touch with her after she left rivers edge there i cant help you and im that sorry i never knew just where it was she went to in london but she could have told me ten times over and it wouldnt have made any difference i was never in london you see i did hear that the house had belonged to her parents which isnt much help as shes likely married by now and living somewhere else he finished his tea retrieved the locket from the table along with the envelope and prepared to take his leave thanking her you never told me how you came to have mrs russells locket he owed her the truth the dead man was wearing it when he was pulled from the river if this man she said after digesting what rutledge had told her had the locketwhere did he get it did he know what became of mrs russell i wish i could answer that rutledge said but he told the police at one time that russell had killed fowler she shook her head vehemently i dont believe a word of that now i could see maybe mr russell taking his fists to mr fowler he had a black temper on him mr wyatt did but murder no but you said that they were jealous of cynthia farradays attentions if every jealous man took to killing his rival youd be busier than a beaver in a rainstorm she retorted whats more in your shoes i wouldnt believe someone wearing a dead womans locket f rom the brothers farm rutledge drove back to furnham and left his motorcar by the dragonfly inn it was small and for furnham rather picturesque with a cottage garden in front where hollyhocks bloomed among other summer flowers the streets were busier now women going about their marketing fishermen coming up from the water workmen standing in front of the ironmongers passing the time of day beyond the high street the river was dappled with sunlight and the boats riding at anchor were turning with the tide rutledge stopped the first man he encountered from his rough clothing he appeared to be a laborer and there was cement crusted in the cuticles of his fingers my name is rutledge he began already drawing the photograph out of its envelope im trying to locate the family of this man he held it out the man barely glanced at it from his flat expression it was impossible to tell what he was thinking dont know him he said and brushing the extended photograph aside he walked on rutledge continued down the street found another man just coming out of the ironmongers a bolt in his hand staring down at it as if he werent satisfied with the choice hed made he looked up when a shadow fell over his hand who are you he demanded as if rutledge had dropped from the moon rutledge recognized him the man in corduroy trousers and a workmans shirt who had challenged him earlier as he drove along the street with frances he wasnt sure however that the man remembered him he repeated his earlier approach the man pushed his extended arm aside never saw him before he said brusquely as he walked on rutledge tried three more times and met with the same unfriendly refusal to admit to recognizing the dead man and there was no way to tell whether they were speaking the truth or whether the man was their longlost brother or son hamish said speak to a woman but rutledge was reluctant to show the photograph to a woman hed done so with mrs brothers because she knew the household at rivers edge and could tell him if she recognized the face he had reached the end of the high street where the bend in the road turned slightly north toward the farms looking back the way he had come he decided to try the pub it was on the river side of the street just before the small harbor cut into the reedy land he hadnt chosen to go there first unwilling to spread word about his search he knew very well that the men hed already spoken to might gossip but he had a feeling they wouldnt in a pub where men gossiped as freely as members of the womens institute rumor would fly after hed gone and he preferred to watch reactions for himself still he needed to find a name and chief superintendent bowles would be expecting him to produce it when hed returned to london and bowles didnt care for excuses however valid the pub was namednot surprisinglythe rowing boat and the sign above the door swinging in the light breeze showed three men pulling for the open sea in their small vessel backs bent to the oars rutledge stepped inside in the dim interior he could see two men playing cribbage at one table another man sat hunched over a corner table eating a thick sandwich and drinking what appeared to be cider the windows at the far end of the room looked out over the river and stairs to one side must lead he thought down to a cellar and possibly the water as well behind the bar with its gleaming brass the wood polished from age and generations of elbows stood a very tall thin man with receding gray hair he straightened when he saw that the newcomer wasnt a regular and he watched rutledge stride toward him without a word of welcome his eyes gave away nothing but there was a tightening in the muscles around his mouth his first words were police are you the men at the two tables turned to stare my name is rutledge he began without further identification and as he passed the photograph across the bar he repeated what hed said before that he was searching for the mans family coming into money are they the man asked i wont know until i succeed in finding them how did he die then he was found in the river the barkeeps eyebrows rose his first sign of interest in the hawking nearby rutledge replied after all the thames passed tilbury that in terms of distances in this part of essex could be called nearby never seen him before the man said finally how long have you been barkeep here the question was met with silence my guess is a good ten years rutledge continued im told the dead man once lived here in furnham i should think youd know your custom by face if not by name i have a very poor memory the barkeep answered him and lifting his voice he asked you there at the corner table the man had gone back to his sandwich and now looked up his craggy brows lifted in surprise at being addressed have i ever called you by name the man at the table hesitated well have i no never the man responded at last taking his cue from the barkeeps tone of voice there you see he said to rutledge and do i remember he went on to the cribbage players do i remember your favorite beverage when you come in they shook their heads eyes wary as they stared from rutledge to the publican and back again sorry i cant be of help mr rutledge or whoever you are but there it is rutledge said then how could you tell that i was a stranger that caught the man off guard just as he was beginning to grin at his own cleverness youd have asked what id have instead you identified me as a policeman the barkeep pushed the photograph back across the bar no one here can help you he retorted youd be better off looking elsewhere if you take my meaning scotland yard doesnt take kindly to threats ill have you closed down within the day on what charges the man demanded the bar is greasy with spilled beer the plates youve used to serve those men have leftover food clinging to them and this floor is so filthy i should think a meal here would send a healthy man to his grave the chief constable will be glad to know of these conditions and as he isnt likely to trouble himself to travel all the way to furnham hell take my word for what ive seen its all a lie you wouldnt dare try me rutledge said his voice cold and he turned toward the door ignoring the barkeep who was shouting abuse after him rutledge had almost reached the door his back to the bar when hamish said ware he turned in time to see the man coming toward him the heavy wooden club usually kept behind the bar raised in one hand rutledge had expected no less put that down you fool killing me wont stop the yard and you know it the barkeep hesitated a flash of uncertainty in his eyes and then it was gone and his intent was clearhe would finish what hed begun in the next instant he was bent back over the bar the club across his throat and rutledge was saying through clenched teeth as he put pressure on the length of wood if anyone else in this room moves ill break his damned neck there was a scraping of chair legs against the floor as the other patrons hastily sat down now rutledge said to the redfaced barkeep struggling to breathe i will step back and you will sit down in the nearest chair and conduct yourself with decorum do you understand me the man could barely move but he signaled with his eyes that he understood still holding the club rutledge released him and the man nearly sank to his knees catching himself with one arm across the bar he stood there for a moment fighting for breath and then he moved to the nearest chair sinking into it he glared at rutledge but the fight had gone out of him rutledge said what was worth an attack on me this photograph whats your name and dont tell me you cant remember barber sandy barber who is this man in the photograph he waited and after a moment the barkeep said hoarsely its willets son the old mans youngest boy who is willet ned willet hes a fisherman it will kill him seeing his boy dead and who is his boy when hes at home thats it he hasnt been home since before the end of the war hes in service in thetfordben never wanted to be a fisherman you see abigail sent for him as soon as ned took a bad turn but ben never answered wellnow we know why dont we look hes not got long to live ned hasnt let him think his boy cant leave his post why doesnt willet have long to live rutledge asked thinking about ben willets stomach cancer he got hurt bringing his boat back in a storm gear shifted and pinned his foot it turned septic they wanted to take his foot off and he wouldnt hear of it stubborn old fool now theres gangrene and its only a matter of time before it takes him you should see his legnearly black its that purple and so swollen it doesnt look like part of his body gesturing with his chin toward the envelope rutledge had dropped on the bar he added what happened to ben then you said he came out of the river someone shot him in the back of the head before putting him in the river there was consternation in the room the other men listening stirred restlessly the barkeep shook his head well theyll meet on the other side wont they he said after a moment whats willet to you that you would have stopped me any way you could my wife abigail is his only daughter whod want to kill ben we never heard of him making enemies he could put on airs with the best of them but no one minded fishing is a hard way to make a living furnham didnt hold it against ben willet that hed escaped to a different life possibly a better one ned wasnt happy barber frowned if anyone else felt strongly i never heard of it the older man who had been sitting alone eating spoke from the far end of the room when he came back on his last leave before sailing to france showing off his uniform everyone was glad to see him i remember my daughter fancied him but nothing came of it you said he could put on airs what did you mean by that hed hobnobbed with his betters hadnt he he could pass himself off as a duke he said if hed half a mind to do it he had abigail in tears one night she laughed so hard describing the family he worked for taking all the parts it was better than a stage play as if realizing he was speaking of the dead barber added aye that was ben rutledge recalled the man who had come to his office passing himself off as another person a gentleman he had done it so well that hed even fooled an inspector at scotland yard but then he rutledge had had no reason to doubt him it was unlikely that such a man would come forward to confess to a murder he hadnt committed or had he pulling out the photograph again rutledge said and you are absolutely certain that this man is ben willet ask them the barkeep said gesturing to the other men in the bar and so he did showing the photograph to each of the three men in turn he met hard eyes staring up at him but in them rutledge read recognition and certainty walking back to the center of the room rutledge said and what about wyatt russell how many of you know him there was a silence one of the players finally answered not to say know him he lived at rivers edge before the war how well did ben willet know him i doubt they ever spoke to each other more than a time or two barber said the russells wanted no part of us here in furnham the family never has he appeared to be on the point of adding more then thought better of it i was told the men of furnham helped the family search for mrs russell when she went missing that was the police set us to scouring the marsh one of the older men answered it wasnt the russells justin fowler then one of the older men stirred in his chair but when rutledge turned his way he said only ive heard the name i doubt i could put a face to it he never had much to do with furnham either barber told rutledge from rivers edge it was easier to go west than turn east there was nothing here the family needed or wanted someone sold them fish from time to time rutledge said remembering what nancy brothers had told him ned would take part of his catch to the cook mrs broadley and she was the one who paid for it i doubt he saw mrs russell five times over the years she did come once to thank him the lone diner put in ill say that for her do any of you know what became of wyatt russell or justin fowler after a moment barber said they went off to fight in the war didnt they no one opened the house again afterward which says they didnt come home but rutledge wasnt sure he was telling the truth when he turned to look at the other men in the pub they refused to meet his eyes staring out at the river at their backs he said id like to speak to mrs barber she should know more about her brothers years here in furnham before he went into service where will i find her here you arent showing that dead mans face to my wife and him her own brother barber was on his feet and how is she to keep the news from her father i ask you ill strike a bargain with you find a way for me to speak to mrs barber and i will keep her brothers death out of it for now the barkeep considered him i have your word you do barber turned on his patrons im leaving if one word of what happened just now goes beyond this room youll have me to answer to am i understood there were hasty nods of agreement and then barber said to rutledge come with me from the rowing boat they went left and rutledge soon found himself in a muddy lane that led north from the high street past a row of elderly cottages the one at the far end was barely larger than its neighbors and here barber turned up the walk youll remember your word barber demanded before reaching out to lift the latch and swing the door wide rutledge nodded the front room was surprisingly comfortable the furnishings were old but well polished and upholstered in a faded dark red a thin carpet with arabesques in deep shades of blue red and cream covered the floor it seemed out of place here somehow but gave the room an air of worn elegance and rutledge wondered if it had come from rivers edge sunlight spilled across it to touch the iron foot of a plant stand where the fronds of a luxuriant fern overhung a dark blue fired clay pot to rutledges eyes it appeared to be french barber left rutledge standing there and went to fetch his wife after several minutes he returned accompanied by a small plump woman with a pretty face although she was pale and there were dark pockets beneath her green eyes as if she hadnt slept well in a very long time mr rutledge ive told abigail that youre trying to find anyone connected with the family that lived at rivers edge i hardly knew them she said apologetically i dont know why you should wish to see me im casting at straws he told her smiling and she appeared to relax a little did you know the family mr russell or his mother i knew them if i saw them in the shops course i did but not to speak to they didnt come into furnham all that often how would you describe them he asked and when she hesitated he added theres no photograph as far as i know of the family members oh not even in rivers edge shyly offering him a seat she asked what is this about then from behind her shoulder sandy barber sent him a fierce frown alas the house is closed he fell back on his recollection of his fathers methods of dealing with clients john rutledge had been a very fine solicitor and his easy manner had belied his sharp mind a legal matter he told her to do with a certain piece of personal property that has been recovered we dont seem to know where to return the item reassured she said well then mr russell was tall and fair a friendly enough man hed touch his hat to us if he encountered my mother and me on the street or in a shop and say ladies as he passed by my mother always said he had good manners but he wasnt one to stop and ask after the children if one had been ill or inquire how my fathers boat had fared after a high wind mrs russell now she would speak to my mother if she met her in a shop she knew my father he sometimes would take a choice bit of fish out to mrs broadley the cook at rivers edge that was a fine bit of sole mrs russell would say thank ned for thinking of us sad that she disappeared the way she did rutledge caught barbers eye the barkeep had left the impression that the willet family had had very little to do with the russell family what did local gossip have to say about her disappearance we thought shed drowned herself well it was what youd naturally wonder about isnt it last seen walking down to the waters edge people dont drown themselves without a reason he responded quietly was mrs russellunhappy not precisely unhappy abigail barber answered trying to remember i do recall my mother saying that she hadnt seemed like herself in a while as if something was on her mind but then the war was coming wasnt it and there was her son and mr fowler of an age to go i understand you had brothers about the age of mr russell did they ever spend time togethergo off on the river together she laughed her face flushing a becoming pink god love you mr rutledge i dont think id live long enough to see that day but ben had an eye for whatever mr russell was wearing he longed to be a footman and someday a gentlemans gentleman once or twice he went up to the house with my father and hed come back and say i wonder how he gets that polish on his shoes or he must have dressed in a bit of a hurry today the back of his coat wasnt properly pressed he could mimic their voices too it came natural to him did he indeed was he hoping to be taken on as a footman in the russell household oh no sir it wasnt at all likely ben said hed be best off where he wasnt known but what he learned would help him fit in he said she glanced over her shoulder at her husband he was a fishermans son here he said he could be anybody somewhere else ben willet so it seemed was ambitious how did your father take this desire to go into service he had other sons to go out in the boat with him that was before the war of course tommy and joseph never came back from france but ben was always his favorite and i think he was sorry not to have him want to go to sea did you know justin fowler she shook her head he was a cousin or some such wasnt he but i never saw him that i know of he didnt come to furnham we put it down to him being more of a snob was there bad blood between russell and fowler i wouldnt know sir he could hear a weak voice calling from another part of the house my father she said rising quickly hes not well rutledge rose as well one more question did miss farraday come to the village on occasion her face hardened oh yes i knew who she was if you want to know she had an eye for the lads and no time for the rest of us any particular lad he asked i saw her once or twice speaking to ben but he told me later she hadnt and then with a hasty excuse she hurried back to her bedside watch rutledge said thank you mrs barber was very helpful was she barber was urging him toward the door he lowered his voice to my way of thinking youre no closer to knowing about ben than you were before i told you it was no use speaking to my wife no closer to finding his killer perhaps barber said an edge to his voice then what was that all about catching you in several lies what lies but rutledge gave him no answer and they walked in uneasy silence back to where hed left his motorcar r utledge had stayed longer than hed intended in essex he set out for london and driving out of furnham he felt a sense of relief as the village disappeared in his mirror reduced to a tiny rectangle of glass in the war hed been blessed with a strong sixth sense which had kept him alive far more times than hed deserved and unexpectedly that had stayed with him as hed resumed his career there was something wrong in furnham not just ben willets killing but something else that seemed to reside in the very bricks and mortar of the village frances had felt it and had been made uneasy by what shed called the whispering of the grasses if there was such a thing as a communal conscience he thought it was laden with guilt barber had been defending his wife and her family and that was understandable but the easy shift from surly to murderous was not common the club rutledge had taken from the man could have been lethal and the back windows of the pub looked out over the river offering a swift passage to the sea for an unwanted body the narrow estuary with few shallows to trap a corpse was at a guess not a quarter of a mile away the current running strong what was appalling was barbers certainty that his patrons would hold their tongues if hed killed the interloper in the pub hamish said if someone there killed yon victim ye willna ever ferret him oot and rutledge believed him whatever had knit that village together so tightly ben willet had escaped it and rutledge found it hard to believe that hed been punished for it so many years later what then had he done in the past few months that had put him beyond the pale but what to make of the fact that the body in gravesend was not russells what to make of ben willets passing himself off as another man while confessing to murder was that what had put willet beyond the pale had his conscience driven him to bring a murder to the attention of scotland yard in the only way hed dared the next step then was to find major wyatt russell and see what he had to say chapter when the gates of rivers edge loomed ahead the pineapples atop the posts promising a hospitality that was far in the past late as he was rutledge stopped the motorcar and got out he had come earlier with a different perspective the house had belonged to a confessed murderer or so hed been led to believe and for all he knewgiven the reluctance of the man passing himself off as wyatt russell to give any details of his crimethe body could still be somewhere here with his sister present hed been content to look at the house and grounds noting the marshes across the river and on either side of the acres of once smooth lawn on which the house had been set and it had seemed all too likely that the house had remained closed because the memories it evoked were disagreeable now as he walked down the long brushchoked drive and made his way around to the riverfront he had a clearer picture in his mind of the people who once had lived in this house standing on the terrace he gazed out over water dancing in the sunlight with an almost macabre gaiety on a warm august day when the clouds of war were gathering on the horizon and threatening her son as another war had taken her husband mrs russell had gone down these shallow steps and walked to the rivers edge had worry for her son really taken her there and had that worry been strong enough to drive the woman to suicide nevertheless shed vanished the police had been satisfied still it was possible that they had heard what they wanted to hear and when there was no evidence to the contrary it was easier to accept the unlikely nor had her son questioned the verdict or appealed to the chief constable for scotland yard to intervene it would be easier to accept a confession by the false wyatt russell that he had killed his mother not justin fowler that brought up another issue would elizabeth russell have killed herself and left behind the three children that she had once thanked god for giving her there seemed to be no good reason to suspect murder unless of course wyatt russell had learned almost a year later that fowler had killed his mother and hidden her body if that was the case how did ben willet come to have mrs russells locket standing there watching the river moving silently toward the north sea he found himself wondering why when mrs russell had disappeared the family had sent for the police in tilbury more than an hour away and it had been tilbury who had asked for the help of the villagers not wyatt russell on both occasions when hed been in furnham rutledge had seen neither a police constable walking along the street nor a police station he himself hadnt sought out the local man because he was still in the early stages of the inquiry and willets murder had occurred in london not rivers edge but there must be a constable in the village surely a womans angry voice cut into his reverie and hamish was warning him to beware what the devil do you think youre doing this is private property she came striding through the french doors at his back and he knew her as soon as he turned although the expression of the living face was very different from the one in the locket he had carried with him to furnham miss farraday i think he asked pleasantly and watched her go as still as if she had been carved from marble who are you her voice was guarded cold my name is rutledge he told her and i may ask you the same question what are you doing here this property as far as i know was not left to you by the previous owner it was a shot in the dark but it struck a spark are you wyatts solicitor she snapped at the moment im representing him rutledge replied she was very attractive with more spirit than hed expected from her photograph she had also changed in other ways there was a maturity about her that wasnt present six years ago the girl had grown into a very selfassured young woman im looking to buy the property is it for sale she asked is that why youre here even in its present sad condition i doubt that you could afford to buy it and then keep it up an angry flush flared in her cheeks i have come into my inheritance she retorted you can speak to my own solicitors if you dont believe me how did you arrive here i didnt see a motorcar or a carriage in the drive i came by boat but he hadnt seen a boat by the landing stage either its a launch i rented it upriver its tied up out of sight she read the doubt in his face theres another place where a boat can tie up the tradesmans entrance to his surprise she laughed yes as a matter of fact the russell who built rivers edge didnt wish to see viands and coal and other goods carried across his hardwon lawn the path leads directly to the kitchen what do you do come here once a fortnight to see that all is well i noticed when last i came that someone had walked up the drive the grasses were bent over and even broken here and there how often do you come when the spirit moves me she countered how did you get into the house when i left no one thought to ask me for my key when did you leave before the war she answered evasively why did you leave she pondered that her eyes taking on the expression of someone staring into the long and unforgiving past a very good question i expect it was because i felt it was the right thing to do indeed its a lovely day would you care to bring out two chairs we could sit here and enjoy the afternoon sadly theres no one to bring us our tea never mind and i must warn you i promised to have the launch back no later than five oclock he did as she asked walking into the house for the first time the room behind the french doors was spacious with a marble hearth set across from the long windows the high ceiling was decorated with plaster roses and swags of floral garlands while trellises of lemon and peach roses climbed the wallpaper several chairs and settees what he could see of them beneath the shrouding dust sheets were covered in pale green and soft yellows the effect was tranquil an indoor garden created for a womans pleasure he found two chairs that would do removed the sheets covering them and carried them out to the terrace cynthia farraday was standing where hed left her staring out over the river she turned as he set a chair down near her with a clear view across the lawns to the water and she smiled sitting down and stretching her booted feet out in front of her heaven she said as he took the other chair i have always loved this terrace aunt elizabethmrs russellused the garden room more than any other and i could understand why the two go together dont you think i spent many happy hours there when did you arrive here today he asked i came just after noon in fact ive missed my luncheon i didnt think to bring any sandwiches with me how long did you intend to stay not this long but then i didnt have the courage to bring out a chair it felt somehowwrongto disturb the furniture as if it were all sleeping did you live here as a child what do you remember most about it youre very inquisitive for a solicitor but since you were gallant enough to bring out our chairs ill answer that i remember being happy for the most part of course in the beginning i missed my parents terribly wyatt did his best to amuse me out of kindness knowing how i grieved and not very long afterward another cousinwyatts not minecame here to live and the three of us passed an agreeable few years together and then we all grew up and it was vastly different her voice had taken on a sad note what happened to them youre the solicitor you tell me justin never came home from the war and russell married but lost his wife and his child at the same time he was a widower and he still loved you that last was a guess based on what nancy brothers had told him but it clearly found its mark cynthia farraday stirred uneasily you know too much have you been prying hardly just fleshing out the facts how did you get on with mrs russell she liked me at first i was a lost child in need of mothering and she treated me like a daughter i was fond of her and it was comforting to have a home again id been so frightened when my parents died and everything changed they wouldnt let me stay in the london house where i felt safe and everything was familiar they told me it was for the best to go to strangers they my fathers solicitors very officious old menwell i thought them old at the timewho kept telling me it was what my parents would have wished but i was just as certain theyd have wished nothing of the sort you said earlier for the most part at first the three of us wyatt and justin and i did everything together it helped me heal i think and i expected it would always be that way but we grew up as children tend to do and wyatt thought hed fallen in love with me sadly i wasnt in love with him aunt elizabeth encouraged him at least so i thought i was too young at the time to realize that she might truly have liked to keep me in the family i believed she was pushing us together for his sake and id have none of it i wasnt a very pleasant child i expect its logical isnt it she knew you well you stood to inherit from your parents when you came of age which meant you were russells equal socially and financially and you were already friends i should think she was pleased to see rivers edge in good hands for another generation her son could have made a worse choice she took a deep breath in fact he did the woman he married was hardly what any of us would have chosen as the future mistress here she hated the marshes for one thing justin told me that when wyatt brought her down to see rivers edge she refused to spend the night even though her sister was with her and she felt it was silly to keep a country house servants and the like when they could live in london then why did russell marry her i dont really know unless he didnt much care anymore he wanted an heir i expect and she was enthralled with the idea of a military wedding uniforms and raised swords and a husband going off to fight for king and country she told me that it was just too exciting for words i told wyatt he could have scoured england and not found anyone quite so selfish that was rather unkind dont you think she shrugged i told him the truth that his mother would have been appalled that was the day before he was to be married and i havent seen him since then why should you wish to buy rivers edge because it stands empty i cant bear that i could live here there are no ghosts here for me but that wasnt what she had told the rector what do you believe happened to mrs russell i dont know at the time i thought it was my fault that id disappointed her and she wanted to punish me i was too young to understand that it probably had nothing to do with me or wyatt falling in love with me or justin being angry with him for spoiling everything for all three of us i heard him tell wyatt that he hated him but of course he didnt not really i remember telling someone that id wished i had been a boy and then none of this would have ever happened someone who did you confide in thats none of your business she snapped as if already regretting shed given so much away was it by any chance someone from furnham by the name of ben willet as he spoke he was watching her eyes and he thought that once again hed found his mark but she shook her head and evaded his question i didnt know furnham very well a few of the shops where i could purchase things without having to go all the way to london or having them sent out to rivers edge without the pleasure of choosing what i liked ben willet went on to become a footman in thetford did you know did he was he happy there do you think he smiled inwardly at her answer but willet knew you my girl and wore your photograph until the day he died the question is how did he come by that locket they sat there in silence for a time as rutledge considered what she had told him so far certainly encountering her here had saved searching london for her but it had brought him no closer to the truth about what had happened to ben willet or for that matter wyatt russell do you think it will be possible for me to buy rivers edge she asked looking him straight in the eye you must know ill see to the property i wont let him down i have no idea how mr russell will feel about that but you will ask i think it would probably come better from you she smiled but it was twisted as if the admission hurt her there youre wrong he rose she would have to leave soon and he was overdue in london and if he feels that he might wish to sell how will he find you tell him ill find him he might prefer to contact you himself my life is my own if he wishes to find me tell him to speak to my solicitors hamish said into the ensuing silence theres the man who let her take the launch shall i return the chairs to the house or do you wish to sit here a little longer ill close up she said her gaze once more on the river as if she saw the past there i should ask whats left in the house thats worth stealing this time the smile was amused dont you trust me still he left it unfinished anything of value is gone pictures on the wall jewelry silver in the pantry stored somewhere in london i expect i wouldnt make my fortune selling whats left but its lovely and familiar and id want to keep whats here if i could whatever happened to the locket that mrs russell wore every day of her life she was very still her eyes on his if they ever find heror her bodyit will be there i dont know that i ever saw her without it he nodded and walked down the broad steps from the terrace to the lawns making his way around the house to the drive without looking back he had let her believe he was a family solicitor she hadnt realized that he was a policeman he was of half a mind to go back and correct that impression but then he decided that this wasnt the time to put her on her guard if she had nothing to hide then no harm done chapter hamish who had only spoken once after miss farraday had stepped out onto the terrace was busy now in the back of rutledges mind as instead of taking the main road to london he drove along the headwaters of the river hawking searching for any spot where a launch could be rented there were only three tiny villages along this narrower section of the road mainly inhabited by families who made their living from the water and while there were any number of boats drawn up along the shoreline they were mainly skiffs rowing boats and other small craft hardly resembling a launch that someone like cynthia farraday could manage he persisted but everywhere he was met with a shake of the head nothing to hire here he was ready to concede that shed lied to him when he followed a rutted lane through high grass and saw his quarry actually stepping out of a sleek launch greeting a tall man in a white shirt and trousers realizing that this was a private landing stage used by sportsmenthe halfdozen boats here were a far cry from the rough craft hed seen until nowhe pulled up and waited it was clear that the man knew miss farraday well for they were laughing about something as he helped her secure the launch and then gestured toward the newly built shed to the left of the landing stage on the far side of that he could see the bonnets of two motorcars the late afternoon sun reflecting off the gleaming paint he hadnt been spotted he was sure of that and when the opportunity presented itself as miss farraday followed the man inside the shed shutting the door he reversed until hed reached the main road such as it was and considered his situation he could hardly approach the man after miss farraday had gone and ask who had borrowed the launch for the afternoon whoever he was he would undoubtedly report scotland yards interest in her as soon as he saw her again but it was just possible that if one of the motorcars was hers he could follow it back to the city through the evening traffic there had been a tumbledown barn some distance back the way hed come and rutledge decided it would offer some semblance of shelter he thought it likely that miss farraday hadnt seen his motorcar outside the gates of rivers edge because it wasnt visible from the house and he was fairly sure she hadnt followed him as far as the gates to make certain hed left there was no reason then that she would immediately recognize it even if he stayed behind her for miles he found the barn with no difficulty and was able to drag one of the doors open wide enough to back his motorcar inside pulling it nearly shut in front of the bonnet and he stood there in the narrow opening keeping watch the rank smell behind him was a mixture of damp rotted manure musty hay mildewed floorboards and bird droppings smothering a sneeze he listened to hamishs voice echoing through the rafters as a startled dove flapped away through a gaping hole in the roof he understood what hamish was saying that following cynthia farradays motorcar was unlikely to work that the yard could find her more readily but could it and once lost the opportunity might not arise again it was nearly half an hour before two motorcars came down the road in the first one he glimpsed cynthia farradays profile strands of light brown hair whipping around her face and in the second he could make out the white shirt of the man who had greeted her at the landing he gave them a fiveminute head start before going after them they had already made the turning toward london by the time he reached it and he had to drive faster than the rough road allowed before he sighted both motorcars in the distance it was not easy to keep up with the two of them as traffic increased on the road and an overladen lorry pulled out in front of him at his next sighting the man was ahead he thought they were playing tag one and then the other taking the lead which kept them occupied but made it more difficult to follow them hamish said it was a foolish notion his voice was gloating but rutledge was patient overtaking another lorry as soon as he could on his left the river thames flowed in golden glory as the sun moved lower in the western sky ahead he could just begin to see the tower of st pauls when the man with a short blare of his horn turned off toward the north the motorcar driven by cynthia farraday continued through the dingy outskirts of london where industry belched black smoke above their heads and then she was threading her way through even dingier streets where barrows and handcarts were a danger to motorcars and themselves as he watched she narrowly missed a barrow boy who had ignored the warning tap of her horn he shouted imprecations in her direction fist raised then turned to glare at rutledge as he passed he nearly lost her in the swirl of traffic around st pauls but then caught up with her again by guessing which direction she might have taken finally they were in a maze of streets in the west end where it was easier to keep her in sight and harder to hide himself behind other vehicles houses here were handsome taller and grouped around small fenced squares it was a part of the city rutledge knew well from his days as a constable with the metropolitan police new to the force and eager to prove himself cynthia farraday turned left from the main road and he recognized the square belvedere place with its tiny rectangular garden surrounded by tall white houses with dark mansard roofs spring bulbs had long since given way to perennials in full summer bloom it was a fashionable address he paused some thirty yards from the entrance to the square waited five minutes and then drove slowly past belvedere place searching for the farraday motorcar and he saw it stopped in front of a house at the far end of the square number he thought as he kept going it took him ten minutes to find a constable he was patrolling several streets away but rutledge was fairly certain the man would know the answer to his question showing his identification rutledge asked the man if he knew the name of the household at number belvedere place constable prettyman frowned aye that would be the raleigh family sir mother father four girls staff of five is there anyone in particular you would be wanting to know about a miss farraday indeed sir i dont believe theres anyone by that name in belvedere place but of course she could be visiting the family right enough shall i make inquiries sir no thank you he could hear hamish in the back of his mind nodding to the constable he drove on reversing at the first opportunity and returning to belvedere place as he reached the corner he looked for the farraday motorcar at the far end of the square but it had gone rutledge swore then found himself laughing cynthia farraday had outwitted him he had no idea when she had discovered that he was following herhe had been damned carefulbut he thought it must have happened shortly before she turned into belvedere place when his was the only motorcar in sight even though he had stayed well back and that he thought must mean that she had a reason to cover her tracks w hen he reached the yard he set sergeant gibson the task of locating cynthia farraday and wyatt russell i thought mr russell was dead in gravesend gibson reminded him so did i rutledge answered grimly but it appears the man is actually one ben willet but he said im aware of what he said the question now is where is the real mr russell and was willet even telling the truth about a murder in it could explain why this man willet was killed hed come to the yard with what he knew even if it was muddled like but from what rutledge had been able to discover in furnham it wasnt clear whether the two mens paths had ever crossed during the war then how had willet learned about what russell had done more to the point why should it matter to him and why the charade find russell and we could have a few answers he thanked gibson and walked on down the passage to his own office the duty sergeant had already informed him that chief superintendent bowles was not on the premises his being called to a murder scene in camdentown it was a reprieve of sorts offering rutledge an opportunity to think through the problem before having to present it to his superior bowles was not noted either for patience or for understanding he demanded answers without a thought given to the difficulty involved in finding them and rutledge had already had a taste of the mans hasty interpretation of information brought to him he sat down at his desk and turned his chair so that he could look out the window his view blocked by trees in leaf they cast cool shadows across the pavement as the sun settled in the west rivers edge was isolated and had stood empty for upwards of five years a perfect site for a quiet murder perhaps it had already seen one mrs russell he thought again that it would have made more sense if willet had come to the yard to confess to murdering her the question was had ben willet been killed because of the pastor for something else completely unrelated to his visit to scotland yard he wouldnt have been the firstnor the lastman to have a finger in too many pies hamish said dye believe the woman that she wished to purchase yon estate it was a sound enough reason to explain her trespassing id have said yes it was the truthuntil she played that game in belvedere place if she had nothing on her conscience she wouldnt have cared whether i discovered where she lived or not but what does she have to do with a footman from thetford who washed up in gravesend he set himself the task of finishing the paperwork waiting on his desk but his mind kept coming back to the riddle of ben willet mrs brothers had recognized his face but couldnt put a name to it that would say that willet could have come home to furnham from time to time but not often enough for nancy brothers to know who he was and the men in the rowing boat had been reluctant to identify willet in the photograph true barbers fatherinlaw was dying and the family had no wish to upset him with the news of his sons death but was that another convenient lie one that the man from scotland yard could investigate for himself and then accept at face value if so the people in that village held a poor view of the police the barkeep at the rowing boat had been ready to kill to keep the truth from coming out but what truth that willet was dead or that someone in furnham recognized him hamish said ye ken verra likely its no the fact that willet was dead but why he died they had come full circle signing the last of the papers in front of him rutledge rose and carried them down the passage to hand them over to constable benning back in his office once more he asked aloud where is wyatt russell it had been a rhetorical question but on the other hand if ben willet had felt safe in impersonating the man it could well mean that russell too was dead miss farraday didna appear to think he was deid rutledge left his office and went in search of sergeant gibson if anyone wants me im going back to essex i expect to return tomorrow afternoon where will you be staying if i should need to reach you gibson asked i doubt theres a telephone within thirty miles of furnham rutledge said hamish said something that he missed as gibson asked would it be best then to speak to the chief superintendent before you leave i think not rutledge replied and walked on on the stairs he realized what it was that hamish had tried to interject if there was no way the yard could reach him while he was in furnham then it would be equally impossible for him to reach the yard in the event there was trouble r utledge went home packed a small valise and set out for essex once more the sun was low on the horizon now and ahead lay the dark lavender clouds of the north sea where evening had already begun to encroach on the day and it was fully dark and very late when he pulled into yard of the dragonfly inn he had intended to call on mr morrison before he drove on to furnham but there had been no lights in the church and looking for the rectory would have taken more time than he could afford if he wanted a room for the night when he strode into the tiny reception there was no one behind the desk but a bell stood to one side of the register and he pushed it it sounded rusty with damp a grinding noise rather than a ring after a moment a man in his shirtsleeves appeared from the rear of the inn frowning as he realized that here was custom he didnt wish to serve looking for a room are you he said his manner surly sorry to say theyre all taken indeed rutledge answered before the man could stop him he reached out and turned the register around opening it to where the black ribbon marked the current page the last guest appears to have signed this page some ten weeks ago are you telling me hes still here theres no room available a problem with the roof im here to call on ned willet then youre too late he died not half an hour ago surprised rutledge said then im here for the funeral after a moment the man said grudgingly very well the room at the top of the stairs you wont be needing a key on the contrary i insist on a key as rutledge signed the register the man fished in a drawer eventually coming up with a key he passed it across the desk and rutledge pocketed it good night he said as he turned and took the stairs two at a time they curved slightly as they climbed and the first room was in fact just at the top on either side of his were two more rooms and across the passage were three others these overlooking the high street at the ends of the passage there were windows the shades already drawn for the night rutledge opened his door and fumbled for the lamp that must be near it finding it he struck a match and lit the wick as the flame strengthened he took in his surroundings the room wasnt very large but neither was it small enough to aggravate his claustrophobia there were two narrow beds a desk under the window and a small wardrobe with two doors turning the key in the lock he left it there and set his valise down between the beds the coverlets were faded a deep green that was now nearly the color of moss in the shade of a tree there was a medallion in the center of each with what appeared to be entwined initials but they were spotlessly clean and the room smelled faintly of lavender and pears soap it had been a long day walking to the open window and looking out he realized that his room was over the kitchen and just beyond the kitchen gardens a lighted window cast a golden glow over the rows of vegetables and as he watched someone walked past the beds and came up to the rear door of the inn he stood half concealed by the curtains and through the open window he could just hear what was being said even though whoever it was spoke in a low voice did they tell you the old man is gone yes molly stopped in on her way home there was silence for a moment and then the first voice said how is she well enough considering shes still grieving for young joseph it will be hard on her losing his dad molly and ned were close whose motorcar is that i see on the street in front of the inn belongs to a fellow by the name of rutledge yes i thought i recognized it what brings him back so soon he came for the funeral he says damn how did he know it just happened i told him there was no room to be had but he insisted how long does he expect to stay he didnt tell me there was a longer silence hell we can deal with him if we have to not in my inn no and then it appeared that the man in the shadows outside the kitchen must have left because the squares of light vanished and the garden was quiet enough that rutledge could hear the crickets he was nearly sure the man outside the kitchen door was barber from the rowing boat hamish said startling him i wouldna go wandering in the dark no here but sleep wouldnt come and hamish was fretful in the back of his mind as well in the end rutledge dressed went quietly down the stairs and out into the night the stars were bright in the blackness of the sky and across the road he could hear the unseen river moving toward the sea turning toward his left he walked to the edge of furnham and out into the countryside ahead he could just see the silhouetted barns that marked the three farms he was fairly certain that the airfield hadnt been built at the middle farm where nancy brothers and her husband lived and if he were choosing the land nearest the estuary would offer greater clearance for night fighters taking off in a hurry or crippled aircraft looking for an easy landing it would also afford a better view of zeppelins moving toward the mouths of the rivers that would point them directly into the heart of london france was not so very far away after all and there would be no problem with navigation over a short stretch of open sea looking over the low fence designed to keep cattle from roaming he could see the massive black bulk against the stars that would be the house and barn far enough away he thought that he could do a little exploring without awakening the owner the fence was rusted and broken in places although grasses and vines had mended the wire in their own fashion running up the posts and making a heavier barrier than the original one finding a short gap some twenty feet farther on he stepped through the tangle of briars and vines and into the field beyond he kept walking minding where he went and soon enough he could see where the airfield had been laid out including the rough foundations of the buildings that had been put up in haste where the actual flying field had been the texture of the grass and weeds was different moving back to explore the ruins again he tripped over a lowlying pile of stones and swore as he fought for his balance in the distance a dog began to bark and he stood still but it wasnt chained by the farmhouse as hed expected he could hear the barking growing louder as the animal raced toward him rutledge stayed where he was and when the dog was fifty feet away he whistled softly and held out one hand palm down the dog large and dark slowed legs stiff tail straight and the ruff on the back of his neck standing up rutledge dropped to his haunches and called come on theres a good dog speaking quietly until it approached all at once its tail dropped and began to wag and stretching out its muzzle the animal sniffed rutledges fingers it had been a good two years since the airfield had been shut down but clearly the dog remembered the men posted here and their friendliness and soon accepted rutledge as one of them letting this newcomer scratch behind its ears together they walked on across the field and then turned toward the barn here rutledge saw great stacks of wood and brick out behind the building where the thrifty farmer had retrieved what the royal flying corps had left behind in another pile were broken propellers cracked struts and even torn bits of canvas and metal where aircraft had crashed or been in a dogfight and the equally thrifty ground crew had salvaged what they could he wondered what the farmer intended to do with such bits the dog wandered into the farmyard and rutledge turned back the way hed come finding the gap in the fence was harder from this side but after several tries he came across it on the road again he walked toward the village he was almost there the river glinting in the distance when he heard oars in oarlocks and quiet voices echoing across the water then close by the sound of a boat being dragged up on the rough shale he stepped quickly into the shadows of the large plane tree at the bend in the road well hidden beneath the broad leaves weighing down the branches overhead three men strode up from the water silent and staying close to one another as they made their way along the side of the rowing boat keeping between the tall shrubs that marked the pubs boundary line and the darker shadows under the roof s overhang as they reached the high rutledge could see that each man carried a haversack slung over his left shoulder hunching a little under of the weight of it and under his right arm each man carried a shotgun the barrel just catching the starlight and glinting dully smuggling rutledge realized and slid deeper into the shadows until his back touched the smooth bark of the tree he stood no chance against three shotguns the men separated without a word two hurrying off up the high and the third coming directly toward him chapter there was nothing he could do but stand where he was his back pressed against the tree trunk his body braced for whatever he would have to do there was no time to pull his hat lower to cover the paleness of his face or even to turn away he carefully ducked his head so that his chin was nearly touching his collar and waited hamish his voice a low growl seemed to be waiting too just behind his shoulder but hamish was not there and no help if it came down to a fight rutledge watched as the man cut diagonally across the road grunting as he shifted the haversack a little to ease his shoulder fifty feet thirty twenty feet and closing near enough now to see him standing there surely and the men who had gone the other way were still within hearing one shout and theyd turn he could deal with one of them he even stood a good chance of disarming the man nearest him given the element of surprise the other two could bring him down from a distance and his only hope was to make it out of range before they fired barber had had no qualms about clubbing him to death these men would shoot first and worry later something in the way the man walked was familiar had he seen him before when he was here with frances just then only ten feet away the man grunted as he shifted the haversack again and the haversack was all that stood between them blocking the mans view of rutledge there under the tree he walked on whistling under his breath it also prevented rutledge from seeing the mans face he wouldnt have been able to identify him if his life had depended on it not in a courtroom there was just that instinctive recognition and it too could be wrong a door opened a little farther along on rutledges side of the street and then shut again as quietly as possible by that time it was too late to move away from the tree to see where the other two men had gone hamish said his voice seeming loud enough to be heard on the far side of the river ye ken this is why no one is happy to have scotland yard come to ask questions had they known anything about ben willets death or had they believed that it was only an excuse to look into other matters the inn was only a short distance ahead but rutledge waited until he was certain there were no watchers guarding the backs of the three men he was just about to move when someone detached himself from the recessed doorway of the rowing boat and turned to jog up the high street disappearing into the small village school he waited another ten minutes in case the watcher left the school and went home finally satisfied that he was in the clear he stepped quietly out of the shadow of the plane tree and walked without haste toward the inn rutledge had seen barberor in point of fact heard himat the kitchen door of the inn hardly more than an hour ago therefore he couldnt have been one of the three coming up from the river nor was he the watcher in the pubs doorway for that man was smaller in stature still rutledge wouldnt have been surprised to learn that barber was the force behind the smuggling smuggling wasnt unheard of along the southern coast of england even in this day fisherman had long ago learned that they could supplement their meager living from the sea by dropping in at a french port and making quiet arrangements with their opposite numbers war or peace men needed to eat and his majestys excise be damned but this last war with submarines as well as naval vessels and german raiders patrolling the seas must have curtailed the usual crosschannel trade much less fishing times would have been hard for villages like furnham the question was why had the village turned its back on the airfield which could have brought in muchneeded revenue to the shops and pub he reached the dragonfly without incident and as silently as possible climbed the stairs to his room the innkeeper was nowhere in sight and his room was as hed left it no one had come in to search it in his absence rutledge wouldnt have put it past the inns owner the next morning rutledge was grudgingly served his breakfast in the small dining room overlooking the street there were five tables crowded together cheek by jowl but he was the only guest tell me about the airfield he said to the young woman who was serving him she was pretty fair hair tending to curls in spite of rigorous attempts to keep it out of her face and her eyes were hazel he wondered if this was the molly who had brought news of ned willets death i dunno much about it sir she said i was only twelve when they came to build it and my mother saw to it that i had nothing to do with the young men who were posted here she said theyd break my heart by dying and there was no use to befriend them and she was right about the dying we saw three of them go down out over the water trailing smoke i was glad i didnt know them then still the airfield must have changed the way of life in furnham by sheer numbers if nothing else she cast a wary glance toward the kitchen door firmly shut it did that there was a scuffle or two between some fishermen and the men up at the farm after that they were ordered to stay behind the fence and we were left to ourselves still we got to hear things how they carried on in london on leave like there was no reckoning tomorrow how they took up with the girls and ruined them how they made the younger lads restless and eager to try things they had no business trying one of my brothers ran away to enlist he was mad to fly but he was only fifteen my father had to go and fetch him home it was a terrible time really the men would roar up the road in their motorcars and motorcycles and three or four even had boats of their own and it was hard enough fishing without them stirring up the river we were that glad when the war ended and they went away someone in the kitchen began to bang pots and pans she reached for his empty toast rack and hurried toward the kitchen to refill it putting an end to any conversation over the racket he could hear a male voice shouting at her rutledge found himself thinking that to the people of furnham isolated and insular the murder of an unknown archduke in sarajevo held little importance in the course of their lives the arrival of strangers in their midstsome of them volatile and living only for today because they couldnt count on tomorrowwas immediate and personal furnham hadnt wanted changeor to change and it was thrust upon them without a byyourleave finishing his tea he didnt wait for his toast but as he walked out of the dining room into reception he heard someone crying in a corner behind the stairs he thought it was very likely the young woman who had served him there was nothing he could do and trying would only have made matters worse he went out to his motorcar and drove back to the farm where he had trespassed the night before he found the farmer in the milking shed busy washing down after the morning milking the man was ruddyfaced and broad in the chest a little taller than rutledge he looked up suspiciously as the stranger walked into the shed followed by the black dog busy wagging its tail as if it were well acquainted with the newcomer i thought you were here to protect us he said to the animal then turned to rutledge and what is it you want rutledge said easily my name is rutledge and you are names montgomery good morning mr montgomery i understand your farm was taken over during the war for use as an airfield montgomery bristled i had no choice in the matter your lot took my land without a word to me just walked in and told me that my best pastures and the marshes nearest the sea were now the property of his majestys government near enough and i had to find somewhere else for my cows to graze where those damned aeroplanes wouldnt frighten them into fits and somewhere else to grow my corn and my hay for the winter one of the aircraft crashed and caught fire the blaze nearly touched off my roof you wont persuade me to anything you could have in mind so you might as well turn around and walk out of here before i lose my temper im sorry im not here to ask anything of you other than information im interested in learning how furnham felt about the field i dont know why it should matter to you but the fact was i was vilified threatened youd have thought id written to the king personally and begged the lot of them to come here i was damned whichever way i turned if it hadnt been for samuel brothers and the other farms id have lost everything as it was it took me nearly a year to clear away the broken glass uproot the foundations and turn the landing field back to pasturage the latrines soured the land and there was oil and petrol everywhere i did it myself and no one volunteered to help me the rabblerousers were all for sabotage but nothing came of that still there were clashes id not have been surprised to see murder done on either side the fliers called this a hardship post no one wished to be assigned here we even had a few american aviators from thetford and three of them died here that upset my wife i can tell you when a man burns the smell doesnt go away for days you mentioned americans coming in from the field in thetford did you know that ned willets son was in service there ben i cant tell you when i last saw him it was before the war i know that is he coming down for the funeral ned was a decent sort i was that sorry to hear hed died ben willet himself is dead he was found floating in the thames nearly a week ago ben now thats sad news he shook his head my wife called him a changeling nonsense of course but he wasnt like the rest he came here with his father one summer needing work a boy of twelve mucking out the stables and the like she lent him books and i found him once in the loft reading he was that upset thinking i would sack him did you know wyatt russell or justin fowler i knew who russell was and his father before him who was fowler he came to live at rivers edge when he was orphaned i doubt i ever set eyes on him what do they have to do with young willet drowning i dont know scotland yard is looking into his death thats why im here before he died willet came to the yard and gave his name as wyatt russell saying that he had information about the murder of justin fowler he claimed he was russell now why would he go and do such a thing we havent discovered why did you often see cynthia farraday in furnham something in the mans expression altered my wife mattie never liked her why not she never would say except that she brought trouble in her wake and did she do you think he glanced over rutledges shoulder as if making certain his wife wasnt within hearing but he didnt answer the question instead he said when matties bitch had a litter miss farraday came here asking if she might buy one of them i was all for letting her have her pick but my wife wouldnt hear of it women do take odd notions sometimes she said the pups would be better drowned than given to her i found other homes for them it was a harsh judgment as if suddenly aware that hed been led off the subject montgomery added for scotland yard to be interested in ben willets death it must mean that he was murdered he was we cant find the connection between him and the russell family at rivers edge but there must have been one here you didnt tell ned before he died that his son was murdered he didnt deserve that ned was a hard man but a fair one and he was proud of that boy i didnt tell him i dont know if anyone else did was ben still in service at thetford what was he doing in london his family thought he was still there ill be speaking to his employers do you by any chance know their name i couldnt tell you if id ever heard it mentioned why did you come here to the farm it wasnt just the airfield that brought you was it rutledge smiled i was getting nowhere in furnham i thought you might have a different perspective that lot wouldnt help the devil put out the fires of hell i never knew what abigail saw in sandy barber but theres no accounting for tastes rutledge thanked montgomery and walked back to his motorcar the black dog trailing at his heels he went next in search of sandy barber and found him scrubbing down the floor of the pub the man looked up as rutledge approached his mouth turning down in a sour scowl getting to his feet he stood there waiting i kept my part of the bargain rutledge said without greeting i said nothing to ned willet as far as i know he died at peace now i want you to tell me what you know about his son ben setting his mop to one side sandy barber said i know nothing about ben or his death look im not here to hunt down smugglers who have you been talking to barber demanded who told you such a wild tale i didnt need to be told not after you nearly took a club to me if you hadnt killed ben willet there was only one other reason to be afraid of a policeman here on the hawking france just across the water the airfield must have been quite a problem theyd have been patrolling the river and the estuary you wouldnt have stood a chance getting past the coastguard with contraband goods it follows that someone resumed this business as soon as the airfield was evacuated i dont believe you suit yourself and as for murdering ben willet what reason would any of us have to go after him look in london or thetford it would make a hell of a lot more sense how often did he write to his sister or his father he hardly ever did we got a letter after he was demobbed and he said he would get in touch with us again as soon as hed settled in thetford that was that ned tried to say he was too busy but abigail thought there could have been a girl he was fond of and he spent all his free time with her what connection did he have with the russell family at rivers edge he didnt not so far as i know then why was he wearing a locket that had belonged to the late mrs russell with a photograph in it of cynthia farraday as a young girl good god sandy barber said blankly staggered by what hed just been told rutledge took the slender chain from his pocket and passed it to barber the man fumbled with the delicate clasp that closed the locket finally when it lay open in his fingers he stared at the photograph as if half afraid it would vanish before his eyes at last he said how do you know the locket belonged to mrs russell i asked someone who knew her well enough to have seen her wear the necklace every day of her life it was presumed that she was wearing it the day she disappeared but there must be dozens of lockets like this one how can anyone be surenot after what six years it was the summer before the war began that she died if i remember right so ive been told it makes no sense how did ben come by such a thing who was in charge of the investigation into her death the family called in an inspector from tilbury none of us think much of constable nelson hes drunk half the time these days and stays in his cottage minding his own business then why havent you asked for him to be replaced you know damned well why nelson turns a blind eye because he has a taste for french brandy there was contempt in his voice and better the devil you know where can i find constable nelson he lives in a cottage half way down martyrs lane can you tell me the name of the family willet worked for in thetford damned if i know rutledge couldnt judge whether he was telling the truth or deliberately being obstructive ill speak to nelson then as he turned to leave he had the feeling that barber was about to say something more but the man thought better of it and rutledge let it go hed said nothing about witnessing the smuggling run making what appeared to be an educated guess about the resumption of the contraband trade even on such a small scale was one thinghaving proof that it still went on was another three short lanes ran north from the high street away from the river barber himself lived on the nearest of these the last was martyrs lane about halfway down it stood a weathered cottage with a bedraggled front garden surrounded by a wrought iron fence sadly in need of paint hamish said skeptically its no verra promising rutledge stopped before the gate for a moment then reached over lifted the rusted latch and made his way up the overgrown path he knocked several times and finally tried the door it wasnt locked and he opened it calling constable nelson as he stepped inside the hall was dusty but presentable enough in contrast the front room of the cottage looked to rutledge as if the constable had lived in it used dishes sat on every flat surface a quilt had been thrown over one chair in front of the hearth and the carpet looked as if it hadnt been swept in months a stained and creased shirt had been thrown on the floor and a crumpled pair of stockings had been tossed into a corner the desk where the constable was expected to conduct official business was littered with teacups opened tins of fruit and several pairs of boots in need of polish a thick fuga combination of cigarette smoke unwashed clothing and brandy made him cough the room appeared to be empty and rutledge was on the point of trying another when his shod foot collided with an empty bottle sending it spinning under the nearest table it was then he saw the constable on the floor behind the divan his first thought was that the man was dead he strode to the constables side and knelt to feel for a pulse just then nelson snored raucously and rutledge realized that hed passed out the constable lay where he must have fallen his face turned to the wall his collar undone and his tunic unbuttoned his shirt was stained with food and his boots appeared not to have been polished for some time the toes scuffed and dull rutledge rose and touched the man with the toe of his boot and none too gently constable nelson the man didnt move constable nelson it was the voice of command this time and nelsons body jerked his lids fluttered and then revealed a pair of bloodshot eyes that could barely focus who are you he demanded in a hoarse croak scotland yard get to your feet man youre a disgrace to your uniform nelson tried to rise fell back and vomited profusely disgusted rutledge said ill give you an hour clean yourself up and present yourself at the dragonfly ill be waiting he turned and walked out slamming the inner door and then the outer one knowing full well the shock to nelsons ears but it was easy to see what had happened to the man shunted aside by the villagers paid in contraband to eke out his meager resources and keep him too dulled to interfere and without the strength to stand up for himself in these circumstances he had accepted his lot someone must have seen to it that he was sober and presentable if or when the need arose or the chief constable would have got wind of his condition and replaced him long since the question was even fully sober could nelson still function hamish said more to the point he wouldna be trusted by the ithers there was that as well rather than return directly to the inn to wait rutledge made a detour to barbers house he could see the black crepe that had been hung over the door and several neighbors were just leaving embracing abigail barber as they stepped outside behind them the rector was preparing to leave also as rutledge approached he heard morrison asking a last question about the service for ned willet and from the shadows of the front room someone answered he could see the outline of a head and broad shoulder but not the face it wasnt barber he was nearly certain it was the man he had seen twice before once when he had come to furnham with frances and once when he had tried to find someone willing to identify the photograph of ben willet whether he had been one of the smugglers coming up from the river in the middle of the night rutledge couldnt be sure under oath but he had a strong feeling he had been the rector offered a last word of comfort to a tearful redeyed abigail barber touched her briefly on the arm and with a nod to the man just behind her walked away as he reached the lane he looked up and saw rutledge waiting good morning morrison said surprised rutledge said i thought you were not welcomed in furnham they fell in step walking to where morrison had left his bicycle leaning against the nearest tree i thought you had returned to london i still havent solved the riddle of a dead man i understand morrison collected his bicycle and pushed it along with him as they continued toward the high street ned was one of my parishioners he was always one to question but he came to believe that he was safer in the church than out of it rutledge smiled a wise man i think a careful one abigail liked to attend services with him and sandy tried to put his foot down but ned told him to worry about the state of his own soul who was the man standing behind mrs barber as you were leaving just now morrison had to think for a moment i expect it must have been timothy jessup hes abigails uncle her mothers brother not what you would call the friendliest of souls the jessups have always kept to themselves but for all that the rest of the village listens to them when they do voice an opinion ive never quite worked out why but there you are villages have their own hierarchy inherited down the generations i should think rutledge waited until they had moved out of earshot of several women carrying dishes covered with linen cloths on their way to the willet house then said when i left the church yesterday i decided to look in at rivers edge i expected to find the house closed and empty as it was before instead miss farraday was there she gave me to understand that she was interested in purchasing the house if russell intends to put it up for sale cynthia farraday morrison turned to stare at him i had no idea he left it there busy coming to terms with this piece of news i had no idea he said again they came to the high street and morrison pulled his bicycle around preparing to mount it you said miss farraday he went on concentrating on adjusting the band around his trouser legs that must mean she never married apparently not but he had not asked her name he had greeted her by it and she had not contradicted him or used we in her subsequent conversation i see with a nod to rutledge he pedaled briskly out of furnham rutledge watched him go he hadnt told the rector the identity of the face in the photograph it was up to barber to find the right opportunity to break the news to his wife first hamish commented yon priest hes afraid to linger and yet hed ventured into the village to offer comfort to abigail barber and would very likely conduct the service for her father why had he stayed so long in a parish where hope was outpaced by the knowledge that he was not wanted here like yon constable he hasna anywhere else to go chapter rutledges ultimatum to constable nelson was sixty minutes it was closer to ninety when he finally walked through the door of the inn and found rutledge standing in reception waiting impatiently but the constable had bathed shaved changed his shirt and brushed his tunic and trousers until they were at least presentable there was nothing he could do about his bloodshot eyes and a face gray from fighting down his nausea his hands shook as well and he seemed not to know what to do with them pressing the palms against his trousers he was out of condition and rutledge could see that he was running to fat around his middle for the last button on his tunic was straining across his belly and yet he was a younger man than rutledge had thought when hed seen him lying in a stupor on the floor thirtyeight forty constable nelson reporting sir the man said unable to keep the resentment out of his voice inspector rutledge scotland yard lets walk shall we they left the inn and turned toward the hawking you were here before the war were you yes sir im going on my twelfth year in furnham nelson answered uneasily as he tried to see what it was that this man from london wanted of him good im here to ask questions about one ben willet and also about the former inhabitants of rivers edge whats he done then ben willet he was found in the thames a few days ago murdered nelsons eyebrows flew up indeed sir murdered he was a quiet sort not one youd expect to be in trouble much less murdered does abigail barber know shes his sister barber is waiting for the proper time to tell her shell take it hard he paused were you thinking it was someone from rivers edge who killed him i dont see that being likely sir was ben willet here in furnham when mrs russell went missing nelson frowned in fact i believe he was sir now you ask his mother was taken ill of a sudden and he got permission to come and see her he was one of the searchers as i remember what do you think happened to mrs russell as to that i dont really know sir tilbury handled the inquiry i was asked to leave the matter to them why because there was hard feelings between the family and furnham i cant tell you why only that they wanted no part of me they spoke to the chief constable of course he did what he had to do and called in tilbury her body was never found thats difficult to believe if she drowned which seems to be likely surely it would have washed up somewhere between rivers edge and the sea the currents tricky sometimes especially after a storm theres no telling whether shed have been found if shed washed up in the marshes on the other side of the hawking theres inroads that the storms have made a body could lie in one of them for weeks without being discovered someone must have searched that side of the river yes sir they did all the same no one not even the likes of ned willet knows all the secrets of those marshes he stopped at the waters edge where it lapped gently at the toes of his boots can i ask you what this has to do with ben willets death it seems that he was carrying a photograph of miss farraday in a locket that had once belonged to mrs russell apparently she was wearing it on the day she vanished ill be damned nelson said are you sure of that sir rutledge took out the locket and held it up see for yourself its been identified as belonging to mrs russell nelson took it tentatively as if he had no right to touch it as to that sir i cant tell you that this belonged to mrs russell any idea where wyatt russell might be did he even survive the war i heard that he had but thats all i was told that he could very well have killed one justin fowler in mr russell sir nelson shook his head i dont see him as a murderer who told the police such a thing it was ben willet nelson stared at him but how could he know willet i mean did you speak to him yourself how did that come about willet came to the yard a fortnight before his death where did he join the army do you know with the men of furnham or in thetford he was in thetford when he enlisted so i was told by ned willet he had friends there and joined with them rutledge said i shall have to go to thetford but this isnt a good time to ask mrs barber where to find the house if i ever knew ive forgot nelson said looking away they watched a heron lift off from the far side of the river and fly toward the distant mouth in that strangely elegant slow motion that marked their flight then the two men turned back toward the high we never really knew ben if you take my meaning nelson said after a moment he wasnt like the rest of them eager to go to sea as soon as they could or if they werent fishermen to work the farm or mind the greengrocers shop furnham is set in its ways you can see that for yourself it looks to the sea not to london at first i didnt understand i thought they were all benighted but i came to like the way things were done here i didnt want to leave where did you live before in the fen country not all that different in some ways from the marshes as far as the land goes a hundred years different in our way of seeing things but you couldnt be the village constable and still shut your eyes to the smuggling at the expression of alarm on nelsons face rutledge said i saw the brandy bottle on your floor its only my business if it has anything to do with the murder of ben willet nelson took a deep breath there was a suggestion of resentment in his voice overlaid with guilt if id told london what i suspected about the smuggling id have had to leave furnham i knew that from the start i made my choice it hasnt been much of a life for you the constable shrugged i was never an ambitious man on the surface that was evident and yetwhat had he left behind what had he turned his back on that made spending his days and nights in a drunken stupor a better way of life they had reached the dragonfly nelson pointed to the sign above the door creaking on its hinges as the wind picked up that was the name of a ship did you know a smugglers craft no he shrugged again not that it matters what do you want of me sir do you think the murderer is here in furnham am i to help you search him out i dont know id hoped you could tell me something about willet and the russells that would explain what connected the two men all ive found is the disappearance of russells mother in your place id look in london ben willet was away from furnham long enough to have made enemies somewhere theres no one here who wanted him dead but hamish didnt believe him stirring restlessly and warning rutledge perhaps i will he saw the relief in nelsons eyes and added youll send for me if you learn anything to the contrary nelson promised but rutledge knew even as the words were spoken that the constable had no intention of keeping that promise and contacting him whatever he might learn his duty was to furnham not to scotland yard rutledge nodded and walked on into reception head down nelson turned toward his home rutledge wondered what repercussions there might be for the constable now that hed been seen talking to scotland yard even if he had told london nothing of importance the clerk was behind the desk sorting through papers and he looked up as rutledge approached wheres the churchyard he asked and the man stared at him as if hed asked directions to the moon there must he thought be a shorter way to get there than driving out of the village the churchyard presumably you have one i understand ned willet will be buried there tomorrow ah reassured the clerk said if you go down past his daughters house theres a road beyond well not much of a road at that more of a track that has seen better days follow it west and youll find the churchyard rutledge thanked him and went out to his motorcar hamish said what really kept yon constable in furnham id like to know rutledge silently replied as he turned the crank its as if everyone in this village has a guilty conscience he followed directions driving down the lane past the barber house quiet now the door shut and saw that just beyond there was indeed a road half hidden by the tall summer grasses when he reached it he realized that to the east it must run past the farm where hed interviewed nancy brothers eventually circling back into furnham from this vantage point he had a very clear view of the farm beyond hers where the land was still high enough for good drainage and the other end of this track must lead to the rectory before debouching on the london road just as morrison had told him a loop as it were marching in parallel with the high street as he turned toward the west ahead across the marsh he could just glimpse the tops of yews and where there were yews there was usually a churchyard in the far distance he thought he saw the glint of sun on water another river or just one of those temporary pools that appeared after a heavy rain and soon vanished indeed the track under his tires was soft from the storm of the other night when he reached the churchyard the graves were to his surprise well kept the grass cropped short flowers blooming here and there where they had been planted at a headstone he could also see as he got out to walk among the graves that the village had buried its dead here for centuries for the older stones had settled crookedly any inscription on them long since covered by lichen or flaked into dust at the back of the churchyard marking the far boundary of graves he could see a pair of low tumuli they were long grasscovered mounds and surely not old enough to be prehistoric hamish said plague victims rutledge thought he was right it was often the practice to bury the dead quickly in limefilled trenches but he couldnt remember having seen any as clearly defined as these walking among the stones glancing at dates here and there he read the familiar names there were any numbers of willets and barbers brotherses and montgomerys going back generations and among them a score or more of other family surnames among the willets someonewas there a sexton herehad dug ned willets grave next to his were two memorial stones to his sons lost in the war behind a phalanx of tall yews stood a stone mausoleum as he approached it he could read the name incised above the grille that formed the doorway russell he was more than a little surprised to find it here he would have thought that the family would have preferred to bury its dead elsewhere ornate stone urns draped in the carved folds of mourning crepe were set to either side of the doorway they were empty and he realized that there was no one to care for them certainly not cynthia farraday did she ever come here and where was wyatt russell he stared into the shadowy interior trying to read the names on the marble squares that marked each interment but it was too dark and all he could decipher were the inscriptions on a pair of plaques nearest the grille the first was a memorial to captain malcolm arthur george russell his dates and the final inscription died of wounds received in the relief of mafeking below it was the memorial to his wife in loving memory of e mily elizabeth margaret talbot russell and the dates of her birth and her disappearance this was the plaque that morrison had spoken of the one villagers had objected to because of the possibility that mrs russell was a suicide he walked on beyond the lilacs that encircled the mausoleum as if setting it off in death from the village just as the circumstances of their material worth had set the occupants apart in life another ten steps and he stumbled over what he thought at first was a low stone wall marking the edge of the churchyard and nearly invisible in the thick grass that hadnt been mown here but it wasnt that sort of wall pushing aside the grass and brambles he followed it some distance before he reached the end and realized that it turned here the stones had been pulled apart and tossed about one or two with carvings that must have come from around a doorway others cut and dressed many of them were blackened as if they had been enveloped in flames ive found the missing church rutledge thought the much older one that had stood here next to its churchyard and it would make sense too that the russell mausoleum rather than being at the outer fringe of holy groundas it now appeared to behad actually stood nearest the church in its shadow where the russells could take their rightful place at the last trump he paced the breadth and then the length of the foundation it had been small like many early village churches and over the years after what must have been a disastrous fire stones must have found their way into byres and walls for stone was scarce out here and brick had been the main building material morrison the rector had talked about drainage issues and the church here was far enough from the river in flood stage to survive here too a crypt could be dug and the dead could lie in the earth not raised tombs there was no way to judge how long ago the church had burnedor even when it had been built had its fate been decided in the upheaval and dissolution of the monasteries under henry viii or had the long arm of cromwell reached even furnham with his strong puritan revulsion for anything that smacked of high church hamish said naught so dramatic verra likely it came down in a storm and yon village couldna afford to rebuild it rutledge smiled to himself depend on hamish to see the practical not the fanciful the staunch covenanter whose pragmatism had often made sense of the nonsense of war and military decisions walking back to the motorcar he said aloud furnham hasnt struck me as a godly place hamish retorted more than likely they fear the devil he continued along this illkept track and saw that a mile before it reached the london road a small cottage stood alone in a clearing the marsh grass beaten back and a pair of trees as tall as the low roof sheltering it rutledge would never have guessed that this was st edwards rectoryit looked far more like a farm laborers cottageif he hadnt noticed the rector his sleeves rolled to his elbow working in his garden morrison looked up just then seemed surprised to see rutledge in front of his house then quickly turned to look back the way the londoner had come it was an odd reaction as if he had expected to see that rutledge was being followed rutledge didnt stop with a single wave of his hand he went on to the crossroads and turned back toward furnham hardly a proper house for yon priest hamish said at a guess he preferred the cottage to living in furnham here in the open the motorcar was being whipped by a rising wind and looking ahead of him out over the north sea he could see the storm clouds gathering the rain had held off when hed come here with frances but this time the clouds kept their dark promise just as he pulled into the yard of the dragonfly the creaking of the inns sign on its post was drowned out as the rain came down in earnest at first a few large drops hitting the dust of the street and his bonnet as he got out of the motorcar and then with a flash of lightning a deluge swept across furnham like a gray curtain as he made a dash for the door shaking the rain off his hat he took the stairs two at a time and went into his room he knew at once that someone had searched it the photograph of the body of ben willet was safely in his motorcar and the locket that had belonged to mrs russell was still in his pocket what else could the intruder have been looking for he debated confronting the inns owner and decided against it standing by one of the windows in the passage he watched the lightning move up the river coming from the sea the thunder loud enough to rattle the sash in front of him at one point the very air seemed to turn blue around him and a tree shattered then went down with a roar he could hear above the thunder that followed someone shouted but he couldnt tell just where the lightning had struck even after the worst of the storm had subsided rain continued to fall but toward the east the clouds broke and a faint rainbow arced above the river to the west someone began using an axe to clear away the tree strong rhythmic blows and shortly afterward rutledge could hear the ring of a second axe as well it was nearly time for lunch and he decided not to dine in the inn but to go up the high street to the same tearoom where he and frances had stopped he could see as he left the inn that a tree had fallen across the road where the bend led toward the outlying farms jessup was one of the men with an axe the welcome in the shop was no warmer than before but he was served a sandwich a cup of tea and a banbury bun there were several women at two of the other tables and the topic of conversation appeared to be the death of ned willet one of the women was saying do you suppose ben will come for the funeral sandy told me that abigail had written to him when her father took ill but theres been no word there was a silence filled only with the strokes of the axe and then one of her companions said havent you heard he was murdered in london nooh no i hadnt the woman shook her head what a terrible blow do they know who killed him and whats abigail to do first ned and now ben he was the last of those willet boys how is she holding up sandy hasnt told her yet she was fond of ben the first woman said he didnt return the feeling the third woman put in how many times has he shown his face here too good for the likes of us yes well when youre in service i daresay you do as youre told the second woman retorted hurrying to his defense he came home when his mother was so ill the third woman reminded her companions just goes to show i say rutledge finished his meal paid for it and then walked over to the table where the three women sat you knew ben willet he asked do you recall where he was in service the house is in thetford they stared at him shocked that he would approach them i had intended to ask abigail barber but didnt wish to intrude on her grief he carried on the third woman said youre the man from london yes scotland yard they glanced at one another apparently of two minds about helping him but rutledge had the feeling that they didnt know the answer themselves then the second woman said if it will spare abigail any more grief ill tell you the familys name is lawson ned claimed the house was twice the size of rivers edge he thanked her and left he drove back toward london until he found the turning to the north coming up from the ferry in tilbury but the roads had suffered in the rain and it wasnt until well after dinner that he reached the outskirts of thetford it took nearly half an hour more to locate the house he was after the local police informed him that there was no one by the name of lawson or lawlor but he might try one alfred laughton who owned a fairsize estate some three miles out on the bury road it was set well back from the main road and difficult to see in the dying light contrary to what the woman in the tea shop had told him it was most likely the same size as rivers edge possibly even a little smaller but in a far better state of repair the gardens were immaculate and the fountain in front of the door was splashing audibly in the quiet of the evening even the mortar between the bricks was smoothly dressed without cracks or crevices there were gas lamps lit by the door their flames flickering gently he lifted the brass knocker and let it fall against the plate behind it after several minutes a maid answered the door her uniform crisp and her manner formal he identified himself and asked for mr laughton ill see if he is receiving visitors sir she left him in the spacious hall and returned finally to invite him to step into the library he found mr laughton there a man of perhaps fifty in evening dress his right sleeve empty and pinned at the shoulder he was standing with his back to the open windows at the far end of a richly appointed room the gilt and leather bindings on the shelves catching the lamplight while comfortable chairs were arranged by the cold hearth mr rutledge he said in greeting good evening sir i regret the intrusion but im investigating a crime in london information has led me here where i believe you have employed a footman by the name of benjamin willet good god laughton said blankly willet he was employed here before the war a good man as i remember very conscientious like everyone else he enlisted as soon as he couldgiving us a months notice mind you typical of him and did he come home from the war laughton took a deep breath no he didnt thats to say he survived the war and his place was waiting for him as wed told him it would be but two months after the armistice he wrote to us from london to say that he had discovered a new vocation what was it he didnt say but his letter was enthusiastic as if whatever it was strongly appealed to him and he asked if we would mind keeping the boxesthose he left with us when he went into the armyuntil he could send for them now that i think about it i dont believe he ever did and youve had no further correspondence from him to my knowledge no but he might well have written to someone on the staff would it be possible to speak to them and to look at the belongings he left here tonight im afraid so its a pressing inquiry rutledge added well let me see if thompson can help you find them he crossed the room to ring the bell by the hearth saying in the war were you it was a common question a way of judging a man that hadnt existed before when position and money determined who or what he was war thought rutledge with irony was a great leveler yes sir i commanded scots troops on the somme and elsewhere did you by god bloody work that he touched his sleeve left my hand there and they took my arm in hospital ended my war straightaway i can tell you but they kept me busy at the war office for another year replacing younger men freeing them for service he sighed heavily and they all died you know every damned one of them i felt somehow responsible ah heres thompson inspector rutledge is looking into a crime in london do you think you could lay hands to those boxes willet left behind i dont think anything was ever done with them the butler was late middleaged his hair graying they are still there sir we didnt feel it was right to get rid of them wed hoped young willet would come for them one day of course the war has been over for two years still and all we thought it best yes quite right thompson can you see to it and the inspector would like to speak to the staff as well those who remember young willet indeed sir if youll come this way inspector rutledge thanked laughton and was about to follow thompson to the door when he was stopped i say you dont believe willet is in any way involved in this business whatever it may be to tell the truth would forewarn thompson and the staff rutledge fell back on standard police formula at this stage of the inquiry im not at liberty to say more i will tell you that there is no danger of benjamin willet being taken into custody at any time laughton accepted that at face value good good id hate to think hed been in any sort of trouble good night then i wish you luck thompson shut the door and ushered rutledge to another under the main stairs where a short flight led down into the kitchen and the servants hall well begin with the staff if you dont mind sir they happen to be available at the moment rutledge could now see that the servants were just clearing away the dinner served in the family dining room upstairs and preparing to eat their own meal thompson explained who this visitor was and why he had come rutledge thanked him and added did any of you correspond with willet on a regular basis the woman in the black dress of a housekeeper said we all took turns writing to him and to the others who went away and hed answer us very interesting letters about france and the war and whatever news he might have when he came home he mentioned that he wished to try something new and if it didnt work out hed like to know he was still welcome here but thats the last weve heard is he all right what has young willet got to do with scotland yard im not at liberty to say he told them once more do you know what it was that he wished to try and was he expecting to remain in london i do remember he was staying with a friend one of the housemaids answered shyly i thought perhaps it was someone hed met in the army it was nice stationery the cook added we commented on that very thick very expensive a house in chelsea the other housemaid added he said there was no room in the house in chelsea for his boxes and would mr thompson here keep them safe until he could send for them i thought perhaps he might have been taken on as a valet by one of the officers hed served under beyond that they had no more information to offer him thompson thanked them for their cooperation and conducted rutledge to the servants stairs he followed the butler up several flights to the floor where the staff slept halfway down the passage a separate staircase led up to a closed door thompson took out a ring of keys and unlocked it there were electric lights in the attic illuminating the rafters and the detritus of generations who had shared the same house trunks and boxes castoff furniture outgrown toys cluttered the floor two long shelves on either side of the attic housed a collection of oil lamps candlesticks and an array of hat boxes thompson led him down the room to an open space under the eaves where several boxes had been stored well bound with heavy string and marked with the name willet in large letters there you are sir i thought they might still be here i doubt anyone has touched them since young willet left id like to open them rutledge said can we drag them out into the middle of the floor yes sir but you will be careful will you not inspector he may still wish to claim them willet would never claim them still rutledge respected the butlers concern they carried the boxes out to the nearest overhead bulb and set them down pulling forward a stool and a chair thompson took out his pocketknife and carefully cut the string there you are sir he said again rutledge sat in the chair and took out the first layer of items mostly shoes and clothing that willet had worn in the course of his duties in the house below that were several newspapers now yellow with age reporting events leading up to britains declaration of war against germany there were even half a dozen broadsheets setting out where men could go to enlist replacing the newspapers and then the clothing under thompsons watchful eye he set the first box aside and opened the next one this seemed to include items that were in willets room here in the laughton household and more clothing of the sort he might wear on his half day off there was a photograph of a fishing boat presumably his fathers framed in tarnished silver plate and a cutting from a newspaper also framed showing a woman standing in front of a display of flowers the caption beneath it read miss cynthia farraday and the prizewinning orchids at the london flower show the date on the newspaper just visible at the edge of the frame was april she was as young as the face in the locket smiling for the camera while one hand lifted a spray of orchids so that the photographer could capture it better hamish said he knew her knew who she was silently agreeing rutledge replaced the contents as carefully as hed lifted them out and reached for the third box inside it were several booksone was a volume of poetry the other a onevolume collection of shakespeares plays and the last was a novel by an american writer henry james beneath these were a stack of copybooks the sort that children used to practice their penmanship i dont know that you should look at those thompson said as rutledge took one and prepared to open it they may be private papers but rutledge had no choice it was difficult to decipher the handwritingit was close together and cramped the better to fit more lines to the page he thought at first that this was a sort of diary and then he realized it was not the heading on the first page he came to was chapter seventeen and there followed a paragraph describing a village in france it was in fact more fanciful than accurate although the writing was very good the next paragraph picked up a thread from what was presumably the preceding chapter for a woman was looking for a particular house she found it on a side street and stood for a moment in the rain trying to decide whether to knock at the door or walk on her internal monologue as she debated what to do was extraordinarily good rutledge looked up from his reading did you know about these did anyone willet had a room to himselfthere was only the one footman you seeand he spent a good deal of his free time there especially in the evenings when the family wasnt entertaining or had gone out to dine one of the housemaids accused him of being too good to associate with the rest of the staff in the servants hall but he told her that he liked to read and this was his only opportunity rutledge took out another of the copybooks and read a few pages it was not as good as the work in the first one apparently ben willet was trying to write a novel for there were only seventyfive pages here and the writing broke off with a splatter of ink as if he had been disgusted and thrown the pen down he had begun again in another copybook and that one also stopped abruptly his third attempt showed promise and by the fourth he lacked the experience to tell the tale he had in mindwitness the incorrect description of a french village that was vaguely reminiscent of essexbut his characters showed depth and maturity thompson was growing restless clearly eager to go back to his interrupted dinner reluctantly rutledge put the copybooks back in the order in which hed removed them and said this will do for now thank you thompson helped him carry the boxes back to where theyd found them and the two men left the attic turning out the light as they reached the stairs was it a diary sir thompson asked clearly worried about what his former footman had seen fit to write about the family and the staff not precisely rutledge replied i should leave the copybooks where they are they will do no harm thank you sir they had reached the kitchen and thompson said i still have duties requiring my attention mary will see you out and the same housemaid who had opened the door to him earlier led him back up the stairs through the servants door into the hall she said as he stepped out into the warm night was it really ben willet you came here about why do you ask i saw him in may the twentyninth it was when we were in the london house he didnt see me i was on an omnibus and he was walking along the street he lookedill i never said anything it wasnt my place but i wondered was it a war wound do you think or was he drinking himself into oblivion theyd never take him back here if thats what it was he was suffering from an illness he told her was is he better dead when he didnt answer she added then he wont be coming back im sorry he meant it we all thought hed be back after the war his things were here you see a promise you might call it we liked him he could be very funny you know really he should have gone on the stage he was such a gifted mimic she bit her lip i didnt want to believe it you know but someone told mesomeone hed known before the warthat he wanted to live in paris that he liked france but he didnt after all did he i saw him last may in london myself who told you this william neville he was a footman in the house next but one to ours in london he met ben willet in hospital in the last weeks of the war they had trench foot of all things he said ben talked about nothing but france how different it was from what he expected he said if he had the money to do it hed stay there after the war was finished william told him he was a fool and ben said all right hed come back to london and work five years then hed go back to france and find out if he still wanted to live there william told him that was brilliant ben laughed and said no it was economic necessity did you like him not so much a liking she said considering her feelings but he was nice if you know what i mean never any trouble never any worry sometimes on our afternoons off wed go into thetford it was great fun like having a beau for a few hours then back to ourselves again when we got home he could understand that service had strict rules no romances no marriages no unbecoming conduct all the same the servants were human and two young people would find in pretense an escape from the tedium of everyday life thompson told me that hed spent a good deal of his time in his room she looked over her shoulder then said he liked to take books from mr laughtons library he wasnt supposed to but he always brought them back and so i never told anyone he was very careful with them what sort of books i have no idea i do know he borrowed a bible once i said to him dont you have a testament of your own and he said hed never had one i thought that was very strange there were voices in one of the passages behind her she said hastily i must go she shut the door firmly and left him there on the steps hamish said it wasna a verra profitable journey in some ways it was for instance was it his illness that brought the man back to england or had he been here all this time how did he live hamish ever practical asked it was a good question by his craftor had he fallen on hard times and turned to blackmail chapter at the end of the laughtons drive rutledge debated whether to spend the night in thetford or go back to furnham and then he decided to go directly to london there had been no way to reach sergeant gibson until now and with any luck there would be answers to his questions concerning the whereabouts of wyatt russell and cynthia farraday by the time hed reached the outskirts of london the first pale rays of the sun were brightening the eastern sky he was in need of petrol and found a garage a few miles farther along the road making his way through the early morning traffic into the city where street cleaners were busy and men and women were on their way to open shops and offices he was caught behind a milk van making deliveries and it was another half an hour before he reached his flat two hours of sleep a shave and a change of clothes and he was ready to go to the yard he had to run sergeant gibson to earth a body had been found in st jamess park and the sergeant was trying to trace a member of the mans family he looked up as rutledge called to him on the stairs and said the chief superintendent has been wanting you did you tell him i was in essex and out of reach yes sir it didnt seem to do much good by the bye ive found the information you asked for its on my desk shall i bring it up when ive finished here he knew better than to tell gibson that he would find it for himself they had always had a very uneasy relationship ever since rutledge had returned to the yard what drew the two men together was a distinct dislike of the chief superintendent and gibson as a rule would happily spite the man in any way he could helping rutledge was one of the surest ways to do that but he did so on his own terms rutledge went on to his own office and shut the door the long nights drive had been tiring and he stood for a moment looking down at the street below not really seeing the activity there as he considered what hed learned about ben willet small wonder he didnt fit into the village where he was born the position as footman had only been a beginning a first step what had possessed him to decide to be a writer of books hed been a great reader yes but what had triggered that leap of imagination that said i can do this too had it begun as boredom and quickly become an aspiration or like those afternoons off in thetford had writing been another means of escape from a life hed thought he wanted and found was not to his liking was paris just another escape a large colony of writers and poets musicians and painters had converged on paris after the war many of them were former soldiers restless and in need of whatever they couldnt find at home or were too lost to try a good many drank away their dreams and others sometimes found disillusionment a few met with success how had willet fared there was a tap at the door and sergeant gibson entered rather quickly shutting it quietly behind him old bowels is on the warpath he said the body in the park has connections bowles was always one to sniff out opportunity a man with no connections of his own he had an eye for the main chance and it just as often eluded him souring his disposition for days afterward gibson held out a sheet a paper this is all i could find given the time i had to pursue the matter rutledge took it and scanned gibsons dark scrawl wyatt russell is in a clinic war injuries so i was told by macdonald at the war office of all the results that rutledge had anticipated this was not one he read on ah cynthia farraday well done gibson in his minds eye he could see the newspaper cutting of miss farraday at the flower show a photographers delight finding a pretty girl admiring a prizewinning blossom and she had appeared to enjoy having her photograph taken had this been her one excursion into the city with harold finley finding her wards photograph in a newspaper would have given mrs russell a very good reason for curtailing such visits ive another task for you see if you can find out which doctors in london one benjamin willet saw in the past six months for a stomach cancer that was inoperable id like to know where he was staying during that time he was in london at the end of may and then a matter of a fortnight ago thats all the information i have the sergeant made a note of that anything else yes see what sort of records the tilbury police can find on the disappearance of mrs elizabeth russell august where will i find you ill be in london this morning and then im off to this clinic in oxfordshire then back to essex i expect ive a funeral to attend if youre leaving nows the time gibson warned him else youll be taken off the gravesend death and put to work on the st jamess park murder sir the man pulled from the thames had had no connections after all bowless only concern had been to put his opposite numbers nose out of joint ill take your good advice rutledge said and reached for his hat he made it out of the yard without encountering bowles and drove to a street in chelsea not far from where meredith channing lived but she was still out of the country as far as he knew and he made a point of avoiding her house the fewer reminders of her the better he told himself out of sight out of mind hamish snorted derisively you tell yoursel that but it does no good rutledge ignored the voice but he knew that hamish was right it had been hard these last weeks to know what to feel he found the street number it was a very good address and the house was handsome the sort that would suit a woman like cynthia farraday large enough for comfort small enough not to require an army of servants to maintain it he remembered that someone had told him she had inherited it from her dead parents he walked up to the door and was amused when he saw the knocker it was in the shape of an orchid he let it fall and waited until a maid appeared to ask his business mr rutledge to see miss farraday he said briskly apparently the young woman hadnt been warned to turn him away instead she asked him to wait in the hall while she went to see if miss farraday was at home he did as she asked there was a small table to one side of the door and above it hung a rather good watercolor of the marshes on the opposite wall a giltframed mirror reflected both he thought cynthia farraday must have been telling the truth when she said she liked the marshes at rivers edge several minutes later a door opened down the passage and miss farraday herself came out to greet him so you found me at last she said smiling amused and the house rivers edge is it for sale i wouldnt know inspector rutledge scotland yard he informed her i dont believe your housemaid heard the title she opened her mouth shut it again and then said well be more comfortable in my sitting room she turned and walked back the way shed come not looking to see if he followed or not it was a bright room she took him to done up in lavender and cream and apricot a very feminine and unusual setting and it suited her closing the door behind him she gestured to a pair of chairs set before a window overlooking the back garden she said seating herself opposite him scotland yard you led me to believe you were wyatts solicitor and you led me to believe you were there in the closed house because you wished to purchase it touche why did you follow me to london i cant think where you were waiting for me still i didnt know whether to be flattered or annoyed he was unexpectedly pleased that she knew nothing about his presence at the landing stage where shed returned the launch your photograph has a way of showing up in surprising places for one in the possession of a dead man she was very still a dead man she asked bracing herself for the answer not wyatt no it was ben willet who was found floating in the thames he told her baldly he could see the blood drain from her face but she said i dont know anyone by that name its useless to deny it he knew you on the wall of his room in thetford he had a photograph of you taken from a newspaper or magazine i dont recall that my photograph was ever in a newspaper you were admiring an orchid anger flared in her eyes that was taken by chance i didnt pose for it yet you have an orchid for your door knocker the owner of the prizewinning orchidthe one i was admiringsent it to me after seeing the photograph ive been looking into willets death and i went to thetford to the laughton house where he was a footman did you find that position for him i cant think of anyone else who might have had the connections or the interest in helping the man his intuition had been right thats none of your affair she snapped and when he was here in london in may seeing the specialist did he come and tell you that he was a dying man she blinked unable to prevent the spontaneous reaction what was your interest in him was it a love affair she cut him off her voice sharp yes all right i lent him books he saw me reading one day and he asked where id got the book where was this and when in i think id taken one of the boats and rowed down to a little inlet where i could tie up and read he came up the river and i nearly frightened him to death he said i was asleep in the bottom of the boat and he thought i was ill i found that amusing we talked for a little and then i gave him the book it was a novel by an american writer he seemed pleased we met several more times and he would return whatever book id let him borrow and tell me what he thought of it for a young man educated in the village school he was remarkably clever i asked what he wished to do with his life and he told me he wanted to find a position somewhere i dont think he had the vaguest idea of what was required to be a footman still he took care over how he dressed and how he spoke so i told him that id write to the laughtons id known rose laughton in school and i was certain the family would be kind whether they took him on or not still i thought it best to present myself as mrs russell when i wrote to ask if they were in need of a footman she smiled at the memory as it happened the last one had died of complications from the measles hed caught from the laughton children i had to swearas mrs russell you understandthat ben had had all the childhood diseases i didnt know whether hed had them or not in any event they offered him the position i gave him several books as a goingaway gift i knew he couldnt afford to buy them which explained the volumes packed away in his boxes when willet went off to war and so he lived happily ever after as a footman of course not there was the war it changed everything for all of us did you write to him when he was in thetford or when he was in france i did not he was my good deed that was all i hadnt taken his soul into my keeping when did you see him again ah after the war immediately after in fact he was just coming out of victoria station and he recognized me at once i didnt know him hed grown filled out a man not a boy in his fathers skiff he even sported a mustache i took him to a shop for tea and he told me he wanted to be a writer and so i gave him fifty pounds and told him to send me a copy of his first publication he did a slim volume of his war memoirs it was not terribly successful as far as i know but he was extraordinarily proud of it the next one was so much better i was proud of him then she turned to stare out the window for a moment then she asked did he kill himself because of the disease or was it for some other reason the truth is he was murdered ben willet she faced him now horror in her eyes no there must be some mistake i can show you a photograph of the body if you like she shuddered no please no when did you last hear from him she was still trying to come to terms with murder but she got up and went to the small desk behind where she was sitting rummaging in a drawer she drew out a postal card and brought it to him it was a sepiatone scene in paris a street cafe with carriages passing and several people sitting at the tiny tables set out on the pavement he turned it over and read the brief message i want to see my father and then im going back to paris to finish the last book it began there let it end there i shant write to you again but ill see to it that you are sent a copy when its published thank you for believing and it was signed simply willet the stamp and the postmark were not french the card had been posted in london not three days before the man was killed and he had never reached furnham did you go to rivers edge to look for him youve been playing god with his life for years did you think he might have gone back home to die that it was a lie about paris dont be rude i went to rivers edge for reasons of my own did you take the launch to where you once used to tie up to the reeds with your books what if i did i was nostalgic for another life but not for him did you know that some weeks ago when he was still in london he called at the yard he wanted to report a murder he said murder what are you talking about she demanded who else was murdered he told me his name was wyatt russell and that he was dying of cancer he wanted to clear his conscience by confessing to a murder i asked him who had been killed and he told me it was justin fowler she had not returned to her chair after handing him the postal card standing by the window instead putting a hand to her forehead she began to pace clearly agitated why would he do that he hardly knew who justin was and why pretend he was wyatt no you must be mistakenor lying it has been suggested that the morphine hed been given for his pain might have caused hallucinations no i still refuse to believe you i wasnt sure what to make of his confession myself and so i asked him to join me for lunch we dined at the marlborough and i was never shown any reason to doubt that he was wyatt russell he carried off the masquerade to perfection now i ask myself why it should be necessary even if it was trueand i dont for a moment believe that it could behow did ben even know that murder had been done i dont think he ever went back to essex he couldnt have been a witness to something if he had surely hed have confided in me it makes no sense at all you said yourself that you hadnt bothered to correspond with him during the war your duty done why should he feel compelled to tell you about russell why would he wish to upset you she took a deep breath making an effort to steady herself and think clearly he must have been out of his mind i knew he was ill but not that ill you dont understand when i first met him ben smelled of fish and there was no future for him but going out in the boats wyatt would have seen nothing in him that required more than a polite nod if that but i did and i did something about it too if what he confessed to isnt true then where is justin fowler if hes alive and well we can put an end to that part of the inquiry she was silent for a time then said softly i wish i knew did they quarrel fowler and russell if they were going to quarrel it would have been before the war hard feelings dont always go away well she said tartly the cause of any quarrel went away you were free to go only because mrs russell disappeared she shivered when i came to live at rivers edge i was frightened by the marshes i didnt like the whispering when the wind rustled the dry heads of the grasses i wouldnt sleep with my window open for fear that one day id be able to hear the whispers clearly and id know they were talking about me after a few weeks i grew accustomed to the sound and thought no more about it but when aunt elizabeth disappeared i dreamed that night that the whisperers had come for her theyd called her out into the river ive never told anyone that but it was the main reason i left so abruptly the other was that i didnt want to be alone in the house with wyatt and justin they were so certain they were in love with me if there had been other young women in the vicinity of rivers edge theyd have ignored me but there werent and so i lost my only home for a second time is it possible wyatt russell killed his mother that her disappearance was his doing oh my god she said sitting down as if her limbs refused to support her no she regarded him even for a policeman you have an extraordinarily nasty mind he smiled grimly as a policeman i have seen more than ones imagination could invent yes i suppose you have im surprised given your years there that you care so much for rivers edge i loved the house id have married wyatt just to be mistress of it but the thought of living with him happily ever after was too much even as a price for rivers edge could money have been involved he asked bluntly was that why russell was so intent on marrying you and if you spurned him perhaps he needed his inheritance sooner rather than later frowning she said i was left with a comfortable income but the russells didnt need my money besides my inheritance was in trust until i was five and twentyto protect me from fortune hunters or so i was told by five and twenty i would no doubt be sensible enough not to run off with the dancing master he smiled and how many dancing masters did you know not one i thought i might do better by going to london it was said to be awash with dancing masters what became of justin fowler after the war youre the inspector from scotland yard she retorted suddenly tired of him or his questions im sure you will find him without my help she walked to the door and held it open after all you found me he stood as well you know your way good day inspector leaving the house he wasnt sure what to make of cynthia farraday she reminded him of quicksilver just when one thought one had it within ones grasp it was gone elusive and tantalizing and deadly hamish reminded him chapter it was after six oclock when he reached the little village of st margarets in oxfordshire the church tower rose above the surrounding houses and shops a sharp tower as if to remind people of their duty to god the clinic he discovered by stopping at the tiny post office was on the far side of town it had once been a graceful country house with a dower house across from the main gates easily found the postmistress had assured him and it was the dower house was a mellow pink brick and the late afternoon sun gilded the windows faced with white stone it was set back from the road in a stand of trees gardens following the short drive up to the door across the road the contrast was pointed the gates to the main house were open and he drove through what had once been a welllandscaped park now the rhododendrons were overgrown and dead boughs showed through the leathery leaves like the gray ghosts of other summers the house too had seen better days the gardens no longer luxuriant the window shades uneven giving the impression that no one had noticed how snaggletoothed this might appear to a visitor on the lawns were stone benches scattered here and there some in the sun others well shaded none of them was occupied at present he left the motorcar to one side of the door and saw that it like the gates stood open hamish said theyre no afraid that anyone will escape a table stood just inside in what had been the hall and a middleaged woman in a nurses uniform sat there sorting charts and patient folders she looked up as he came in and smiled good afternoon have you come to visit any particular patient id like to speak to matron if i may ian rutledge shes just gone into her office ill show you and she led him down the passage at one time the spacious rooms had been divided into wards but the thin partitions had been removed only the pale lines on the scratched and scuffed parquet floors marked where they had been matrons office had been a morning room at one time now it was filled with filing cabinets while books crowded one another on a shelf the desk was utilitarian and well used an older woman with graying hair was seated behind it and she looked up as he was shown in then rose as the nursing sister gave his name mr rutledge she said pleasantly i dont believe ive had the pleasure of seeing you here before ive come to visit a patient of yours one wyatt russell but before i go in to him i was hoping you could tell me something about his condition are you a relative mr rutledge he could see that she was reluctant to divulge any information im from scotland yard matron he took out his identification and passed it across the desk to her do sit down mr rutledge she sat as well then examined his identification before handing it back to him i should like to hear why you are calling on major russell have you come to ask for his assistance or is he accused of something i dont know how to answer you matron the inquiry is in its early stages there was a man found dead in the thames he gave her the date when ben willet had been pulled from the river he knew from the twitch of a muscle at the corner of her eyes that he had touched a nerve the problem was earlier on this man had given scotland yard his name in another matterbut it was false the name he gave was wyatt russell i see but why should he do that had he ever met major russell do you know i cant tell you how well they knew each other slightly at a guess but they both lived in essex within a few miles of each other they most certainly were aware of each others existence he remembered suddenly something that he should have spoken to miss farraday about as it happens this man was one of the search party trying to find mrs russell the majors mother when she disappeared in ah i see she set the file she had been working on as he entered to one side of her desk and folded her hands major russell she began seeming to choose her words with care has a problem with his memory it isto put it bluntlyimperfect shell shock he asked hearing hamish loud in his mind please dear god he prayed let it not be that and his prayer was heard not shell shock no he was severely wounded and while he can function in so many ways that we consider normalbutton his clothes tie his shoelaces comb his hair count his money carry on a seemingly intelligent conversationhe has difficulty with the past he recalls it in very irregular and sometimes inaccurate ways for instance he told me two days ago that he was being called up again that his train was to leave in a quarter of an hour and he couldnt find his uniform he was quite upset as you can imagine and he wouldnt believe us that the war had ended two years earlier another example of his confusionhe was allowed a leave actually a test of his ability to cope in strange surroundings this was two months ago you understand we sent someone with him to oversee his care a valet if you will or a batman actually this person was a trained orderly and it was his duty to keep an eye on the major for us she picked up a pen looked at it then put it down on the desktop again for the first week he was a model patient we were greatly encouraged and then he came home late from a walk in such a state that we brought him back and he hasnt been away from the clinic since that time she reached for the pen again her eyes hidden from him we have not sent him out to live on his own since then no but the door to the clinic stood open and the gates as well would matron call in the local police if major russellor one of her other patients for that matterwent missing not he thought unless they were on a regimen of medicines and their health was put at risk or they posed a danger to themselves or to society he thanked her for seeing him and asked again if he could interview major russell she told him that he could and rang a little bell on her desk there was a tap at the door and a young nursing sister asked yes matron take mr rutledge to visit major russell if you please and then he was in the passage following the young sister they entered a room that had once he thought been the billiard room but there were chairs and small tables set about it now and men were engaged in board games or cards a few simply stared into space their hands dangling over the arms of their chairs their minds disengaged from the present hamish said ye see yoursel still in their faces he did and the clinic where hed been kept until his sister had intervened and had him transferred to the care of dr fleming in that first clinic men who were shellshocked screamed at night and sat staring at nothing all through the long day dr fleming had taken a different approach dragging out of unwilling patients the reasons for their withdrawal from themselves and the world rutledge had had to be pulled off the doctor after he had confessed to the death of corporal hamish macleod ready to kill the man who had made him face his demons in spite of the warmth of the summer day that filled this familiar setting he felt cold the sister went across to one man broadshouldered fairhaired in every way seemingly normal and touched him lightly on the arm major russell you have a visitor sir he raised empty eyes to her face she turned and smiled at rutledge if he becomes tired or anxious youll let one of the staff know yes of course thank you sister he pulled an empty chair nearer to where russell was sitting good afternoon major my name is rutledge chapter russell turned a little to see him better it was then that rutledge realized that one side of the mans head was slightly misshapen as if the skull had been damaged his hair nearly concealed the difference do i know you he asked frowning as he studied rutledges face with a nod the sister walked away i dont believe weve met i was on the somme he gave his rank and regiment were you patient here are you no im presently an inspector at scotland yard someone came to my office not long ago and i believe he knew you ben willet lately of furnham essex cynthias pet what did he want he was concerned about justin fowler in fact he rather thought that fowler was dead he is died during the war as i remember what about it do you have any recollection of where he died im not in my dotage russell snapped irritably in or thereabouts in france how do i know i was busy as hell trying to keep myself alive and my men there was some mention of the fact that he might have been murdered wouldnt surprise me he was a selfcentered bastard probably shot in the back by one of his own men i never cared for him you know i understand you were married just before you went to france i was she died in childbirth my son with her he shook his head do you know i can hardly remember her face i try sometimes theres a photograph in my room but i dont know if its my wife or someone else rutledge reached into his pocket and drew out the locket i believe this may have belonged to your mother major russell put out his hand and touched the locket dangling from its gold chain but he didnt take it or open it never saw it before are you sure the maid nancy appears to think so nancy the quiet one i cant quite bring back her face either how recently were you in london last week no it must have been earlier than that he tried to think his brow furrowed im sorry im sometimes confused about dates do you remember walking along the thames no i dont but that doesnt mean i didnt or that i did perhaps you were walking east of the tower rather than nearer westminster bridge it was east of the tower that the watermen believed willet had gone into the river yes thank you i remember now there was an accident on tower bridge it was blocked by a lorry that had overturned spilling marrows all across the road i remember the blood the driver was bleeding you couldnt see his face for the blood i walked away id watched enough men die was willet there as well ben willet no he was waiting for me on the other side of the bridge i didnt want to watch him die either why should he be dying was he involved in the accident damn it i told you he was on the far side of the bridge waiting did you have your service revolver with you i always carry it with me every officer does but the war is over damn it are you calling me a liar not at all im trying to establish a clear picture of events its my duty although i grant you it can be tiresome at times you had your service revolver with you then did you use it that night id have liked to shoot that wretched lorry driver and put him out of his misery his head was bleeding all down his face i know what that means doesnt stand a chance poor bastard they drilled holes in my skull did they tell you because the brain was swelling ben willet was suffering from a cancer rutledge went on trying to bring russell back to that night on the bridge thats right he didnt want a slow death but he couldnt bring himself to finish it his father was strict you see a religious man he wanted you to help him die it wasnt an answer rutledge had considered yes didnt i tell you i was to meet him that night on the far side of the bridge id run into him in piccadilly he was on his way somewhere someone was waiting but he asked if i would mind having dinner with him there was something he wished to ask me i had to rid myself of my minder only half aware of what he was doing russells fingers had been fiddling with the locket which was still dangling from rutledges outstretched hand and then it opened without warning swinging around to face him he stared at it for a moment then looked up at rutledge what the hell are you doing with her photograph youve been lying to me all along havent you my mothers locket be damned his face was suffused rage flashing in his eyes turning the blue almost incandescent surging to his feet he overturned his chair the crash startled the others in the room and they looked up in alarm i thought this talk of london and willet was nothing but a trick you stay away from her do you hear me shes worth ten of you and before rutledge could stop him hed flung the locket across the room and strode swiftly out the door one of the card players was on his feet as well shouting at rutledge as he listened to russells boots pounding down the uncarpeted passage rutledge managed to find the locket where it had fallen among a collection of canes in a porcelain stand he reached the door just as the nursing sister came rushing in almost colliding with him what did you do she demanded and behind her matron was saying i heard someone running rutledge pushed them aside its russell i think he left the house several other nursing sisters were coming from other parts of the clinic and he had to dodge them as he ran someone had thought to ring a bell somewhere the clanging almost earsplitting reaching the door he glanced up to see the bell hanging in a window above the door and there was an orderly vigorously pulling on the rope that way he shouted down to rutledge pointing toward the trees of the park rutledge followed the direction he indicated almost certain that he could hear someone crashing about in the straggling undergrowth but he reached the road without finding the major hamish said hes gone to ground rutledge swore he hadnt opened the necklace on purpose it had been a fluke that it had clicked open at all he could hear matron giving orders as the bell stopped clanging rutledge crossed the road and went into the garden of the dower house he circled the house then looked into the sheds behind the kitchen swinging the doors wide before turning back to the road he couldna have got far on foot hamish said i should have been prepared but he knew even as he said it that there had been no warning whatever had stirred in the dark recesses of the majors mind it had exploded into violent action ye ken he mentioned the lasss name earlier and nothing happened cynthias pet but a name was very different from a photograph in the hands of another man they searched until the sunset colors faded into lavender purple and then deep blue and there was no light to see under the trees matron standing in the doorway said i warned you that his mental state was uncertain rutledge said i take full responsibility but hes done this before hasnt he and you failed to warn me of that she said nothing watching the last of the searchers trudging wearily back to the house one of the men said as he came close enough to be heard i think we should search the house again in case he doubled back but rutledge didnt think he had still the staff and those of the patients who were ambulatory set about going from room to room when did he disappear the last time he asked as matron stood listening to the search going on over her head you cant protect him now yes all right a month ago he was gone for three weeks we searched for him looked everywhere we could think of that he might have gone i didnt wish to ask the police to help after all hed done nothing wrong he wasnt dangerous and my faith was rewarded one morning he was standing here at the door when we came down disheveled hungry in need of a bath but he knew who he was and where he was and he apologized for worrying us he gave no reason for leaving he told me he needed to think that he couldnt here he needed to be alone does he have access to his service revolver no most certainly not there are no weapons here i assure you but he does have a house in london where he and his wife lived is it by any chance there she hesitatedthe orderly saw to it that the revolver was put away it was his first responsibility when they arrived in london although she was reluctant to give it he got the direction of the london house but its closed now she protested it generally is when hes in residence here he thanked her and left then as he was driving out the gates a constable came peddling furiously up the road rutledge stopped the motorcar and asked what is it he had to identify himself before the constable would speak to him theres been trouble in the village he said it must have been someone from here he struck down george hiller and took his trusty the trusty triumph had been the workhorse of the war dispatch riders found the motorcycle the best and fastest way to reach the front and keep sectors in touch with hq they took weather the shelling and the rough and treacherous terrain in stride and the silhouette of the goggled figure head down and hunched over his machine was a familiar one tell matron if you please ill see if i can find him rutledge didnt wait for an answer he drove as fast as he dared given the state of the roads but he knewas hamish was busy telling himthat the triumph had a head start and would reach london long before it could be overtaken but what had triggered major russells outburst rutledge had assumed that it was the photograph of cynthia farraday but what had he said next be damned to my mothers locket had he recognized it earlier even though hed said he didnt know it orwas it the locket with cynthia farradays photograph in it had russell thought then that she had had something to do with his mothers death was she in any danger he had to find russell and george hillers trusty before the major reached the farraday house in chelsea chapter rutledge scanned the distance searching for some sign that he was closing the gap with the triumph but it was wishful thinking and hamish relentlessly pointed that out whatever hed set in motion he had to stop it and still there was nothing ahead no small red light to guide him russell he thought was driving recklessly his anger goading him his own concentration was intense passing through countryside avoiding a horse cart moving slowly or a gaggle of geese waddling toward a pond then through one village after the other with lamplight marking the street in tidy squares back into the countryside once more before finding himself in a fairsize town where people were strolling in the warm summer evening his eyes readjusting as he returned to the pitchdark of farms and woods once more even hamish was shut out and the silence was unsettling had russell turned off taken a different route from the one rutledge had expected him to take it was becoming more and more likely and without a moon it was impossible to push the motorcar any harder on unfamiliar roads and then six miles outside london he caught up with his quarry he nearly missed it all his attention on negotiating an unexpectedly sharp bend in the road the triumph lay in a ditch front wheel twisted and it was the brief flash of the headlamps on metal that caught rutledges eye braking hard slewing the motorcar halfway across the road nearly sliding into the ditch on the far side himself he came to a rocking halt thanking god no one had been coming from the other direction he got out quickly and ran to examine the wreckage shining his torch across it expecting to find major russell there in its beam dead or dying entangled in the ruins of the machine cursing himself and russell in the same breath george hillers trusty had suffered from the great flaw of its kind the front fork spring that could take only so much rough handling before breaking in france where the roads were even rougher than here in england a leather strap had often been added for extra support allowing the rider to cut crosscountry when conditions made it necessary but the major wasnt there not beside the motorcycle not under it dropping to one knee rutledge shone the torch over the machine and the bruised grass beneath it trying to comprehend how russell could have escaped unscathed it would have taken a miracle he told himself and then he saw the blood he got to his feet and looked around there was a house just on the far side of the bend and a light shone from the front window stopping only to move his motorcar to a safer place than the middle of the road he went quickly to knock on the door a tall slim woman with iron gray hair opened it he was struck by her eyes dark and intelligentand red rimmed with weeping my name is rutledge inspector rutledge scotland yard did you by any chance see the accident with that motorcycle in the ditch she stared at him for a moment then said youd better come in he walked into the very handsome parlor and sat down on the dark blue couch that she indicated may i ask your name marilyn furman and did you see the accident he asked again i was just coming home i hadnt even opened my door when i heard the cyclist coming around the bend at great speed and then something happened i dont know what it was it was as if the front balked like a horse at a fence i heard the rider cry out and then he was flying over the handlebars the next thing i knew he was in the ditch and the motorcycle was coming straight toward him as it slid in the dust she turned away it was quite terrible i heard him cry out a second time and then nothing i was afraid to go across to him i didnt even want to think about what i might see but i took my torch and made myself do it and to my astonishment he was alive people from down the road had heard the noise too and came running i sent them for an ambulance and stayed with him i couldnt see his face for the blood i asked him his name but he couldnt tell me she turned back to rutledge i thought someone should know it you see in the event they came to look for him and saw the wreckage of the triumph and the hospital ought to know as well but he couldnt tell me her eyes filled with tears and she reached for her handkerchief he gave her time to collect herself then asked was he still alive when the ambulance got to him oh yes they couldnt understand how he missed being killed do you know where the ambulance men took him but she was still locked in the horror of all shed witnessed they were so long in arriving i thought they would never come there was a young couple who appeared from somewhere and sat with me they wanted to put him in their motorcar but i was afraid to try to move him he was in pain moaning i couldnt even offer him a little water i felt so useless and then the ambulance was there and it was all right do you know where i can find him he asked again i believe he was taken to st annes its about seven miles down the road i was too distressed to ask and so relieved to have help for him finally she took a deep breath struggling against the tide of memory do you have any idea of the extent of his injuries i asked the ambulance men to tell me what was wrong so that i could reassure whoever came looking for him they couldnt be certain they told me the cut on his forehead was bleeding profusely and it was possible that he had sustained internal injuries even broken ribs then they were shutting the doors and driving away i just stood there watching them go too dazed to think what to do next is there anyone here who could take a message to oxfordshire is that where the cyclist is from theres the man who sees to my gardens for me he wont mind going he has friends in oxford a head gardener at one of the colleges and his family ill give him the day off tomorrow i have the name of the triumphs owner he will be glad to come and take it away he took out his notebook and wrote the direction tearing away the sheet and passing it to her but scotland yardwhat had he done this manwere you following him is that why you know all this she indicated the sheet of paper in her hand i was following him to london rutledge replied that was true as far as it went are you all right is there someone who could come and sit with you im just a little shaken still but ill be fine she said collecting herself it was justseeing him fly through the air like that it happened so quickly i couldnt even cry out and then the triumph following as if it were intent on crushing him i dont think ive ever seen anything quite so horrible he sat there for a few minutes more talking to her until she was calmer and then said i must go would you mind terribly would you send word to me so that ill know if he lived or not it would be kind i really dont want to spend the rest of my life wondering ill see to it the doctors may not know anything at first theyll have to examine the man and determine the extent of his injuries you wont hear straightaway but that will be good news actually yes i understand i wont worry but it would be comforting to think i could put that terrible picture out of my mind no harm done he left then still concerned for her and went back to look at the triumph and then he started his motorcar and drove directly to st annes it was unexpectedly difficult to find a small hospital in one of the larger villages that had all but been swallowed up by londons growth it was tucked away out of sight he had turned around at the outskirts and driven through the village a second time when he saw the catholic church down a side street a signboard identified it as st annes and just beyond it was a square building that was set back from the road in what appeared to be a park he thought it might have been a small manor house at one time or perhaps a rectory leaving his motorcar by the steps he went inside the nurses were nuns in white habits and he wondered if this had originally been a lyingin hospital for difficult maternity cases there was a small casualty ward in the back the sister in charge came to meet him prepared to make a decision on where he was to be sent but he said after she asked what his problem might be im here in regard to the accident case just brought to you a man on a motorcycle are you a relative she asked pursing her lips as if about to tell him he couldnt go into the ward itself scotland yard he told her i was looking for this man to help us with our inquiries indeed well then youre out of luck chapter hes dead rutledge asked unprepared for this news no he is not but he ought to be he may yet be bruises and scrapes all over him but somehow he just missed breaking his head or another bone and he left refusing further treatment or a few hours of observation he said his wife would be worried about him if he didnt come home before midnight but major russell had no wife that rutledge knew of was he able to give you his name or tell you where he lived not at first but then he did tell the sister in charge that he was mr fowler justin fowler from london later on he asked if he could take an omnibus from here to london most particularly one that would stop somewhere near kensington palace damn the man and did he find an omnibus that would carry him to kensington he must have done he asked one of the orderlies which to watch for and i was looking out the window when he left thank you sister if you please tell him he must rest in the event there are more serious injuries than we knew of even a concussion it was very foolish to go rushing off like that i will warn him rutledge answered and took his leave his mind already dealing with the problem of major russells intentions for kensington palace was within walking distance of chelsea where cynthia farraday lived it was also where he could find another omnibus to carry him to victoria station and a train to tilbury hamish said hell go for the lass and then to tilbury and on to rivers edge rutledge was already turning the crank on the motorcar well try chelsea first just in case as he made his way out of the village and found the london road again he added he still has a head start but the omnibus will be slow at least we have a fairly good idea where to look and if he isnt in chelsea theres the house in london and after that essex he knows matron will send someone to the house but he may think theres time enough to clean himself up and change his clothes london traffic was unexpectedly heavy for this time of night lorries filled with produce motorcars barrows and carts vied with omnibuses and even a few larger horsedrawn vehicles and while there were not that many of them all told he found it difficult to make good time the only consolation was that a lumbering omnibus would find it even harder to overtake them a summers dawn was breaking in the east when he finally reached kensington a wagon laden with early cabbages was stopped stockstill in the middle of the road while the driver haggled with a woman shopkeeper over the price of his wares impatient rutledge left his motorcar in the queue and went forward to speak to the pair they turned as one glaring at him as he said how much are your cabbages the driver looked him up and down as the woman said here i was first ignoring her the man gave rutledge a price it was outrageous but without comment rutledge paid him for ten handed them to the woman and then pointed to the high seat of the cart drive on youve made your first sale of the day grinning the man clambered up with alacrity and lifted his reins calling to the horses but the woman said here i wished to choose my own he gave her his best smile madam you have ten fine cabbages that didnt cost you a farthing be grateful and he walked back to his own vehicle before she could think of a response the rest of the way to chelsea was uneventful but rutledge fretted over the delay as he threaded his way through the streets where milk vans stopped and started with no regard to others he had a very bad feeling about what hed find at cynthia farradays house and hoped that her maid would have the good sense not to open the door to a bruised and bleeding stranger but when he pulled up in front of miss farradays house and walked quickly to the door he found it off the latch opening it only a little he stood there for several precious seconds listening for any sounds of argument or trouble any intimation as to where he was needed the house was quiet he pushed the door wider prepared for an attack if russell had seen his motorcar on the street but none came and he stepped inside the ticking of the long clock in another room could be heard clearly the house was unnaturally quiet rutledge began to make his way from room to room on the ground floor listening to the quality of the silence as he went each one was empty and nowhere was there any sign of a struggle a door closing behind him creaked and he stood still waiting but no one came or called out worried now he went quickly down to the servants hall and found no one there miss farradays cook should have been feeding the banked fire in the cooker and preparing for breakfast and the door to the back stairs was firmly shut returning to the hall he cast caution to the winds and took the main stairs two at a time in the passage at the top he paused there were several doors all of them closed and no way to judge which one was the master bedroom he went to the one at the top of the stairs and opened it he wasnt sure what hed expected what he found was a tidy and very feminine bedroom done up in peach and pale green with windows overlooking the back garden a great maple shielded them the leaves moving gently in the early morning breeze nothing was out of place neither the chair nor the octagonal turkish carpet in the center of the room a large wardrobe stood against one wall and a door beside it led to what must be a dressing room he started across the room to open it and as he did he heard a sound just behind him prepared for anything he spun around but it was only the bedroom door swinging shut in the quiet room it sounded as loud as a gunshot from the wardrobe came a whimper cut short he turned toward it and reached out for the handles of the two doors this time hamish warned him with a soft ware just as rutledges fingers touched the gilt knobs he stepped back at once and in that same instant one of the doors was flung wide from inside and a figure hurled itself at him he recognized cynthia farraday just as he caught sight of the sharp pointed scissors in her right hand he was only just able to dodge the blades as they slashed viciously within inches of his eyes and he caught her hand before she could try again steady he said as she cried out and began to pummel him with her other hand and then she blinked as she recognized him and broke away what are you doing here she demanded her voice overloud from anxiety the outer door was open i thought i ought to find out why struggling to regain her composure she said i thought hed come back i could hear someone walking downstairs didnt you even think to call out warn me that you were here it seemed wiser not to the house was quiet i didnt know what to expect yes well you gave me the fright of my life her hair had fallen down around her face and she brushed it back impatiently it was then he saw the pink mark on one cheek who slapped you if you must know it was wyatt russell i told you he was just here and he was very angry where is your maid i couldnt find her or anyone else she and my cook went to hammersmith to attend a funeral they wont be back until midmorning i couldnt sleep id been sitting downstairs reading when someone knocked i shouldnt have opened the door yes i know that now but i did and wyatt was the last person on earth i expected to find standing there i thought he was in a clinic somewhere he was until late yesterday afternoon what did he want why did he come here there was blood all over his face and his clothes were stained i asked what had happened and he said hed been in an accident and was feeling lightheaded and so i asked him to come in but he couldnt settle pacing the floor he wanted to know if id been to rivers edge recently what did you say i thought it best to say that i hadnt i offered to bring a basin of water to him to help him wash off the blood he thanked me and asked if id bring water to drink as well but when i came back with the basin and some towels he drank the glass of water and said that the rest could wait thats when he asked me if i knew a man called rutledge i told him i did i was surprised i didnt think you and he had met next he asked me if id given you my photograph and i told him i most certainly had not he called me a liar he said hed seen it for himself i told him he was wrong and he slapped me i was so shocked and i think he was as well because we just stood there looking at each other he threw the empty glass in the hearth shattering it and then he turned and walked away what did you do then i cleared away the broken glass then put away the basin and towels i was in the kitchen when i heard something upstairs a door creaking i thought and then footsteps i believed that hed come back again i couldnt remember whether id shut the door much less locked it i was afraid to go and see i took the back stairs and shut myself in my room hoping mary would come soon but of course it was far too early when i heard someone coming up the staircase i knew he was looking for me and there was nowhere i could go i took the scissors out of my sewing box and got into the wardrobe if he opened that door id know he was hunting me but her attack on him had been far more serious than a response to a slap rutledge wondered if there was more to the account than shed told him tears started in her eyes and she brushed them away irritably going to stand by the window and then before he could speak she whirled around and said fiercely why are we standing here im not accustomed to entertaining anyone in my bedroom she crossed to the door leaving him there and he followed her down the stairs when they reached the sitting room she said what did you say to him that made him come for me you must have found him you must have said something done something she was angry with him now and what photograph do you have of me not that silly one with the orchids a motorcar backfired in the street outside and she jumped her eyes flying to the door before she realized what the sound was shes verra frightened hamish said his appearance alone rutledge began cynthia farraday was staring at him what do you hear she asked and the question shocked him had she heard hamish actually heard him and then he realized that he was gazing toward the window distracted unaware of where he was looking a motorcar he said it didnt stop theres nothing to fear it was all he could muster the photograph well she reminded him he struggled to think the photograph hed never shown her the locket sit down he said i want you to look at something you havent answered me you do have a photograph dont you when did you take it why he took out the locket and handed it to her but she wouldnt touch it staring at it as if it could bite her where did you find that she whispered sitting down quickly as if her knees had failed to support her my god did you show this to wyatt no wonder he was so upset you recognize it he asked of course i do its aunt elizabeths i dont think she ever took it off where did you find it she asked again and then her lips trembling she said youve found her havent you no but someone must have done ben willet was wearing it when he was taken out of the river the locket was given to me by inspector adams in gravesend he thought she was going to faint the color went out of her face and she leaned back in her chair no no ben would never have done such a thing he was one of the searchers its possible he found it when he was searching its gold quite valuable but he kept it didnt hei mean to say if thats true he never returned it to the family or sold it as if hamish was pointing out keeping the locket made any difference he put it to another use rutledge took the locket between his fingers and opened it this is what was inside cynthia leaned forward reluctantly as if half afraid of what she might see oh she said drawing back my photograph i thoughtshe told me that her wedding photographs were inside according to nancy brothers they were she was surprised to see that theyd been removed this is what wyatt saw yesterday before he came here this is the photograph he claimed id given you how could you be so heartless as to let him believe such a thing i didnt he jumped to conclusions and told me that a policeman was not good enough for you he left the clinic and while we were wasting time hunting him he got a head start i had the devils own time catching him up and then he slipped away again i was afraid he might be coming here but was there an accident as hed claimed he was so bloody one of his hands badly bruised and i couldnt be sure but it appeared he was limping youthe two of you didnt come to blows i thought that was why he was so angry he told her about the stolen trusty and that russell had refused treatment at st annes i expect i should have been grateful he only slapped me i was so frightened i couldnt know could i what had set it off or why he has a temper that was the problem id never seen him so livid at least not before the war ive had very little contact with him since then he hasnt encouraged visitors at the clinic it would seem that hes still in love with you he has an odd way of showing it she retorted with a semblance of her old spirit and for all i know he could have believed that id killed his mother r utledge had intended to leave as soon as possible and go after major russell but cynthia farraday was still uneasy he went down to the kitchen and made tea for her then waited with her until mary her maid and the cook returned later in the morning he saw the alarm in her eyes when she heard someone coming through the servants door into the hall and then as she recognized marys footsteps the alarm faded when mary reached the sitting room miss farraday said ah mary mr rutledge is just leaving and turning to rutledge she said coolly thank you so much for coming to my rescue and then as he was about to follow mary out she added quickly will you try to find wyatt i have no choice he answered her and youll keep me informed i should like very much to know more about that locket he thought as he left her house that she had been embarrassed by her own weakness the danger passed no longer alone her natural resilience had returned and she was determined to show him that it had driving to scotland yard he reviewed part of a conversation he and cynthia farraday had had earlier she hadnt wanted to be left alone and so she had gone with him to make the tea to distract her as they sat together in the tidy kitchen he had said tell me about coming to live at rivers edge she made a face it was rivers edge or a boarding school for girls young as i was i told our solicitors that i would run away if sent to one i couldnt bear it i wanted so badly to stay at home instead they wrote to elizabeth russell and asked if she would consider becoming my guardian she replied that she would and she came herself to fetch me which i thought was very kind i didnt meet wyatt until i arrived at the house he was a few months older but we got on well together until i was seventeen and he decided he was desperately in love with me i told him not to be silly did he listen to you i thought he had but when he came down from cambridge he informed me that while he would say no more about it i must understand that his feelings hadnt changed you have no idea how that confused my comfortable and safe world when i went to aunt elizabeth and asked her what to do she told me that i was far too young to think about love and she didnt expect to see me married until i was past my twentieth birthday it was such a relief but i could tell she was pleased that wyatt cared and as i told you once i didnt know how to interpret that when she disappeared i wasnt eager to live under wyatts roof without her still i told everyone that i longed for the excitement of london and convinced my solicitors to open the house here it made leaving easier for all of us he said you had no feelings for him as a cousin and a friend of course i did i just wasnt in love with him yes he was handsome he wasnt a dancing master and he was great fun i wanted everything to stay the way it had always been he smiled at her reference to the dancing master how did you feel later when he announced his engagement to be married happy for him relieved as well and perhaps just a tiny bit jealous she made a face so much for his vows of undying love he needed an heir for rivers edge in the event he was killed i wondered once or twice if he was happy content perhaps but not outrageously gloriously happy rutledge couldnt help but think how that had described his engagement to jean only he hadnt recognized it then or even later only with time and what about justin fowler her face didnt change but there was something in her stillness that was different and then in spite of herself she said i think i could have loved him i knew he liked me but he was soso remote i never knew why and by her admission she had just unwittingly given wyatt russell a motive for murdering fowler and possibly even ben willet as well i t was too late to overtake major russell before he reached essex if that was where he was going rutledge made a detour to drive by the house russell had inherited from his late wife and even knocked at the door as he listened to the sound echoing in the hall beyond he knew that the house was empty it was possible too that after his encounter with cynthia farraday russell had realized what he had done and returned to the clinic of his own volition given george hillers affection for the trusty the man would be out for his blood if word of the accident had even reached him by now russell would have to face his anger as well as matrons he decided to make a telephone call to the clinic from the yard and establish whether or not russell was there before making the long drive to the river hawking rutledge found a place to leave the motorcar and walked the short distance to the yard his mind still on russell stepping through the door he felt the change in atmosphere almost as a physical blow the sergeant at the desk was grimfaced his greeting a curt nod and as rutledge climbed the stairs he heard the silence the yard was never quiet with men going in and out of offices doors opening and closing telephones ringing typewriters clicking footsteps loud on the bare floorboards voices in the corridors sounds that rutledge had become so accustomed to that he hardly noticed them except now when they were missing he was on the point of entering his own office when he saw sergeant gibson step out of another room down the passage closing the door quietly behind him rutledge stopped his hand on the knob waiting for gibson he couldnt read the sergeants face for once it was blank without expression what is it rutledge asked what has happened you havent heard then no rutledge answered hamishs voice sounding a warning in his mind its chief superintendent bowles hes in hospital a heart attack rutledge was stunned bowles hed thought the man was indestructible whats the outlook grim sergeant gibson replied sir were to go on about our duties as if he were here and in charge meanwhile upstairs theyre making a decision about his temporary replacement as long as it wasnt mickelson rutledge was comfortable with whatever choice his superiors made not that the man had the seniority for such a promotion still stranger things had happened and he and mickelson had a long history none of it pleasant he thanked gibson and went into his office trying to imagine the yard without bowles was impossible rutledge thought as he sat down at his desk the man had been his nemesis almost from the day he arrived here jealous of the new wave of men replacing those who had risen from the ranks rutledge himself had done his duty as a constable and walked the streets in fair weather or foul but he came from very different roots and whats more hed been well educated bowles appeared to believe from the start that rutledge had an eye to his position true or not and had done everything in his power to prevent it consequently rutledge had been passed over for promotion more than once the reasons for denial had been true as far as they went but couched in terms that reflected on rutledges ability rutledge also had a feeling that bowles had used his authority as a chief superintendant to search his background for any flaws and he had wondered more than once if bowles had somehow discovered just where his newly returned inspector had been from the day of the armistice in to the date of his official return to the yard june indeed his very first inquiry after the war was one where the chief witness was a shellshocked man and bowles had not told rutledge that hed had to discover it for himself when he reached warwickshire if rutledges shell shock became public knowledge his position at the yard would be untenable he knew that and as for hamish macleodit was unthinkable that anyone should learn about him the shame would be unbearable rutledge went cold at the thought hamish said aye but dr fleming is no one to talk but there had been others in the clinic nurses orderliesvisitors unable to stand the close confines of his office he glanced through the papers awaiting his attention dealt with them swiftly and remembered his promise to the woman who had seen the triumph crash he wrote a brief note indicating that against all odds the cyclist had survived the accident without serious injury and had been released from st annes hospital in a matter of hours it would do it was all she needed to know sealing the envelope he set it to one side for the constable who came round to collect letters for the post then thought better of it pocketing it he walked out of the building no one stopped him or asked where he was going he found a postbox on a corner just beyond where hed left his motorcar and then continued to the marlborough hotel where he could use a telephone the clinic he was told by an operators disembodied voice did indeed have a telephone and he was put through after several minutes when matron came on the line he knew at once that russell hadnt returned giving her a brief account of events including the whereabouts of the trusty he added that he was still searching for the major she listened to him then said a moment please inspector when she returned to the telephone she said im so sorry but a man has just come he has already spoken to mr hiller he tells me i appreciate your message inspector have you looked for russell at his house in london i have thats to say i asked one of our former orderlies who is now at st johns to go round and see if anyone was there that was at ten oclock this morning the house appeared to be empty whats more a neighbor confirmed that he hadnt seen the major for some time i think we can safely say he isnt there the question is where do we look now should i have jacobson look at hotels im on my way to essex he told her i shant be able to reach you but i have a feeling that russell is returning to rivers edge my understanding is that the house is closed the staff dismissed she said doubt in her voice thats true but given his present state of mind he may not care yes of course thank you inspector i shall look forward to hearing from you again and should he turn up meanwhile will you call sergeant gibson at the yard and leave a message for me she promised and he rang off after a brief stop at his flat he drove out of london it would be dark well before he reached his destination and given his lack of sleep the night before he ought to wait until morning but in essex he would also be out of reach of recall he doesna have his revolver with him hamish said some time later if he didna go to yon house not unless he stopped at the london house before he went to see miss farraday but i dont think he would risk that not before he spoke to her the question is what weapons are in the essex house ye ken his father was in the boer war he was buried in south africa theres no way of knowing whether his service revolver was sent home in his trunk or if he kens where it is its too bad that willetwhen he was confessing to the murder of justin fowler in russells placedidnt tell me how the victim was killed some miles outside london rutledge stopped for petrol and then realizing that he hadnt eaten for nearly two days he drove on to a pub overlooking the thames and ordered his dinner it was slow in coming darkness was falling by the time he was on the road again the sun a deep red ball behind him the last of its rays reflected in the thames flickering on the current ahead over the north sea the sky was a luminous purple hamish said its best to wait until daylight but safer in the dark rutledge answered aloud he wont see me coming he stopped briefly for a cup of strong tea when the food hed eaten made him drowsy then he drove on the night air warm in the motorcar and adding to his drowsiness at length he picked up the pitted road that followed the hawking east toward furnham where there was only starlight to guide him and his headlamps tunneled through the darkness marking his way the wheel bucking under his hands was enough to bring him fully awake again the gates of rivers edge were ghostly as the glare of his headlamps picked them up just ahead alternately white and shadowed he drove past them some little distance and then stopped the motorcar turning off the headlamps taking out his torch but not flicking it on he walked down the middle of the road as far as the house gates guarding his night vision reaching the gates he stood for a moment listening to the night the marsh grasses whispered to themselves and he could hear scurrying as small creatures hunted and were hunted insects sang in the warm darkness or perhaps they were frogs of some sort but there was no sound of a man moving on the overgrown drive it wasnt likely that russell was just ahead of him but there was no way of knowing how successful the major had been finding transportation rutledge knew he couldnt afford to be careless he used the mental map from his previous visits to guide him now up the drive striving to keep to the flattened paths that hed made before he took his time if russell wasnt here now he would surely come at some point and there was no need to make him unduly nervous the night felt empty like a house where no one was at homeindeed like russells house in london but he still took no chances alert slowly feeling his way keeping to the shadows he finally came within sight of the house rearing up before him no lights he thought scanning this front but he would have to step into the open to reach the house from where he stood casting about for a better approach he heard the soft flutter of feathers and without warning an owl soared out of the trees directly over his head swooping downward to scoop up its prey a sharp squeak broken off and then the same flutter of feathers as the owl lifted off again and came back to his roost it had had all the earmarks of an ambush and rutledge felt the rush of adrenaline through his veins setting his heart to pounding he stayed where he was for several minutes until it had slowed staying within the shadows as much as he could he reached the corner of the house and then bending low crept across the open ground keeping his silhouette short and as inconspicuous as possible if there were guns in there would russell use them or had his anger burned out rutledge stayed in the shadow of the house for all of five minutes but nothing happened and keeping as close to the walls as he could he worked his way toward the terrace he was nearly sure that cynthia farraday had either been able to force one of the french doors or had left it unlocked for future visits she had spoken of a key but he wasnt certain he could believe her the terrace was empty he got as far as the doors and waited again for any sign that hed been spotted five minutes later he tried the french doors and found that one of them was unlocked as hed expected he stepped inside and stood waiting again before beginning a silent and methodical search of the house he walked from room to room sometimes caught off guard by a dust sheet that was unexpectedly as tall as a man or a board that squeaked loud enough to echo in the study he found the gun case in the dimness he used his hands to identify the contents standing upright were four shotguns for hunting the ducks and geese that wintered here on the river they were well oiled and cared for in the case below were two revolvers one a service revolver and the other a smaller caliber that could have been a souvenir they too were clean and oiled to one side of the case were several daggers mounted on the wall the sort a military man might collect on his travels when he had made a full circuit of the ground floor with no sign of an intruder rutledge started up the stairs careful not to step on the center of the tread but to stay as close to the wall as he could at the top he waited and listened before going on it was late enough that a weary russell might be sleeping in one of the beds but the first floor yielded nothing either mattresses had been rolled on the beds to discourage mice most of the drapes had been drawn and there was nothing to indicate that a man tired from a long journey had tried to rest here still he went from room to room as a rule standing in the doorway and listening before going inside to search he had reached the master bedroom which faced the river with long windows overlooking the lawns and the water this too offered nothing and he went into the dressing rooms on either side before turning to go hamish said the kitchen quarters in the hope of finding a tin of tea and a kettle as well as a hob to heat it on russell could have fallen asleep at the servants table unwilling to climb the stairs to find a more comfortable place to rest it was worth taking the time to have a look afterward he was never quite sure why he decided to go to one of the windows he had already reached the doorway his hand on the knob on the point of shutting it behind him instead he turned and crossed the room a second time lifting an edge of the drapes to peer out into the night the ambient starlight seemed brighter than it had before as if the moon was about to rise just touching the horizon the shadows on the lawn were dark as pitch by comparison and the reeds and salt grass along the waters edge were nearly as black but the water itself was bright in contrast a pewter ribbon making its way to the sea beyond he thought at first that his eyes were playing tricks on him and then he realized that someone was standing on the landing stage his silhouette blending with the boards irregular and almost undetectable he couldnt tell if there was a boat tied up below out of his line of sight or if the man had walked there from the house itself was it russell it was impossible to judge height or shape the only thing he could be certain of was that the figure was not that of a woman whoever it was he was wearing trousers rutledge stood there watching him for several minutes and then as if the man felt his gaze he turned and looked toward the house staring up at it intently the light touched his upturned face and his eyes were black holes in the paleness chapter rutledge stayed very still certain that he had been spotted that something some inadvertent movement had given him away then finally the man turned back to his contemplation of the water even now he couldnt be sure was it russell standing there or someone from the village he let the edge of the heavy drapes fall gently back into place and was across the room in swift long strides shutting the door and making his way to the staircase it had taken him fewer than two minutes to go down the stairs and reach the room overlooking the terrace but when he looked out he saw no one on the landing stage or on the lawns whoever had been there was gone and he had no idea where he searched the landings the grounds and the park for nearly threequarters of an hour but if russell had come to rivers edge hed disappeared there was still the chance that hed seen someone from the village but rutledge was unconvinced what would possibly bring them out this far at this hour of the night there had been no indication that the house had or was being used to store contraband although it wouldnt have surprised him to find that it had been on occasion an empty house on the water was always a great temptation a boat could easily come up this far on a dark night put in at the landing long enough for the goods in bulk to be unloaded and carried up to the terrace doors a fairly decent livelihood but this gift had been handed to them at the same time that crossing the channel had become impossible the villagers must have cursed their luck and if the smuggling that he had witnessed was any example they hadnt reestablished their contacts or else they were unable to afford more than three men could carry hamish said theyre a suspicious lot at best they wouldna trust strangers in france any more than strangers in yon village rutledge had to agree with him he gave up the search finally whoever had been here had gone either by boat or on foot quietly and without being seen walking down the choked drive to his motorcar rutledge was glad hed left it some distance from the stone gates all the same he was relieved to find it just as hed left it motor and tires intact he had no taste for walking all the way to furnham t he dragonfly inn was dark but when rutledge tried the door it opened a small lamp burned in the little room behind reception and he called to the man who was usually there no one answered he wondered how the inn made enough money to stay open given the owners aversion to strangers and then he realized the answer to that ordinarily this was where the contraband was broughtexcept when a man from scotland yard had stubbornly taken up residence it could be sorted and passed on at leisure but more importantly controlled by the chosen few involved the three men in the run hed witnessed had had to make other arrangements no doubt cursing the intruder from london every step of the way he grinned in the lamplight amused turning the register around he saw that one other person had stayed here in his absence one frederick marshall a single night a fisherman or someone who had once served at the airfield rutledge couldnt imagine a sudden attack of nostalgia bringing one of the airmen or their crews back to furnham he signed his name put down the number of the room hed been given before and went up the stairs in his absence it had been cleaned and the bed newly made fresh towels on the rack by the washstand without bothering to turn on a light rutledge undressed and went to bed but it was some time before he actually fell asleep hamish was awake and busy in the back of his mind and rutledge found himself mulling over the nights events who had been standing on the landing stage and where had he gone rutledge didnt believe in coincidences it had to be russell and it was very likely that hed borrowed or taken a boat to make the long journey down the hawking reaching the house by river rather than over the road why he hadnt stayed was anyones guess at least for the night late as it was bruised and tired as he must have been or had this simply been reconnaissanceto be sure before he brought in supplies and prepared to stay that no one was waiting for him here because there was no other place really where russell could go sleep overtook rutledge then and the first rays of dawn were coming in the window when he awoke the man behind the deskclerk or owner rutledge had never been surewas startled to find rutledge coming down the stairs as he arrived the next morning it took several minutes of explanation and exclamation before the clerk would accept the fact that rutledge intended to stay at the inn and wanted his breakfast when it finally came it consisted of overcooked eggs burned toast and tea strong enough to walk back to london on its own there was no sign of molly and he wondered if she was called in only when there were guests to serve as he was finishing his meal he asked the man about the visitor in his absence frederick marshall here youre not to be reading the register its none of your affair the clerk told him angry rutledge said its done who is he he came to see if there was any good sport fishing here the clerk said clearly against his will the other rivers in this part of essex have a fair amount of it and he thought the hawking might as well he was of a mind to buy land and set up a yacht club if it was promising and is it promising i sent him over to the pub he was told that the war had put paid to any good fishing what with the zeppelins and the fighters at the airfield and the coastguard mining the mouth of the river i should think furnham would prosper with more contact with the rest of the country it would mean some changes but theyre inevitable and thats what we dont need the clerk said goaded what will we do with ourselves when furnham is overrun with strangers and theres not a spot we can call our own what we saw in the war will last us a lifetime prying taking us for fools who didnt know our elbow from our nose cheating us where they could laughing at us behind their hands i saw it for myself the way they lorded it over the rest of us loud and brash and not taking no for an answer when it was something they wanted he was incensed now it was a trial of the spirit the four years they was here if it hadnt been for the war wed have run them off in the first six months i wasnt the only one went off to fight the war not knowing if my wife would be mine when i got back if this inn would still be standing after one of their wild parties betwixt the coastguard and the airmen it was four years of hell he turned and walked out of the dining room leaving rutledge sitting there he rose and left as well but the clerk was nowhere in sight when he walked through reception and went out to his motorcar this wasnt the only village that war had disrupted and overrun but for people more or less left to their own devices for hundreds of years it was harsh reality with no respite and for some of them it was impossible to go back to the past hard as furnham was trying he didnt think the village would win men like frederick marshall were always looking to the main chance and in the end the villages along rivers like the blackwater and the crouch and the hawking would succumb thanks to the motorcar they were too close to london now to survive for very long he walked down to the water and stood looking toward the sea the day was fair and already warmer than usual far out in the north sea he could just make out a ship steaming by the smoke of its funnels a thick gray line above a hull that was nearly invisible from here barber spoke just behind him and rutledge turned quickly he hadnt heard him walk down to the waters edge the lapping of the river on the strand had covered the sound of his footsteps what brings you back to our fair village he asked ned willets funeral rutledge said keeping his voice light when is it to be it was yesterday you missed it the man replied with some satisfaction im sorry were not barber reached down and picked up something from the strand it was a flat stone and he sent it skimming across the water not bad seven skips barber went on then he turned back to rutledge youll be leaving then there was nothing to keep him here except for the search for russell and yet the mans eagerness to see the last of him aroused his suspicions he took a chance making another run to france are you before the moon is full barbers face was a picture of dismay and anger then wariness i dont know what youre talking about rutledge picked up a stone just by the toe of his boot and sent it skimming across the river it skipped nine times hypothetically of course weighing the word barber stared at rutledge then looked out to sea as rutledge himself had done earlier but not before rutledge had caught the doubt in his eyes he had pushed far enough after a moment rutledge added my only interest is what happened to ben willet ive told you help me there and ill be on my way i dont know who killed him nor do i was it you because when he came home from france he was different no longer a villager prepared to keep village secrets or was it major russell perhaps out of jealousy or because willet knew too much about the death of justin fowler miss farraday because willet presumed on her friendship barber picked up another stone looked at it and let it drop to the strand again he was silent so long that rutledge thought he wasnt going to answer at all finally he said the answer could lie in france have you thought about that he wouldnt be the first one to want to stay hanging about with that useless lot in paris drinking and whoring and posturing with the rest of them rather than coming home and doing right by his family it would have killed the old man rutledge turned to look up the river so that barber couldnt read his face on the postal card willet had sent to cynthia farraday a few days before his murder hed told her he was intending to visit his father and then return to paris and finish his last book but abigail claimed he hadnt come home since the war and if he hadnt why did sandy barber suspect his brotherinlaw had chosen to stay in paris after a footman from thetford son of a fisherman in furnham would have been eager to return to the laughton house where his former position was awaiting him why should you think that ben willet would be one of them he asked his eyes on a shorebird flitting here and there after whatever the current had on offer barber lifted a shoulder in irritation i dont know someonejessup i believe it wassaid something after he cleared his throat he said better men than ben had been tempted to stay on what had barber been about to say before hed caught himself after one of his runs to france for contraband after meeting ben willet in london or tilbury or on the road to furnham that was an odd remark rutledge said facing him did he know ben so well barber flushed i dont know what the hell possessed him to make it it doesnt matter does it the point being that once ben was free from furnham he never looked back not really too good for the likes of us i expect in his castoff clothes and his airs he made fun of the household in thetford and most likely he kept the kitchen staff in thetford rolling on the floor with his imitations of us there was an intensity of bitterness in his voice that was unexpected he loved his wife rutledge thought and was angry for her sake but this was a new intensity what did he know and as if he knew hed already said too much barber turned on his heel and walked away without a word tales of the wild bohemian ways of paris painted in lurid detail had come home from france with returning soldiers most of them had never seen paris but most knew someone who had and those who had were not above embellishing for greater effect for ned willets son to prefer that world to the staid life of service in a respectable household was unimaginable to someone who had rarely left this backwater of essex rutledge turned to follow him will you let me speak to your wife barber shook his head she cant help you and besides shes still cut up about her fathers death and ben not making it back here in time she told me this morning that she couldnt understand why he hadnt written what am i to do tell her that hes dead as well she even asked me to go to thetford and see if hes all right whats more the whispers have already started someone talked to his wife despite my warning and when i find out who ill kill him myself rutledge said shell have to know the truth sometime let her heal a little first when will they release his body i can give the order tomorrow thats too soon with a nod barber turned and walked away again rutledge let him go this time hamish said theres more to him than meets the eye i agree then rutledge added thoughtfully he would kill ben willet himself if he thought willet was going to hurt abigail but theres nothing he can do the man is already dead and thats grief he has to carry its verra possible that he did kill him gie him a little rope meanwhile i have to find major russell and that meant returning to rivers edge halfway to his motorcar in the inn yard rutledge saw nancy brothers coming toward him a market basket over one arm she hesitated and he thought perhaps she didnt wish it to be known that he had come to the farm to interview her but after that brief moment she walked on ducked her head in a diffident nod and passed him without a word he touched his hat but didnt speak in accordance with her unexpressed wish it was a measure he thought of the village attitude toward him indeed hed been surprised that sandy barber had sought him out hamish reminded him that barber was a force to be reckoned with in furnham and made up his own rules but rutledge had a feeling that the encounter had gone beyond curiosity a fishing expedition then he was just stepping into the motorcar when the inns clerk came to the door are you leaving then he asked hopefully ill fetch your valise for you rutledge shook his head and drove off toward rivers edge leaving the clerk looking after him with frustration writ large on his face a s far as he could tell after hed left the motorcar and walked up to the gate nothing had changed there the chain was still looped between the pillars and the high grass showed his passage but not he thought that of someone else unless someone had walked in his tracks he made his way up the drive to the house remembering last night and his care not to be seen until he was ready to show himself and that had been wise given the weapons hed found in the study now he went boldly toward the house across the open ground and around to the terrace it was one thing to shoot an intruder in the dark and quite another to fire on him in the light of day instead of mounting the steps he scanned the river for any sign of watchers where for instance had cynthia farraday met ben willet ye canna tell you do na know the coves and inlets yed require field glasses to be sure rutledge turned to study the margins of the lawns that line where the cultivated grass ended and the marsh began how much draining had it taken to rip this estate out of the marshs grip or had this been a naturally higher stretch of land he could see for himself that there were half a dozen places that might be the beginning of a track through the reeds but striking out into one of them would be foolish at best unless one knew what he was about and how often did the tracks shift would russell have been able to find his way after all this time rutledge was reminded in fact of a maze with its artificial twists and turns intentionally leading the unwary down blind alleys there was the river of course to help keep ones bearings but as the ground rose in hummocky patches and dipped into small wet pockets even that guide could disappear he was beginning to understand how mrs russell could vanish so easily but was she aliveor deadwhen she did turning to climb the steps to the terrace he debated whether or not to go inside if russell was there walking in uninvited could be considered trespass and laying siege in the hope to see him come out of his own accord was wasting time what was the mans state now hed left the house in chelsea after slapping cynthia not hard but enough to shock both of them his body was battered from the motorcycle accident and he knew he was being hunted did he see himself as a man with a damaged mind who had burned his bridges there was a good chance that russell had never intended to stay here and every intention of dying here by his own hand rutledge crossed to the door and tried it it was still unlocked just as hed left it but when he swung it wide the morning sun fell across a muddy footprint on the floorboards just inside he hadnt risked turning on his torch and there was no way of knowing if it had been there last night before hed seen the man out by the landing or not squatting beside it he touched the rim of mud it was hard dry and the shape didnt match his own boots it was longer and wider he cast about for any indication that the wearer of the shoe had gone out again two or three crumbles of mud were caught in the threads of the carpet a stride away but after that he could find nothing straightening he called russell major russell are you here the words seemed to echo through the house loud enough to be heard by anyone inside but even though he called again no one answered hamish was reminding him that he was here where the yard couldnt reach him if new developments occurred in london or for that matter if something happened to him out here on the hawking but he took his chances and walked into the garden room taking care not to destroy the footprint or add his own he went directly to the study to look at the gun case if russell was here and armed he wanted to know it before encountering the man he opened the glass door the shotguns were just what hed expected used for hunting below were the revolvers and he would have sworn last night that there were only two in the case now there were three chapter he stood there for a moment thinking remembering how the cold metal had felt as he touched the handguns in the dark yes just the two last night he was sure of it he couldnt be mistaken not with weapons the third was a service revolver and it was the same caliber as the one that had been used to kill ben willet it appeared to have been cleaned recently no way of knowing when it had last been fired the science that could tell him was in its infancy and not always trustworthy taking out his handkerchief he examined the other revolver fired but not cleaned since then he set it back where hed found it more to the point how had this third handgun magically appeared in less than twentyfour hours did it mean russell had finally come home what did this have to do with the man hed seen last night hed been upstairs in the master bedroom after searching the ground floor and then the first floor could the man have come in and set the revolver in the gun case the house was large enough that neither man would necessarily have heard the others movements what had taken him to the waters edge before he left did he think he was safe enough that he could take his time about leaving or was he looking for signs of a boat along the riverbank if the tide was out there could have been a rowboat riding low in the water no answers to any of his questions rutledge listened to the house the maker of that footprint could still be here and for all he knew the revolver could have been used here he remembered that timothy jessup had mentioned seeing him at rivers edge and asked if he intended to buy the property but rutledge as aware of his surroundings as any man of his experience could be had not seen jessup frances was right one could conceal a battalion out there in the grass there was nothing for it but to search the house again and then the grounds but they yielded nothing save for the footprint and the revolver he would have been prepared to swear that hed been the only living soul inside rivers edge last night closing the terrace door behind him he walked down to the waters edge no sign of a boat here but at the second landing while he couldnt find any proof that anyone had come in here he found the faint imprint of a mans boot in the damp earth just above the highwater mark he squatted there studying it it appeared to belong to the same foot as the one in the house but the soft earth hadnt preserved it as well as the hard surface of the wooden floor standing again he looked back at the house beyond the kitchen gardens and the few outbuildings and felt a rising frustration with major russell where the hell was the man halfway back to furnham just beyond the turning that led to the rectory and the churchyard rutledge saw constable nelson pedaling toward him on his bicycle rutledge slowed looking for me he asked nelson stopped rutledge could see that he was sober although haggard as if he had finished the last of his stock no sir but i will ask did you see a loose mare back the way youve just come a mare no i havent one of the villages upstream reported her missing jumped the pasture fence shes a valuable beast and i was asked to keep an eye out for her when did she go missing rutledge asked quickly the owners not sure he went to st albans for a few days and when he came back she was gone he doesnt believe she got this far but he sent word by the ironmongers son who went to the dentist in tilbury he gestured to the dusty unmade surface of the road no tracks that the boy could pick up on his way home and none ive seen so far but i said id look a pretense of doing his duty or was there more to this had he been asked to look for russell rutledge was nearly certain that matron wouldnt have contacted the police but the owner of the trusty might well have wanted his pound of flesh it was even possible nelson was keeping a watch on the troublesome londoners movements for someone testing the waters rutledge said how well do you know timothy jessup he was ben willets uncle im told jessup you dont want to tangle with that one nelson said alarm in his face a nasty piece of work never in any trouble with the law you understand and i thank god for that all the same nobody ever crosses him rutledge heard overtones in the mans voice that made him wonder if jessup and not sandy barber was the leader of the smugglers how well did he get on with ben i wouldnt say they were close abigail has always been jessups favorite and he was against ben going into service in thetford i overheard them quarreling once ben was trying to explain that he wasnt cut out to be a fisherman jessup wanted to know if he thought he was better than his father and ben said it wasnt that hed rather blacken another mans boots in a city than gut fish here in furnham jessup knocked him down then and told him to stop daydreaming and get on with the life he was born to lead and ben said you dont want anyone to leave thats all for fear hell talk about things he shouldnt what things nelson said uneasily it was just talk a boys talk and hed been up to rivers edge a time or two hed seen a different way of life the smuggling hamish said yon uncle was afraid the lad would tell someone but was it only that had furnham corrupted its only officer of the law just to protect a few bottles of brandy a little tobacco and whatever other small luxuries these men had brought in on their backs the entire village seemed to be involved in the secret not just a handful of rogue fishermen constable nelson was preparing to mount his bicycle again someone told me last year that ned willet had written a book and it was published in france i doubt ned could put two words together on a page much less a book but i didnt believe that not for a minute why not rutledge asked curious i never knew anyone who wrote a book and im not likely to not anyone from furnham and he was gone pedaling along the road seemingly the model of a village constable sober and responsible until the next bottle of french brandy was left outside his door it was easy to see where his loyalties might lie france rutledge was letting out the clutch preparing to drive on when the single word stopped him ned willet what was ben willets full name was it possible that on one of the runs to france someone had asked jessup if the old man had written a book jessup would have found that as amusing as the constable had and on his next run had the frenchman produced such a book to have the last laugh he reversed and turned into the road leading to the rectory how much did the rector know about what was happening in his own parish or was he as much jessups creature as constable nelson was mr morrison was sitting in his studycumparlor when rutledge stopped in the short drive he got up and met his visitor at the door before he could knock come in inspector im sick of my own company the parlor was simply furnished but a lovely old desk took pride of place and morrison saw rutledge looking at it my fathers he said the only thing of his that i possess actually i was trying to think of a suitable subject for my next sermon he gestured to a shelf behind the desk rutledge could see that there were at least twenty collections of sermons there bound in leather he wondered if these were a relic of morrisons father as well one would think he went on that every possible permutation of religious topics had been covered already but one soldiers on searching for inspiration rutledge smiled in point of fact its a book thats brought me here sermons morrison asked blankly staring from the shelf to rutledges face actually no do you have the old christening records for the church st edwards as a matter of fact we do going back to the early s i can search for whatever you need to know but it will take time in some cases the ink is faded or the writing is illegible my predecessors were not always thinking about posterity when they made their notations what im after isnt that old id like to know ben willets full name abigail barber hasnt been told yet that hes dead and i dont care to distress her at this stage bens name i can answer your question without consulting the records edward benjamin stephen willet he was named for his father his grandfather and an uncle he was called ben to prevent any confusion morrison smiled ruefully i was entering neds death and looked up ben while i was about it hed have been twentyeight in september edward willet yes hed have used that name honoring himself and his father rutledge said after a moment youre releasing the body is that why youre interested for theerforms actually i was wondering what name willet would have used if hed published a book in france willet good god no youre mistaken on that score i heard the story going round about ned im not sure who started it jessup perhaps or one of the others i dont often hear gossip but there was talk in one of the shops one day they were laughing they had forgot i was there you dont have a copy of the book they spoke of hardly it doesnt exist or at least i dont believe it does then how did such a tale start when morrison looked away as if trying to choose his words rutledge added you neednt worry i know about the smuggling its not what brought me here and if it has no bearing on murder i intend to ignore it very wise of you morrison agreed i shut my eyes as well one cant help but notice that constable nelson drinks himself into a stupor on brandy one cant purchase at the rowing boat poor man he isnt cut out to be a policeman he came here just now asking if id seen a lost horse i never know whether these forays of his into duty are real or a way of salving his conscience there was a band of gypsies said to be camping out in the marshes and before that a stolen bicycle um where was i smuggling yes i was going to add that the veil abigail wore at her wedding was french lace handed down from her mother and ned god rest his soul ned used to do the runs to france before the war he took ben with him once or twice when the boy was fifteen while i sat with ned after he injured his leg he told me the story how ben was seasick when a storm blew up and they had to put into a different french port he was so ill he was taken in by a french family didnt know a word they were saying to him but he walked about in a daze for weeks afterward enamored of the daughter of the house he got over it of course at that age boys generally do but had he rutledge remembered the copybook in a box in the laughtons attic the description of the woman in chapter seventeen was she based on the girl ben believed hed fallen in love with as a boy did the french ever produce the book they talked about on another run perhaps i shouldnt think so if they did no one showed it to me and ned would have he loved a good joke why is it so important because its possible the book does exist and that the authors name was edward willet but not the father of course the son i still dont see why this matters what could it have to do with young willets death for all we know it could be an entirely different branch of the family ned told me once that there are willets in derbyshire and norfolk nor do i see the connection at the moment morrison shook his head how many books do you think the people of furnham read in the course of a year the bible perhaps theyve always lived hard lives these villagers they dont have the luxury of reading nor the time or the money to buy books the children go to school until theyre old enough to help earn their keep the war was particularly hard with the sea cut off i understand is there any other matter i can help you with other than bens full name rutledge said i have a puzzle on my hands three deaths with seemingly no link between them mrs russell in justin fowler in and now ben willets you know these people better than i ever shall do you see a pattern that i have missed morrison frowned we dont know what happened to mrs russell do we she may well have been in great distress over the coming war as her family suggested if thats true i bear some of the blame for not seeing her need in time as for fowler why should you think hes dead simply because he has cut his ties with the people who used to be close to him a troubled man sometimes prefers to turn to strangers rather than risk the pity of those he cares about as for ben im afraid that in the end well discover that his death is more related to london than it is to furnham you present a very reasonable case i wish i could believe in it when youve been a policeman as long as i have theres a sixth sense about murder the locket around ben willets throat connects him to rivers edge if nothing else does ah yes the locket but that too has a reasonable explanation doesnt it im afraid miss farraday has left a trail of broken hearts behind her i shouldnt be surprised if ben was one of them she was kind to him after all it explains the photograph not the locket itself are you so certain that it isnt the only one of its kind with mrs russells initial engraved on the face there must be thousands of englishwomen named elizabeth emily eleanor eugeniahave you considered that i dont like coincidence morrison smiled im afraid i cant help you there my business is to save souls not to hunt killers as rutledge rose to take his leave morrison added if you find that willets book exists i should like to know about it in fact id like to read it myself ill be sure to tell you they had walked as far as the door when rutledge said this man jessup is he dangerous do you think timothy hes a hard man to know and he doesnt care to be thwarted by ben going into service instead of to sea or by an airfield being built in this parish he nearly killed a man coming to blows with him after he discovered hed come here to weigh the possibility of furnham becoming a seaside town i shouldnt like to cross him an unwitting echo of constable nelsons words and morrisons comment explained why he and frances had been challenged by the man after leaving the rectory rutledge spent threequarters of an hour looking for any sign of a runaway horse there was always the chance that russell had taken it to speed him on his way to furnham but he had no more luck that constable nelson had someone had been along the road with horse and cart that was clear enough but a single horseno he continued to london his mind occupied with the problem of the three victims while morrison might believe there was no connection he had a feeling there must be it was one of the reasons hed come looking for russell he expected when he reached cynthia farradays house that she would refuse to receive him but the maid mary admitted him and led him to the small sitting room where miss farraday was writing a letter if youve come to see if im well youve wasted a trip she said as he walked through the door im angry now at wyatt and at myself for being frightened of him im happy to see you fully recovered he countered then asked do you by chance still have a copy of the book ben willet is said to have written said she asked i told you hed had two volumes published he was working on a third i dont suppose he finished that before he was killed but there it is rising from the desk she went to the bookshelf under the window and retrieved two books here see for yourself he thanked her and took the books he looked at the name on the coveredward willet as hed expected then he opened the first of the two books at random reading a page here and there it was a war memoir as she had told him earlier the title was a long road home beginning when willet went to enlist it was filled with stories of the men hed trained with and then fought with they were well realized and very human and it brought the war back all too vividly have you read this he asked looking up the earlier part i found the rest too disturbing how awful it must have been to have these men come into ones life to get to know them and watch as they are shot or blown up or grievously wounded by shrapnel there was another corporal he came to know very well another young man in service in thetford and a month before the armistice the man was shot and died in his arms she shook her head as if to clear it of the image shed invoked i couldnt bear it he said fighting to keep his voice even it was what we knew still skimming he stopped at the top of a page and read on i hadnt heard from home for some weeks and then i saw an officer i recognized he lived near my village his shoulder was in a bad way and he was being sent to england for further treatment i asked if he would find out if my father and my sister were all right id heard that one of my brothers had been killed the one here in france but there had been no news about the one in the navy captain f told me he intended to go to essex as soon as he was well enough and he promised to send me word but he never did i expect he must have died of his wounds because as far as i know he never came back to france id asked around hoping he was all right and they hadnt had to take off his arm all of us fear amputation more than death my sister did write finally and told me that joseph was dead as well and she begged me to come home safe it was with heavy heart that i went back into the line that day and i think i killed a good many germans in josephs name rutledge was about to ask miss farraday if shed read the chapter and if she thought captain f was a reference to justin fowler he remembered in time that she had told him she could have loved fowler instead he looked for the date of that passage and it was in the spring of and as far as he could judge reading on into september there was no other reference to captain f hed have to read the book from cover to cover to be sure of that have you found something of interest she said watching him as he read it brings back memories he said evading her question she nodded i expect it would he turned to the second book thicker by far and this time fiction the title was simply marianne it was set in paris during the war and the chief character browning warden was searching for a woman hed met before the war while smuggling along the french coast hamish said ye ken it wouldna make his family verra happy which was probably why willet hadnt told them about the books or perhaps he felt that he wasnt ready to share this next part of his life given the trouble hed had over becoming a footman rutledge said to cynthia farraday have you read this one yes i thought it quite good but had she known how much truth had gone into the story skimming again he looked for a chapter similar to the one hed read in thetford and he found it the description of the wartorn french village was astonishingly real now unlike the poorly imagined village in the copybook the odd thing was the woman in the earlier version had been dark haired dark eyed the girl willet must have recalled from his boyhood in this version she had light brown hair and sounded very much like cynthia farraday had she recognized herself the early pages describing where browning warden lived evoked furnham although willet had renamed it and the river the isolation the marshes the dark river where he learned to sail the crossing to france all spoke of firsthand knowledge the first meeting with the girl he would seek during the war her search later for the wounded soldier who had deserted to marry her shadowed a fulfillment of the promise glimpsed in the thetford notebooks realizing that hed been reading for some minutes he set the book aside youre right willet was quite a fine writer do you by any chance know what the third book was to be about pure evil she replied thats what he said once that it was a study in mans depravity but i cant tell you what story he was telling im sorry he didnt want to talk about it very much he said it was a reflection of what hed seen in the war and what he knew of heroism and cruelty ambitious that was his word for it and gertrude stein whoever she may be thought what shed read was splendid these first two books had roots in willets life his experiences in the war this love for a girl he could never marry based on the smuggling he knew so much about i wonder if the third book did the same are you saying that there actually was smuggling going on in furnham that ben was a part of it she shook her head you must be mistaken he liked the way the past shaped the future nothing to do with reality and he had lied to her to protect her or to protect the people of furnham there was nothing here with the possible exception of the reference to captain f to cause a mans death or to support willets claim that russell had killed justin fowler with regret he set the books aside cynthia farraday was saying im not in a position to judge not really i know so little about writing but i think the second book is much more mature than anything hed written before the war hed seen the world he understood far better what he was trying to say the money i gave him was well repaid can you imagine what paris must have been like after furnham or even thetford for that matter you lived at rivers edge did you feel that the village in the second novel was furnham well of course it was i mean to say he didnt use real names but i recognized a few of the residents those i knew there are probably more reading these i keep asking myself why he came to scotland yard and posed as wyatt russell was that the only lie he told me or have i been chasing shadows i dont know you havent told me if youd found wyatt are you saving bad news for the last i cant find him i thought hed be in essex there was nowhere else to go and i was wrong why did you tell me you wished to buy rivers edge if it were for sale color rose in her face to find the girl i once was i suppose dont you ever wish you could go back its heartbreaking to see it standing empty and i have a feeling wyatt wont ever live there again he sees the ghosts that walk i dont not even the ghost of justin fowler justin was handsome he loved sportswe had croquet and lawn tennis and the like horses to ride a boat but he wasthere was something about him a darkness i thought at the time having read too many novels still it was there i thought at first he missed his parents they were dead like mine but he never talked about them never my father and i did this or my mother loved roses i wondered afterward if perhaps he wanted to forget them why she looked across at the window perhaps it was too painful to remember my parents died on holiday there was a typhoid outbreak in spain while they were in cordoba they were thereand then they werent horrible for me but id said goodbye when they went away and when their luggage was returned there were presents for me ribbons and a cutglass bottle for scent some lace and a collection of photographs theyd bought in famous places i knew theyd been thinking about me and i found it comforting i dont know how his died perhaps they were ill and had been suffering for some time the sort of thing one tries to put behind one it was an interesting possibility he thanked her and was preparing to leave when she said wyatt didnt come back not even to apologize do you think he ever will for her sake he lied once more im sure he will s topping at the marlborough hotel he used their telephone to put in a call to the yard it was some time before gibson could be found and he sounded harassed when he finally answered sir where are you was his first question after rutledge had identified himself what news do you have of the chief superintendent rutledge countered in hospital sir and the report is not good where are you traveling rutledge replied have you learned anything about justin fowler or benjamin willet nothing about fowler as for the other man he had rooms in bloomsbury but gave them up to return to france there was no real connection then with the marlborough hotel willet had lied when he claimed he had rooms there gibson was saying constable burton who located his lodgings is very thorough we also found the doctor who treated this man willet he gave rutledge the address in harley street dr baker good work and keep trying with fowler if you will sir ill try were at sixes and sevens with the chief superintendent in hospital rutledge noticed that gibson had used bowless title rather than what he and the rank and file called him old bowels it was not a good sign nor was the fact that it appeared that no one had yet been asked to fill in either temporarily or permanently much as he himself disliked the man it was hard to picture the yard without him someones been looking for the file on the macguire trial by any chance do you know where that is i sent it along to the chief superintendent look there if it isnt in his box it may have been given to someone else yes sir ill do that and the weatherly case rutledge felt a twinge of conscience on my desk the constable who discovered the body hasnt finished his report ill get on that then gibson paused then added quietly theres been some question about what to do one rumor says chief inspector cummins might be called back that meant that there had been some discussion in the upper echelons after all and no ones view had prevailed in point of fact the chief superintendent would be hard to replace for the simple reason that he had never groomed a successor for fear of being overshadowedor shown lacking rutledge rang off and stood there for a moment in the telephone closet he ought to go back to the yard but the last thing he wished to do was enter into the speculation and carping that must be going on much less the ruthless undercurrents as some tried to benefit from bowless crisis hed become a policeman for very sound reasons and political intrigue was not one of them hed been pleased when cummins who had retired earlier in the summer had suggested that he be promoted as his replacement it had been a measure of cumminss respect for a junior officer but subsequent events had left a bitter taste in rutledges mouth hed realized that promotion would leave him vulnerable to attack where he could least afford to tell the real truth about the war hed been decorated for bravery but the stigma of shell shockregarded as cowardicewould negate that he realized that someone was standing outside the door waiting to use the telephone and he left the hotel with every intention of going back to essex but he actually went to his flat and paced the floor for over an hour hamish loud in the back of his mind his temporary exile from the yard and the inquiry at hand driving him to physical action there was something missing in the case and he didnt know what it was yet why had ben willet facing his own death come to scotland yard to accuse wyatt russell of a murder committed during the war the only connection between willet and russell besides the river that connected rivers edge and the village of furnham had been cynthia farraday had willet known how she felt about fowler and as a last gift tried to end her uncertainty over what had become of the man he could just as easily have been trying to protect her from the police by pointing them elsewhere but if the police knew nothing about fowlers death to start with why bring it to their attention and who had found it necessary to kill ben willet when he was already dying or had the killer known that major russell had said that willet wanted to be killed rather than face the indignity and excruciating pain of waiting for the end but this didnt smack of a mercy killing shooting him hadnt been enoughhis body had been stripped of identification and shoved into the thames for good measure it should have disappeared for good or else have been so badly disfigured by the water the fish and the passing ships that any identification would be impossible but luck had not been on the killers side a third possibility was that someone had discovered that willet had come to the yardor he had actually told someone what hed done but why bring up justin fowlers death in the first place what had driven willet to make such a claim he had seemed to have no place in either the village or rivers edge no one but a sister to mourn his loss no one but that same sister waiting eagerly for news of him or for the closure that finding his killer could bring to those who had survived him and what about willets writing what role had that played waiting for gibson to find out what he needed to know could take days it was better to drive to colchester and see what he could discover for himself that had been where fowlers parents had lived and died hamish said theres the room in furnham theyll be relieved when i dont return rutledge retorted packing a valise but before he left london rutledge went to call on dr baker he was an older man his hair nearly white his eyes a sharp gray murdered you say willet thats startling news indeed he regarded rutledge for a moment but youre here about his illness not his murder there was nothing i could do we could have tried surgery of course but the cancer had spread too far and willet knew that what did he take for the pain i gave him morphine but i dont believe he took it very often he said he had something to do before he died and he wanted a clear mind why should he come to scotland yard give another mans name and in that mans name confess to a murder willet did that ill be damned medically i cant account for it how did he receive his diagnosis quietly he didnt appear to be particularly religious but i overheard him comment as he was dressing again that god was punishing him he didnt tell me how hed incurred the almightys displeasure perhaps i should have asked but he wasnt speaking to me and i respected his privacy have you considered that his charade was intended to push the yard into action as he appears to have done its possible rutledge answered neutrally would willet have paid someone to cut short his suffering rather than contemplate suicide i think not unless hed finished whatever it was that drove him to eschew taking something for his pain and it was growing unbearable as it would have done im sorry i cant give you a more satisfying answer i knew very little about his personal life except for the fact that hed recently lived in paris and had come home to be seen by a doctor hamish reminded him of a last question rutledge said you examined him of course was he by any chance wearing a gold locket he took it from his pocket holding it out to dr baker quite pretty isnt it and quite old as well but no ive never seen it before rutledge thanked him and was about to walk out the door when baker said suddenly i just remembered he asked if i had any information on the plague i gave him a book to read and he brought it back on his last visit he said he had found it very interesting i asked him why he should want to study the subject and he said that it was a hobby of his a hobby he must have seen my reactionvery much like yours im sureand he smiled and said the spanish flu was a plague was it not killing thousands i told him the effects might have been the same the way it ravaged country after country but that the pathology was quite different it wasnt spread by rats or fleas and he said yes but you see its the only comparison i can make c olchester had once been a roman camp the capital of roman britain until queen boudicca burned it to the ground during the iceni revolt it had also been a prosperous woolen center in the middle ages it was very late when rutledge reached his destination the town was dark quiet only a few vehicles and fewer pedestrians on the streets as he made his way to the town hall with its handsome tower and then found the police station lights were on inside but he knew that only a small night staff would be there tomorrow morning would suffice there was a room available at the ancient hostelry the rose and crown and he fell asleep almost as soon as his head touched the pillow hamish had been busy in the back of his mind from the time hed left london and he was glad to shut out the soft scots voice after breakfast the next morning in one of the small halftimbered rooms off the main dining room rutledge left his motorcar in the inns yard and walked to the police station the streets were busy men hurrying to their work women walking small children to school while older boys laughed as they took turns kicking a stone down the road shopkeepers were only just opening their doors and the greengrocer was setting boxes of vegetables on racks in front of his window he nodded as rutledge passed and then spoke to a woman just behind him calling her by name and wishing her a good day rutledge could feel the warmth of the sun on his back and smell the summer dust stirred up by passing motorcars the motes gleaming in the sunlight not a day to speak of murder he thought as he opened the door to the police station and stepped into the dim interior the sergeant at the desk looked up as he entered and asked his business rutledge explained what he was afterany information that the local constabulary had on the family of one justin fowler formerly of colchester before moving to essex he saw the expression in the mans eyes change although he gave nothing away scotland yard he repeated it might be best sir if you speak to inspector robinson ill find out if he can see you now robinson could taking rutledge back to his office and offering him a chair the mans desk was piled high with paperwork but the room was tidy otherwise and robinson himself was spare neatly dressed and curious to know why rutledge had come he explained himself as well as he could given the sparseness of information at his disposal beginning with a report that had come to the attention of the yard claiming that one justin fowler had been murdered during the war his body had never been found but because of another murder closely associated with that case the yard was interested in learning more about fowlers background robinson considered him as he spoke fowler is dead you say we cant be sure the man who told us about the murder has since died violently we find ourselves wondering if the two events are connected hmmm yes what do you know about fowlers family only that his parents died when he was eleven or twelve and shortly afterward he was given into the guardianship of mrs elizabeth russell of rivers edge mrs russell is dead as well and her son was gravely injured in the war weve had no other information i see robinson shifted papers on his desk then looked up and said then you may not know that fowlers parents were murdered chapter robinson had been watching rutledges face as he spoke judging the impact of his words i see that thats news i didnt think they had died on the same day i went to somerset house they didnt fowlers father died at the scene and his mother two days later young fowler himself was in hospital for six months first with stab wounds and then with infection he passed his next birthday there when he was about to be released the fowler family solicitors contacted mrs russell and she agreed to take him a number of people were willing to give him a home he was that well liked but the doctors believed that it would be best if he left colchester altogether too many reminders and so on and you never found the person who was responsible there was very little evidence to guide us robinson answered his tone defensive mrs fowler died without regaining consciousness when we could we questioned justin but he was asleep when the murders were committed and he woke up in the dark to find a figure standing by his bed and then he himself was stabbed and left for dead it was the housemaid bringing up morning tea who discovered his parents and she ran down to the kitchen in hysterics the housekeeper went up to see for herself sent one of the other maids for the doctor and the police and only then had the presence of mind to look in on the boy the staff was cleared of any involvement yes we felt fairly confident that they werent to blame the housekeeper was fifty the three maids in their early forties the cook nearing sixty all of them had been with the family for twenty years or more and we found a window in the dining room broken a bloody handprint on the post at the bottom of the drive and signs that someone had been sick just there we questioned the staff but they knew of no one who had a reason to kill mr or mrs fowler he was a solicitor we spoke to his partner and we were assured that there was no evidence that the murders were related to his work mostly wills conveyances and the like the partner himself had been attending a funeral in suffolk and there must be twenty witnesses to that it was clear that robinson was not happy admitting to scotland yard that the murders had gone unsolved and it was just as clear that with two dead and one severely injured no suspects and no answers the local constabulary had chosen not to call in the yard why who was in charge of the inquiry he asked robinson inspector eaton i was a constable at the time i had no voice in decisions but i can tell you that i saw the bodies repeatedly stabbed as bloody a sight as id ever seen until the war is eaton still here he died in the influenza epidemic overworked if you want my opinion policeman confessor nurse he tried to do it all there was no possibility that justin fowler killed his parents and then stabbed himself good god no for one thing we never found a weapon even though we searched his room the ground under his windows and every inch of the house wall in between and only his bedding was bloody there was no blood at all on the floor and considering his wounds there most certainly would have been if hed stabbed himself thrown away the weapon and returned to his bed whats more he said hed been too frightened to move he thought the killer was still in the room and soon afterward he fainted from pain and loss of blood and neither parent could have committed the crimes not from the evidence we also looked into that very carefully the inquest person or persons unknown we spent six months investigating every possibility even a botched housebreaking and we discovered nothing new in all that time what became of the staff they stayed in the house until justin fowlers future was decided and then the house was sold the staff pensioned off according to mrs fowlers willshe survived her husband you see but the provisions were very much the same in both cases there was the usual gift to the church fund and to a charity school in london that mr fowler had made gifts to over the years nothing of a size to suggest that they were killed for what anyone expected to inherit and no disgruntled servant client or other person with a grudge against fowler or his family none at all we looked into that as well had the elder fowler always lived in colchester indeed except for a brief time in londonthree years when he was a very young man as i recall he was a junior in a firm of solicitors there before coming here and setting up his own chambers rutledge remembered what nancy brothers had said that mrs russell had lost touch with her cousin after shed married fowler that mrs russell hadnt cared for him was there anything in fowlers background that was in any way irregular irregular unusual a source of concern for the family skeletons in the closet we never discovered any he was some years older than his wife as i remember a pillar of the church impeccable reputation here in colchester i heard one of the other constables an older man say that fowler was too dull to look for trouble much less to find it his wife was a lovely woman my mother cried when she heard what had happened perhaps a case of mistaken identity the wrong people singled out and killed we considered that as well and nothing pointed to that possibility then why had someone come into a house in the night stabbed three people in two different rooms without disturbing the servants in their beds leaving the victims for dead and disappearing as quietly as hed come whats more neither cynthia farraday nor wyatt russell appeared to have had any inkling of justin fowlers past nor had nancy brothers whatever mrs russell had been told by the fowler family solicitor had not been passed on to anyone else and justin himself had kept his secret small wonder everyone felt he was quiet and preferred his own company hed suffered a shocking end to his childhood but what connection did this have with ben willets confession that wyatt russell had killed fowler even when rutledge had questioned him willet had refused to say why or how the murder had been committed because he didnt know any other details he thanked robinson for the information hed been given the inspector rose to see rutledge out and said as they reached the door to the station youll be sure to let me know if you find anything that might shed light on our case i shall i dont see any chance of that at present but then inquiries have a way of moving in directions we havent foreseen yes ive had my own experiences of that good hunting and then rutledge was out in the street walking back to where hed left his motorcar hamish said ye ken the lad was only eleven he couldna overpower both parents even if they were asleep when he came into the room thats very likely no i think we can absolve justin of any blame but it was important to consider one other possibility that during the war major russell learned about justin fowlers past and blamed him for mrs russells disappearance he could have jumped to the conclusion that if fowler had already killed twice and his own parents at that he would likely kill again and how could ben willet have discovered that halfway to the rose and crown he stopped retraced his steps to the police station and asked the name of the fowler solicitor robinson was reluctant to give it to him unwilling to hand the yard his own pet case but rutledge said blandly its possible there are other family members i could speak to we asked there are none still robinson hadnt needed to look it up with that information in hand he tracked down the firm of biddle harrison and bailey their chambers were in a victorian building with a view of the castle and the senior clerk informed rutledge that it was mr harrison who had dealt with the affairs of the fowler family harrisons hair was white but his face was smooth as if age had treated him well his grip was firm when the two men shook hands and then harrison said i understand from my clerk that youve come about the fowler murders is there any new information sadly no but i have been searching for justin fowler i understand he survived the war did you handle his affairs as well he wrote to us when he was about to go into the army he wished to draw up his willas so many young men did at that time it was the first correspondence wed had from him since he went to live with mrs russell as he was underage she had handled his affairs for him the trust fund that his father had set up for the boy had paid him an allowance but the principal wasnt his until he reached the age of twentyfive he left everything to miss cynthia farraday in when he should have reached his majority we heard nothing from him but the war was still on and we thought perhaps he wished to wait until that was over before taking charge of his inheritance it was quite sizable in fact but as one of our junior partners said at the time there was very little need for great sums of money in the trenches and did he contact you when the war was over we wrote to him at rivers edge but the letter was returned we made an effort to contact major russell to discover if justin fowler had survived the war but he could tell us nothing their paths hadnt crossed in the years of fighting and the war office listed him as missing in action that was news and so miss farraday inherited the fowler estate mr harrisons dark brows in such sharp contrast to his white hair rose im afraid were a rather conventional firm mr rutledge missing does not necessarily mean dead we chose not to act precipitously but to wait and see if any new information might help us to learn mr fowlers fate we were left in charge of his estate and its our duty to be certain that he is dead before disbursing such sums yes i quite understand did you contact miss farraday no not directly we did make inquiries and we discovered that she was living in london and was still unmarried that is to say her name hadnt changed with marriage as she made no attempt to contact us we felt it best not to contact her prematurely as it were you said that fowler was missing in action when was this it was early in there was a later report that he was wounded and sent home to england to recover we tried to verify it and were unable to do so id like to know more about the elder fowler i was told by one of the maids who was in service at rivers edge that mrs russell had not cared for her cousins choice of husband do you know why that may have been he was some ten years mrs fowlers senior but it was a love match i can tell you that i saw them a number of times socially and it was very clear that they were a happy couple perhaps there was something in mr fowlers background that mrs russell disapproved of i understood that he was married when he was very young hed just come down from university and he wasgullible shall i say she was someone he met in london and married without his parents knowledge or consent when this woman discovered that he was to be cut off without a farthing she told him that she already had a husband and walked out the door that was the last he saw of her and the marriage was quietly annulled on those grounds fowler left london and returned to colchester he admitted this freely to his fiancee before he married mrs fowler at our urging and what became of the first mrs fowler she died some years later of consumption she wrote to mr fowler before she diedthis was even before hed met the second mrs fowlerbut he refused to meet her she wanted forgiveness and he couldnt find it in himself to forgive so much rutledge thought for the man who was too dull to know what trouble was and who wouldnt know what to do with it if he did find it small wonder he had led a staid life in his second marriage he paid for her care through our good offices and we received notification from the sanitarium when she died he paid for her burial it was generous of him and we never spoke of this matter again nor did you tell the police about his first disastrous marriage we considered speaking to them but the woman was dead and we had actually verified that fact there was no reason to resurrect the past but she had a husband somewhere didnt she or was he a lie as well he was in prison he died there before the murders and that also is certain yes his majestys prisons dont make mistakes of that sort a dead end which led him back to the river hawking he thanked mr harrison for his time then asked one more question this woman what was her name shes dead let her rest in peace i intend to but i should like to know her name for completeness that was something the solicitor understood indeed her name was gladys mitchell shes buried in the cemetery of st agnes the church associated with the nursing clinic where she died at the end she told the sanitarium staff that her father had been a clergyman they felt that this was an attempt to gloss over hersomewhat irregularpast she had initially told one of the staff that he was a solicitor what was he i dont know we werent her solicitors the truth was not something we had need of she had no children according to mr fowler she was not pregnant when she left him and no family a sister im afraid i dont know her name she was with gladys mitchell when she died it was she who arranged the burial do you know where she is now if im not mistaken she died in thank you the senior clerk appeared like magic to escort rutledge to the street door deferentially bidding him farewell hamish said yon sister couldna ha murdered the family weve come to a dead end just as the original inquiry into the fowlers deaths had done he collected his valise from the rose and crown settled his account and drove out of colchester for the road south t he first call rutledge made when he reached furnham was on nancy brothers she was preparing dinner when he knocked at her door wiping her hands on her apron she hesitated then let him into the house my husband will be coming in from the pasture where he was repairing a broken fence and hell be wanting his dinner she told him anxiously i just have two questions for you he told her i wont keep you from your work id like to know if mrs russell ever told you what had happened to justin fowlers parents she told me hed lost his just as miss cynthia had lost hers i took that to mean they died of an illness i thought mr justin consumptive for that matter he was so pale and thin when he first came to rivers edge i said something to mrs russell but she told me he was grieving and it must have been true because he filled out that summer and did mrs russell ever tell you why she didnt approve of her cousin marrying mr fowler she never said not directly but i heard her tell mr wyatt that he was too old all of which corroborated what hed learned in colchester he thanked her and left the farm just as brothers was walking in from the pasture his shoulders stooped with fatigue and his face red with sweat and smeared with dust he saw rutledge turning out of the gate and lifted a hand in greeting nancy brothers had done well for herself he was just turning around to go back to the farmhouse a thought tickling at the back of his mind when he saw constable nelson coming toward him on his bicycle found the missing mare he asked we did tother side of rivers edge some five miles down the road i notified the owners no ive come to find you abigail barber is that upset she wrote to her brother in care of that family in thetford to tell ben that his father was ill and then again to tell ben that his father died now a letters come from them saying they havent seen ben since the start of the war sandy barber is beside himself trying to think what to say to her the truth would be best rutledge said it wouldnt have been possible to keep the news from her for very much longer others have seen the photograph i brought with me yes well barber wants you to come and tell her and explain as well why no one had told her before this he followed nelson into furnham and went alone to the barber house abigail was sitting in the front room when he knocked and then opened the door mrs barber he called from the entry and when she replied he joined her constable nelson had been right her eyes were redrimmed her face blotched by tears there was a crumpled handkerchief in one hand theyve sent scotland yard to me she asked looking at him as he took the chair she offered he said you were an inspector sandy it cant be good news her voice was thick husky im afraid not but first i think it best to tell you what i know about your brother he didnt go back to thetford after the war he was afraid to tell his father what he really wanted to do and apparently from what ive learned from miss farraday oh miss farraday is it she looked up at him anger in her eyes it was miss farraday that put ideas into his head about going into service he never would have left furnham if she hadnt he would have gone to sea like his father and grandfather and never got notions about leaving his family she and that driver of hers sweeping into furnham like the queen come to call was like a thorn in my side every time i saw her as if she was gloating over taking ben from us what did she persuade my brother to do this time you didnt like her driver he was surprised nancy brothers had left the impression that finley was dependable and helpful indeed hed been left in charge of rivers edge until he himself had been called up he was a servant wasnt he no better than ben was but youd have thought he was the lord high somebody standing stiff as a poker by that motorcar and not a word to say to anyone i dont believe miss farraday was responsible for your brothers decision he said thinking of the copybooks hed seen in thetford still shed made it financially possible for him to return to france he was trying to establish himself as a writer he never showed any interest in such a thing when he was growing up nevertheless he was actively trying to write while he was a footman i dont know what he did during the war but it must have shown him a different sort of life and he decided to stay in paris and work hes still there in paris is that what sandy wanted you to tell me ive been so worried thinking something must have happened to him im glad my father never knew he wouldnt have cared for that he never liked the french very much boastful people he said and thinking they know more than anyone else ben wrote two books that were published in france they were quite well written by the way he used the name edward willet his fathers name as well as his own and then this spring he came back to england to see a doctor he was diagnosed with stomach cancer there was not much the doctors could do she said slowly as if she found it difficult to hear what must be coming he was dying of it im sorry yes but why doesnt he come home then and let us take care of him we dont know the answer to that mrs barber its one of the questions were still asking where is he ill ask sandy to take me to him in hospital im afraid hes dead she stared at him and then her face crumpled and nobody was there with him none of his family around him rutledge took a deep breath this was the part of his duty that he found the most difficult he was found in the thames mrs barber someone had shot him hedid he kill himself because of the cancer no he couldnt have taken his own life nodding she said then youre saying that this was murder yes if its any consolation he was intending to come home to see his family before returning to france to die but he was killed before he could there was nothing else he could say a silence fell and he gave her time to recover from the blow finally she said i want to see him will you take me to see him idont believe it would be wise mrs barber i dont know that he would wish you to see him like this im his sister theres no one else i want to see my brother he considered offering to show her the photograph and then thought better of it will you let your husband take you ill see to the arrangements not sandy i dont want to go with him but ill go with you if youll be so kind now yes please ill just fetch my shawl and she rose leaving him there in the room five minutes later she was back he thought shed splashed cool water on her face for it seemed less flushed but her jaw was tightly clenched and he could tell that she was trying to steel herself for the ordeal to come is there anyone youd care to take with you another woman perhaps molly no ill go alone hed have wanted it that way and so he led her out to the motorcar settling her into the seat his mind busy planning his route he chose to take the lane that led past the churchyard rather than to go through furnham she looked up as they were approaching it and he cursed himself for his thoughtlessness because both of them could see the raw hump of a grave near the east wall but she said only im glad my father didnt know its for the best and if theres any truth to what rector was telling me theyve already met havent they he said im sure they have remembering his conversation with dr baker he asked i saw those barrowlike graves in the back theyre unusual plague victims she stared at him her eyes wide then said i wouldnt know but he thought she did i t was a long and silent drive to tilbury where they took the ferry across to gravesend he found a cab to convey them to the hospital and sent a message to inspector adams as well by the time they had found someone to escort them down to the cellar inspector adams came in frowning as he saw rutledge with abigail barber your note asked me to meet you here thank you for coming mrs barber this is inspector adams he had made every effort to learn the identity of the man brought in by the thames boatmen otherwise we would have had no way of knowing that he was your brother mrs barber adams said in acknowledgment then added are you sure you wish to go through with this it can be an unsettling experience did he suffer it was a question she hadnt asked rutledge according to the doctor who examined theyour brother he did not he wouldnt have known what had happened well then i expect it was better than dying of that tumor they took her back then rutledge had already asked an orderly to see that the body was presentable and that no other corpses were in the room as the door opened he watched as abigail barber squared her shoulders as if bracing herself as she followed inspector adams into the morgue it was chilly and the light was glaring pools in the dimness but she walked resolutely to the table where a body lay under a freshly ironed sheet inspector adams asked are you ready mrs barber yes she answered stoically but rutledge put a hand on her shoulder as comfort adams pulled back the sheet she flinched its ben she said and then tentatively reached out to touch her brothers face drawing back quickly at the coldness of the flesh hes a man isnt he he was a boy when he left us to go to thetford now he looks very much like joseph after a moment she leaned down as if to whisper in his ear adams turned aside to offer her a little privacy and then she straightened i want to take him home she said adams glanced over her head at rutledge who nodded once yes all right i shall see that the paperwork is completed theres a good man here in gravesend theundertaker hell take care of the rest thank you before they could move she reached out and drew the sheet back over her brothers face her hands gentle and then she was walking quickly out of the room as if she couldnt bear it any longer rutledge thanked adams and followed her out of the hospital and half a block down the street she stopped there suddenly as if she couldnt go any farther and broke down crying inconsolably he put a hand again on her shoulder but she shrugged it off when she lifted her head finally to his shock her eyes were blazing with anger if you know where cynthia farraday lives you tell her for me if she ever shows her face in furnham againif she even thinks of coming to the service for my brotherill kill her myself he summoned a cab and without a word she got into it it was very late when he delivered mrs barber to her home in furnham her husband peering anxiously out the window saw them arrive and hurried out to open the motorcar door for her he was about to demand where she had been when he caught the look that rutledge gave him instead he said as if it had been what he intended in the first place come in love theres tea waiting rutledge didnt get out but he waited until the barbers had walked into their house and shut the door driving on he cursed whoever had killed ben willet and it willna do you any guid to damn him still he went to the rectory to find mr morrison to tell him what had transpired and to ask him to call on abigail willet but the rectory was dark and silent no one answered his knock at the church then at this hour he came to the junction in the road and soon after saw the church just ahead it was dark except for a dim light in the nave just visible through the plain glass of the high windows stopping the motorcar at the verge of the road but leaving it running he crossed to the church door and quietly began to open it so as not to disturb the rector if he was at his prayers he had not swung it more than two inches wide when the sound of voices came to him echoing in the empty church he couldnt see anything but the opposite wall without pushing the door wider but he knew the voices and could put a name to both of them that was the rector saying what is it you wish to confess my son and the response came from major russell chapter his voice was hoarse but still recognizable damn it morrison theres nothing to confess i just need to talk to someone the police are after me ive left the clinic again and i dont know where to turn rivers edge is closed theres no refuge there the house in london has very likely already been searched there was a long pause and then morrison said why do the police want you major i took a mans motorcycle well it was the only way i could get out of that clinic and reach london then i frightened cynthia which i didnt mean to do i just wanted to knownever mind that i sometimes muddle things its getting better i think but then there are days of torment pure hell when i can barely remember who i am theyve come to furnham the police ive been told that ben willet has been murdered and possibly justin fowler as well i dont know what to think and theres your mothers disappearance is rivers edge cursed or is it furnham i grew up in a quiet village where murder was unheard of i have no answers to give you they arent connected if thats what youre afraid of theres no madman out there picking us off every year or two its the war people are different the england i nearly died for is gone i dont recognize anything there was despair in his voice for that matter im not the same either we must have faith that god in his wisdom i dont know that i believe in god any longer he damned well wasnt there in the trenches when we needed him did you know that willet has written a book a novel i saw something about it in a newspaper a year ago so its true then gossip had it that the french believed it was his father whod written a book it caused a great deal of hilarity i can tell you among neds friends were these books something he was ashamed of is that why ben never told his family about them i have no idea apparently ones all about smugglers in essex before the war i suppose i should have read it but i wasnt ready to revisit furnham or rivers end morrison was still concentrating on the books its just as well everyone thought it was a good joke otherwise it could have got him killed jessup hadnt forgiven ben willet for becoming a footman putting furnham into a book would have angered everyone i doubt it would have led to murder i saw willet in london quite recently twice as it happens the last time there was a crash on tower bridge and i couldnt get through what did you talk about i didnt recognize him at first but he knew who i was and spoke he asked how i was faring and i asked why he looked so ill we commiserated on our war and i told him id seen a mention of his book asked him if he was still writing he said he was just finishing another manuscript and then he told me he wished once it was finished that someone would shoot him and put him out of his agony i told him not to be a fool i thought he was asking if id do it and i wouldnt i couldnt understand why he believed i could do such a thing i hardly knew the man then why were you meeting him a second time he told me there was something he must tell me before he died wyatt took a deep breath i didnt come here to talk about willet will you risk it rector taking me in i cant ask nancy to do any more than she has done she must be afraid her husband will find her out i had trouble enough persuading her to bring me food in the old church ruins there was another silence russell said irritably if youre afraid ill murder you in your bed ill find somewhere else to go it isnt that morrison began then before russell could speak he added theres hardly enough room for one in the rectory much less two ill sleep in a chair if i have to but he must have read something in the other mans face because without waiting for an answer russell went on yes all right i understand i think theres a bicycle in one of the outbuildings it was used by the servants i can manage at least let me clean up a little ive slept rough too long and i cant very well bathe in the river in plain sight of anyone coming upstream rutledge eased the door closed careful not to let the latch click to and went back to his motorcar driving off as soon as he was behind the wheel without turning on his headlamps he continued down the dark road until he was certain that neither the rector nor the major could see his rear light hamish said ye didna think to search yon ruins it was an accusation but there was barely cover enough to conceal a human being he hadnt expected it to hide a stray sheep much less a grown man more to the point how did he get there ye must ask him i intend to he drove for more than a mile past the gates of rivers edge then left the motorcar at the verge as far into the heavy grass as he dared walking back toward the house he considered where best to set his ambush just past the gates but then if russell knew a shorter way across the marshesand rutledge was fairly sure now there must be onecloser to the house would be wiser he chose his spot under the windows at the side of the house leaned against the wall under the drawing room windows and waited how long would it take a man to bathe and shave perhaps drink a cup of tea an hour then before russell appeared but an hour passed and then another had morrison taken pity on russell after all and allowed him to stay the night in the rectory hed been certain that morrison wouldnt change his mind hamish said ye could ha confronted him in yon kirk if russell had put up a fight morrison would have had every reason to raise the question of sanctuary no it was better to wait for him here alone by half past two it was clear that russell wasnt coming a wildgoose chase then go to yon rectory now and yell have him it was the only option left to him by morning russell could be miles away from this part of essex the roads were rutted but flat and a bicycle could make good time given an early start it was a long dark walk back to his motorcar but when he reached the rectory there were no lights and no one came to the door a fter an early breakfast the next morning rutledge drove to the brothers farm he found nancy cutting flowers for the house a basket over her arm and secateurs in her hand she looked up as she heard the motorcar come up the farm lane straightening to stare warily at rutledge as he got out and walked across to the garden he was beginning to understand why she had been eager to see him go yesterday before her husband had come in from the fields she was afraid her husband might learn that she was harboring the son of her late mistress a man wanted by the police and yet out of her feelings for the family she had served so long shed taken the risk good morning ive come to ask you about major russell she set the basket of zinnias and marigolds to one side trying to decide whether he knew the truth or was merely looking for information he could read the uncertainty in her eyes rutledge said ive learned youve been taking food to him at the old church did your husband know flushing she said who told you you did looking back i should have guessed you were hiding something or in this case someone she made no attempt to deny the truth he doesnt knowsamuel he was glad the house at rivers edge was closing just as i was marrying him that was my old life he said and this was the new he didnt want me keeping up any acquaintance with the others mrs broadley the cook and i were friendly and mrs dunner the housekeeper helped me sew my wedding gown they told me they wouldnt mind hearing from me from time to time but samuel told me hed rather i didnt they were in service still you see and i was a farmers wife now and so i never wrote to them when the major came i hardly recognized him i couldnt turn him away could i and i couldnt take him in neither i didnt know what samuel would have to say about it instead i agreed to feed him id take sandwiches and fruit and a jug of tea to him whatever i could spare that wouldnt be missed that was rough living for a man like the major dont i know that but he said hed learned to do without while in the trenches that hed be all right and i couldnt go as far as rivers edge without taking the cart he could see her quandary was this the first time youd seen him since the war since my wedding in fact he gave me away i was that grateful i couldnt turn him away could i she asked again what did he tell you how did he get out here to furnham he came with the van from tilbury that brings the meat to the butchers shop it comes twice a week hed remembered that didnt you wonder why a russell would be reduced to traveling in the butchers van he owns a motorcar im told i did wonder but he told me that the doctors wanted him to stay in hospital and hed left instead he said it would be all right theyd stop looking and he could go his own way i believed him why should i not hes not one to lie i never remember him telling a lie to anyone at the house its true what he told you as far as it goes hes not done anything wrong he just didnt want to be found and made to go back to hospital he said hed heal better on his own if theyd leave him to it i could understand that did you ever see russell come to blows with justin fowler mr justin she was surprised at the shift in subject they werent as close as mrs russell had hoped but there was never any hard feelings between them there was a time when mr wyatt was jealous over miss cynthia and all that but it was silly nonsense like two cockerels discovering the new hen ive seen it happen before and since did russell blame fowler for his mothers death she stared at him what did mr justin have to do with that i must depend on you to tell me shaking her head she said i never heard any such thing then what happened to mrs russell you asked me that before when you showed me the locket the good lord knows i dont samuel said once there must be a murderer in that house but thats nonsense i dont believe it for a minute who could do a thing like that yet she disappeared i know it troubled all of us the major most especially as youd expect i never knew a suicide before that but it was the most likely thing she glanced over her shoulder and rutledge knew she was anxious that her husband not see her speaking to the man from scotland yard then looking back at him she said i thought you came here about ben willets death not about the major unless youre looking to take him back to hospital im more concerned about his welfare than returning him to hospital then you should know he wasnt there when i went to the church this morning early i didnt know what to make of it unless he decided that hed be better off going back he hadnt said anything last evening about leaving he just said hed give much for hot water and a razor i asked if he wished me to buy a razor for him and he said best not he thanked her and left intending to go directly to the rectory now instead as he came through furnham he was hailed by a furious sandy barber standing outside the door to the rowing boat he looked haggard and out of patience reluctant to take the time to soothe barbers ruffled feathers rutledge weighed putting him off then decided against it until now they had maintained a workable truce and that had to be considered he pulled up in front of the inn and got out barber said almost as soon as he was in hearing why the hell did you take my wife to see her brothers body she asked to be taken i tried to persuade her not to go but she was adamant when we got there i saw to it that the body was presentable and there were no other corpses in the room yes well thats as may be but she couldnt sleep last night she sat in the parlor and cried there was no comforting her i went to find morrison finally but he wasnt at the rectory i came back home and sat up with her first her father and then her brother i wish to hell shed never found out about him she has asked to have the body brought to furnham ive given permission for it to be released for burial barber swore another funeral weve not got over the first he paced away from where rutledge was standing and stared out to the mouth of the river then paced back again are you any nearer to finding out who killed ben no the question is did his killer know willet was dying would it have made any difference why wasnt he in thetford where he belonged why was he wandering about in london abigail just told me some faradiddle about ben wanting to be a writer of books apparently hed lived in paris after the war he wrote a book about a man who smuggled goods between england and france this man met a girl on one of his journeys and he went to look for her during the war the book was published in france ill be damned abigail never told me that and there was a girl he mooned over for weeks another thought struck him here was it furnham he wrote about i havent read the book does jessup know about this yet hed be spitting mad will he indeed barber paced away and back again when ben went to be a footman jessup asked ned if he thought the boy could keep his mouth shut and ned said he would jessup said the last thing we needed was for furnham to become notorious he said people would come just out of curiosity and if one or two of us was hanged even better i hardly think furnham would become notorious over a few bottles of brandy and the like still do you think jessup could have killed willet god no im not suggesting that look youve stirred up feelings here that we thought had ended with the war when they dismantled the flying field thats all the blackwater and the crouch are drawing holidaymakers from london weve seen what that does to a village we dont want it to happen here then help me find ben willets killer you do want him found dont you the dead man isnt a stranger hes your wifes brother it was clear that barber simply wished that the whole matter would go away but he said yes all right i do for abigails sake and her fathers i liked the old man was the killer one of your merry band of smugglers barber grimaced we can get the things we need easier from france than from london whats so wrong with that we dont pay the tax on them but we dont go about with a barrow selling them in the streets either do we a bit of tobacco a few bottles of spirits some lace or a length of cloth wheres the harm the men go armed barbers face changed youve seen them ware hamish said in the back of rutledges mind ye canna tell them and rutledge himself saw the danger he stood in dont they always swords muskets shotguns it doesnt matter men in that line of work know the risks the tension in barbers face eased true enough you dont always know what youll be dealing with at either end back to ben willet if i knew who had killed him id tell you but i dont and with that he walked off rutledge watched him go as hamish said dye believe him i dont know rutledge responded silently i havent forgot the club aye and its no wise to forget anxious now that barber had also been unable to raise the rector rutledge considered his next step russell hadnt come to rivers edge last night and nancy brothers had looked in vain for him in the church rubble morrison in spite of his vows had been uneasy about giving the man houseroom where was he now more to the point what had become of the rector the question was how well had nancy brothers looked in the ruins they were on his way and it would take no more than ten minutes to be sure he drove there got out and made his way through the tumble of stones in the thick grass a snare for unwary feet he had to keep his mind on what he was doing but he reached a slight depression where two of the larger stones formed a sort of wedge he hadnt come this far in his earlier exploration and it was a place he would have chosen if sleeping rough well protected without being a trap the nights were warm enough and the weather had been dry russell had been lucky on that score squatting he looked at the flattened stems and watched an ant busily dragging away a tiny crumb of bread just outside he saw the pit of a plum where it had been cast aside satisfied he rose and scanned the terrain then he walked back the way hed come to the road he found jessup leaning against the wing of his motorcar arms crossed whats so interesting about yon ruin he asked his voice neutral a habit of mine looking at ruins rutledge said easily my godfather happens to be an architect is he now jessup asked insolently measuring rutledge with his eyes when did the church burn when it was struck by lightning how old was it old enough for the timbers to be dry and that rutledge thought must be true he walked past jessup and bent down to turn the crank on your way back to london are you not until i find the man who killed ben willet and tossed his body into the thames he straightened and went around to open the drivers door he was killed in london not here you should be looking there rutledge corrected him he was put into the river in london but is that where he was killed ben hasnt been in furnham since the war you can ask his sister perhaps he tried to come and was waylaid when was the last time you were in london jessups eyes narrowed none of your business i can make it my business rutledge told him his voice harsh now and before you make a decision to take me on speak to sandy barber hell tell you it isnt worth your while he got into the motorcar and jessup put his hand on the other door then thought better of it he stepped away and rutledge drove on a dangerous man hamish said echoing morrison he likes playing the bully because no one ever had the courage to face him down at the rectory rutledge stopped and pounded on the door there was no answer the door was unlocked and he looked inside but there was no sign of a struggle and the remains of breakfast for one still sat on a table in the corner facing the back garden where then was the rector called to a sickbed and what had become of russell frowning he stood outside for a moment it would be hard to explain another disappearance in furnham whatever the police had concluded in hamish said were ye oer hasty last night did he come later than expected it was possible possible too that after his own breakfast morrison had taken one to the house for russell since it was too far for nancy brothers to venture he had just reached the furnham road when he saw the rector bicycling furiously toward him from the direction of rivers edge morrison hailed him frantically and rutledge waited at the crossroads for him to come within speaking distance of the motorcar i cant find the major he called do you have him in custody or has he gone away back to london i havent arrested him or anyone else when did you see him last rutledge waited giving the rector time to catch his breath and interested to see how he would explain himself without admitting to speaking to russell in the church last night but morrison answered without prevaricating indicating no confession had taken place after all he came to the church last evening quite catching me by surprise and we talked why didnt you tell me he was in furnham without waiting for an answer morrison went on he was in a shocking state and i didnt know who he was at firstthe scratches on his face all the blood on his clothinghe looked like a scarecrow but he explained about the motorcycle and why the police were hunting for him he also told me about the clinic to tell you the truth i cant see that its doing him any good where did he go when he left the church i took him to the rectory he needed a bath a shave and a nights sleep but he couldnt sleep after pacing for an hour or more he came to my room and asked if id bring him some food this morning to the house i didnt think it was a very good idea for him to leave in the middle of the night and i told him so he promised to reconsider but five minutes later i heard the door open and close i got up and looked out the window and he had set out on footto rivers edge or so i thought but hes not there and im worried what time of night was it when he left i dont know a little after one oclock i suspect but rutledge had waited until well after two how long would it take russell to reach the house if he took a shortcut through the marshes im not sure at a guess no more than half an hour im really not very familiar with the marshes walking around in all that tall grass makes me claustrophobic fortyfive minutes if he went by the road what ought we to do leave your bicycle here ill drive morrison hesitated then set the bicycle by the side of the road before joining rutledge in the motorcar which door did you try he told me to come around to the terrace overlooking the water hed be waiting for me there but he wasnt the door was ajar i thought he was inside that tired as he was he might still be asleep i called several times and then went to look for him i disliked walking in unannounced i can tell you still i searched and there was no indication that hed slept in a bed i left as quickly as i could to find you they drove in silence until they had reached the gates rutledge said well leave the motorcar outside it was easy to see that morrison had been here this morning a new path had been beaten through the undergrowth but then the rector hadnt been concerned with being seen rutledge led the way and when they reached the terrace he pointed to the edge of the lawns if youve searched the house then we should begin with any shortcut the major could have taken that looks promising see over to the left of that stunted tree i should think you could make your way in just there they walked to the stunted tree ahsomeone has been through here and fairly recently those broken stems havent withered in the morning sun rutledge touched one of them havent they no youre right although i should think it was a dog that came through not a man lets see how far in it goes perhaps i should wait out here in the event you cant find your way out again rutledge stepped into the thick grasses that quickly yielded to reeds he was a tall man but the fronds moving in the light breeze were chesthigh in places and several times brushed his face for a while he believed he was following where someone had walked before him and then twice lost the trail and had to cast about to find it again morrison called anxiously anything nothing perhaps he decided to go back to the church ruins it was closer and he was used to it i was just there so was jessup but not the major he moved on using his sense of direction to guide him toward the road he couldnt see keeping the water on his right hed gone perhaps three hundred yards into the grass when he realized that the track no longer led anywhere stopping he looked about ive been following a false trail he said aloud irritated there must be another way in hamish answered him nearer to the drive yes very likely morrison called what have you found who are you talking to rutledge shook his head and began to make his way back trying to follow the bent grass stems that had marked his progress a hare broke cover just in front of him tearing off in a zigzag before darting into a thicker clump of reeds and disappearing he changed his mind after some ten yards and cut toward the water where he thought it might be less confining once more he had to force his way through but he did find that a muddy water line where the river lapped into the weeds provided damp but easier going it turned out to be better than the original track hed taken once back at the lawns he could start again coming to a thin stream drainage that fed into the river he saw that just beyond was a larger inlet where the river had eroded the land swearing he realized that to ford it he would have to wade there was nothing for it but to strike out inland once more he quickly discovered that he would be wiser to follow the inlet a short distance or fight his way through a thicker stand of reeds the print of a boot in the soft earth warned him that he wasnt the first to come this way recently it was very like the one hed seen on the floor of the garden room but not sharp enough to be definitive casting about for more he found the major some ten paces farther on russell was lying on his side curled into a fetal position as if he had been in great pain and rutledge could see the spread of a bloodstain on the back of his coat he shouted to morrison and bent over the body it was cold to the touch as he reached out to roll the major onto his back and then russell groaned without opening his eyes my god is he alive morrison asked starting toward rutledge go to one of the sheds find something we can use to bring him out hes bleeding and in a bad way be quick about it rutledge was already ripping open the mans shirt to get a better look at his wound and it was a gunshot wound to the chest high enough not to kill straightaway to the side where the ribs might not have protected the lung there was a chance slim but they had to hurry there was no doctor in furnham and rutledge doubted that tilbury could deal with such a wound london then if russell could be kept alive that long and that appeared to be very doubtful morrison came finally with a heavy horse blanket struggling through the marsh grass losing his way once but grimly persevering his face was flushed and set from the effort they got russell onto it and managed between them to carry him as far as the lawns bent over his hands on his knees as he fought for breath morrison said well never make it to your motorcar just the two of us we have to try rutledge said bleakly and they lifted the corners of the blanket again the overgrown lawn was easier but the drive was daunting russell wasnt a light man they were both breathing hard and sweating heavily by the time they reached the gates their coats left where they dropped them shirtsleeves rolled to the elbow the grass and thick undergrowth of the drive seemed to be diabolically intent on making every step twice as difficult as it should have been collecting himself morrison said weve probably killed him im afraid to look out there where i found him hed have died regardless this is the only chance he has rutledge hesitated conscious of hamishs firm grip on the rear seat and then he said in the back with him are you coming i cant make good time without you yes of course it took precious minutes and an energy they no longer possessed but in the end russell was settled in the motorcar supported by morrison rutledge ran back to retrieve their coats and then they set out for london m iraculously russell was still aliveand still unconsciousby the time they had reached the nearest hospital of any size on the outskirts of the city hamish was saying ye ken the first time he wasna hurt this time his voice faded as rutledge sprinted into casualty and brought nurses and a wheeled examining table back with him as the medical staff took over morrison sank into the nearest chair my god he said i dont know when ive been so completely exhausted do you think hell pull through or at least wake up long enough to be questioned rutledge pacing the floor said id give much to find out who shot the man dont ask me morrison said youre the policeman hes been lying there for hours possibly since the middle of the night or else someone came to the house this morning from the look of the wound my guess is last night the blood in his clothing had dried a little i didnt hear a shot fired you wouldnt indoors if the wind was the other way nor had he rutledge thought which meant that it must have been fired after hed left rivers edge yes i suppose youre right morrison broke off as a doctor came through the door where russell had been taken glanced around and then spoke to rutledge youre the man who brought in the gunshot victim inspector rutledge scotland yard yes dr wade its not as bad as it could have been dehydration loss of blood damage to the ribs the left lung nicked somehow the bullet missed the major arteries and hes got a fair chance of surviving what happened he looked the two men up and down rutledge realized that he and morrison were in a sorry state we dont know yet we found him in the marshes up the river hawking id like to speak to him is he awake weve already given him a sedative to help with the pain im sorry you didnt find the bullet no it went straight through but judging from the wound my guess is that it was a caliber an inch either way and hed be dead whats more he was shot in the back cowardly thing to do rutledge said it was dark and a warm night he was wearing his coat unbuttonedit was that way when i found him in the high grass hed have made a very poor target at any distance how long ago could you tell us roughly when he was shot from the clotting around the wound id guess around three in the morning give or take an hour he was cut and scraped as well an earlier accident was it or a drunken brawl he ran a triumph into a ditch yes that fits major russell also suffered a head wound in the war hes sometimes confused i noticed that as well hes lived a charmed life the major has i dont think hell be riding his triumph again anytime soon with that head wound he really shouldnt be riding one at all rutledge indicated morrison this man is the majors priest i should like to leave him here in the event that russell comes to his senses and can describe his attacker will you see to it that mr morrison is allowed to stay with him at all times morrison was on his feet about to protest im neededmrs barber in good time rutledge finished for him i have to leave but ill be back by late afternoon he turned back to dr wade is there anything else you can tell me sorry no not at this time its a watching brief at the moment with surgery a possibility if those ribs press into the lung or theres more internal bleeding hes lost enough blood that id rather not risk costing him more well see rutledge thanked him and left morrison resigned walked with him to the door should i ask for a constable to come in and sit with russell or bring in a sister to hear whatever he has to say hes not confessing rector either he can identify his assailant or he cant if he dies were back to where we began if he names someone and then dies youre a reliable witness yes i see i must admit he said wryly im still a little shaken seminary doesnt prepare one for police duties rutledge smiled he cranked the motorcar and got in as morrison hurried back into casualty to begin his watch but he sat there for fully five minutes after the rector had closed the door behind him there hadnt been time to go back into the house and look at the contents of the gun case there was also the fact that jessup had been waiting for him at the ruins of the old church had he discovered that russell had been hiding there and had he come to gloat because he knew that russell was now lying in the marsh near rivers edge it would fit but why should he wish to shoot russell it was hamish who answered that ye ken in the dark he thought the major was you rutledge let out the clutch and drove on to his flat to change his torn and bloody clothes he went to the marlborough hotel and put in a call to the yard asking for sergeant gibson gibson was not at present in the building he was told so much for the information that rutledge needed he rang off left the hotel and drove back through london to the hospital where hed taken major russell when he found his way to the ward where the patient had been transferred he saw morrison sitting next to the majors bed rutledge thought the rector was asleep in his chair but as he came down the aisle morrison looked up he waited until rutledge was standing by his side to say quietly he was awake briefly i dont think he knew where he was or why it could be that he will recall more details later how is he the doctors are worried about infection where he was lying was not helpful on that score damp marshy land and god knows what festering in it otherwise the wound appears to be clean enough and they dont believe theres as much internal bleeding as they feared in the beginning he has a fair chance of making it hes lucky his assailant was a poor shot or possibly he came up on russell sooner than hed expected he broke off as he saw russells eyelids fluttering and then he was fully awake grimacing in pain recognizing rutledge his gaze swung around the room eyes wide with alarm then he made a sudden movement as if to sit up and sucked in a breath between teeth clenched in a grimace as he fought the fire that seemed to explode in his shoulder sweat broke out on his forehead and he lowered himself gently onto the pillows again lie still rutledge admonished him the doctors are worried enough and so am i the motorcycle russell asked his voice rough and without much force it was clear that he had lost track of everything since going into the ditch with the triumph you survived that well enough someone tried to kill you at rivers edge youre in a london hospital where you were brought from there do you remember anything at all about going to the house the major struggled to assimilate that bit of information finally he managed to say his gaze on rutledges face shot as if it was as alien as the fact that he didnt recognize his surroundings when last night do you remember sleeping in the church ruins outside furnham being brought your meals by nancy brothers it took some time to take russell stepbystep from the crash of the trusty to leaving the rectory in the middle of the night finally rutledge asked who shot you do you know he shook his head slightly as if afraid the movement would bring back the fierce pain hebetrayed me he said his gaze moving on to morrisons face in point of fact he probably saved your life he came for me when he couldnt find you this morning told mehe told me he couldnt lie if you askedif you asked where i was if we hadnt found you in the marsh youd be dead by now as it was it was a close run thing one hand lifted vaguely in the direction of his chest dying probably not but we need to know who shot you do you remember anything nothing if theres anything on your conscience id advise you to clear it morrison will hear your confession if you like russell closed his eyes hurts the very devil he asked morrison to summon one of the nursing sisters when he was out of earshot rutledge said in a low voice before i go i must ask you its my duty did you kill justin fowler god no did you kill ben willet told you no refused hamish said do you believe him rutledge didnt answer him morrison was coming back with the sister and she carried a tray with water and a small medicine cup russells good hand tried to clutch at rutledges arm his fingers grasping at air as i fell silhouette i remember now he paused and when the sister was about to hold the water to his lips russell shook his head still watching rutledges face am iwill they send me back to st margarets speak to dr wade he will have to work that out yet rutledge understood how the major felt about the clinic he himself had left flemings clinic a month before the doctor felt he was ready and the doctor as it turned out was right he hadnt been prepared for warwickshire russell leaned back taking the medicine the sister had brought rutledge waited until he had swallowed it and then he left promising morrison to drive him back to essex as soon as possible as he walked back to where he had left his motorcar he debated his next move and he came to a conclusion he drove back to the center of london and once more availed himself of the marlborough hotels telephone reluctantly shutting himself into the tiny closet and putting in a call to someone he knew in the war office george munro listened to what rutledge had to say then replied do you know what youre asking i do a great deal of time and work my present inquiry revolves around finding the answer he could hear the sigh down the line i know i owe you ian ill do it thank you he put up the receiver george munro had been a fellow officer during the third battle of the somme the bullet that tore through the femoral artery in his leg should have killed him but rutledge had managed to stop the bleeding and drag him back to his own lines sending him to a forward dressing station where a doctor named macpherson and three nursing sisters had saved munros lifeand more important than that to munro his leg he walked with a permanent limp thereafter and had complained bitterly when he was sent to the war office after his release from hospital rather than back to the front lines in the end hed stayed in the army and at the war office glad of the decision that had taken him where his knowledge of strategy and tactics had seen him promoted meanwhile his wife had named their first son ian macpherson in gratitude for her husbands life he had been absent from the yard long enough reluctantly rutledge left his motorcar in the street and climbed the stairs to his office no one seemed to have noticed his absence gibson had come in and taken several of the files on his desk replacing them at some point with several more he sat down and scanned them added his signature to two and noted that two others were ready to be filed someone tapped at his door and sergeant gibson came in sir constable greene told me he thought hed seen you what news is there of chief superintendent bowles resting comfortably it was a near run thing it appears now that hell live but whether hell come back to the yardor whenis uncertain at best what do the yard punters have to say gibson grinned sheepishly as to that sir its currently five to one against his returning much of that may be wishful thinking rutledge smiled superintendent williamson has taken over as of this morning and chief superintendent bowles has been placed on medical leave for the present rutledge had not had many dealings with williamson the jury was out on whether he was a good man kept on a short leash by bowles or whether he was a weaker imitation of bowles at any rate gibson was saying were to go on as we were any questions his door is open otherwise he expects us to do our duty as if the chief superintendent is here rather trusting of him rutledge thought but said nothing the yard as a whole was professional and responsible and williamson was wise not to appear too eager to step into his predecessors empty boots it was clear that gibson was waiting for him to comment good man he said then asked any progress on the requests ive put in gibson frowned ive not been able to find this justin fowler he appears to have dropped out of sight last known address as far as i can judge was rivers edge the furnham road essex and that would fit with what rutledge had been told that justin fowler had been the last to leave the house save for finley the driver had he felt obliged to go so that the house could be closed the servants released from their duties where did he go when on leave hamish asked his family home in colchester had been sold the money put in trust for him and it was doubtful that he would have wished to return there given the memories of his parents deaths in the house unless hed taken a flat or bought a house in london rivers edge was his home was that why he had gone there while on leave in because he needed to remember a happier time before the war he couldnt have stayed there but he could have spent a few hours on the grounds or in the house if he still had a key and that brought up another problem rutledge hadnt considered until now how had fowler reached the river hawkins aware that sergeant gibson was still talking rutledge said sorry i was fitting together pieces of the puzzle go on gibson said have you spoken to miss farraday or major russell i should think they ought to know where fowler is theyve been less than helpful if hes alive where is fowler now if hes dead why hasnt it been reported in my view sirfor what its worthyou must assume the worst twenty minutes later rutledge set the last of the folders in the basket for filing there had been no telephone call from munro although hed given the man more than an hour not a good sign as hamish was pointing out there was one other person he needed to speak to before he went back to the hospital and from there to essex miss farraday was at home she said when he was shown into her sitting room ive had enough unpleasant news i hope you arent here to add to that where did justin fowler live after the house at rivers edge was closed he went into the army in late september i think it was and on his first leave he took rooms at the prince frederick hotel he invited me to dinner one night and we talked mostly about the army and about our years at rivers edge i asked if hed like me to write to him and he said he thought it would be better if i didnt he was still quite upset about aunt elizabeths disappearance i think one of the reasons he stayed on at the house after wyatt and i left was the hope she might come back and someone ought to be there if she did and after that the prince frederick was flattened in one of the zeppelin raids worst luck because in my opinion the hotel restaurant was the best in london i dont know where he stayed after that or even if he came to london at all if he did he never got in touch with me his name never appeared on the lists of killed wounded and missing ive heard since that not all of the missing and dead were ever accounted for she looked away perhaps he found someone he liked and spent every minute of any leaves with her he detected the faintest note of jealousy his solicitors have had no word of him ive spoken to them there was a sadness in her voice that she couldnt quite conceal justin went his own way and wyatt has been damaged by the war ben is dead it makes me aware of how fleeting life is how little we can hold on to anyone or anything i wish i could understand why hed been the way he was what the shadows were in his life it wasnt his place to tell her about justin fowlers past but he said something happened before he came to rivers edge the shadows were there before you knew him she nodded thank you for telling me that it helps i always had the feeling that he was waiting for something to happen or someone to come it was one of the reasons he didnt go into furnham he liked the isolation of rivers edge he told aunt elizabeth once that he felt safe there i know because i happened to overhear him he thought about the boy justin fowler had been his parents had been murdered he himself had nearly been killed was he afraid that the unknown killer would come for him one day and finish what hed begun it was a dreadful burden for a child to bear if he went to rivers edge on one of his leaves how would he have got there aunt elizabeths motorcar harold finley brought it to london when he enlisted and stored it in the mews behind wyatts house all of us used it from time to time mostly it just sat there of course but i drove it to dover once and another time to cornwall for a friends wedding do you remember who used it in the summer of no of course not not now i can tell you that the few times i wished to borrow it it was always there in the mews as he rose to leave she said theres something i just remembered the first warm weather we had after hed come to rivers edge we went swimming in the river i saw justins chest it was horribly scarred i asked him what caused them he said hed been in hospital for a long time i thought he meant hed had some sort of surgery it explained how pale and thin he was i was young easily put off but i realize now the scars were not the sort that come from surgery i helped with the wounded during the warreading to them writing letters keeping their minds off their suffering it never occurred to me at the timethose scars of his were wounds he said nothing did his parentswere they responsible not his parents rutledge replied a stranger dear god i wish someone had told me i wish id known i dont think mrs russell wanted you to know she understood that it was important to forget but did she tell wyatt probably not for the same reason she took a deep breath if you find him will you let me knowif hes all right if thats what he wants me to do and she had to be satisfied with that chapter the first person rutledge met as he walked into the hospital was a nursing sister he had dealt with earlier as they walked together to the ward where the major was being kept under observation he asked if there had been any change in his condition she reported hes been rather restless and the doctors are quite concerned about a fever that would mean infection he needs sleep but he keeps trying to remember what happened to him she paused then said diplomatically it might be best if the rector left for a time there would be less temptation to talk russell had in fact dropped into a light sleep when rutledge walked into the ward morrison was not there and so rutledge took the empty chair by the bed he himself had left rivers edge at a little after two the previous night and he had seen no one had heard no shots morrison had told him that the major had left the rectory after one oclock where had he been between half past one and half past two or to look at this problem another way who had encountered russell on the roador in the marshes was it a planned meetingor simply opportune who came to the house at night who kept those terrace doors unlocked for easy access to the guns in the study who stood by the landing stage and stared out over the river to the far side as if lord of all he surveyed the only people who were usually abroad late at night were the smugglers and while they wouldnt brook any interference in their business it seemed unlikely that they would go out of their way to stalk major russell through the marshes although timothy jessup might well have his own reasons for seeing that rivers edge remained closed hadnt he asked if rutledge was interested in the property on that first encounter when he was here with frances perhaps it was time to find out who would inherit rivers edge if the last of the russells died rutledge realized he knew very little about the majors father who had been killed in the boer war cynthia farraday was distantly related to him who else might be surely not jessup but stranger things had happened men sometimes committed indiscretions in their youthwitness justin fowlers fatherthat they kept firmly locked away in their past dr wade rutledge thought was right the major seemed to live a charmed life the war wound the motorcycle crash and now this gunshot any one of them should have killed him hamish said he willna escape the hangman we must prove he killed fowler first he was suddenly aware that the major was awake and staring up at him his first thought was that hed answered hamish aloud without thinking russell said after a moment have you come backor have you never left i was at the yard where is morrison he went to the canteen he wanted a cup of tea just as well do you feel like talking not particularly if you had died of this gunshot wound who stands to inherit rivers edge i made a will leaving it to my wife after she died i left everything to cynthia why are there any other cousins i dont know i dont remember much about my father or his side of the family for that matter a grandmother i think when i was very young she read to me and i remember her voice not her face do you know where justin fowler stayed when he was on leave during the war there was a hotel in london he liked a little out of the way for my tastes but it suited him he said cynthia went there to dine with him i think but dont trust that memory i was jealous and could have imagined it im told the hotel was destroyed in a zeppelin raid was it did he go back to rivers edge after it was closed i ran into him in france and he told me hed gone down to essex a last time before being sent over with his regiment that it was all right id heard that one of the raids had taken out a windmill and some houses but he told me that that was on the blackwater or maybe the crouch i dont remember when was this early in i think hed seen some fighting and i was in the relief column he told me hed borrowed my motorcar and driven out to essex did he stay at the house or just spend a few hours there he built a fire in my mothers sitting room he said it was damned cold the house had been shut up for months hed brought tea in a thermos and a packet of sandwiches and he ate them by the fire rather than on the terrace as hed planned i asked if the chimneys were all righti didnt relish the idea of the house burning down but hed checked them first he said and made certain the fire was out before leaving when next did you see or hear from him someone told me hed been wounded late may it earned him a ticket home i expect he wrote once from hospital hed heard that we were expecting a child my wife and i theyd done surgery on his knee and he was hoping to be released for duty by late august he told me he might drive down to essex again if he could manage it russell lay still closing his eyes i never heard from him again as far as i recall but letters get lost do you know if he survived the war you must ask cynthia that she kept track of both of us and harold finley as well why the interest in justin you dont think he shot me do you he had opened his eyes his gaze fixed on rutledge why on earth should he do that it was clear that hed forgot what rutledge had told him about willets confession im still investigating willets death were you in england during that summer of i was in france no thats not true i was sent home on compassionate leave when my wife died did you go down to rivers edge or look up fowler in hospital i dont think so it wasi dont remember much about that time he grimaced i was ridden by guilt i hadnt loved her she died because of me i didnt think id made her happy he turned his head aside go away leave me alone rutledge was on the point of saying something more when morrison came back there you are he said stepping in is he asleep rutledge answered yes i think so the nurse warned me not to disturb his rest we should leave he rose and got morrison out of the room walking to the motorcar morrison asked could you talk to him did he tell you anything else only that he doesnt know what happened to fowler it may be that he will never be able to remember if hes guilty of murdering him russell could well go free morrison digested that then said you dont intend to take him into custody suspicion isnt truth i need facts morrison cranked the motorcar for rutledge and then got in how i wonder did ben learn about fowlers death and russells role in it i dont know but the fact that he did tells me that whatever happened happened in rivers edge or somewhere along the hawking not in london or dover or portsmouth i told you before i dont believe in coincidence and it would have been difficult to kill someone and get rid of the body where hundreds of men are collecting and boarding their transports but the river hawking is rather isolated if it swallowed up mrs russell it could swallow fowler just as easily then why wasnt willet killed in essex as well i havent worked that out yet perhaps someone didnt want him to reach essex we dont know he was intending to go there ive discovered that he was that silenced morrison after a time he said im tired ill shut my eyes for a bit if you dont mind he leaned his head against the window strut rutledge was grateful for the chance to think with his eyes on the road he let his mind review everything he knew hamish said theres no answer exactly and theres only one reason i can think of to explain that somewhere is a piece of the puzzle we havent found not yet and im not sure where to look aye ye must start at the beginning by the time hed passed the gates of rivers edge and made the turning to the rectory morrison was awake and complaining of being stiff he said preparing to get out of the motorcar i never thought he would live nor did i but if he had died the inquiry on justin fowler would have to be closed without willet and without russell there is no case morrison shook his head i watched you question a man who was in great pain how do you live with the fact that the person you take into custody will be tried and judged and very likely hanged do you never feel merciful its not a question of mercy i dont judge people i leave that to the courts its my task to collect the facts that will help them arrive at the truth thats very selfrighteous dont you think and then he was gone shutting the rectory door behind him rutledge continued into furnham realized hed eaten nothing since breakfast and stopped by the tea shopcumbakery but it was already closed and he went on to the inn the clerk told him that he hadnt asked for dinner and so there was none to be had but when rutledge offered to pay him well for a meal he agreed to prepare something when the tray was brought to his room rutledge found under the cloth covering several sandwiches a dish of fruit and a square of cheese with rather stale biscuits he ate his meal sitting by the window where the cool evening air made him drowsy setting the empty dishes outside his door he went to bed but the drowsiness seemed to evaporate as soon as he blew out the lamp and got into bed instead his mind went over and over what he knew about the three murders and the attack on russell and he didnt like what he was beginning to conclude cynthia farraday had wanted rivers edge but not its owner it would have been easy for her to murder the unsuspecting mrs russell but despite his protestation of his love wyatt russell married someone else for the sake of an heir if that was her motive it didnt make sense for her to kill fowler or ben willet wyatt russell had the best motivejealousy he could have killed the men he perceived to be his rivals but why kill his own mother jessup for reasons of his own could have killed mrs russell her son and his own nephew but why murder fowler and if the person who killed fowlers parents intended to return one day and murder the son as well why had it been necessary to kill the russells and ben willet was it possible that there were two people at work here he was close to the answer when sleep overtook him and then he was back in france the sound of the guns loud in his ears the screams of the wounded and the dying all around him while the machine gunners whittled away the numbers coming toward them until only rutledge was left on his feet and struggling through the mud toward the gunners his revolver in his hand and determination giving him the strength to keep going despite the bullets plowing into his body but when he reached the nest there was only one gunner nothing but bones grinning at him from behind the gun sight and hamishs voice at his ear was shouting to him trying to make him understand that he too was dead fall down and let it be over the scots voice cried for gods sake let it be over rutledge fought against it clinging to life struggling against the darkness that was overwhelming him reaching out for a handhold and unable to find it for he could see that the river somme was filled with blood and he would drown in it in spite of all he could do with a shock he came wide awake wrestling the bedclothes crying out in the darkness he could feel the cold sweat drying on his body and his chest was heaving as he tried to breathe again in the quiet room unseen hamish said it will never go away not even when ye die the dead dream too he got out of bed and thrust his head out the window letting the night air blow away the last remnants of the night terror finally he dressed and went out to walk until the sun brightened the horizon not caring if the smugglers had made a run in the night it wasnt until he could see his hand clearly before his face that he went back to his room and without undressing fell into a deep sleep in the morning he went to see nancy brothers spending half an hour in her pleasant kitchen and when he had the information he wanted he thanked her and left and then because he didnt think he could spend another night in the room at the dragonfly inn he packed his valise and drove out of furnham when he finally reached london he went directly to somerset house and began his search the first name on his list was mrs broadley the cook at rivers edge according to nancy brothers she had gone to live with her sister when the house was closed he hadnt expected to encounter quite so many broadleys but it appeared to be a fairly common name in some counties finally he found the one he was after she had died in a village north of derby during the influenza epidemic of he turned next to mrs dunner who had taken another post in the midlands there was no record of her death and he had the address that mrs brothers had given him the last name on his list was the young chauffeur harold finley there was no record of his death it had taken him two hours but he felt satisfied with the results on a whim he also looked for gladys mitchell fowlers first wife her death was recorded here and he jotted down in his notebook the name of the sanitarium he found the name of her husband in the marriage records and looked at his death date he had died in prison just as the solicitor in colchester had said if there was a child he couldnt find it satisfied he thanked the clerk who had been assisting him and left at the yard he went to a telephone and after some effort on the part of the operator he found the house in the midlands where mrs dunner had taken up another position when he was put through to the number a butler answered and rutledge identified himself before asking for mrs dunner im sorry inspector mrs dunner is no longer housekeeper here she is now the housekeeper for mr and mrs lintons daughter who lives in london is she indeed rutledge asked relieved to be spared the long drive northi should like her direction if you please the butler told him then inquired is there any problem concerning mrs dunner shes always been an exemplary employee not at all we are looking for information about a family she once worked for in essex were hoping she can help us locate other members of the staff at that time the butler thanked him and rang off rutledge looked at the address in his hand belvedere place cynthia farraday hadnt chosen a house at random when she was intent on eluding him she had chosen the residence where mrs dunner was employed it was not surprising that the constable hed spoken to hadnt recognized miss farradays name she didnt live there and she wasnt a regular visitor to the linton family hamish was echoing his own thinking miss farraday was too clever by far by the time hed reached belvedere place it was nearly the dinner hour but he lifted the elegant knocker and when a maid in a starched black uniform opened the door he stated his business she hesitated repeating inspector rutledge of scotland yard to see mrs dunner he was tired and felt an urge to ask if any of the silver had gone missing but resisted the temptation instead he repeated what hed told the butler in the midlands the family has only just gone in to dinner she looked over her shoulder then said if youll come this way she led him through to the servants quarters and tapped on the door of the housekeepers small room mrs dunner was just finishing her accounts and she looked up as the maid came in she was tall and slim her dark hair only beginning to show gray although he thought she must be well into her fifties what is it daisy an inspector rutledge from scotland yard to speak to you mrs dunner thank you daisy they will be looking for you in the kitchen i think the maid nodded and went away as mrs dunner invited rutledge into her room and shut the door behind him what has brought you to belvedere place inspector is there a problem with one of our staff not at all he assured her its about the staff at rivers end ive spoken to nancy brothers and now to you how is nancy she asked i had hoped to hear from her from time to time but shes never written to me i expect shes been busy yes im sure does she have any children do you know i dont believe she has a pity and now you have found me as well what is it you need to know about rivers edge i believe the house has been closed since the war began what interest does scotland yard have in it but he thought she knew what he was about to ask her you were there when mrs russell disappeared i was it was a terrible day i dont think i shall ever forget it what do you believe happened to her the most obvious conclusion was suicide of course but i could never reconcile myself to that i found it hard to believe in murder as well still it seemed to be the most logical explanation why murder because mrs russell wouldnt have deserted her children yes i know what was said about her belief that her son would die in the war that was coming and i can tell you it was very distressing for her shed lost her husband the thought of losing mr wyatt as well was insupportable there was no question but that he would join the army once war was declared he was his fathers son she couldnt forbid it she was trying to make peace with her fears did you tell the police what you believed i didnt feel it was my place to stir up more trouble for the family if you were willing to consider murder there must have been someone you believed was capable of it who could have wished her dead there were tears in her eyes as she answered him thats just it you see i couldnt imagine it not one of the staff certainly all of us had been with her for years everyone that is but harold finley but he was a quiet responsible young man and as for the people in furnham why should they want to harm her what about the family he could see a shocked expression in her eyes justin fowler for one he suggested oh no not mr justin why not poor child he had nightmares when he first came to us mrs russell would go in and wake him up then comfort him it was terrible my room was just over his and i could hear his screams some nights she got no sleep did her son or miss farraday know about this were they jealous do you think how could they be mrs russell had put him in a room nearest hers so they wouldnt be disturbed what if they came looking for her and she wasnt in her room i doubt that ever happened mr wyatt was a deep sleeper as for miss farraday she never was one to need pampering an independent little thing from the first time i saw her i was told she was accustomed to her parents going away and leaving her with the servants did you like her he asked hearing an undertone in her voice not to say didnt like her she was such a pretty child everyone liked her still she wasnt one to come down to the kitchen and beg a treat or ask me to sew her ribbons on for her little things but they endear a child to you she lacked that quality why did justin fowler have nightmares i asked mrs russell and she told me that he had been ill in hospital and i was not to worry it would pass when he regained his health but i always wondered you know if his father beat him he had such fearsome scars not to speak out of placebut mrs russell told me she was pleased that he had more of his mother in him than his father i had the feeling mr fowler had a dark past what sort of past she never said as much outright but i gathered mr fowler had been involved with a woman of the streets it was a reflection on his character did he marry this woman or live with her he couldnt have married her could he she already had a husband and a child it didnt stop him from taking up with her it was the first hed heard of a child harrison the solicitor had assured him there was no issue in the bigamist marriage a child of his or by her husband i should think her husbands which made it all the more shocking that mr fowler should have anything to do with her a boy or a girl i dont think mrs russell knew you must understand mrs russell never confided in me but sometimes shed be distracted and say things and i had eyes i could see some things for myself when miss cynthia showed a partiality for mr justin she worried that he might break her heart then he was off to university and it all blew over but sometimes the seed doesnt fall far from the tree as they say he was reminded of something something inspector robinson had said while reviewing the terms of the fowler wills it came back to him then that mr fowler had supported a charity school in london over the years an odd choice of interest for a young bachelor reading law did you keep in touch with the family after the house was closed mr russell wrote to me once or twice and mr justin wrote to me before he was sent to france they were young men i wasnt surprised that there were no more letters after that did you know mrs broadly was dead yes sadly her sister wrote to me did harold finley survive the war i dont believe he did he wrote to me quite a few times very pleasant letters they were too he came to see me in early summer hed been wounded when the caisson he was in charge of was blown up it crashed into his leg breaking it i thought he looked tired and still in pain with a nasty limp he said he was eager to get back to france i wished him well that was the last i heard from him she picked up her pen and put it down again i was very fond of him if id been blessed with a son i would have wished to have one just like harold where did he come from he was from norwich i believe you havent told me why you are reopening the inquiry into mrs russells disappearance or why scotland yard should take an interest in it he decided to tell her the truth about ben willet and his visit to the yard as wyatt russell thats ned willets boy isnt it the fisherman but why should he do such a thing i cant believe it he was found dead a fortnight later and he was wearing this he handed her the locket after looking at it she raised her eyes to his its mrs russells but thats not the photograph she kept in it she was silent then she said he couldnt have killed her he was only a boy a gold necklace must have been tempting even to a boy when his family was struggling to keep food on the table but he kept it didnt he he didnt buy bread with it when rutledge said nothing she added if hed killed her then mr wyatt or mr justin would have killed him if they discovered it what i dont understand is if it was one of themmr wyatt or mr justinwhy did they leave this locket on his body when they knew how much it meant to her hamish spoke for the first time because he said his voice so clear in rutledges mind that it seemed to come from just behind his shoulder where the young scot had stood so often during the long watches in the night he knew the police would gie it back to him chapter calling on mrs dunner had been profitable rutledge drove to his flat unpacked his valise and sat by a window watching the moths dance futilely around the lamp on the table at his elbow he could feel another storm building and it suited his mood the housekeepers words echoed in his mind what i dont understand is if it was one of themmr wyatt or mr justinwhy did they leave this locket on his body when they knew how much it meant to her there was another possibility that the body had gone into the thames before the locket could be removed someone could have come along just after the killer had emptied the dead mans pockets and the only choice was to let the locket go had justin fowler accused willet of the murder if so willet had had to kill him and then he had attempted to clear his own name before dying of his cancer by putting the blame squarely on wyatt russell that at least would go a long way toward explaining the false confession cynthias pet wyatt russells words was willet coldblooded enough to kill cynthia farradays foster mother as well as the man she had grown up with and still faced himself in the mirror after all miss farraday had done for him hamish said his voice almost inaudible in the rumble of distant thunder sandy barber killed him to spare his father and sister it could be true if willet had changed so very much kill him before he could come home to furnham and reveal his true character that begged the question of who had tried to kill wyatt russell perhaps it wasnt sandy barber who had killed willet jessup was fond enough of abigail to have done the deed to spare her he too was in a position to intercept any message from the prodigal son and he could have known more about the book published in france than hed told anyone whichever way he turned what he knew rutledge found that one piece always failed to fit into the puzzle hamish said if willets murder was blamed on wyatt then someone wanted revenge and that made sense but rutledge wasnt satisfied he watched the storm break over london watched trees along the street bend before the sudden wind as lightning shattered the darkness and thunder rolled like cannon fire there was enough evidence to make an arrest and superintendent bowles would argue that it was the role of the court to sort it all out rutledge had always seen justice differently that it was the policeman whose duty it was to sift the evidence and bring in the guilty party while the courts judged whether or not the facts as presented supported punishment according to the law or the release of the accused without prejudice a test as it were of truth the rector hadnt understood that even mrs channing had once questioned why he had chosen the police over following in his fathers footsteps in the firm of solicitors old standards died hard many people still expected a policeman to come to the servants entrance where he belonged but that was the view of a generation ago and it was changing hamish said breaking into his thoughts you must decide which man took the law into his ain hands jessup who had always believed that ben willet had made the wrong choice when he left his family and his village or sandy barber who loved his wife and would protect her at any price there was still no answer the next morning rutledge set out early driving through rainwashed streets to stop briefly in the yard there he put in a telephone call to mr harrison the solicitor handling the affairs of the late mr and mrs fowler when mr harrison was brought to the telephone rutledge asked what charitable school for boys the fowlers had supported its the jamison baldridge school he replied before seeing to the disbursement of the bequest i took the opportunity to inquire about them mr baldridge was an mp and close friend of william gladstone who encouraged the childless baldridge to donate large sums to a charity school in london its soundly funded and responsibly managed and so we carried out the elder mr fowlers wishes what was fowlers interest in it im afraid he never told me he had begun supporting it before he returned to colchester what sort of school is it it is for poor boys without reference to religion only need and ability it has a high scholastic standard and most of the boys have gone on to do well in life several have served in the metropolitan police a number went to the army theres a clergyman or two many became teachers and a few have even gone into service into service rutledge was surprised one was a valet to a cabinet minister another became an estate manager in scotland and their failures rutledge asked i was led to believe that they did very well too harrison replied dryly none in prison then if there were the headmaster never saw fit to mention them rutledge thanked mr harrison for his information and went to find the jamison baldridge charity school for boys it was in a respectable street near st pauls cathedral and had grown considerably since its founders day the victorian brick building was several stores high with an arched stone doorway resembling a bishops palace but rather than saints the reliefs set into the stone ledge that ran across the front featured classical figures as he rang the bell rutledge recognized plato and homer above his head a young man dressed in much the same fashion as a student at harrow or eton opened the door to him and politely asked his business the headmaster if you please my name is rutledge he was invited into a wide hall the floor a checkerboard of white and black marble and the young man excused himself after several minutes an older man with the look of a don greeted him and asked his business with mr letherington scotland yard im here to inquire about a former student indeed mr rutledge my name is waring i can help you with that will you come this way he was led down a quiet passage to a small office filled with bookshelves and rows of ledgers waring offered him a chair i should like first to ask you why you are inquiring about one of our boys as i understand it his mother died of consumption and his father died in prison i dont know that he was ever at the school but there is circumstantial evidence that he was we are attempting to find him because he may have been a witness to a crime some years ago whatever information he can provide will help us in our inquiries waring gestured to the array of ledgers if you will tell me the name of the boy and when he might have been in our school ill be happy to look for him i have his mothers name gladys mitchell and an approximate date what leads me to baldridge school is the fact that a man with a possible association to this boy was also a benefactor of your school his name was fowler mr warings face reflected his recognition of the name but he said only and the possible dates rutledge had made his calculations there were only two ways that gladys mitchell could have claimed that her son had been fathered by fowler he had been conceived after a brief affair with fowler that had been resumed at a later date or he had been conceived just after the relationship had ended there was a space of ten years between fowlers relationship with gladys mitchell and his marriage to justins mother the murders occurred when julian was short of his twelfth birthday the boyif it was indeed a male childcould have been as young as twentytwo or as old as twentyfour at the time add another twelve years since then and the killer could be as young as thirtyfour today which would make him close to harold finleys age or even thirtyfive or thirtysix he gave waring the possible dates was he in the war do you think if it was finley the answer was yes possibly in our small chapel we have an honor roll of boys who died in the war his name may be there but first lets have a look athe ran his finger along the spines of the tall ledgers on the third shelfthis one i should think mitchell you said yes and then as an afterthought it could be finley half an hour later waring closed the ledger and shook his head im afraid you must have been mistaken i dont find him at all could it possibly be fowler waring looked up at him sharply are you saying this boy could have been mr fowlers son he was not to my knowledge but the boys mother could have used the name erto honor him for services to the family there wasnt a fowler either i would have noticed there was nothing more to say rutledge had used every variation he could think of there was one other but he didnt know the womans name she was gladys mitchells sister and he would have to return to somerset house to ferret her out or speak again to mr harrison he thanked waring for his assistance and he rather thought the man was glad that the search had drawn a blank for the sake of the school if not his own at the yard rutledge put in a call again to mr harrison only to be told that the solicitors had no record of mrs mitchells sisters name i recall that you told me she had arranged the services indeed she did however we were billed directly by the undertaker we had no correspondence with the sister in short the solicitors had not thought it advisable to trust mrs mitchells sister with any sums although harrison had not directly said so and this was true of care at the sanitarium as well as a headstone for the grave precisely rutledge had just put up the receiver when sergeant gibson walked by what news do you have of the chief superintendent hes been allowed to sit in a chair for the first time but its a long road ahead for the chief superintendent and hes not one to be idle rutledge agreed with him but there had been a subtle difference in the yard since bowless heart attack a quieter mood men going about their business with an air of uncertainty about what the future held inspector mickelson sent to northumberland to investigate a murder had made a point of staying out of sight rutledge wondered if the mans head would roll if bowles was forced to leave for medical reasons mickelson had stepped on more toes than he could reasonably count knowing he was protected by bowles the question was would bowles see to it that his successor also protected the man as far as rutledge was concerned mickelsons absence was a respite he went back to his office and made an effort to concentrate on a folder that gibson had brought up earlier that morning but his mind kept wandering to his dilemma mrs dunners remark about the locket rang true and there was still the riddle of the charity school the elder fowlers support of it from such an early age must have some connection with his first disastrous liaison had he bought gladys mitchells silence about their annulled marriage by seeing to it that her son was properly educated it wouldnt have done for her to appear in a year or two with blackmail on her mind just as he was preparing to take another wife the education of her sonbut not hiswould be the surest way of protecting his future and a gift to the school with the promise of more to come as the boys education progressed would keep him there but what did this have to do with murder it could be the connection that he had so far failed to find a bitter and forgotten child might look for revenge if it had been fostered in him by a bitter and dying mother first to kill the fowlers and when justin survived to look for him and destroy his new family hamish said derisively willet was no a member of the family rutledge took a deep breath he had the necklace that somehow brings him into the circle they were all there the day mrs russell disappeared he could ha killed them all and finished wi the past then and there he would have been hunted down he was no hunted down when the fowlers were killed unable to sit still rutledge left the yard walked over the bridge to the far side of the thames then turned and walked back again the exercise didnt help rutledge went to his motorcar and drove to the hospital where major russell was recovering and found him propped up in a bed in the mens ward youve made progress rutledge said taking the chair beside him first the casualty ward now with the rest of the sufferers major russell grimaced they snore like the very devil i couldnt sleep last night for it you probably wouldnt have slept well anyway no its hard to breathe that keeps me awake what do you want are you here to ask more questions if i could answer any of them the bastard would be in irons by this time ive come to ask you about harold finley mrs dunner regarded him as the son she never had cynthia farraday cajoled him into taking her to london against your mothers wishes your mother hired him to drive her its how three women saw him i want to know how he struck you finley i never gave him much thought the groom usually drove my mother wherever she needed to go until she bought the motorcar she didnt like it she called it the contraption and he couldnt manage it she advertised for a chauffeur who could work in the house if needed the agency sent three or four men to be interviewed she chose finley he worked out very well cynthia flirted with him outrageously but she was a child and he treated her like one much to her chagrin my mother was pleased with that he dealt with justin and with me just as easily i took him for granted i suppose the way i took mrs broadly and mrs dunner and nancy and the others they were there did he strike you as a man who was angry beneath the politeness of a servant i dont think i ever saw him lose his temper was he different when you were alone with him when mrs russell wasnt present and he could be himself not to my knowledge he knew his place and he kept to it what is it you want me say i dont this man came to an isolated household of women and children do you think he was hiding anything his past his name god youve got a twisted imagination no finley was finley that was all it seems to me that he could have found work anywhere why choose the marshes and only tilbury for any social interaction on his free afternoons he actually seemed to like the marshes he took me out in the boat once and we sat for an hour or more watching the marsh birds id never really noticed the birds before he fashioned a penny whistle for justin and none of us could play it but we tried and cynthia laughed until she cried rutledge could see that he was getting nowhere and he said did strangers come to rivers end very often if they did i never saw them what are you getting at i expect im chasing ghosts there was a moment of silence then russell said i expect theres no chance cynthia will take pity on me and visit i dont know she was shaken by your last encounter yes ive no doubt of that he said ruefully i always seem to get off on the wrong footing with her i have a knack for that is there anything you need patience he said rutledge left soon after and returned to the yard constable henry saw him walking down the corridor and called to him sir theres a message on your desk a george munro returning your call thank you ill take care of it ten minutes later he had reached munro and he said you have something for me yes i do but i dont think it will help you very much you found the information about justin fowler and harold finley mind you it took me hours because i was looking in the wrong place finally as a last resort i tried another direction and thats when i found both of them let me take out my notebook you wont need it ian its very straightforward all right go ahead i looked at the rolls of the dead and then searched the missing they werent there i went to the list of deserters and i found both their names on it the army would very much like to find both of them the war is over but the army is still of a mind to shoot them when did they desert in the summer of chapter rutledge sat there with the receiver to his ear after a time munro said are you there rutledge im still here how did you come across these names i should very much like to know they came up in a murder inquiry ive been conducting neither man had contacted anyone since the armistice what month did they desert both men had been wounded but at different times and neither wound was selfinflicted for a free ticket home finley failed to report to france in july fowlers wound was more serious but he didnt return to duty in september whats more he missed a medical examination to update his recovery that was in august from my end the two cases dont appear to be related id like to hear what you see at your end it shoots my own theory full of holes yes i expect it does all right the shoe is on the other foot now you owe me rather than the other way around give my love to frances will you joan was asking about her just the other day ill be sure to with that munro was gone and the line went dead rutledge realized he was still holding the receiver when the operator asked if he cared to place another call it was late when rutledge got home having had to interview a possible suspect in someone elses case the air in the flat was hot and oppressive and he opened several windows to let in what little breeze there was london had had a particularly long spell of warm dry weather punctuated by a few storms that hadnt seemed to bring in cooler temperatures he was all too aware that he was back at the beginning in the willet case and the more he learned the more unlikely it was that the disappearance of mrs russell had anything to do with willets murder if hed found the locket in the marshes while searching for her then put a photograph of cynthia farraday in the place of the wedding pair willet was guilty of theft not murder and it was more and more likely now that he had posed as wyatt russell because his mind was confused by the drugs hed been taking yet he had carried that imposture off flawlessly which brought rutledge back to the likelihood that major russell had been shot because coming through the reeds along the riverbed hed been mistaken for the man from scotland yard it would be easy to rid themselves of him in the middle of the night with no witnesses and the reason why ben willet had had to die would be safe even if the yard knew to look for him here a dozen inspectors sent out in his place would have no better luck finding a body than earlier searchers had had looking for mrs russell he didna come to see if you were dead no that would have left footprints if i hadnt been found in a few days whoever it was could safely put me in the river hamish said the house is his he must come there often enough to feel it is and if he isnt jessup ill wager jessup knows who he is aye its verra likely true which meant a confrontation with jessup was looming he didnt altogether regret it rutledge left the window and went to bed shortly after that but he lay there for a time thinking about cynthia farraday and trying to decide what it was that made her so attractive to so many men no great wisdom arrived with the morning on the way to the yard he considered placing a request in the personals of the times asking either justin fowler or harold finley to contact scotland yard both men were considered deserters by the army and the risk for them was too great to expect them to yield to curiosity that avenue was effectively closed to him there must be another in his office refusing to admit defeat he played with the wording of such a request hamish said ye ken fowler hasna used a farthing of his ain money hes deid its the reason why hes shown as a deserter then where was his body hidden theres the river the same reason mrs russells body has no been found then major russells body should have been put into the river as well but he knew the answer to that there hadnt been time to bring a boat up to rivers edge and take the body aboard morrisons concern and his own search of the high grass had seen to that an idea was taking shape galvanized rutledge worked feverishly for threequarters of an hour crumpling sheets of paper as he made false starts and was faced with unexpected hurdles finally satisfied he went to find sergeant gibson read this id like to see it in tomorrow mornings times gibson scanned the sheet of paper then looked up at rutledge sir is this true only half of it russell is alive but badly wounded its possible that the person who shot him also shot benjamin willet i need to draw him out before he kills again you believe he will if he discovers that russell is alive he will bide his time and try again gibson read the paragraph more carefully major wyatt russell was shot three days ago on the lawn of his house on the furnham road essex and taken to a london hospital where he was expected to recover and name his assailant this morning at six oclock he succumbed to severe blood loss and infection scotland yard is treating this death as a case of murder by person or persons unknown anyone with information that could help the police with their inquiries is asked to contact sergeant gibson at scotland yard all replies will be held in the strictest confidence ill see to it gibson told him but there was doubt in his voice youve told the major im on my way now at the hospital he caught dr wade just coming out of surgery they retired to an empty office and rutledge explained his plan i dont care for it dr wade said flatly the danger of infection hasnt passed i understand that risk but if major russell survives this wound whoever shot him will still be out there waiting you cant be sure of that can you im not willing to find out yes theres that but where are you taking him he needs care he cant fend for himself rutledge had considered the possible answers to that on his way to the hospital his first choice had been the rector mr morrison but the cottage was small and if there were any changes in the majors condition medical care was too far away and the cottage was far too close to furnham morrison would be no match for an angry jessup the second choice was the clinic in oxfordshire but he was fairly certain the major would have no part of that and a careful killer just might think to look for him there to see if the times article was true the third option was to take the major to cynthia farraday that too had its risks which left him with no alternative but to offer his own flat with a nursing sister in charge of russells care and yet he had rejected that for personal reasons his flat was his sanctuary his dark corner where he could scream in the night when the war came back again here hamish was at his most vocal and his presence was a living thing his rational mind told him that the major and the nursing sister would find nothing there to betray his connection with hamish macleod and yet the part of his mind that hamish inhabited recoiled in terror and refused even to contemplate such an idea even when rutledge himself would not be in the house at all the rest of the journey had seen a battle with himself but now he said to dr wade my flat in london and for the next half hour together rutledge and wade hammered out every possible detail until both were satisfied dr wade said im still not convinced that this is necessary its important to try in the ward he found the major sitting up against pillows and drinking a glass of water im surprised to see you again he said as rutledge took the chair by his bed i thought our business was concluded until you found my assailant ive told you all i know ive come to arrange for you to die im damned if you are he handed russell a copy of the sheet that hed given sergeant gibson setting aside his glass russell read the words written there and then read them a second time yes i see what youre driving at all right how do i go about dying and where will you take me not to oxfordshire or ill refuse to help you that was a bit of a problem but weve found a solution ill find a way to make it happen you must play your part and call for the nursing sister in half an hour then let her examine you and cover your face someone will come and remove theerbody when youve got what you want will you retract the death notice as soon as i can yes he took the sheet of paper and returned it to his pocket then he said did you know that justin fowler is listed by the army as a deserter justin you cant be serious yes you are arent you he lay there for a time then said thats odd because justin said something ive never understood he told me that the war was too bloody for him that it gave him nightmares again rutledge leaned closer to make certain his voice didnt carry but a patient was coughing heavily behind him covering his words he said did you know that justin fowlers parents were brutally murdered and he himself repeatedly stabbed and left for dead good god no is that true justin did they catch whoever did it no he whistled softly did my mother know she never said a word to me but that explains the scars on his body something was mentionedsurgery i think after a moment he added wryly i was a boy i didnt believe her i was envious because i thought hed done something daring and so i asked him do you know what he said i have no scars i thought hed been sworn to secrecy and it was rather exciting rutledge said its time we got started i must go russell stopped him i remembered something last night as i was falling asleep when i ran into ben willet in london he asked me if id see that cynthia got boxes that hes left for her in his lodgings in bloomsbury he was in love with her i could see it as plain as the nose on his face but he didnt want her to see him ill as he was i asked why the boxes shouldnt go to his family in furnham willet said they wouldnt have any use for them but i was jealous i didnt do anything about them as far as i know theyre still there my conscience pricked all night it was wrong of me theres no one else morrison hasnt come back id like to ask you to make certain theyre kept until i can deal with it myself what sort of boxes i dont know i wasnt curious enough to ask rutledge thanked him and left he waited out of sight in one of the other wards until the transfer was over watching the nursing sister hed dealt with before hurrying out of the ward summoning dr wade and then a few minutes later the body of major russell was taken away on a stretcher under matrons grim watchful eye finally the undertaker arrived and rutledge went out to his motorcar and left it was at a layby some two miles away that the transfer was made the nursing sister settling the major into the rear of rutledges vehicle it was painful work but the major took it stoically rutledge thanked the driver of the undertakers van and an hour later the major was in rutledges flat lying exhausted in the bed while the sister took his vital signs rutledge quickly packed a valise of whatever he would need for the duration and stowed it in the boot of his motorcar then warned the nursing sister not to open the door unless she could see him through the window beside it and then he left driving to bloomsbury and after asking a man walking a handsome english setter he tracked down the lodging house where ben willet had stayed in london it was a small well cared for with a neat sign by the door advertising a vacancy the woman who answered his knock was tall with graying redbrown hair and a lined face and when she spoke he realized she was irish hello my dear im that sad to tell you that despite that sign we have no rooms to let just now ive not had the time to change it but ill give you the name of a friend one street away who does im actually here to collect ben willets boxes he smiled he seems to make a habit of leaving them behind i hope you still have them oh yes of course i do major he told me youd be here sooner or later did he reach france safely i was so afraid you know that ill as he was hed collapse on the journey i should think all is well but i havent heard myself what sort of lodger was he neat as a pin and such a gentleman hes a lovely man and he could make me laugh until my sides ached you know such a grand mimic he was what a pity that he took ill so sudden i thought my heart would break but there you are we shouldnt be questioning the lords way should we all the same i cant help but think how his family must feel did his sister or her husband come to visit him he didnt want her to know you see i thought it wrong myself she sounded like such a lovely girl he wrote to her and i posted it for him myself it was sent in care of someone else to be given to her after hed passed on and then the man came to see him and they left together this was unexpected when was this it was the night he was to meet you at tower bridge he said to me as they were walking out the door goodbye mrs hurley if the friend i was to meet comes looking for me tell him ive gone ahead and will be there as promised when mr willet came back he told me there was a terrible accident on the bridge and no one could come across the next evening he left for dover and that was that i held his room for a few days just to be sure youre very kind do you remember the man who came to see him i was in the dining room serving dinner and only caught a glimpse of him it was mr willet who told me why hed be missing his dinner and here id made his favorites but i saved him a plate in case and when he got home he sat there in the kitchen with me and ate it could you describe this visitor i had no reason to remember him did i i was only glad for mr willets sake that hed come hoping he might persuade mr willet to go home and see his father and his sister after all i tell you i cried when he walked out the door that last time i was that upset the other man didnt come back with willet oh no he was alone he told me the visit hadnt gone as hed expected and i was sorry for that but here ive kept you standing at the door come in major my dear and well find those boxes he followed her inside and she led him to a tiny box room in the back of the house where there were odds and ends piled neatly to allow access and to one side were two boxes marked with willets name in a way im that sad to see them go mrs hurley told rutledge as long as they were here id hoped for a miracle and that hed come back the way he was before the sickness came on him i couldnt bear to hand them over to that constable who came for them i was told to pass them to no one but the major and i keep my word when its given and he was grateful for her insistence there ive said goodbye she said as he lifted them to carry them to his motorcar and she turned and walked swiftly back into the house shutting the door so that rutledge wouldnt see her cry the major was in rutledges flat so he took the boxes to his sisters house when he walked in carrying the first of them frances said are you moving in not precisely i need to leave this and its mate with you after i open them the study yes that will do very well when hed brought both boxes in rutledge set about opening each one both contained sheets of paper neatly typed and then others written in longhand i wonder what became of his luggage he mused but i suppose it went into the thames with him id have done the same in his shoes whose luggage whose shoes frances asked if i knew the answer to that id be ahead of the game does this have to do with that awful village where you took me for tea i still havent forgiven you for that furnham yes that was rather dreadful wasnt in hindsight i shouldnt have taken you there he lifted the first hundred or so pages out of the box but the pages he held were drafts of willets first two books and he set them aside disappointed and yet he knew that to the dead man these had been precious when he reached the bottom of the first box he retied the cords and set it aside it was in the second box that he found what must have been a draft of the unfinished third book he took it out sorted through the handwritten pages and then came to the typed sheets a title had been written by hand above the first paragraph the sinners he began to read sitting in a chair by the open window his sister leaning her elbow on the back beside his head after half an hour she turned away its furnham hes talking about isnt it and it must be true the inn is called the dragonfly im afraid so i wish youd never taken me there she said crossing the room as if to put as much space as possible between herself and the pages in his hand rearranging a bowl of flowers she said it was done wasnt it luring ships into rocks and the like bringing them aground so that they could be plundered in cornwall they were called the wreckers i expect the people along the shore had done well when ships wrecked themselves in a storm or on a foggy night and then someone had a clever suggestion if we could bring in more wrecks not waiting on natural causes we could prosper they had had to kill the survivors or else what had happened would quickly reach the ears of the authorities furnham had no rocks on which to beach ships only a sandbar at the outer edge of the estuarys mouth that sometimes shifted in storms and caught an unwary pilot by surprise as a rule ships were able to refloat with the next tide and so furnhams story was very different from cornwalls they hadnt lured the dragonfly ashore it had struck the sandbar in the night and was still there at first light one of the fishermen had noticed something odd about her and several men decided to board her and ask what was wrong they found the ship empty no crew no passengers it was decided to take whatever was useful on board and then refloat her jam the rudder and let her break up elsewhere there were chests of goods in the hold trunks of clothing and barrels of provisions leaving the impression that the passengers had been traveling as far as the new world there was a box of bibles another of hymnals and the log indicated that she had sailed out of newcastleontyne stopped briefly in holland and was expecting to put a few passengers ashore in plymouth and then take on another half dozen for the remainder of their journey their destination was new england the man who discovered the log had read the final pages and he quietly tossed it overboard through a stern window in the captains small cabin it required close to four days to empty the ship of all that was useful men had stayed aboard guarding the goods and others came and went with the fishing boats and rowing boats from the village this was the background of a plot revolving around the rector who told the fishermen and their cohorts from the village that the ship had been sailing on gods business and that everything taken from her belonged to the men who had funded the voyage he had railed against their greed and their covetousness but no one listened every household had benefited from the dragonfly and no one wanted to return his share there was salt flour pork tea a cage of live chickens and even a cow for milking theyd had to build a sling to get her ashore boxes of nails and hammers and other tools bolts of cloth chests of bedding wood for construction of huts until houses could be builtthe list went on it could all be put to good use the rector in frustration told his parishioners that they were doing the devils work and that the devil would exact his price hear me there is a curse on these comforts that have come to you and not even a fortnight had passed before the first of the men who had stayed on board for four days came down with the plague rutledge put the pages aside hed asked about the mass burials assuming that they must be plague victims and no one had answered his question why is he writing such a story this edward willet frances asked i dont know his first two books were personal one of them his war memoirs and the other an account of a girl hed seen once when his father took him to france and that hed searched for during the war its not surprising that his third effort would be something in the past of his village how much is true i dont know but so far the facts are there the name of the inn the barrows id seen in the churchyard that were mass graves for plague victims it takes place in the mids almost two hundred years ago i wish you would take it away she said gesturing to the box i feel uncomfortable even knowing its here he smiled apologetically id forgot i shall have to stay here for several days would you mind terribly r utledge spent the day at the yard then stopped by the flat to be sure that all was well the nursing sister welcomed him and he saw that she had been reading to russell from one of the books on the shelf across from the bed the major had more color this afternoon but no fever sister grey told rutledge he was a difficult patient and russell had smiled rutledge said what do you know about a ship named the dragonfly its on a sign above the inn in furnham nothing more no one from the village ever told you the story i didnt know anyone from the village well enough to talk about legends and the like russell replied i dont believe mother did she never mentioned it it went aground on a sandbar by the mouth of the river when the village men went out to see why there was no activity on board they found the ship abandoned the cargo was rich enough to salve their consciences one of the villagers who could read saw what was written in the ships log then deliberately tossed it overboard then plague erupted in the village and it must have run through it fairly quickly ive seen the mounds in the back of the churchyard ive seen those as well many villages lost threequarters of their population to some of the plagues i dont think its that unusual here it was considered a curse from god for taking the ships goods where did you discover all this in furnham willet was writing a novel about what happened i collected those boxes of his from his lodgings they were filled with manuscripts i expect thats why they were intended for cynthia farraday good god that history will set the cats among the pigeons if it ever comes to light he told miss farraday that his next book would be a story of pure evil i expect he was right tell me how are you faring do you have everything you need im well enough sister grey tells me im healing it doesnt feel like it my chest still hurts like the very devil i expect it does does cynthia know where i am its not all that far to chelsea he said hopefully only dr wade matron and sister grey know youre alive only dr wade was told where i was taking you foolishness id have been safe in the hospital im sure you would have been on the other hand are you willing to risk another attempt on your life im using you as bait to draw out a murderer the yard would take a dim view of your dying while in our charge yes all right he closed his eyes good hunting rutledge left him to rest and went to francess house she had gone for the day with friends and so he shut himself in the study and took out the manuscript it was close to eleven oclock when she came through the door here you are i saw your motorcar but when i called you didnt hear me have you had dinner i think theres a bit of cold chicken in the pantry shall i make you a sandwich id forgot the time he told her ill come with you i see youve been reading more of that manuscript i hope its better than the part i saw its not as interesting as id hoped he answered her im continuing from a sense of duty rather than pleasure it was a lie he didnt want his sister to know the truth about furnham im sorry youd said he appeared to be a talented writer and she began to tell him about her evening as she went to find a plate for him and bring in the cold chicken after hed eaten he went to bed so that frances would also go up and then when he was certain she was asleep he quietly returned to the study and finished the manuscript setting it aside he considered what ben willet had done was he exorcising ghostsfirst the war the french girl he looked for but couldnt find and the past that still hung over the village where hed lived most of his life was it what had made him want to leave furnham in the first place would his next work have been the story of wyatt russells murder of justin fowler out of jealousy rutledge understood now why jessup and barber and others had not wanted the airfield to be brought to furnham for fear someonebored or clever or simply looking to annoy the villagers in his turnwould stumble on a history no one wished to remember it wasnt so much change they feared but that the more people who came the more likely it would be for furnham now only a backwater village of no importance to find itself famous for the wrong reasons what had barber said that jessup didnt want furnham to become notorious did jessup want that badly enough to kill willet before the book could be published or had he thought hed been in time for all anyone knew judging from these typed sheets the sinners was ready for publication barring a final revision before it went to the printers willets arrival in france was all that was needed to carry on in light of what hed been reading rutledge suddenly realized that the manuscript explained the missing luggage whoever had come to see willet at the lodging house must have knownor guessedwhat willet was carrying to france with him the finished work the man had to die so that he couldnt recreate what hed written and the manuscript couldnt survive him to be sent to paris posthumously was that what had happened gathering up the pages hed read rutledge set them carefully back into the box theyd come from and rummaging in what had been his fathers desk he found a roll of twine with which to bind it shut that done he carried the two boxes into the attic and left them there until he could decide whether they were evidence or willets personal property to be handed over to cynthia farraday as the man had wished back in his room he lay on the bed staring at the ceiling most of the facts had been there and hed failed to see them still the few that had been missing made a whole of the story and without them he had been unable to understand what was wrong with the village of furnhamonhawking it was a fisherman named jessup who had tossed the logbook overboard so that no one else would realize that this was a plague ship the last survivor on board had written there all dead but me i still dont know who brought the plague aboard i do fear we stayed too long in rotterdam i watched them die and now i find i cant face such an end alone and without comfort if you find this whoever you are know that i chose selfdestruction i pray god will forgive me but if im damned for it then the devil must look for me in the sea so many more dying in furnham all because of one mans greed but it was what the villagers did next that was unthinkable the rector had gathered all the plague victims in the tiny church and was nursing them there setting the dead outside on the porch trying to contain the sickness as best he could dependent on food and fresh water brought to him by villagers and left in the churchyard the man had worked day and night to save as many souls as possible and outside by the harbor the man who had destroyed the logbook harangued the remaining people of the village telling them that the only way to stop the spread of the plague was to burn it out in the end they collected wood and torches blocked the exits from the church and set it afire the rector and the victims inside had screamed for mercy but there was none the church burned to the ground no one knew whether it was god or the devil who answered their prayers as the church burned prayers that the plague would end and everyone else would be spared there were no more victims but jessup watching his own wife burn alive hanged himself within a year on a tree near the harbor in plain sight of the villagers a pact was made then never again to speak of what had happened it was jessups defiant son who had renamed the inn for the doomed ship no one had dared to change it again chapter after breakfast with his sister rutledge went to the yard she had commented as she poured his tea that he looked tired and asked if hed slept well he had lain awake most of the night for fear he would have a nightmare and start up screaming frightening frances but he smiled and said chief superintendent bowles has had a heart attack the yard is tense waiting to see if hell return when hes stronger or if well have a new chief superintendent we all feel it im sure thats true you and he never got on did you well i hope the new man if there is going to be one is more sympathetic when he walked into his office there was a message on his desk from gibson and attached to it was a cutting of the request for information from the times rutledge read it again then set it aside he wasnt sure now what sort of response there would be he doubted that anyone in furnham read the times and he would have to take a copy to them with what he knew now he hoped he could finally clear up the murder of ben willet he had a motive now and clear suspects as for the attack on russell it would most certainly no longer be an inquiry for the yard it would be turned over to the tilbury police now that the major had survived the other deathsif there were otherswould have to remain unsolved hamish said it willna be resolved true enough rutledge thought tilbury had never solved the disappearance of mrs russell just as colchester had never solved the murders of justin fowlers parents still even though he couldnt quarrel with the evidence before him he was not satisfied another question was what cynthia farraday would do when willets new novel failed to arrive even though hed promised her a copy would she raise the matter with his paris publishers he had no more than formulated the thought when there was a tap at his door and constable henry stuck his head in a miss farraday to see you sir and she appears to be very upset he wasnt surprised he hadnt told her about the fabricated article just in case fowler tried to contact her she came in her face flushed with anger and he thought too that she had been crying you didnt have the courtesy to come and tell me she said at once i was left to read the news in the times i would have gone to him i would have been with him when he died im sorry there has been no opportunity to tell you did he suffer who shot him when where i dont know anything he had been standing when she came in and he offered her a chair sit down let me tell you what i know she did as he asked but her eyes were still blazing with her fury and he felt a surge of regret for what he was about to do he told her how he had finally learned that russell had gone to essex and i left the church before they could find me there listening i went on to rivers edge and waited for him to come but he didnt and i believed that morrison had relented and let him spend the night at the rectory the next morning i spoke to nancy brothers who told me he hadnt come back to the church ruins and i went myself to be sure from there i drove to the rectory but neither morrison nor russell came to the door i was just turning toward rivers edge when i saw morrison coming from that direction hed been looking for russell as well and together we went back to the house to search more carefully he glossed over discovering what hed thought was russells dead body and the difficulty of carrying the wounded man to the motorcar he said only we found him on one of the marsh tracks we managed to get him to a london hospital morrison and i i dont believe he ever regained consciousness and you dont know who shot himor why weve had very little luck thats why we asked the public for assistance and you think anyone in furnham has even seen this article she shook her head in disbelief first ben and now wyatt she angrily brushed away a tear and so far youve done nothing to stop it nothing at all scotland yard for heavens sake and no better than that poor drunken constable in furnham do you realize that im alone now theyre all gone aunt elizabeth justin ben my parents its a frightening feeling i can tell you and you didnt have the courage or the decency to come to me and break the news yourself she began to cry then he handed her his handkerchief as she fumbled for her own she rejected it as if to take it would be to forgive him i can only say how sorry i am would you have come at all she asked finally i was hoping to reach you before youd seen the times i dont believe you she rose to go where do i find the undertaker who took wyatts body i shall deal with the arrangements myself it was the one thing he hadnt planned for the hospital is sending that information to us ill see that you get it just as you saw to it that i was informed before the times arrived this morning no miss farraday ill see that you know in good time if i must send constable henry to you with the information turning toward the door she said youve brought me only unhappiness when i thought you were wyatts solicitor i liked you and then you tried to follow me home and i was frightened since then nothing has gone the way it should i hold you accountable he walked with her as far as the street in front of the yard shall i take you home my motorcar is just there id rather walk she told him and turned toward trafalgar square leaving him standing on the pavement he drove to essex feeling the guilt of the liar telling himself that what he had done was necessary but it didnt help on the way he stopped and bought a copy of the newspaper arriving in furnham he took the paper already turned to the proper page into the cool morning dimness of the rowing boat barber was there and jessup as well with four or five others rutledge realized that hed just walked into a planning meeting for the next run to france they stared at him with animosity and he told himself grimly that it was only to get worse he put the newspaper down on the bar in front of barber i dont imagine youve seen this he said with a glance at the others barber picked up the newspaper found the article that rutledge had referred to and began to read it then he stopped and began again reading it aloud this time there was silence in the room as he put it down whats this got to do with us he nodded to the others i should think youd be interested in helping find his killer even if you had no interest in finding ben willets perhaps it was suicide barber said after a moment did you think of that i should think he would have found it difficult to shoot himself in the back and then walk as far as the house leave the revolver where hed found it and return to the marshes to collapse as he stood there waiting for them to answer he found himself wondering if any of the shotguns the runners had carried had come from the gun case at rivers edge something in the faces turned toward him told him they knew the gun case as well as rutledge did jessup said into the silence why should one of us wish to kill russell we hardly knew him he wasnt one to come to the rowing boat of an evening and drink with us there have been too many deaths at rivers edge beginning with mrs russell and including justin fowler bodies dont disappear in the river not without a little help jessup stirred dont be a fool he said after a moment what reason did we have another of the men asked i was hoping you would tell me there is something wrong at rivers edge i havent found out what it was but i will he gestured to the newspaper as he picked it up as this says any information will be treated with strictest confidentiality so dont be afraid to speak up i should think miss farraday will be offering a reward as well he turned walking out the door feeling a tightness between his shoulder blades until he had swung the door shut behind him at the rectory he saw morrison trimming a hedge that ran along the back of his property getting out he walked past the house and said when he was in earshot i think youll want to read this holding up the newspaper he waited until morrison had put down the woodenhandled hedge trimmers and joined him by the kitchen door whats that it can wait im thirsty would you care for a lemonade rutledge went into the small but tidy kitchen and took the chair morrison indicated an oiled cloth in a rather garish shade of green covered the table and the hutch and the cabinets were old after a moment he came back with a heavy pitcher in his hands its not terribly cold the rector said apologetically its hard to come by ice out here ive taken to keeping the jug in the root cellar he poured a glass and handed it to rutledge now what is it i ought to read rutledge thanked him and pointed to the top of the page dear god he said after hed finished it hes dead but i thought dr wade gave him a very good chance of living i was there yesterday just before his fever shot up ive shown this to barber and jessup and a few of the others and as you can see ive kept your name out of it i thought it best thank you very much i can do without any other quarrel with my parishioners but this is sad news after all our efforts to get him to a casualty ward did he ever remember anything more apparently not well that will just make your task harder i should think much as i hate to say it it must have been one of the villagers morrison shook his head but theres no motive he hadnt been here for years why shoot him perhaps because hed seen ben willet the night before he was killed with someone from furnham morrisons eyebrows shot up are you sure in london thats a long journey for someone from furnham none of us has the luxury of your motorcar there are vans that come to the butchers shop and the greengrocers shop someone must come for the milk out at the farms there are ways yes i suppose thats true well then it should be easy enough for you to find out stilli know these people rutledge which one have i failed to understand you told me that jessup was dangerous yes thats true he is he will hammer you within an inch of your life if you cross him his fists are his weapon of choice nevertheless one of your flock shot russell all right yes i just dont want to think that men ive known and argued with and cajoled into coming to a service or letting a son or daughter be baptized are killers is it possible that someone from london followed him here there was that business of the loose mare probably very slim at best rutledge could appreciate morrisons concern for the souls in his keeping whether they wanted his keeping or not finishing his lemonade he asked did you know the history of the church that preceded yours morrison roused himself from whatever he was thinking about the men of furnham i was told it was struck by lightning and burned flat as it is out here a steeple is the tallest point around not surprising jessup told me the same story its one of the reasons why the new church st edwards has a truncated tower i suspect the beams were ancient and as dry as several hundreds of years could make them theyd burn in a flash i asked if it had been a sunday if anyone had been trapped in it but apparently not it was in the evening rutledge left it at that picking up the newspaper he said im going to rivers edge its possible that in our concern for russell we overlooked something i cant imagine what do you want me to go with you two pairs of eyes and all that its just as well if i go alone and then ill carry on straight to london will you tell me when the funeral will be ill take the service if cynthiamiss farradaywishes me to he was prepared this time the body wont be released straightaway yes i understand but youll pass along my offer i hope rutledge promised thanked him for the lemonade and left are ye going to rivers edge yell be a target if ye do and no one to help he answered hamish aloud if its someone from furnham hell follow me to london and there i wont see him coming aye but watch your back rutledge stopped at the gates of rivers edge walked up the drive and around to the terrace and although he stood there for nearly threequarters of an hour he saw no one no one took a shot at him all the same he could feel eyes watching him from the high grass among the reeds across the river or concealed in the dozens of inlets and coves barely deep enough for a small boat he hadnt thought to bring his field glasses and he cursed himself for that debating the wisdom of spending the night in the empty house he decided against it hamish said yon major was shot after dark if im to be shot and killed it wont matter if i see who it is in broad daylight aye theres that when next i come ill bring constable greene with me the drive to london lay ahead reluctantly he walked back to the motorcar he wouldnt have been surprised to find his tires slashed but they were not the crank turned and the motor caught and nothing at all happened he didnt feel reassured by that i t was too late to return to the yard by the time rutledge reached london but he stopped at his flat to look in on russell he was sleeping and sister grey who had been nodding in her chair by the bed assured rutledge that there were no changes in his condition he found frances waiting for him i didnt know if you were coming here again tonight what did you do with the boxes take them with you this morning theyre evidence i put them in the attic for safekeeping im glad theyre out of sight im starving will you take me to dinner im afraid you still owe me a lunch at the restaurant they met several friends but sat at a table for two rutledge was just as glad the four people they had spoken with as they came in often included meredith channing in their dinner plans he couldnt sit there and listen to speculation about where she might be or why she was away so long hed told himself a hundred times to put her out of his mind but it was harder to do than hed ever imagined the wound was still too raw hamishs voice without warning spoke from just behind him you willna walk away its safer to love someone ye canna have you willna have to tell her about me frances said a penny for your thoughts stretching out her hand she put a copper penny in front of his plate collecting himself he recognized the profile of edward vii staring up at him and managed a smile to gain time he handed it back to her what else is there to think about the yard she made a face put it aside for tonight listen the orchestra is starting to play talk to me or i shall make a fuss until you dance with me laughing because she expected it he cleared his mind of everything except for the everpresent hamish and tried to pretend it was before the war and the golden summer of had lasted forever the next morning he went to the yard early and found an envelope on his desk sergeant gibsons name was on the front in care of the yard there was no return address rutledge took out the single sheet of paper i saw the request for information in the newspaper will you meet me just by st martininthefields will do it was unsigned the hunt was beginning and he had a feeling he was the prey but who was the hunter he walked out of the yard at onethirty and made his way to trafalgar square he stood there for a quarter of an hour surveying the people coming and going trying to spot anyone looking for him as well at five minutes before two oclock he walked to the west door of st martininthefields its white facade bright in the afternoon sun he stood there until well after two oclock and no one came giving it up he turned and walked back toward the yard he was waiting at the corner to cross the street when someone came up behind him and said quietly dont turn around you arent sergeant gibson who are you inspector rutledge i put that request in the times sergeant gibson was merely the contact whats your name no i told you dont turn in exchange for what i know i want one thing immunity from prosecution for desertion can you arrange that a break in the traffic was coming but rutledge stayed where he was i dont have the authority to make such an arrangement then you dont need to speak to me wait rutledge said quickly ill do what i can give me twentyfour hours ill give you until dark come back alone i know what you look like now if you try to see me its finished very well another break in the traffic came go urged the voice behind him and rutledge crossed the street with six or eight other people hurrying on their way even before he reached the far side he knew he was alone the encounter had yielded several pieces of information he had met a deserter for one and he was absolutely certain the army wouldnt offer immunity in exchange for information that would bring a murder inquiry to an end and finally he hadnt recognized the voice at his back was it a trick a deserter seizing the opportunity to help himself the man claimed he knew sergeant gibson or had someone actually come forward and been clever enough to ensure he himself wasnt tricked rutledge tried to replay the voice in his mind low but not deep most certainly male it reminded him of ben willets the same timbre the same cultured overtones willet was a good mimic the voice of a gentleman coming naturally to him but he was also dead and his sister had identified the body rutledge sent a message round to his sisters house to say that he would be late and then he went to see major russell someone contacted me he said as he came into the bedroom it wasnt such a wild idea after all russell said quickly who was it handing him the envelope rutledge said do you recognize the handwriting after studying it for a moment russell said i dont think ive seen it before would you know findleys hand or fowlers i dont know that ive ever seen anything in finleys handwriting and it isnt justins his had more of a slant to it rutledge told him what had transpired ending with he asked for immunity from prosecution for desertion good luck to him russell said the army will never agree to that i wouldnt be surprised to learn its someone from furnham you did see to it that they knew about the times all right then ive dealt with soldiers from isolated villages some of them were so homesick they would have deserted if they hadnt been too afraid to try rutledge himself had dealt with raw troops facing battle for the first time or its a trap he said slowly im to meet him again when its dark what would he have done russell asked if this man gibson had met him hed have been prepared to put him off wouldnt he and make certain that you would come it was an interesting point take someone with you russell added thats my advice ill ask constable greene i cant risk taking gibson with me no need to frighten him off have a service revolver do you the clinic took mine away carry it with you good advice but policemen were not expected to go armed later when rutledge asked constable greene to accompany him to the meeting the man said its my wifes birthday sir i dont think shed forgive either of us constable henry had already left for the day and sergeant gibson was closeted with the acting chief superintendent rutledge left the yard on his own walking through the quiet streets back to st martininthefields he wasnt sure what he was facing still he hadnt brought his revolver he would take his chances without it arriving at the church the first thing he saw was a white square of paper pinned to the door taking it down he walked to the pool of light cast by a streetlamp unfolded the half sheet and tried to read what was written there the words were a black scrawl not at all the neat writing on the first message he thought this must be the mans true hand or else hes apprehensive afraid of a trap with hamish uttering a warning in his mind rutledge finally deciphered the tangle of words walk another quarter mile north and ill find you whoever it was he was being very careful but then the price for desertion was death rutledge continued north out of the square coming finally to a dark street where trees blocked the light of streetlamps casting long black shadows across the road half seen beneath one of the trees stood a tall slim man in country clothing a cap pulled down over his eyes he was suddenly reminded of furnham when he had waited under another tree this one by the bend of the road until three men with sacks over their shoulders had come up from the river hed been alone tense prepared for trouble then had watched it walk directly toward him and knew that he stood no chance if he was caught there rutledge understood what the other man was experiencing knew the price hed paid to come to this meeting stopping some ten feet from him rutledge waited for him to speak all he could see was the pale glimmer of a face beneath the cap but no distinguishing features they arent offering me anything are they the man said after a moment resignation in his quiet voice im sorry no he could see a faint lift of his shoulders as the man accepted the bald truth well ill have to take my chances wont i ill do what i can but i make no promises still i need whatever information you can give me i cant find a killer without it there was a pause as if the man was considering how to begin finally he said all right my name is harold finley i worked at rivers edge until it was closed and stayed on as caretaker until i was called up rutledge stayed where he was waiting for an errant breeze to shift the leaves a little and show him the mans face it had nearly happened once already i came back to the house twice after that when my training was finished and i was given leave and later in the summer of when id recovered from my wounds i knew justin fowler was already in england so i wasnt surprised to find the terrace doors open there was no one inside and i decided to walk down to the water and i stood there for a while i was beginning to wonder where fowler had got to and just in case hed brought in supplies at the kitchen landing i thought i might go along and help him carry boxes up to the house do you know where it is this landing i do fowler was there stretched out on the ground i thought he was dead and i couldnt believe it i didnt want to find out it was suicide but he wouldnt have been the first to fall into despair at the prospect of returning to france i got to him and discovered hed been shot in the back of his head that was a shock i can tell you whats more when i touched him the body was still warm i tore open his tunic to listen to his heart hoping i could save him it occurred to me that whoever had done this must still be nearby that i could be shot as well but i found a faint irregular pulse i couldnt leave him as he relived the event his words tumbled over one another and there was the ring of truth in his voice echoes of the shock and fear and desperation hed felt any idea who could have shot him why they should still be nearby it had to be someone from furnham who else something had changed in his voice now but with the war on there was no smuggling nothing to store at rivers edge why furnham i couldnt think clearly i tell you he turned away i didnt want him to die and just then someone spoke and i wheeled thinkingbut it was fowler i could barely make out what he was saying even though i put my ear to his lips and what he said made no sense no sense at all and he died while i was holding him what did he say brother he said it twice brother finley hesitated all i could think of was major russell and that was impossible they werent actually brothers were they he leaned forward waiting for an answer wyatt russell was an only child as was justin fowler he paused its possible that there is someone who believed that he was fowlers older brother it isnt true but as a child he must have been led to think of himself as the elder fowlers son and its also possible that this manif he existskilled fowler and murdered both of his parents perhaps thats why the police have never found the person responsible the familys solicitors never told them about this man gentle god there was a long pause rutledge wished he could see finleys face is that true he asked finally can you be certain of it i believe it to be true ive tried to find this man but i dont have his name for a time i thought he might be you coming to work for the russell family in order to finish what had been started in colchester you thought id killed fowlerand now russell even in the darkness his surprise was evident theres no one else is there you were the only outsider at rivers edge pacing back and forth in the shadows the man said yes all right but if id killed them why would i come to you now just to bargain with the army why did you desert why not go to the police were you afraid they would suspect you i couldnt go back to france even in the artillery shaking his head he couldnt continue the rest of us had the courage to go back it wasnt a matter of courage damn it im as brave as the next man taking a deep breath he said more calmly i didnt come here to defend myself fowler told me it was his brother when i read the yards request in the times it occurred to me that perhaps hed been mistaken both men had been killed at rivers edge and i was afraidthe wrong person might be blamed rutledge realized that finley had come to protect cynthia farraday what did you do with fowlers body did you leave it there where youd found it i didnt know what else to do and that was a lie his voice betraying him once more then why was it never found even the bones it was never found fowlers body there was genuine consternation now mrs russell also died at rivers edge who killed her i wish i knew we searched until we were stumbling over our feet and still we kept looking and there was no sign of her ive had a long time to think about it since then i knew she had to be dead they whispered suicide but she wouldnt have killed herself it had to be murder was it the same person the tension in his voice was mirrored in the way he waited for the answer it could very well be if hed taken fowlers first family from him why not the second but we wont have an answer will we until weve found him then hes killed all of us hasnt he except for cynthia except for miss farraday he corrected himself thats all i can give you its all i know justfind him for the love of god find him he waited expecting something from rutledge when it didnt come he simply walked away rutledge let him go but when he was nearly across the road and just into the shadows of the trees on the far side yet still within hearing rutledge called in a normal voice fowler and before he could stop himself the man began to turn he said quickly my name is finley i told you i think not i didnt kill them he protested angrily taking a few steps forward the whites of his eyes were stark beneath the bill of his cap im arresting you for the murder of the people who gave you shelter and love when you were a victim yourself did you kill mrs russell and her son no you cantill be hangedits not true he began not ten feet away and rutledge felt himself tense as he moved even closer my name is finley he broke off as an older couple came out of one of the houses behind them and turned to go the other way rutledge waited until they were out of earshot i suspect harold finley is dead and you survived because he was youre wrong i didnt have to come i didnt have to meet you i did it for the majors sake you arent a very good liar fowler what really happened at rivers edge the sudden shift in his weight betrayed him and rutledge said sharply if you run ill find you no matter how long it takes and when i do ill hand you over to the army i didnt want them to die the man cried dear god do you thinkits why i ran so that it would stop but it didnt did it whoever is doing this finally came for wyatt too didnt he and i couldnt let miss farraday be the next victim if thats the truth come with me well find somewhere to talk i give you my word i wont arrest you if in turn youll give me the truth rutledge expected fowler to refuse and then he changed his mind almost against his will a part of him needing relief from the burden hed carried too long finally to rutledges surprise he said where russell was in his flat and frances was at the house let me take you to miss farradays house it isnt public you can leave anytime you like no anywhere but there then name a place theres a pub some distance from here too public i expect youre right my motorcar is not far from the yard we can sit in it fowler considered the risks and finally said yes all right but i need another guarantee that you wont ask the name i now live under very well hamish was already questioning whether fowler would make it that far before they reached the motorcar there would be a dozen opportunities to disappear but the man followed without a word and under the brighter lamps by trafalgar square rutledge could see his haggard face and haunted eyes before they reached the motorcar fowler said how did i betray myself you werent shocked when i told you about the murders of your parents no one else knew mrs russell had kept it a secret from the other two children it wasnt likely she would confide in her driver and you said hes killed all of us not all of them fowler swore softly i thought i could carry it off they reached the motorcar and when fowler stepped in and shut the door he put his head back against the seat im so very tired he said his eyes closed i thought it would never end where did you start lying rutledge asked after giving him some time to collect himself its true most of what i told you only it was i who arrived early that morning to find finley dying down by the waters edge hed been shot in the back of the head i wasnt sure what he said to meit could just as well have been a gurgle of pain but it sounded very much like brother i didnt know if finley had any brothers and then i remembered that wyatt had been a little jealous of me we were the same height and build harold and i a split second later i knew knew what theres something i never told anyone not even mrs russell or the police while i was in hospital recovering from the stab wounds there were messages from my parents friends our neighbors clients general wellwishers all of it very kind the police and my solicitors opened them at first to be sure they wouldnt be upsetting after the first weeks realizing that the messages were actually comforting they just let me open them as they arrived a week before i was released there was one with just two lines on the page he stopped trying to steady his voice what did it say a constable came toward the motorcar and fowler tensed but the man walked on by and went inside the yard he was my father and the woman with him was a whore and youre my bastard halfbrother im not finished wherever you are i will find you no signature nothing i knew one day hed come for me that it was only a matter of time and so i stayed close to rivers edge but i never expected him to attack the others by the time aunt elizabeth went missing id been to cambridge and id convinced myself that it had been a vicious prank by someone because you see nothing ever happened it had been an empty threat from the start a hoax that had haunted me shaped my life i didnt want to believe hed killed aunt elizabeth go back to the day you found finleys body i did the unthinkable i stripped finley put my uniform on his body and shoved him into the river i expected him to float down to where the fishermen would find him and report me dead i started walking and i didnt stop until i was too exhausted to go any farther thats why i realized i couldnt return to france when my leave ended if i did id have to explain about finley and how he came to be wearing my uniform and carrying my papers on the other hand if i simply disappeared by the time finley was spotted in the river hed be unrecognizable and whoever was out there stalking us would think it was finished theres be no point would there in killing wyatt and cynthia if i wasnt alive and i was right nothing happened to them when i saw that column in the newspaper i had to do something it had started again you see why do you think it stopped for five years the killing i expect whoever he is he was satisfied and wyatt stayed away there was no temptation no opportunity did you know that cynthia farraday often went out to rivers edge for the day she was there fairly often i expect and a perfect target but he rememberedshe borrowed a launch there was no telltale motorcar outside the gates still there could have been an encounterit was only a matter of luck that she hadnt been seen by whoever watched the house dear god fowler seemed to fold into himself hunched over almost as if he were in physical pain why didnt you tell the police what you suspected when mrs russell vanished fowler roused himself to stare at rutledge i told you i hoped it was all my imagination besides the tilbury police didnt know about my past i was afraid that if i told them theyd think id run mad the colchester police were suspicious enough in the beginning if they could have shown that id killed my parents they would have been very pleased i was young but not so young that i didnt understand where their questions were leading if id reported a body at rivers edge what do you think would have happened id have been the chief suspect i decided to let the fishermen report him for me four people dead rutledge and i was present each time whats more i dont think tilbury would have any better luck finding the killer than colchester had done but they never reported a body are you sure did you ask that man nelson the constable they should have found him in the shallows id emptied my pockets and put everything in his i was in such a funk i forgot and left the pounds he was carrying and my own in the wallet how much money was there i dont know i had almost fifty pounds with me because i was expecting to stay in a hotel in london for a few days he could have had twenty or so i cursed myself i can tell you that money would have made my disappearance a lot smoother i dared not touch my inheritance had jessup found the corpseand just as his ancestor had done aboard the dragonfly had he taken the pounds and left the body in the water jessup had much to answer for you gave no thought to finleys family he had none thats why he went into service but he was a decent chap and i thought long and hard about what i was doing he was still serving us in a way and if after the war wyatt reopened the house hed be all right safe rutledge remembered the man hed seen at the landing looking waiting after a time he said is there anyoneanyone at allwho could have been stalking your family before they were killed anyone you felt the slightest suspicion of i was eleven sometimes children see more clearly do you think he would have taken that risk that hed be among the people the police interviewed ill have to look through the statements the colchester police took at the time meanwhile what will you do where will you go is there a way to contact you ive made a life of sorts for myself perhaps not what id have wanted if none of this had happened but i was content you can imagine what i felt when i read about wyatt in the times my god that was a shock i can tell you i had to make a choice then i had to come forward hamish spoke suddenly in the stillness of the motorcar do ye trust him and rutledge weighing all the evidence wasnt sure i shall go to colchester tomorrow and look for the statements meanwhile theres something you should know he told fowler about willets visit to the yard the accusation hed made and his subsequent death he said wyatt had killed me but how did he even know i was dead you said mythe body was never found a good question had willet heard something believed it and later tried to do the right thing without involving his family a fishermans son he had a strong connection to the men who lived by the water he could have heard whispers what are you going to do about me fowler asked after a silence if i ask you to testify the army will take you into custody yes i know give me a way of reaching you if i find something i may need to contact you if you sent a letter to the pipes tobacco shop in chester addressed to finley it will eventually reach me fair enough its late ill take you to a train if you like thanks id rather walk he got out thanked rutledge again and then said ive never dealt with such hatred as this such evil you must find him you know that rutledge said thinking about a burning church and the screaming victims inside evil is always there if we look for it with a nod fowler walked on rutledge watched him go wondering if hed done the right thing or if hed made the worst mistake of his career in the end as he started the motorcar preparing to drive to his sisters house he rather thought that he had done the only thing possible in the circumstances if he could ignore smallscale smuggling he could ignore a case of desertion but he was still not certain about fowler even when he let himself into his sisters house and climbed the stairs to the room that had once been his hamish said ye didna face murder when ye were eleven rutledge hanging his clothes in the wardrobe and preparing for bed tried to put himself in fowlers shoes how would he have felt if hed been awakened in the night by a murderer and then barely surviving himself learned the next morning that his parents had already been killed with the same knife it didnt bear thinking about chapter when rutledge walked into the police station in colchester he found that inspector robinson was elsewhere investigating a housebreaking the constable who had been summoned in the inspectors place didnt remember the fowler casehe had come from suffolkand spent over an hour searching for it in the cellar archives and youre quite certain sir that the inspector is willing to allow you to read the file in his absence hes knows of scotland yards interest in these murders he directed rutledge to a small interview room and ten minutes later reluctantly turned over the box containing the statements taken when fowlers parents were killed it took rutledge two hours to sort through the statements everyone had been interviewed the staff in the house fowlers partner the neighbors mr harrison who represented the family anyone who made deliveries to the house from the milk van driver to the man who brought the post anyone who had worked on the grounds or in the house from gardeners to painters to the chimney sweep and the coal man no one had seen or heard anything no one knew of any trouble touching the family the killer had come quietly finished his work and left taking nothing leaving nothing but death behind hamish said if the wife had screamed and one of the servants had come running there would ha been another murder very likely but i dont think the killer wanted that he replaced the statements in the box and sorted quickly through the other pieces of evidence in the file the postmortem report that graphically described the number and placement of the knife wounds in the bodies of mr and mrs fowler indicating the savagery of the attack and commenting that mrs fowlers survival for even a few hours after it had been nothing short of miraculous although she hadnt regained consciousness that was followed by a statement from the doctor who had treated justin fowler describing the severity of his wounds and expressing concern about telling the boy that his parents were dead suggesting that the police wait until he was out of danger a sergeant had meticulously made a list of all the personal correspondence found in fowlers desk in the six months before the murders and another had been compiled of clients hed dealt with in the past six months the police had been meticulous even to keeping a list of those who had called at the hospital in the first few days after justin had been rushed to casualty and there it was a name he recognized rutledge sat back in the chair telling himself it had to be a coincidence a faint echo of memory awoke something that inspector robinson had told him whats more it explained why mr waring hadnt been able to find the right name when hed been questioned at the school another discordant fact had fit well into the whole now and other odd pieces began to fall into place making a pattern he just might have found the connection after all armed with this new knowledge rutledge asked to use the stations telephone and put in three calls to london when the last of these calls had been returned rutledge whistled under his breath gladys mitchells son had been adopted when he was barely a year oldjust about the time she met the young man who would later become the father of justin fowler ridding herself of an encumbrance in the hope of impressing a rich man but it hadnt worked out the way she had planned meanwhile the boys new parents hadnt wanted to give him up still they had sent him to the charity school in london because he had had a scholarship there they were too poor to do otherwise that much rutledge had already worked out but for the details what he had had no way of knowing was that gladys mitchell had become a matron at that same school using the name grace fowler had the solicitor harrison been aware of that it was most certainly when shed poisoned her sons mind against the elder fowler and his family the boy grew up to follow in his adoptive fathers footsteps as a shoemaker but he hadnt prospered his adoptive mothergladyss sisterdied soon after followed within a year by her husband and the boy now a grown man was penniless unhappy and in search of a new life he had found it in an unexpected place sitting down again at the table rutledge stared at the box of evidence in front of him hardly able to take it all in dear god he said aloud behind him inspector robinson replied hes not available but i am what have you found when rutledge didnt answer straightaway he said harshly its my case i remind you of that the yard hasnt charged you with this inquiry you have your own rutledge turned as he collected the rest of the file and added it to the box quite i cant connect my murder to yours i dont know why your killer should have shot my victim he rose and handed the box to robinson i might add that your predecessor was a careful and thorough man if anyone should have found this murderer it was he the only problem is we arent omniscient are we its what gives the criminal an edge taking the box inspector robinson said i dont appreciate your examining this file without speaking to me what were you looking for any tangible evidence that could be useful a name a coincidence an irregularity anything out of order if an answer comes of what youve discovered i want to know theres no real proof robinson only a faint hope he was on his way to the door what im afraid of if you want the truth is that if im not careful they will hang the wrong man and even if im careful that could still happen inspector robinson was a zealot when it came to this particular crime and there had to be some way of proving what he rutledge suspected without involving justin fowler or having him taken up for desertion rutledge didnt approve of what the man had done refusing to go back to france but that was a matter for fowlers conscience he left then faced with the dilemma of what to do with the information he had wyatt russell could probably tell him what he needed to know but russell hadnt seen his assailant and rutledge wasnt eager to put words in his mouth who could answer his question nancy brothers when he came to the junction with the road to the hawking river he took it but halfway to furnham he changed his mind leave nancy brothers out of it go straight to constable nelson the rector was wheeling his bicycle along the road on his way from furnham to the rectory rutledge slowed to keep pace with him back again are you morrison asked im afraid so willets death is still a mystery i thought youd all but settled on jessup in truth ive yet to place him in london but all in good time they had reached the rectory drive morrison went ahead and leaned his bicycle against the side of the cottage come in im making a pot of tea rutledge followed him inside and walked to the window to look out as morrison brought down the teapot and filled it with cold water i need more information i considered speaking to nancy brothers or constable nelson its possible you can help me as well if i can when did you take up the living at st edwards were you here before cynthia farraday came to live at rivers edge i dont believe there was a priest here then there hadnt been since i think it was i refused the living twice myself before my bishop convinced me it was my duty to bring god back to this benighted place or words to that effect hes dead now i often wonder what he would have to say about my dealings with the people of furnham im not the most successful shepherd i grant you but this is not the general run of flock rutledge laughed what about nelson when did he come to furnham about five years before the war i should think but you were asking me about cynthia farraday ive told you most everything i can think of is there anything in particular ive spoken to her a number of times and ive begun to think that shes still in love with justin fowler she refuses to believe hes dead she feels he must be among the missing what she doesnt knowi didnt care to be the one to tell heris that hes been listed as a deserter by the army morrisons surprise was genuine has he been by god rutledge finished his tea now i must beard jessup in his den do you know where he lives the house just past the bend in the road on the right but when rutledge stopped in front of that cottage he changed his mind reversing he went instead to the rowing boat it appeared to be closed but he knocked at the door there was no answer from there he drove to abigail barbers house she came to the door and as soon as she recognized him she said my father and my brothers are dead theres no more bad news to bring to me my apologies mrs barber i need to ask you again you had no word from your brother for months thats true i expect he didnt want to tell us he was dying her eyes filled at the memory he was so thin lying there under that sheet it broke my heart to see him someone paid him a visit in london the night before he died hed written a letter and the visit must have been prompted by that he couldnt have written sandy would have told me nor would he have gone to london without me not if it was ben he was seeing he wouldnt have gone to london without me your father was ill he reminded her he would have taken me to see ben id have found someone to sit with my father it would have been all right he reminded her of the date again was your husband away at that time no of course he wasnt besides theres the pub he doesnt trust anyone else to manage it your uncle then when she hesitated he added i know about france its not important her face wasnt good at hiding what was going through her mind he had his answer jessup had been away but where mind reading couldnt put jessup in london and it was clear that abigail barber had no idea where her uncle had gone he was in france she said finally he goes sometimes he thanked her and left now ye must ask the man himsel hamish warned him before yon lass asks him id have preferred not to hes spoiling for a fight and im not aye he is that this time rutledge walked up the path to jessups door before he could knock jessup opened it in his face i saw you before trying to gather your courage i wont ask you in its my house and im rather particular about who i invite to step across my threshold yes i rather thought you might be rutledge said easily where would you prefer to go instead the strand there where everyone in furnham can watch you being taken into custody for obstructing the police in the course of their duties or shall we retire to the churchyard where only the dead will be disturbed by your humiliation jessup measured his chances they were nearly of a height rutledge slightly taller while he himself was running to fat around the middle and could give rutledge at least a stone rutledge said youre wasting my time jessup talk what did ben willet tell you in his last letter that he was writing a book about the dragonfly about the plague and the burning of the church with a hundred souls inside is that why you went to london and killed him rutledge had prepared for any reaction what he got was a frowning stare what last letter what do you mean he was writing a book about the dragonfly god if id known that id have killed him myself bloody coward are you sure damn it he swore to me and to his father he swore he would say nothing he was furiously angry striking the frame of the door hard with the edge of his fist is that why he was afraid to come home before ned died did abigail know this she did not i dont know why he never told her about his books hes the one they were talking about in france jessup said suddenly not ned i thought they were putting us on georges and his son theyre bastards but they get what we want how did they know when we didnt besides i thought they said the book was about smuggling they knew because the books were published in france under the name edward willet smuggling was in his second work dragonfly would have been his third if youre lying to me ill kill you someone knew someone met him in london theres a witness to the fact that he wrote that letter the same witness can swear to the fact he met someone the night before he died i got no letter hed write to sandy not me or to abigail his gaze moved toward the pub looking up the street rutledge saw sandy barber in the doorway of the rowing boat watching them he said who found mrs russells body foundshe was never found but the locket was wasnt it her locket he watched the mans eyes and they gave jessup away and who found justin fowler floating in the river and never reported it jessup looked toward barber again nobody you didnt want the police asking questions thats why you didnt report the locket or fowlers body who killed them jessup your merry band of smugglers or someone else get the hell out of furnham jessup said through clenched teeth im warning you youve intimidated constable nelson but you cant intimidate scotland yard i will have a dozen men here to search every house and question every person in this village well drag the river as well and tear every boat apart the london newspapers will be kept abreast of our efforts and when were finished furnham will be changed forever and your name will be synonymous with the evil your ancestor did i read the manuscript jessup he knew that hed pushed too far if the shotgun had been to hand jessup would have used it hamish warned him and he realized that while hed been speaking sandy barber had come up behind him he moved slightly so that he could watch both men waiting for whatever would happen next but hed been angry with the intransigence of these men the obstruction at every turn and it was time to end it into the hostile silence barber said if we tell you will you leave us in peace no jessup said explosively were making a spectacle of ourselves barber shouted at him in his turn theres no one in the boat well settle it there barber waited and rutledge held his tongue jessup was struggling to get himself under control he seemed to realize through the haze of fury that villagers going in and out of the shops were staring at the confrontation on his doorstep rutledge could almost read the thoughts passing though the mans mind that this was too public a place to do murder finally he nodded curtly shoved rutledge to one side and walked off toward the pub he didnt look to see if anyone was following him when he was out of earshot barber snapped why did you make him so angry he could have killed you he could have tried rutledge said and strode to the pub in his turn with barber hastily falling in beside him was the book that explicit he asked god i neverhe went to be a footman thats all ben wanted what happened i expect it was going to france that changed him the war he must have kept a diary he wrote a memoir after it was over and someone in paris published it damn the war barber said as rutledge opened the door into the pub and damn the french while were about it jessup was waiting he said to barber what are we going to do with him he has to be stopped you fool do you want to hang they know where he is the yard does if he goes missing hes right theyll come down on us and tear furnham apart tell him what he wants to know tell him or i will then make him promise the flush on jessups face was a measure of his rage they wont know what he knows they cant there are the boxes willet left behind the manuscripts are in them rutledge said youll be taken up for the murder of benjamin willet when they come to light whats more the murder of justin fowler and the attack on wyatt russell happened here not in london you have that to answer for as well you selfish bastard barber said youve got us into this get us out of it there was a long silence as jessup weighed alternatives rutledge saw the man glance once at the windows that looked down on the river then he shook his head as if to rid it of the thought instead he grappled with the realization that he had no choice at all all right he said finally we found fowler floating already dead we thought at first he was a german spy come to grief on the river but it wasnt all that long after the old woman vanished and we didnt want the police here again we towed him to the mouth of the river and turned him loose who told willet that wyatt russell had killed him it must have been ned barber said i cant think who else could have told him jessup cut across his words it wasnt ned i wrote to him in france and mentioned thered been a fallingout between russell and fowler and wed heard a gunshot just in case the body washed up somewhere else he wanted to know if theyd quarreled over miss farraday and i answered that it was likely you told himdamn it you never told me barber said angrily it was to cover us i thought it best rutledge said willet believed you thats why i was drawn into this inquiry in the first place he came to the yard and told me that wyatt russell had killed fowler willet knew he was dying my guess is he wanted miss farraday to learn what had become of fowler and he could hardly tell her himself he must have known how she felt about the man and it was a way to repay all shed done for willet himself he smiled grimly you brought your own house crashing down around your ears jessup willet wasnt dead jessup said not when you came to furnham that first time i was curious rutledge countered who killed mrs russell i dont know ned found her locket he wanted to show it to the police but i told him not to i told him to keep it and give it to abigail but ben saw it on his last leave and asked for it he wanted to put his likeness in it and give it to a girl to cynthia farraday would it have saved three lives if he had or would ben willet have been hanged for a murder he hadnt committed rutledge shook his head jessup mistook the shake to mean he wasnt believed he couldnt give it to abigail i can see now it would have got all of us into trouble if he had but what would a girl in thetford know about mrs russell ben could tell her the locket was his mothers and who would think otherwise they were scoundrels all of them living by their wits doing what they had to in order to survive do ye believe him hamish asked rutledge found he did it was probably not the whole truth but when did the whole truth ever exist which brings me back to willets letter he wrote it he posted it that much we know he was leaving for france he wanted to die there and at a guess it told whoever it was to break the news gently to abigail and her father what else did it say and who came to london that last night of his life it wasnt me jessup said i was in tilbury getting a part for my boat he didnt write to me barber said it must have been to ned ned was too ill to travel to london but rutledge had found his connection now it was the last piece of the puzzle how would he have managed to keep such a letter from his daughter he was a sly old fox barber said hed have burned it in the cooker he wouldnt have wanted abigail to learn any more bad news and ned willet was dead no one could ask him or prove what hed done jessup said hed have told the priest by god hed have sent the priest to london to persuade ben to come home to his father make sense jessup the priest wouldnt have killed him barber retorted why not they were all of them in love with that farraday woman i wouldnt be surprised to find out the priest loved her too no he saw the locket rutledge said morrison killed mrs russell he believed that ben willet knew what had happened to her and a dying man often wants to unburden his soul morrison couldnt take that risk have you run mad barber asked the priest hes like constable nelson hes afraid of his shadow is he he came into a house in colchester one night and butchered justin fowlers mother and father and stabbed fowler himself so severely he spent six months in hospital morrison barber exclaimed i sent for him to comfort my wife you look at the evil your ancestors did but here is an equal evil right under your nose and you thought because you could bully the man that he was nothing did he have a reason for killing them jessup demanded he believed lies hed been told by his mother he thought he was owed a different sort of life his real father was in prison but hed been led to look upon justin fowlers father as his he saw himself as the rejected son and youre sure he killed ben it was either you or morrison i thought you were angry enough with him that youd killed him without warning jessup came straight for him as barber shouted here but jessup shoved rutledge aside and was out the door before either man could stop him hell tell abigail she dotes on rector barber said and was through the door before rutledge could reach it but jessup wasnt heading in the direction of the barber house with long determined angry strides he went toward his own house rutledge was halfway there when he realized what jessup was intending to do it wasnt the shotgun in his house that he was after it was the motorcar sitting in front of it he turned the crank with the vigor of his anger got in and was already gunning the motor before rutledge reached him as his hand gripped the door jessup used his fist to pound it and when he couldnt break rutledges hold he drove off throwing rutledge backward twisting his arm and then slamming it against the side of the motorcar careening as he fought for control of the wheel jessup nearly collided with barber who was yelling at him to wait the motor sputtered caught again and then jessup was gone hell kill him barber exclaimed hes that angry rutledge looked up the street a grocers van was stopped in front of the tea shop its motor running and he sprinted for it barber at his heels rutledge swung himself inside realizing as he did that hed damaged his elbow fighting to hold on to the motorcars door ignoring the pain he began to roll and heard barber swear as he struggled to join him sprawling across the stack of boxes in his way as rutledge reversed the van and started out the london road they could hear the vans owner screaming at them from the tea shop door barber said almost out of breath i dont think hes ever killed anyone jessup but its been a near run thing a time or two i want morrison alive but how did you know a curate by the name of morrison tried to visit young fowler in hospital an alert constable kept a list of all callers they were afraid the killer might come back and he did only no one guessed later he wrote an anonymous note but morrison was here wasnt he no he accepted st edwards when he learned somehow that fowler was going to be sent to rivers edge hes cagey about the time he arrived in essex but ill have london document the date and his background now that we know where to look why did he kill the others morrison had killed the fowlers out of jealousy but when justin survived and came to rivers edge to live with a new family it must have seemed doubly unfair two families when he had none he made certain that mrs russell died first a warning to fowler that he would be next and when russell finally came back to rivers edge another opportunity presented itself the man was clever enough to be patient hed got away with murder before and he intended to get away with it again lookjessup is just turning into the rectory drive were in time but morrison saw the motorcar came to the cottage door and then frowned when he realized that jessup was driving whats happened he called wheres rutledge he turned to stare at the van barreling toward them jessup was out the motorcar door and rutledge saw that he had the heavy torch that lived under the passenger seat rutledge brought the van to a skidding stop and raced to intercept jessup morrison looking from one to the other as rutledge used his shoulder to slam into the older man took himself inside the rectory slamming the door shut with a roar of rage jessup recovered his balance and ran the short distance to the cottage door hitting it with his own shoulder and bursting inside rutledge and barber were just behind him but hed already cornered morrison who was standing with his back to the wall glaring at jessup it was impossible to tell if he was armed or not rutledge prayed all three revolvers were still at rivers edge safe in the gun case whats this all about he demanded looking to rutledge for his answer i thought im arresting you for the murders of justin fowlers parents rutledge broke in putting himself between jessup and morrison hes my prisoner he said turning to jessup you cant touch him and then everything happened at once barber yelled something and then there was a deafening explosion almost in rutledges ear he was momentarily back in the trenches stunned into memory only vaguely aware of jessup swearing and barber racing past him he fought to hold on to the present then morrison fired again and barber was stumbling backward his hands outstretched as if to ward off a blow the third shot meant for rutledge went wild as he shook off the war and grappled with morrison for the revolver morrison fought with all the violence of a cornered animal growling incoherently as rutledge reached out for the weapon it went off again and rutledge heard a window breaking glass raining down on the floor and then he had morrisons wrist driving him back against the wall and battering his arm against the low mantel morrison cried out in pain but held on to the weapon it took all the strength he could muster for rutledge to bring the arm down hard on the oak edge of the mantelpiece expecting to hear it snap instead morrisons fingers flew open as the blow hit a nerve instead and the revolver went thudding to the floor morrison fell back nursing his arm and for good measure rutledge hit him hard on the edge of his jaw the rector slid down the wall unconscious sprawling there in a heap wheeling to examine the injured he heard barber say with an effort see to jessup i think ill make it but his face was already pale with the pain and he was clenching and unclenching a fist jessup was still and rutledge bent over him the shot had struck him in the stomach but as rutledge examined him he said its bad ive seen worse we need to get him to hospital as soon as possible he turned to look at barbers chest wound but it was high enough that he said youre right youll live with care damn good thing he was a poor shot that close by rights we should all be dead a knife is his weapon rutledge said grimly busy doing what he could for both men using whatever linens he could find in the cottage he got barber into the motorcar and the man said what will we do about the van and theres my wife theres no time to worry about it ill deal with it later when i come back to furnham and morrison ill leave him here until i can retrieve him i dont want him in the motorcar jessup was a big man and it was harder to carry him outside but then he opened his eyes appeared to know what rutledge was trying to do and managed to get himself into the seat his face pale and clammy from the cost in pain morrison was only just coming to his senses when rutledge was tying his hands and feet looping the ropes through the pair of open windows and back again standing to one side he regarded his handiwork there was no way for the man to free himself without ripping out the heavy boards that separated the two windows he didnt think jessup and barber together could break them he took up the revolverthere was one shot leftand stowed it in the boot of his motorcar he drove carefully on the rutted road avoiding the deeper holes where he could listening to the grunts of pain from jessup and barber he could still hear the low growl of warning from hamish crowded from his accustomed place rutledge tried to think what he had overlooked and failed shutting out everything except making the best time he could he concentrated on his driving his elbow was hurting like the very devil and every time the wheel shook in his hands over a particularly rough patch he could feel the knifing pain but he shut that out as well there was a casualty ward in tilbury accustomed to dealing with men injured on the docks he walked in and asked a nursing sister for help with two men suffering from gunshot wounds it was an unpleasant reminder of bringing russell to a similar ward in london there would have to be a retraction in the times about that rutledge reminded himself ruefully the newspaper wouldnt care for it but he hoped fowler would see it wherever he was hiding he got the two fishermen inside and a doctor arrived to examine both of them he looked up at rutledge how did this happen apprehending a killer these men were caught in the cross fire wincing he pulled out his identification and showed it to the doctor you did a fair job of bandaging them in the war were you yes the doctor nodded field dressing i recognize it sit down you dont look very good yourself im all right rutledge protested but the doctor wouldnt take no for an answer someone brought him a cup of tea and insisted he drink it then the doctor was back they will survive both men have serious but not lifethreatening injuries we can deal with them any next of kin to notify ill see to it thank you are you hurt the doctor said looking him up and down im all right rutledge said again and the doctor reluctantly let him go but he was stopped once more as he was about to leave the ward a very angry man stood on the threshold asking for the gunshot victims he was inspector hayes of the tilbury constabulary and hed been in the maternity ward with his wife when he heard there had been a shooting it took rutledge another quarter of an hour to pacify him its inspector robinsons case in colchester rutledge said if you disagree take it up with him and as he walked out the door he was fairly certain that hayes would indeed contact robinson once more in his motorcar he cursed hayes for wasting precious time he was fairly sure that morrison would be unable to escape but he felt an urgency he couldnt explain he was already into the turning for furnham and the river hawking when he saw the van coming toward him he didnt know the driver but he recognized the van hed left it sitting outside the rectory someone from the village had found it and he had a sinking feeling that whoever it was had found morrison as well picking up speed driving with attention fueled by the certainty that he was too late he covered the miles as best he could but he could see even before hed reached the rectory that morrison was free his bonds lay scattered across the grass and the cottage was empty when he stepped inside rutledge took the time to search each room as well as the back garden alert for an ambush at any moment where had morrison gone to the village no he couldnt be sure who beside jessup and barber knew the truth the village was for all intents and purposes a trap in the van hamish said as far away as he can go possible very possible still he hadnt been driving and rutledge had a feeling he hadnt chosen to go that far not yet there was unfinished business to attend to first he knew rutledge would be coming back for him and he intended to choose his ground for that encounter rutledge had taken morrisons revolver but there were other guns in the case in the house at rivers edge had the van carried him that far or had he gone by way of a shortcut through the marshes hed said once that he didnt know his way through them but that had been a lie the only way he could have reached rivers edge ahead of major russell was to take an even shorter path retrieving his torch from where jessup had dropped it rutledge went back to his motorcar when he reached rivers edge he left his motorcar by the gates for what he hoped would be the last time and after removing the revolver from the boot and shoving it under his coat he walked up the overgrown drive there were shotguns in the glass case in the study the question was did morrison know where to find the shells ye ken he was in and oot of yon house often enough it wouldna take him verra long to find them and load as carefully as hed trod the dark approaches to no mans land looking for snipers rutledge walked toward the house the sun was bright but not bright enough to penetrate the deeper shadows he moved cautiously watching for movement for the slightest sign that he had been seen there was nothing he could do about the upper windows overlooking the drive and so he ignored them the undergrowth and the untrimmed trees offered more immediate danger the final sprint across the open lawn leading to the main door took him to the shelter of the house and he pressed himself against the warm brick while he caught his breath still no sign of morrison perhaps rutledge thought i was wrong he was in that van out of sight among the crates and boxes but he had to be sure and after two minutes when nothing had happened he quietly moved around the house toward the riverfront and the terrace ducking under windows where a watcher could see him he reached the corner of the house pausing again before leaning forward to peer around the edge he stopped moving back out of sight for down by the water at the landing a launch hed seen before was tied up and swinging gently with the current chapter cynthia farraday had chosen today of all days to return to the house on the river hawking because of the times article because she mourned russell rutledge swore under his breath his eyes scanning the lawns and the edges of the marshes where the hell was she and where was morrison he waited forcing himself to stop and to think his mind was tired hamish hammering at the back of it if hed been wrong about morrison if the man had cut his losses and escaped while he could she was safe enough if hed been right was cynthia farraday already dead shot or stabbed it wouldnt matter if morrison had found her there he would kill her just as hed killed the others rutledge needed to find out before he could know what his options were if morrison was still expecting him the launch was there waiting when it was overor as a last resort if everything went wrong if there was sufficient petrol in it morrison could very easily reach france or farther down the coast past the mouth of the thames and into kent were they inside it was where rutledge would wait in the same circumstances there was no other way into the house without breaking a window or forcing a locked door and alerting his quarry if morrison had found the shotgun shells he could wait in the garden room and control his field of fire the alternative was the firstfloor master bedroom with its long windows looking down to the water giving a wide view of the lawns and the edges of the marsh there was no escape for morrison from either place if he himself could get in the first shot but there was only one cartridge left in the revolver beneath his coat he could feel the rush of adrenaline now as he had on the battlefield as he went over the top knowing what was waiting for him out there knowing what his chances of survival were but until he knew where cynthia farraday was whether she was alive or dead his hands were tied there was nothing for it but to walk out into the open and challenge morrison rutledge had taken the first step out into the open when he heard voices someone had come out onto the terrace he moved swiftly back into the shelter of the house and pressed himself against the wall he could just hear cynthia farraday saying but i dont wish to sit in that chair bring me another she was alive then and being used as a judas goat rutledge waited youll sit where youre told i shant kill you until hes dead or at least i hadnt planned to push me too far and i wont wait he isnt coming you said yourself he had taken those other men to hospital he wont leave until hes certain theyll live those men are his witnesses dont you see hes not the sort to leave a prisoner tied to a post any longer than needful its hot today hell remember i have no water no shade hell arrive at the rectory and discover that ive escaped then hell come here he knows me very well rutledge does but i know him even better hell die to save you wait and see i have only to say show yourself and ill let her live hell step out then and youll walk down to the launch as i told you to do he wont know ive disabled it hell watch you go hell stand there and watch you step into the launch and then ill kill him its quite simple a silence fell then she said you cant watch both of us i can swim i can leap out of the boat and youll never find me in the marshes ill come back for you one day as i did for justin fowler remember that you will never know when my life had taught me patience russell learned that too did you kill mrs russell oh yes i had to be quiet about it so i cut her throat and then tied her to a stone shes still down there on the river bottom as far as i know its important that you understand me wherever you go i shall find you eventually or now it doesnt matter to me when you die ill even let you choose thats very kind of you she said with heavy irony another silence fell it lasted longer this time rutledge weighed the distance and how quickly morrison would react he didnt know how morrison was armed he didnt know whether he had brought out both shotguns or only one far more urgent was the question of what cynthia farraday would do whether he could depend on her to stay out of the way it was just as likely she would try to throw morrison off balance and in that instant put herself directly into his own line of fire there was no way to plan no way to calculate the odds once he stepped out in plain sight there would be chaos with no chance to do anything but try for a kill with the first shot after two years was he still quick enough you canna fash yourself over the lass if morrison brings ye doon she willna live verra long afterward ye canna save her you mustna even consider it not by my shot please god but hamish was right he had to stop morrison any way he could if he wanted to protect cynthia farraday he himself would have to survive bringing out the revolver he checked again to be sure one shot that was all he had then he put it back again one deep breath to steady himself and then he walked out of the shelter at the corner of the house and into the open he heard cynthia farraday gasp and morrison turned to look his way there was no time to think hed been right about that waiting had dulled morrisons wits danger had sharpened his before the shotgun could swing up and be aimed rutledge had retrieved the revolver and fired the upward motion of the shotgun hadnt stopped rutledge had no defense he watched the mans finger close spasmodically on the trigger and prepared to throw himself to one side cynthia farraday had her hands in the air and then he realized in the same instant what she was doing pulling the long pin from her hat she rammed it into morrisons side he didnt cry out but his fingers clenched prematurely and the shotgun went off even as his knees buckled and he went down rutledge could hear the shot raining down somewhere to the left of him but he was already in a dead run toward the terrace morrison had died by the time he got to the man rutledges shot in his heart in some far corner of his mind he could hear cynthia farraday crying and peripherally he could see that her hands had covered her face rutledges shot had been true he wasnt sure how he had managed it there had been no time to take careful aim still hed used his revolver all through the war he had learned to make every shot count he was not proud of the skill pushing the shotgun to one side with his foot he turned to cynthia she pulled her hands down i wanted him to hang she cried staring at rutledge with horrorfilled eyes he murdered my family too why did you kill him he reached out to her but she spun away running down the steps across the lawns to the water she leapt into the launch and when she failed to start it she sat down and stared at him numbly leaving morrison where he lay rutledge walked down to the landing and said let me drive you back to london there are some things you need to know i dont want to hear anything she told him turning her back on him why wont this launch start he told you he disabled it leave it it can be brought in later he squatted on the landing next to the launch listen to me wyatt russell is alive notice of his death was a way of advertising for information to help us find this man she half turned her head and said is it true ill take you to him hes in my flat at present after a moment she said i think youre the cruelest man ive ever known the motorcar is by the gates ill meet you there theres something i must attend to first she wouldnt take his hand stepping out of the launch herself she started toward the house he walked as far as the terrace with her then without speaking she veered to the nearest side of the house and left him to do what he had to do he returned the chairs to the garden room spread a dust cloth over morrisons body and closed the house door taking the shotgun and the revolver with him the drive to london was made in a tense silence there was one stop on the road and that was in tilbury where he spoke again to the doctor in the casualty ward both men are out of danger did you reach mrs barber he had not but his day hadnt ended he also begged the use of the only telephone and put in a call to inspector robinson in colchester he caught the man just leaving for his dinner rutledge said your murderer is lying on a terrace behind rivers edge he gave directions to the house im sorry i had to kill him there was a hostage there was a pause at the other end of the line hes dead you say damn it rutledge i wanted him to stand trial rutledge rang off rubbing his aching elbow leaving the casualty ward he debated telling cynthia farraday the truth about justin fowler and then he decided that it was not his truth to tell fowler had made a life for himself in the north of england he was content he was safe best to leave it that way ye must tell him so that too could be done an unsigned letter to a tobacco shop in chester cynthia farraday looked away as he turned the crank and got in beside her it would be after midnight before he reached furnham again he realized hearing a church clock in the distance striking the hour he hoped to be in time to meet inspector robinson there after speaking to abigail barber as he drove through the familiar outskirts of london cynthia farraday said i have a confession to make go on im listening in the beginning when i believed you were a solicitor for the russell family i liked you very much i told you i wanted to buy rivers edge so that id have an excuse to see you again i was flattered when you tried to follow me to my house i thought it meant you liked me as well instead you dragged me into a murder inquiry you were involved long before i came on the scene he told her did you know he held a knife to my throat when he caught me inside the house i smiled at him when i first saw him in the doorway thinking hed come because he was looking out for rivers edge that he had heard about wyatt and wanted to offer comfort he told me hed hurt his arm and had walked up to the house hoping to find something to use as a sling i could see it for myself it was red bruised and when i turned to look for a strip of cloth he came up behind me and i felt the coldness of metal against my skin i couldnt imagine what he wanted i was afraidbut later he told me hed cut aunt elizabeths throat i had no idea you were coming for him until he took out the shotgun he was the rector id known him for years trusted him and yet he told me he was going to kill me i thought wyatt loved me and yet he burst into my house and shouted at me and even slapped me that was your fault too in the past few hours i have learned to hate you he said his voice tired then why did you stab him with your hat pin to stop him from shooting me as he went down for the same reason i wanted him to hang i wanted him to feel the pain hed made the rest of us feel justin wyatt aunt elizabeth me she took off the hat and tossed it into the back of the motorcar discarding it as she was discarding the truth you showed me how evil people are you showed me how impossible it is to trust anyone ever again you showed me that i cant even trust my own judgment even the war hadnt showed me those things there was nothing he could say and so he drove on to his flat and signaled the nursing sister to allow miss farraday to come inside that done he started for furnham to face another womans anger even though it was not his fault that jessup and barber were shot he had almost reached the corner of his street when he heard someone calling his name turning his head he saw that miss farraday had come out of his flat and was running down the street toward him he waited where he was and as she got closer he could see that she was flushed her eyes bright he took it for anger and he didnt think he could endure another denunciation please im sorryso sorry she said stumbling over her words as she caught the door of the motorcar with one hand i wasit wasyou saved my life and i never even thanked you she broke off bit her lip and walked slowly back toward his flat her head down he watched her until she had stepped inside and closed the door epilogue as he made his way out of london rutledge remembered the boxes that were in his sisters attic he hadnt had an opportunity to tell cynthia farraday about them tomorrow when he took her statement would be soon enough he would have to explain as well that they held what must be the only remaining copy of willets third and last book whether she chose to see that it was sent to france was her decision to make he was of two minds about its publication he stopped briefly in tilbury was told that both patients were resting comfortably and drove on toward the hawking passing the gates of rivers edge he didnt look down the drive he didnt want to see the ghosts that must inhabit it now he didnt believe in ghosts still he did not look for them he wondered if the house would ever be opened again too much had happened there and memory could be an uneasy companion but he rather thought that if cynthia farraday wanted it opened wyatt russell would do that for her after her ordeal today perhaps her love for the marshes was tainted too he didnt want to think about the dead man lying on the terrace that would come later he must come to terms with shooting a man not a german in the war but a murder suspect and he went through those last seconds once more to judge himself there had been only one cartridge left in the revolver hed had to shoot to kill he couldnt be certain of disabling morrison even so he had been lucky that it had hit its mark that didnt make the fact easier to live with in some ways he thought willet and morrison had been alike selfish enough to go after what they wanted with little regard to the consequences in the lives of others willet knew his second and third books would anger everyone in furnham but he had written both of them anyway and at the end of his life had salved his conscience by reporting fowlers death instead of going home and facing his family it would have been easier for him to die alone in paris passing the turning that led to the rectory such as it was and thence to the burnedout shell of the old church he considered morrison the man could have put the education his mother had blackmailed fowler into providing for her son to better use he could even have become a good priest and yet he had hidden behind his calling comforting abigail barber even though he had killed her brother believing the lies hed been told because he wanted to think of himself as the neglected child of a rich man instead of the son of a felon who died in prison ahead lay the lane that led to abigail barbers house she must be frantic with worry but at least he could assure her that her husband and her uncle would live a small victory he accepted it as he turned off the headlamps and prepared his tired mind for the hour ahead hamish said as rutledge left the motorcar and walked toward barbers house ye must put this inquiry aside ye canna hold on to it and rutledge realized that that was precisely what hed done held on seeking absolution he remembered cynthia farradays flushed face as she had thanked him for saving her life that would have to serve he felt a flickering of peace as he knocked lightly on the door and heard anxious footsteps hurrying to answer the summons
