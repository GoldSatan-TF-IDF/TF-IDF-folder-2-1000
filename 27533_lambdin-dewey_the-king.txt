dewey lambdin the kings privateer lewrie i go mount the western winds and cleave the sky then with swift descent to carthage fly there find the trojan chief who wastes his days in slothful riot and inglorious ease bid him with speed the tyrian court forsake with this command the slumbring warrior wake aeneid book iv virgil chapter shortest damned commission in naval history ill be bound alan lewrie commented to his dining companions at glosters hotel and chophouse in piccadilly oh god is he on about that one again the honorable peter rushton one of his old friends from his brief terra at harrow almost gagged give it a rest will you alan theres a good fellow it is a wonder you dont still wear blue exclusively cant dine out on yer little bit o fame forever ye know alan clotworthy chute rushtons constant companion agreed round a bite of steak and sloshed a sip of wine into his mouth to clear his palate to go further bloody wars been over nigh on a year dont ye know youre home well set up got oceans o chink to spend oceans o mutton to bull what man has need of anything more well its not exactly oceans of guineas clotworthy alan pointed out more like a trickle of yellowboys than a proper shower but didnt granny lewrie just finish visiting peter rushton asked id have thought shed have refilled your coffers to overflowing so thats why you two bade me dine with you this evening alan said with a leery expression from the first time hed met them neither rushton nor chute had had two pence to rub together chutes parents had gone smash and only provided him a miserly hundred pounds a year rushtons poppa lord george rushton baron of staughton had scads of loot and rents but limited the honorable peter to a mere thousand guineas a yearit should have been enough for anyone but young peter had always spread himself a bit wider than most and loved the gaming tables a bit too much both of them could be downright abstemious with their own funds but could happily spend some other young fools money in the twinkling of an eye you use me ill as so many bears sir peter shot back as if he had been stung to the uttermost limits of his personal honor but then gave a sardonic bark of amusement the thought had crossed my mind damme if it hadnt alan but well go equal shares on the reckoning tonight so there i believe were flush hey clotworthy flush up to the deckheads as our alan would say clotworthy agreed smacking like a contented porker over some recent change in his fortunes and how was old granny still prosperin nigh onto seventy and spry as a hound alan marveled and none too fond of my living arrangements let me tell you spent most of my time over at their lodgings getting preached at glad my fathers off in the country most of the time too rushton commiserated leastwise theres my younger brother should i have a bad end titles safe lord parents do have such vaunting expectations dont they though wasnt enough i got through harrow and cambridge now he wants me to amount to something i ask you me amount to anything just let me inherit and who were those rustics i saw you with on the strand alan clotworthy teased new companions the cousins damn em alan winced id hoped no one would know me had to take them everywhere see and do everything except anywhere near a good tailor or dressmaker following fashion is sinful extravagance to their lights just about everything back in old wheddon cross is perfection to hear them tell it and everything in london is like a german woodcut engraved hell wheddon cross wherever the devils that clotworthy asked devon near exeter ah damn dreary i should think peter rushton shivered youd think right alan agreed his postwar visit had been the most boresome two weeks of his life the nuttbush cove his granny had married to transfer the lewrie estate to his coverture so his father sir hugo couldnt lay hands on it was a dour old squire not much taken with him from the first no matter his repute as a sailorhero and had made it perfectly clear than alan should harbor no hopes of getting his sinful little paws on a farthing of the new nuttbush estate hed also made it pretty clear that the farther such a rakehell was from his own kith and kin the better no matter what his grandmother wished old granny still dotes on you dont she clotworthy asked further he hasnt turned her off you has he clotworthy was one person alan would never discuss money with hed started out school days a living sponge just borrowing at first but had graduated to a higher calling of criminal endeavor lately aye she slipped me a little on the sly not much mind alan lied actually his grandmother had done him rather proud a purse of bank notes worth an hundred extra pounds above his two hundred a year remittance and shed gone shopping and had outfitted his suite of rooms with a new turkey carpet a handsome wine cabinet and desk and a new set of chairs for his secondhand dining table shed also provided a new lockbox for his chocolate tea sugar and coffee and while strolling with him through one of the academy exhibits at ranelagh gardens had purchased a nautical painting hed taken a fancy to which now hung over his sitting room fireplace mantel ah well clotworthy sighed in slight disappointment knowing he couldnt hit alan up for a loan not right then at any rate alan was surprised clotworthy chute had even agreed to go shares on their supper usually he lived on someone elses dole like a roman client when he wasnt bamboozling some idiot out of some ready pelf must have found a new fool to bilk alan decided they were the most peculiar lot peter clotworthy said laughing so thass tstrand coozin alan alan mimicked go blessus hiss wide ahnt eet however ye geet cross tstreet ere in loonun me dear which caricature set his dining companions off in mirth i tried to take em to my usual haunts but they werent having any of it coffee houses were nests of idleness theyd be happier in a counting house where people do productive work covent garden drury lane i do believe shocked em to their prim souls got an hours rant about sin fornication the low morals of theatre people theyre right on that score thank the lord peter said giggling lords cricquet grounds that was acceptable to em the banks the palace the change youd have thought was westminster abbey alan went on couldnt even get em enthused about a rareeshow suggested watching a hanging thought thatd buck em up but it was no go speaking of actresses and such peter rushton sighed how does a run over to wills coffee house in covent garden sound i feel like putting the leg over some nubile young thing topping idea peter clotworthy said in his best toadying style evidently chute had gulled some other young wastrel earlier and for once had his own cash to go on a high ramble and just who was it this time clotworthy rushton asked him much amused by his schoolmates new trade as a hooray harry one of those captain sharps who could decypher to the penny how much someones inheritance was worth at first sight and could also discern to the shilling just how much of it he could abscond with in his role of guideamanuensis to the pleasures of london life the right honorable mathew jermyn viscount mickleton clotworthy boasted poor little shit twenty years old just down from the country rich as croesus now hes inherited must have led a damned dull life up to now like alans cousins he wants to go everywhere and do everything so far ive shewn him a decent tailor you cant believe how chawbacon he looked when he got down out of his coach had suiting id not give a starving irishman with a tricorne on his head dont ye know haw haw haw that wouldnt be your own tailor would it clotworthy alan asked pouring mem all another glass of burgundy and waving for the wine steward to fetch another bottle made the man an easy three hundred pounds in an afternoon with enough overage to pay my bills off and finagle a new suit for meself out o the bargain clotworthy tittered oh weve had some fine times i tell you the old family equipage just wouldnt do so i steered him to a carriage maker of my acquaintance over to newmarket for four fine horses new hats at locks and a brace for me as well ive got him ensconced in a townhouse of his own in old compton street close to all the action there was an extra two hundred for me on the deal introduced him to all the people who matter dont ye know got him invitations to just about everything whats he worth do you reckon alan asked grinning in spite of himself clotworthy could sell roast pork to muslims and convince them to eat it with avidity there must be fifty thousand pounds a year due the young clown and if i dont end up with ten percent im a barearsed hindoo hell tumble to you sooner or later you know alan said aye but by then ill have got mine so what care i clotworthy boasted ah another bottle just in time too peter you must meet him he knows nothin about cards you could skin him for a few hundred to tide you over i should think and you as well alan you cut a dashing figure about town lewrie preened a little at that remark poor as his purse was he had his stolen guineas from the french war commissary ship ephegenie to call upon plus his two hundred pounds a year and what the navy laughingly called halfpay which with the various deductions came to a miserly eleven pence a day but he could still afford to wear the outer attributes of a stylish young gentleman about town with the best of them styles had changed drastically since hed been dragooned into the navy in cocked hats and tricornes were out widebrimmed lowcrowned farmers styles or narrow upwardly rolled brimmed hats with truncated tapering crowns were in long waistcoats were horribly passe short doublebreasted styles were all the go now sensible shoes with sturdy heels and soles had been replaced by either twotoned high boots or thinsoled slippers little more solid than a ladies dancing shoe no one carried a sword anymore unless out after dark in the worst neighborhoods now one had to sport a cane or walking stick with an intricately carved handle and suits the finery of a long fullskirted coat had been out for some time and those of society with the proper ton now favored those coats drastically cut away from the legs in front alan was sure he looked as acceptable as any other follower of popular fashion it was dangerous in london to look too odd the mob had been known to throw dung at people who looked foreign or too out of style following fashion was cheaper than the cleaning bills think theres a penny in your cully for me as well clotworthy alan smirked you know i dont gamble deep anymore might be some wine and entertainment anyway clotworthy promised his round cherubic face aglow damme alan thought but he looks so innocent butterd not melt in his mouth like peter here you know everyone of note an invitation or twod not go amiss to bedazzle our calfheaded innocent while i skin him damme whod a thought youd end up a swindler clotworthy alan marveled id have put you down for nothing higher than amuser back when we were caterwauling in might as well be a pickpocket or a handkerchief snatcher clotworthy sniffed never steal out of need amusers blow snuff in some cullys eyes beat him up into the bargain and elope with what they can get now a true artist such as i only accept payment for my services thats not true stealing i mean damme alan what goods an education if you cant use it fer yer own improvement and since you did so poorly in school rushton supplied waiting for the expected tag line that was almost chutes cri de coeur a mans got to be good at something dont ye know chute bellowed and shook with amusement at his own welltried jape well the last of the last bottle rushton said sharing the last of the wine into their glasses port cheese the houses specialty sherry trifle or should we just pay up and head for the nearest bagnio and get ourselves stuck into some bareback riders i must confess im most pleasantly stuffed alan replied with not an inch more room for dessert or cheese and biscuit too much food stifles the bloods humors clotworthy added burping gently lets pass on dessert and stroll supper off time enough for a cold collation after the whores afraid youll have to roister without me tonight gentlemen alan said waving for the waiter and digging for his purse ah an assignation is it rushton teased digging him in the ribs who is it tonight then lady cantner or the lovely and soedible dolly fenton now that would be telling alan grinned with an air of mystery besides halfpay and prize money from his naval service he could always count on the generosity of women whose husbands or keepers were too busy about their public affairs to pay proper suit to their private amours tonight it was to be dolly fenton who had been his mistress at antigua for a few delicious weeks after hed gone into the shrike brig shed gone back to england on the packet once his ship had been transferred to the jamaica squadron but she was still half in love with him even if she had gained herself a wealthy city magistrate as a patron and lover the man had to spend time with his wife and family which left dolly bored and lonely she was to come to his lodgings for a few hours of bliss and he was going to be a trifle late if he didnt stir his young arse up and hurry home dolly was a few years older than he but that hadnt been a detriment so far alan had solved her financial difficulties after her husband left her a penniless widow on antigua by the simple expedient of pointing out to her that instead of whoring of even the most genteel sort she could sell the late captain fentons commission in the army to a richer junior officer of his unit who wished to buy his way up in rank tomorrow though he would have to devote all his time to lady delia cantner when alan had been a midshipman aboard the small dispatch schooner parrot in she and her husband had been their passengers in the midst of an outbreak of yellow fever among the crew alans insubordinate actions had burned a french privateer to the waterline a ship that had appeared like the last act of a capricious god to torment them in their already dire peril lady delia was years younger than her husband the ancient squintapipes lord cantner who was most conveniently crossing over to holland to transact some business and would be gone for some time where dolly fenton was greeneyed and blessed with hair the color of polished mahoghany with a slim young body lady delia was dark like a spanish countess black hair smoky brown eyes with a lazy sensuous cast and a bountifully soft and round form with the biggest bouncers alan had ever doted upon he would be hard put to choose exactly which of the pair hed prefer if he had to give one of them up and with two such lovelies in his life both so eager to be rogered to panting ruin as often as possible the idea of going on a rut among the drabs was less than appetizing at least with dolly and lady delia he didnt have to worry much anyway about catching the pox and suffering the dubious and painful mercury cure they paid their reckoning gathered up their hats and cloaks and headed out into a bitter night sleet was falling the streets and walks were already glazed with a rime of slush halffrozen into ice and a brisk norwesterly wind would harden that into a proper snowfall before dawn nasty bloody weather clotworthy grumbled from the depths of his threetiered capecollared overcoat whod be a sailor on such a night alan sighed wishing just once more for the sort of balmy warmth hed experienced in the west indies and shrugging deeper into his dark blue grogram watchcoat part of his uniform hed never expected to use damn your invigorating stroll clotworthy rushton said lets whistle up a coach here comes one now a coach and four was indeed trotting up to the doorway of glosters the horses hooves splashing and skidding a little in the muddy slush of the roadway a postillion boy muffled to the eyebrows in yards of scarves jumped down and opened the door to hand out the occupants as clotworthy arranged a fare for drury lane there was something familiar about the bleak almost harshfaced young man who was alighting from the equipage snapping hazel eyes ashblonde hair and a certain stiff almost military manner in which he carried himself alans face split in a grin of recognition and when the second young man with the same features alit he stepped forward and extended his mittened hand in greetings governour chiswick is that you alan demanded what the devil alan lewrie the elder chiswick brother boomed out loud enough to startle the horses give ye joy sir caroline mother see whos come to meet us chapter i declare mister lewrie london must be the worlds largest little city mrs chiswick stated over supper once we left charleston and sailed for home we lost all track of you and then up you pop like a jackinthebox alan had debated whether to beg off and run home to his set of rooms to dolly or stay and catch up on old times with the chiswicks whom he hadnt seen since yorktown and the evacuation of wilmington north carolina it was caroline chiswick who decided the matter for him she had blossomed from a gawky and almost painfully thin young girl of eighteen to a lovely young lady of twentyone his own age she was still slimmer than fashion dictated and was taller or gawkier than most men preferred at a bare two inches less than alans five foot nine but the hazel eyes of the chiswicks were like amber flames into which he was drawn with the certainty of a besotted moth her light brown hair glittered in the candlelight as though scattered with diamonds and her delectable mouth beamed the fondest of smiles at him from the moment he had helped hand her out of the coach the cheekbones were high still the face slim and tapering to a fine chin her eyes still crinkled at the corners and formed little folds of flesh below the sockets of a most merry and approving cast as they had that last day on deck when she and her parents had been sent ashore at charleston the way she laid her gloved hand on his coat sleeve and gave it a squeeze and the pleading wistful way she had gazed at him as she had said oh please sup with us do alan had knocked all thoughts of dolly fenton from his head alan had had to introduce peter rushton and clotworthy chute to them and when clotworthy had learned they were in london to seek out some position for the younger brother burgess it was all alan could do to drive chute away from the possibility of a few hundred pounds thankfully the weather had driven his friends into the relative warmth of the carriage and the chiswicks into glosters before cfotworthy could offer his good offices and connections with the influential of the town on their behalf you cant imagine what a pleasant surprise it was for me as well mistress chiswick alan replied in turn last i heard of your family you were considering taking passage for eleuthera in the bahamas to try your hand at fanning there lands too dear in the bahamas governour stated for cotton or sugar you need slaves and slaves cost too much so we didnt have the wherewithal to start over out there theres been some talk of a compensation treaty so the rebels may someday make restitution to all the loyalists who had to flee but id not hold my breath waiting for a penny on the pound of all that we lost were in surrey near guildford with our uncle phineas now burgess chiswick the younger brother stated cattle sheep and oats some barley and hops too you must try our beer and ale itll never be like the carolinas never be like our own place not really but he shared a glance with his mother shrugged and shut up govemour manages the estate for uncle phineas caroline said to fill the awkward gap he was most kind to help us with our passage and to give us a place to live and although it is nowhere near as grand as our former home and acres it is a solid enough croft aye it is the mother agreed firmly weve a roof over our heads a tenancy with enough acreage for a good homefarm rentfree may i remind you burge tis more than we could have hoped for and a deal greater than most could ever dream of in these unsettled times and mister chiswick alan inquired he is well the last time alan had seen their father in wilmington hed been daft as bats improved most remarkably sir burgess was happy to relate he does for our acres wonderfully well twas amazing what a piece of land and herds did to inspirit him after all those trying months indeed you would not know him now alan caroline chorused his feebleness had been embarrassing to her now hes ruddy and hale out in all weathers with the flocks and herds like a man half his rightful age dealing with the crofters and the lesser tenants and a tenant himself after all these years alan thought glumly no matter theyve food in their bellies and a dry hearth it must still be a mortifying comedown from being tidewater planters along the lower cape fear id think thered be work enough burgess or do sheep put you off your dinner alan teased god i hate the bloody things burgess burst out which set them all laughing and well i dont know if you have any interest in things agricultural alan but what with enclosure acts being passed every session and with the changeover of crops theres little to do the poorer crofters have been run off the common lands and gone to the cities and mills for work and theres no need for a large tenantry no permanent laborers anymore which leaves little for me to do either he concluded with a wry shrug we were hopeful of an army career for burgess here governour said as their food arrived uncle phineas cant extend his generosity so far as to buy burgess a set of colors but we both know hes an experienced officer he made lieutenant with our regiment of volunteers before the war ended from the tone of governours voice when speaking of generosity from their blood relation it was a slim sort of beneficence and most like as cold as charity it would cost this uncle phineas nigh on four hundred pounds to settle burgess as an ensign in even a poor regiment and that with no support to maintain himself in the mess later either if the man was as miserly as governour hinted he didnt sound like the sort whod spend money just to get young burgess out from under foot not unless there was a satisfactory return on his investment if not a regiment burgess had a decent education alan caroline told him drawing his attention most willingly back to her there must be something clerical for him to do he knows lumber from our mill before the war horses trade ive come to learn its not socially acceptable to admit to a career in trade here in london but there surely is something he could do to earn his way in life law parliament the church military service banking or such careers were for the upper crust alan knew burgess was too old at twentyone to be prenticed out to learn a trade and it sounded as if farming was out too what little was left for him that this spectacular specimen of mankind would grub away his days in some counting house clerking and writing for a bank or mill owner it was a ghastly thought and with the country inundated with veterans returned from the war jobs were scarce as hens teeth already with a hundred queuing for every opening and a thousand more tramping the roads from one rumor of employment to the next bow street runners alan spoke up with sudden inspiration you know that fielding fellows watch service replacing the parish charlies with a police force its a bloo a devilish unenglish idea if you ask me having a police force like the frogs over in paris do might as well declare martial law and have done but theyd look kindly on a well setup young fellow with military experience ive read he hires exservicemen sergeants and corporals mostly good men handy with a staff who can take care of themselves surely theyd need someone like you burgess you could show em what red indians fight like its a good idea burge governour opined heartily not too much different from the army i suppose get in on the ground floor so to speak and with your education and your skills youd move right up quickly aye its a thought burgess piped back but alan could see even if the others didnt that his heart wasnt exactly in it from their time at yorktown besieged by the rebels and the french and in their daring escape after being blown downriver in those damned barges the night before the surrender alan was pretty sure being a constable of the watch was not the career burgess chiswick would care for he was a strange young fellow so woodscrafty so in control of his troops by an almost natural sense of superiority yet down in his depths alan had always caught an inkling of fear of uncertainty god knew alan had seen enough war to make his own knees knock every time he heard a cannon go off and he still couldnt quite credit the navy with making him a commission officer and giving him command of a ship of war even one so small as shrike in the closing weeks of the warhe of all people by god knew uncertainty like a close relation but with burgess he felt a softness a nature too soft for the slings and arrows of life like setting foxes to outfight hounds and yet the ember of ambition burned within his breast the wish to do great things perhaps beyond his measure who knows burgess went on between bites of his fish course theres always the sea like you or the east indies ive heard officers with john company come home at least a chickennabob fifty thousand pounds in diamonds and rubiesd suit me right down to my toes i pray not burge caroline said frowning so far away so harsh and hot why they die like flies among the hindoos do they not alan so ive read caroline alan replied and was rewarded with another of those deep gazes and a slight touch of her hand on his in thankfulness for backing her words a touch that struck a spark between them as remarkable as their first timid kiss on the desperate frigates midnight quarterdeck two years and more before whyd i act so missish with her before alan wondered i even entertained a thought of marrying her even if she was poor as a churchmouse course that was back when i still had hopes of lucy beauman and her daddys guineas any other girl id have bulled her aft by the taffrail and damned anyone in the watch whod interfere governour or burgess would have called me out and skewered me for it though maybe thats why i didnt maybe thats why it would be a capital way to renew the family fortunes burgess insisted to get on with john company even as a clerk to some trading house out there would put me in the way of money beyond measure and it wouldnt be but for a few years your friend mister chute intimated he had influence alan governour said perhaps he could suggest something id not trust him any farther than i could spit governour alan replied i knew him at harrow before i was expelled he still owes me half a crown for tatties and gravy after all these years and devil a hope i have of ever being repaid he makes a career of making efforts on peoples behalf but he charges a pretty penny for it ah that kind governour scowled again and i thought after mister richardsons novels about such doings theyd be a law to stop such as he mrs chiswick all but cried in alarm harrow though a good school for all ive heard tell and what did you do to get yourself expelled alan tried to blow up the governors coachhouse and his privy alan was forced to admit come to think on it clotworthy chute and peter rushton were both in on it with me and left me holding the bag or the wick in this case the food had been swill the new governor of the school had strict ideas about discipline and most schools were run by terror anyway with the students ready to riot at any provocation just before term ended when parents came to fetch their children and saw the one instance of decent victuals put on for their benefit and not to be seen again they had decided to do something grand a small keg of gunpowder had been procured with a length of slowmatch it had been only extreme bad luck that the governor had been on his way to the privy behind the stables when the charge went off the intent had been to destroy the mans splendid coach and let him know how reviled he was among the students but the measure of powder was a lot more than it ought to have been alan had lit the slowmatch and run back away from the stables and coachhouse what he thought was a safe distance to watch the show and clotworthy peter rushton and a couple of other young scamps had hidden in the box hedges tittering with anticipation the roof had been blown off the doors and windows disappeared in a whoof of flame and smoke and the carriages inside had certainly been turned into heat and light but the horses had panicked and broke free from the stalls and ran all over the county as the barn caught fire everyone had run for his life and alan had had the misfortune to choose the wrong direction had not thought to put down his portfire and had collided headlong with the governor ramming his head right into the mans stout stomach and nightshirt which abrupt collision had addled both of them and alan was last to his feet with the incriminating evidence by his side i could have tattled on the others but i didnt alan said in conclusion of his tale and he still wont pay me for those tatties or the beating i got either were i your father id have tanned your bottom sir mrs chiswick declared swooning with laughter with the rest no wonder a career at sea where you could indulge your passion for explosives resulted oh what a scamp you were sir and still is ill be bound caroline added fondly i can see where your sense of adventure comes from alan and where is your father now alan governour asked in london as well last i heard from him alan lied smoothly he went to portugal something about the wine trade i believe such as getting closer to the source of his sherry alan told himself hoping they wouldnt pursue the topic any further by the time hed brought shrike back to pay her and her crew off at deptford hard his solicitor mr matthew mountjoy who had been pursuing a suit against sir hugo had told him hed fled to the continent leaving a host of creditors behind and was rumored to be living in lisbon where even the impoverished could scrape by as long as one did not upset the church authorities and the inquisition by ones behavior even so he must indeed be proud of you sir mrs chiswick continued to become a sea officer in only three years well there was the war maam they were pretty desperate you know alan chuckled in mock deprecation yes tell us what you did after we lost track of you alan caroline urged totally ignoring her portion of dover sole and wine urn battle of st kitts under hood and then our ship desperate fought a french twentyeightgunned frigate and took her as prize the same day alan said sounding as if it was nothing much to take note of but secretly glad to have a chance to boast hed had few enough in the last monthshalf of london had tales of battle and bravery and the populace was heartily sick of hearing them by then passed the examination board right after and was made first lieutenant into the shrike brig made a nuisance of ourselves along the cuban coasts took a fair amount of prizes ran guns to the creek and seminolee indians ended up anhissi to the white clan the devil you say governour burst out of their fire ey took a foreign office party up the ochlockonee and the chatahootchee to get the indians to side with us against spain if we landed troops but nothing came of it alan said frowning between sips of wine got ambushed by the coastal apalachee had an exciting hour or so til the seminolee showed up and rescued us then we got stuck in at turks island in the bahamas to retake it from the french that didnt work either my captain was wounded pretty sore and hood gave me command temporarily really the war ended two weeks later and we brought her home to pay off with the first batch of ships you actually commanded a ship caroline exclaimed alan i cannot imagine you remember mother how masterful he was how nautical the morning we sailed down the cape fear quartermaster half a point toto whatyoumaycallithelm up and hands to the braces lord alan i knew you were a competent sailor even then as a masters mate but to run a ship of your own well for the shortest commission in naval history i expect he replied almost glowing inside on the warmth of their regard but i also expect governour and burgess have more interesting adventures and im dying to hear them allow me to sport us all to another brace of this rather good wine and tell it all to me he stayed long past his intended departure time partly because the chiswick brothers indeed had exciting tales to relate of how they had used the remnants of their north carolina loyalist rifle battalion alongside depot troops and recovered sick from simcoes queens rangers around new york for a few months as scouts and raiders to keep the rebels on the hop then had been transshipped to charleston to defend the approaches to the city from rebel probes partly because he was with caroline chiswick who had been beautiful before but was now so incredibly deliriously handsome and you stay in london how long alan asked as they stood on the icy street once more whistling up another coach to take them back to their lodgings we may spend two weeks at the outside governour informed him there probably wasnt money enough to allow them to rent rooms and buy food for longer burgess would have to be settled in that time or he would have to return to guildford and take what little the countryside had to offer we must see each other again sir caroline insisted from the frame of the same dark red velvet hooded traveling coat shed worn in wilmington in it was a little shiny in places from too much wear but still presentable enough and it made alan feel an urge to buy her a new one a cloak fine enough to suit her and what he felt she deserved from life call on us do mister lewrie mrs chiswick agreed we lodge in st clements street oh dear i forget the house number but its a decent enough house im told governour knows it panton street for me alan said id never be able to afford it but for admiral sir onsley matthews and his wife you remember i wrote of them caroline he and governour exchanged addresses while burgess managed to flag down a coach one of the few that would still risk horses on the streets that were now icing over under the constant drizzle of sleet caroline and her mother huddled for warmth to one side by the door goodnight and thank you for the wine alan do call on us aye i shall alan told mrs chiswick again then turning to caroline said we have so much to catch up on which sentiment caroline agreed with heartily and gave him a last smile of invitation and a firm nod of her head as they said their goodnights as well then the coach trundled off leaving lewrie to trot home on his own swaddled up in the voluminous dark blue watchcoat hed never thought hed find a use for back in the west indies his lodgings were one pairofstairs up from the main floor in the front of the house once a substantial mansion lady maude matthews had turned it into sets of rooms to let for a very decent fifty guineas a year about half what lewrie suspected it was really worth he got a sitting room with fireplace and mantel and two whole windowsthe window tax be damnedthat overlooked panton street a fashionable address for foreigners secretaries and underministers to overseas embassies wellheeled younger blades such as himself home too to a regiment of mistresses the set of rooms bent in an l with a bedchamber to the rear along the outer wall and from a tiny window in that room he could look down upon oxenden street and farther down to the haymarket and st james market it was inclined to be a trifle noisy in the mornings but hed learned by then to sleep through almost any din as long as he wasnt at sea civilian noises and alarums meant nothing to a weary sailor whod developed the habit of trotting or crawling up his own stairs at first sparrowfart every morning and caulking like a sodden log until noon he stepped into the sitting room where a small seacoal fire burned in the grate and the embers and flames were reflected into the room by a brass backplate it was the only light in the room until his manservant cony woke up at his entrance and used a paper spill to light him a candle or two mistress fenton still here cony alan asked as he shrugged off his watchcoat and went to thaw out before the fire no she aint sir cony was forced to admit she did come but when the church bells went ten o the clock she went on ome sir cony shyly handed alan a folded and waxsealed letter that had been waiting on the silver tray by the door she lef ya this sir cony told him i spect youd be wantin a brandyr somethin warmin sir aye thankee cony id admire that alan said drawing a wellpreserved william and mary chair hed found at a secondhand shop closer to the fire to read it alan lewrie had gotten too many notes or letters from women to imagine that it was good news which explained his waiting until he had a brandy in hand and one sip in his belly for fortification before he broke the seal and unfolded it ah he said after a first quick perusal cony was thankfully busy in the other room putting a warming pan into his bed and building up the fire in the second fireplace so lewrie could retire and undress without turning blue from exposure if it had tears splashed on it it couldnt be more plaintive this wasnt the first time alan had so shamefully ignored her he read and he had to admit dolly was right there were so many other things to do in a city as great as london so many interesting people to hear speak edifying exhibits to visit theatres dramas and comedies to gawk at oranges to be bought and hurled at poor players so many young women to bull she is getting a little long in tooth alan told himself his putative mistress was getting on for thirty there were the first hints of wrinkles around her mouth kissable as it was the first crows feet around her peculiarly dark green eyes bright as they were still or perhaps it was because she was available for his pleasure so little of the time in the beginning when hed run into her at a supper dance back in the summer it had been intriguing to have her again to pick up where theyd left off on antigua and having her free with another man to pay her keep and enjoying her between the magistrates visits with one ear to the hallway and the latch was exciting too just as well alan decided come to think on it i was getting a trifle bored with her yew say somethin sir cony asked from the other room just maundering cony pay me no mind alan called back aye sir dolly had been so grateful for his assistance and his money which kept her during the war shed made a real shore home for him an activity he strongly suspected shed want to do again if he had enough money to support her as he once had dolly fenton was at the upper end of marriageable age and her magistrate wasnt doing her much good in that regard only the most fascinating widows ever got a second man to take them on he knew the best dolly could hope for was someone incredibly rich to keep her on the side as her magistrate did someone titled who could keep a mistress openly care for her all his life and leave her well provided for when he turned up his toes damn hard lot for most women alan thought folding the letter up with a sense of finality wonder what caroline chiswicks lots to be american loyalist not a hundred pounds for her dot if she did marry country girl even lovely as she is service with some family around guildford married to some pinchbeck countryharry and up to her ankles in dirty children and sheep the rest of her life god what a thought he shivered with more than cold that be all sir cony asked aye cony you go caulk tomorrows me day off sir cony reminded him if theres anythin youd be awantin afore i go in the mornin sir hmm alan pondered tossing dolly fenton and her letter on the coals ill have a couple of letters for you to run about the town one to st clements street to the chiswicks the chiswick brothers ere in london sir cony brightened and the mother and mistress caroline too you tell em i sent you and i expect youd want to visit them as well after all we went through during the siege thatd be wondrous fine sir i liked the chiswicks and therell probably be a dram or two in it for you and some of the mothers ginger snaps ill leave the letters on the tray by the door alan promised tell one of the housemaids to do for me so you can depart early as you like aye thankee sir and i expect youd be needing some cash hey alan teased his longtime hammockman wardroom and cabin servant cant make a grand show with the young ladies without a shilling or two he dug out his purse and gave cony his four shillings thankee sir thankee right kindly sir cony said pocketing the coins and almost skipping down the hall to his own bed belowstairs with his weeks wages ready to burn a hole in him damme alan spoke to himself aloud a habit hed developed in those few weeks hed inhabited the captains great cabins aft in shrike i dont believe ive been home this early in weeks and by myself at that what a novelty it is he trailed into the bedchamber and shucked his street clothes for a silk nightshirt and a dressing gown thick and heavy enough to serve as a horse blanket sleet rapped on the panes and the glass was frosted almost opaque as a muscovyglass lantern on the windows alan surveyed his little kingdom the first home of his own he had ever had that the navy or his father hadnt provided hed had it repainted a cheery pale yellow before he moved in with snowywhite wood work the mantel and hearth were milkveined grey marblethe genuine article instead of some painted slate most builders tried to foist off on the unsuspecting there were some nature scenes hanging on the walls the anonymous sort of thing sketched on some aristocrats grand tour of the continent roman ruins greek temples viaducts with tall poplars lining narrow roads almost awash in happy peasantry and wellrendered animals of indeterminate breed cattle mostly there was a copy of some frog artists imaginings of a sultans harem though the women werent as junoesque as the classics depicted them alan suspected the copyist had used some slimmer covent garden whores as models and he wasnt so sure but that the one reclining on the couch in the foreground wasnt change court betty who had been one of the first whores hed ever sprung money for once he saw it being loaded into a cart to be auctioned off with the rest of a households belongings he had to have it besides the painting was so inspiring and a harem had been one of his favorite fantasies since puberty a portrait of his mother elizabeth hung on the inside wall of the sitting room near the door over the sofa his granny had given it to him on his visit to wheddon cross a portrait of himself as a naval lieutenant hung beside it hed had one done for his granny and had thought a second copy could always come in handy as a present for some future amour the furnishings were quite goodhalf london was always selling up and moving to stay a step ahead of creditors or buy their way out of debtors prison so the selection had been quite varied deep blue velvet sprigged with bright vines and flowers covered the sofa and two upholstered highbacked chairs the tables and exposed wood shone with bees wax and lemon oil and no one hardly ever noticed the odd nick or scratch the previous owners had caused and he had the bench before the fire and the two side chairs as well the dining table sideboard and wine cabinet made the far end of the room a cheery cozy place to eat or play cards cards mostly the most fashionable young men dined out at clubs or chophouses sending down to an ordinary for meals if at home and if he did have to entertain and feed guests he could send cony out shopping and trust the kitchen in the basement of the lodging house to come up with something presentable though he did it seldom he could maintain this lifestyle for some time yet if he was careful with his money three hundred pounds a year had been enough to keep a single gentleman in style before the war and with no need for a horse or coach of his own and only the one servant two hundred would do now he could not purchase every book that struck his fancy could not entertain lavishly would have to watch for bargains instead of spending like a lord on the strand oh hed had to buy plates saucers silverware and serving utensils for the first time stock that wine cabinet in his reverie of accounting his possessions he opened it and poured his glass of brandy back up to full yes it could be a good life he decided best hed lost dolly fenton after all shed have turned expensive speaking of dolly he said aloud again with a weary mutter he had notes to write one to dolly a parting shot to salve his ego one to the chiswicks and caroline laying the ground for a proper reunion with her and one to lady delia to let her know she could expect him by early afternoon if the weather would allow chapter mwack a carping little sound half trill in the back of the throat then the rustle of cleverly parted bedcurtains and a heavy weight hitting the mattress down near the foot of the bed mwack again something stalking up the side of the bed to the pillows then a leap from one side to the other that for one moment put all four paws in an area no larger than a pocket watch right in the center of alans belly oh for christs sake he groaned opening one eye he was confronted by a round furry face and two yellow eyes staring back at him somberly from three inches range mwack more petulant louder this time william pitt had his best pout on and what the hell do you want you little bastard william pitt had been the best mouser aboard the shrike brig a ship absolutely infested with the creatureshis former captain lieutenant lilycrop had adored the little beaststhe king ramcat and the one with the worst disposition of any feline even lilycrop had ever met why he at long last took a liking to lewrie who had always thought a cat was better drowned at birth no one could ascertain hed moved into the great cabins once alan had gotten command more than that william pitt had startled the officer initially appointed into shrike at the entry port and sent him crashing back into the longboat to break his unfortunate skull before he could even introduce himself theyd paid off at deptford hard laying shrike up inordinary and sending the crew off to civilian pursuits somehow hed followed alans belongings down the gangplank at the stone pier and into the coach the cat had an open door to depart anytime he felt like it but so far had shown no signs of taking advantage of it other than a stroll out into the backgardens or sunning himself when the miserable london weather allowed there were queens enough in the neighborhood for him to roger when they came into heat and alan grudgingly let the cat be fed in his apartments pitt slept near the hearth either in the belowstairs kitchens where the housemaids and other servants slipped him some tucker on the side or in the bedchamber william pitt wasnt picky nor was he of a disposition that doted on much affection from humans so he could be tolerated most of the time alan put out a hand and rubbed the top of the cats grizzled head pitt allowed himself to be greeted then shook his head vigorously and sank down on his haunches to scratch at his offended ears with a back paw one did not make the mistake of touching pitt more than he liked more than once not if one enjoyed having fingers howd you get in here anyway alan mumbled sliding up to the headboard and plumping up his pile of pillows mornin sir a tentative voice called from beyond the bedcurtains your man cony said to come wake you sir us abigail i am sir an abigail named abigail alan grinned lazily how rare aye im awake thankee abigail alan slid the bedcurtains on the inner side of the room back to let the heat of the fireplace in the room was cold as charity the girl was kneeling down by the grate dropping fresh coal on the embers and stirring them up with a poker hollo youre a new un aint you alan commented started las week sir the girl said turning to give him a grin she was a lovely little thing with newpenny coppery hair and blue eyes not a minute older than fifteen or sixteen he noted your man already done took your letters sir but he says to me on his way out he says im to wake you an ask you for your key sos i can make your tea sir ah right alan said in my waistcoat pocket she passed out of his sight to the foot of the bed and he heard something rustle as she picked up his clothes from the floor where hed dropped them then she came back to the open side of the bed this be it sir she asked him close to he saw that she had a dusting of freckles across the bridge of her saucy upturned little nose aye thats it an whatll you be havin this morning sir tea coffee chocolate she asked do youmake good coffee abigail alan asked her sitting up higher against the pillows i mean really good coffee i reckon i can sir she replied a trifle dubious grind the beans fine as corned gunpowder use a heaping spoonful per cup mind dont scrimp alan instructed water hot as the hinges of hell none of this tepid water and let it steep and drip until all the waters gone down into the pot or the cup aye sir ill do it shelp me though i know nothin bout gunpowder sir she promised earnestly toast too sir or dyou want me t go out an get some rolls for you what sort of a day is it abigail alan asked tis that cold sir twould make a stone cupid shiver she informed him snow up t the bottom steps already an ice under an more comin down sir like theres no tomorrow toast then from the kitchens no sense slipping and breaking your pretty young pate for my pleasure alan said grinning first i need a kettle of hot water for shaving and then the breakfast ill do her sir abigail said as she curtsied her way out alan steeled himself then slid out of bed and toewalked to his stockings and slippers on the icy cold floorboards he stripped off his nightshirt and bundled it into the armoire donned a clean pair of white canvas sloptrousers from his seachest and the heavy dressing gown he went to the living room window and rubbed the glass clear of fog and frost on the inside to look out the semitranslucent view he had of the street reminded him more of the arctic wastes hed seen north of halifax and louisburg than london the girl had stoked up the sitting room fire as well so he sat close to it as he waited for his shaving water abigail was back with a large copper kettle using a thick rag and both hands to hold it away from her so she wouldnt sear herself on it your man cony says t me he says sir that you likes plenty o hot water o the mornins so i brought ya a full gallon measure topping alan cried in appreciation washhandstands in the bedchamber lay me out a fresh towel and ill attend to my shaving things abigail here let me take it it looks heavy yessir it is sir but i can manage sir no bother she poured the bowl full set the kettle down by the hearth and handed him a towel on the way out alan hummed to himself as he unrolled his housewife and stropped his razor it wasnt too long before hed not had to shave every morning and that only for sunday divisions aboard ship at that but delia cantner appreciated the lack of stubble to irritate her more private parts if he was to keep his tryst with her that afternoon he wanted to please once shaved he fetched out a washcloth and began to sponge himself down from neck to ankles with hot water and a precious bar of scented italian soap a present from lady delia one of many shed given him over the last few months to do so he had to drop his sloptrousers ohpe came a small gasp from the door to the sitting room the young maid abigail had come back with his coffee and toast and was standing in the doorway with the tray in her hands ready to drop it in shock at seeing him standing there with his robe open and his trousers down around his ankles before he could say a word in explanation she was gone and he could hear the tray and the items on it rattling as she set it down on the table and began to lay them out alan grinned to himself finished swabbing himself dry and belted the robe about himself again neglecting the sloptrousers ah hot as the very devil alan said after his first sip abigail you simply dont know how bad coffee usually is here in london tepid muck too weakly brewed looks about the color of china tea worst excuse for a beverage ive ever seen the girl was blushing a furious red from her startled embarrassment still and only nodded and avoided his eyes as she finished bustling about with his breakfast things her hands trembling a little they brew it much stronger and thicker in the west indies alan went on the way im used to it this is good very good you could show my man cony a thing or two im certain thankee sir she replied losing her shocked color at last im that glad you likes it jam for your toast sir black currants the only sort we had belowstairs this mornin sir or i could fetch you up some treacle no this black currantll do right nice thankee anyway abigail alan replied the girl had looked so abashed a moment before he suspected shed drop dead of apoplexy but now she was grinning again in her shy little way eager to please with an errand care for some toast abigail ah i couldnt go she blushed again ive had me breakfast hours ago sir an theres so much work to be doin do you work for another of the lodgers or for the housekeeper hmm alan asked to keep her in the room she was incredibly pretty in her own way and how much work is there really fuss and clean the lodgings after the occupants are off at work upstairs maid or maidofallwork are you maidofallwork sir she admitted an i does for that mistress harper on the third floor too but its little enough there is to do for her her bein out on the town so much you know an she with her own maid already a bell tinkled downstairs and the girl was off like a hare suspending any further conversation alan smeared butter and jam on his toast spooned sugar into his coffee and began to munch missing his newspaper usually he arose late as he had that morning had his sparse breakfast and hit the streets making for a coffee house where he could borrow the house paper and converse with others of his sort he could not remember the last time hed stayed in his lodgings this late in the day with nothing to do long after all the others had departed for their daily chores or rounds of visits there was a rap on the outer door and abigail was back once more wiping her hands on her apron so as not to soil the letter she bore in her hands iss note come for you sir she squeaked in awe of the crest and the quality of the paper and the liberality with which it had been sealed in blue wax from a great lord i thinks the footman come in the downstairs parlor grand as a lord hisself he did alan opened it and read that due to the weather lady delia cantner would not be receiving that day she wished his company but not at risk to life and limb from the slippery streets nor the risk of sickness at being exposed to such cruel cold besides her previous guests were staying over because they couldnt get home and his presence would not go down all that well tears unrequited passion etc ah well alan sighed folding it back up and tossing it aside thinking that hed not had much luck lately in notes from women so much for visiting friends for cards this afternoon he explained lord and lady cantner knew em in the indies saved their lives a few years ago ah did you indeed sir the girl gushed your man cony he told me he says to me how you were a sea officer an how many adventures youve had sir yorktown an red indians too this was before i met cony before i joined the ship he was in oh sit you down ever had coffee abigail lord no sir tis dear stuff for the likes o me back in evesham have a few minutes to spare from your work alan cajoled have a chair pour yourself your first cup of coffee and see if you like it and ill tell you all about how i made the acquaintance of lord and lady cantner well just for a few minutes sir she replied shyly casting a glance toward the hallway door the housekeeper shed turn me out if she thought i was shirkin tell her youre doing my rooms while my man cony is off that i asked you to do it alan coaxed have a slice of toast too undermaids usually were run ragged from sunrise to long after sundown for little more than six pounds a year and not a full day off to themselves and most were halfstarved teens down from the country whose stomachs growled loud as a midshipman on short commons the offer of a second breakfast some quiet time away from the demands of the housework and a tale of derringdo alone with a gentleman were too much temptation she plunked herself down in a chair snatched toast and knife in a twinkling and laid to with a will oh tis bitter she said of the coffee but liked it a lot better with sugar in itanother luxury most servants never tasted except when allowed and for a few blessed minutes she sat on the edge of her chair gasping here and there uttering an occasional my stars or god bless at his saga of desperate danger as though it were a play she was watching from the cheapest seats in the back why sir she exclaimed in a soft voice when his narrative was through i do believe your man cony was right youre a true english naval hero that you are sir if i may be so bold as tsay so youre too kind by half abigail alan replied patting the back of her hand to test the waters if dolly fenton was on the outs with him and delia cantner was saddled with unwanted houseguests the day would not have to be a total loss he decided he admired the way abigails chest had heaved with emotion youd not be knowin it sir she said dropping her voice to almost a whisper once more and averting her eyes but the first time i clapped eyes on you i said t myself i says there goes a fine gentleman so dashin an brave lookin i sort of well talk gets around belowstairs from one servant t the tother and i heard tell you was a sailor back from fightin the kings enemies an all but cony didnt tell me the half of it he didnt she didnt stiffen up as he massaged the back of her hand nor did she quail as he turned it over and held her small workroughened hand in his he pulled her gently to her feet towards him as he pushed back his chair she leaned forward even before he could rise and in a moment she was seated on his lap and he was raining kisses on her slim young neck on her cheeks and their lips met in a first clumsy little maidenly kiss he put a hand to the back of her neck and she opened her mouth to his pressure slipping her arms about him warming to his play quickly too quickly for the shy maiden she seemed lor they warned me bout london they did sir abigail chuckled softly between kisses werent no diffrent man any house a girl could work for in evesham nor birmingham neither at least the men are gentlemen abigail he whispered the games the same city or country i cant afford t lose my position though sir she complained gently as he slid a hand under her skirts and stroked his hand over her warm incredibly soft and slim young thighs ifn i get turned out with no refrence theys not a house in london d hire me cept a bawdyhouse you do for me like you do mistress harper then alan said thrilling to the way she was shifting her slight weight on his lap she gives me two shillings a week abigail suggested coyly ill match it alan promised and on your next day off i promise you a pretty new hat a ride in a coach a grand supper like a real lady sir she sighed parting her thighs so he could stroke her downy groin she leaned hard into him in passion one day a week you can play the lady alan swore too afire at that moment to care as long as we may play you will be careful wont you sir go lock the door he ordered she was too young to need a set of stays and had only thin unsupported linen petticoats on under her sackgown alan had but to unbutton her down the back and gather her dress around her waist and he was rewarded with soft warm tantalizing flesh under his hands and lips smooth young legs wrapped around his hips under his robe as he spread it to cover both of them pert young breasts that stood up proud as islets even flat on her back got t hurry sir before the missus she pointed out as he licked and kissed and stroked her into flames taking time with her mounting need as most would not pretty young houseservants were fair game for the sons the fathers the butlers and footmen too poor to be able to complain they were mostly or too willing for the game to continue as long as they didnt get caught or turned up with a jackinthebox town servants would be turned out come summer anyway to spend several months trying to eke out an existence on what pitiful few pence theyd managed to save until their families returned from summer homes in the country london was full of parttime courtesans willing servants such as abigail some like abigail indeed who were more than willing if they could make some extra money on the side from it get enough to eat for once be rewarded with gifts of nicer clothing than most housekeepers begrudged them it was a quick furtive sport for the most part done at the top of the stairs across an unmade bed in a rarely visited garret storage room fast furious and rapidly over that was what abigail had grown used to not this langorous incredibly sensuous stroking and kissing hands and lips touching her in places she had never known her breath came fast as she swooned with anticipated pleasure with restless want fear of discovery a spur to her abandon he entered her at long last his member sheathed in a sheepgut condom and she bit her lips and turned her face to cry out into the pillows experienced she might be at housegames but still young and snug reminding alan of his temporary wife among the creek indians soft rabbit shed been that hot and moist that firmly gripped around his engine and that wildly exuberant i may be hells own bastard with the women alan told himself as he drove deep into her and reveled in how she heaved her hips in synchronicity with him them that want to play but never let it be said i left the little dears wanting for anything he held off his own explosion as abigail clung to him like a squid buried her face into his neck and squawled and mewed in climax wishing she could scream out loud in ecstasy then she fell away limp and dragged him down atop of her showering his face with weary kisses lor sir youre a terror she shuddered weak as a kitten thankee for takin time an all cant say when i cared so much for it last oooh alan rose up on his hands to loom over her and began to stroke into her once more long and slow delighting in her surprised look dont you be teasin me now sir she whispered beaming an expectant smile up at him from the pillows her red hair had come half unpinned from under her mobcap and she swiped a tress away from her face an did i please you too sir not yet abigail alan grinned punctuating his remark with another deeper and firmer thrust but you will oh darlin she gaped at his meaning lifting her knees once more hurry gallop away fast as you like i oh it feels so good so bloody good an hour later she came back asking if he wanted some more coffee brewed since he could not go out for it that was an excuse for another bout of the blanket hornpipe nothing shy about this time and they were bouncing across the bed and giggling in covert joy almost before she could set the tray down she returned in midafternoon with tea and a cornish meat pasty and had at each other again it was too cold to go out for a meal at a twopenny ordinary she assured him they snatched another fifteen minutes of utter bliss with her sprawled facedown on the side of the high bed and her skirts thrown up over her back it was almost a relief for cony to come back from bis day off and putter around the rooms ranting happily about how grandly hed been received by the chiswicks when he visited them cony was the one to brave the cold and fetch a meal from the handiest ordinary though abigail assisted in laying the table and gave alan a most fetching smile or two while cony had his back turned winds come more souwesterly sir cony opined finally as alan prepared to turn in early that evening snow stopped an hits turnin t rain looks like be thawin tmorro thank the lord filthy streets alan yawned nodding by the fire with his feet up in the second chair and a blanket over his lap while he read a book about the recent war that was as factual as a turkish rug merchant ill try getting out to visit tomorrow set out my boots if you would and give them a daub or two of blacking well coach where were going as well aye sir that be all fer the evening then sir yes you turn in early cony enjoy a yarn or two with the rest for a change thankee right kindly sir that i will goodnight sir all in all a grandly satisfying day lewrie thought smugly as he drowsed by his fire with a book in one hand and a brandy in the other his personal chronometer read eleven the one he had borrowed from a spanish brig off cuba time to turn in he decided there was a soft scratching at the door surely not alan whispered in delight rising to open it abigail slipped in and shut the door softly behind her opening her arms to be enfolded and lifted off her feet her slippers fell off and under her thin flannel bedgown she was as toastywarm as a bed of coals just wanted t stop by an see if you needed anythin more tonight sir she said grinning turn your bed down warm the sheets for you off for the night are we you little minx alan chuckled carrying her toward the bedchamber if you wants i am she suggested bolder with him now i wants alan agreed deed i do chapter so you see sir onsley i thought it best if we came to you for advice regarding burgess future alan told his host admiral sir onsley matthews was all tripes and trullibubs fat as a porker before slaughter when alan had served on his staff at antigua and now hed been retired by a supposedly grateful admiralty had put on enough weight for three allin wrestlers hed never been blessed with the brains god promised a titmouse but he knew just about everybody who counted and even in retirement controlled bags of patronage and interest the lifeblood of a successful career damme mister lewrie but yer concern for the welfare of a colleague does ya credit sir onsley heaved with deep breaths as he lolled in his wing chair one foot up on a hassocka foot wrapped in hot damp cloths to alleviate the agonies of the admirals latest bout of gout and these bona fides mister chiswick sir shew much the same enterprise and pluck as ive come to expect from our alan like bookends you are lads hewn and carved from the same hearty oak youre too kind sir onsley burgess remarked sitting prim and nervous on the edge of his chair by the roaring fire he wore his best pale blue ditto suit with a plain longskirted older waistcoast and clutched a black cocked hat across his knees his own glass of brandy sat untouched on the side table there hadnt been much enthusiasm shown for his efforts to get a position so far and the chiswicks had prevailed upon alan to see if he had any influence with anyone at all a task alan had happily undertaken because it would allow him to see caroline almost every day devil i am young sir devil i am sir onsley maundered i say no moren the plain truth im a plain old tarpaulin hand meself not given to pissin down some younguns back for no cause oh spare us alan almost groaned sir onsleys flagship glatton hadnt stirred from her moorings once in a full three years commission and had been rumored to be hard aground on a reef of beef bones it had been his small ships and tenders to the flag that had done the dirty work against the french spanish and dutch and had reaped sir onsley a princely oneeighth of their prize money which had sent him home rich as croesus to a place on the board of admiralty where hed drowsed the last three years of his career away still he was a useful old stick alan thought and kept his expression respectful and admiring who knows alan might actually have need of his good offices in future slim as that chance might be now there was peace and ninetenths of the navy laid up to rot been to sam hood about this yet mister lewrie not yet sir onsley alan replied i did write to him just a short note no reply so far i doubt he recalls me fond as he might have seemed after turks island im sure he passed it off as one more halfpay officer looking for employment for himself theres devilment afoot still in this world young sirs the old admiral warned them laying a thick beringed finger to the side of his rather large and drinkveined nose losin this wars encouraged the frogs no end their navy showed rather well in the east i know not why the nation feels so secure all i hear up in the house of lords is deficits and bankruptcy handwringin and budgetcuttin meantimes theyre over there on the continent just diggin like the furtive rats they are looking for an openin to throw us over for good and all damme their blood and heroes such as you pair sit on the beach twiddlin your thumbs instead of being allowed a chance to stop their frightful business wherever it emerges alan stifled a yawn covering it with another sip of brandy he paid court to the matthewses at least twice a fortnight when they were in london to keep his low rent on his set of rooms and to lay his ear to the ground for any hint of great affairs that could help him prosper hed heard this screed chapter and verse too many times before to rise to it this time he nodded sagely though which sir onsley took for much the same hearty approval as earlier lewrie theres a nacky one the sort of young feller who knows i speak the truth sir onsley pointed out to burgess by god mister chiswick sir if alanll speak for you thats good enough for me i cant promise you an easy place ill not say more now too many plans afoot at the moment but a place i can promise you and theres my word ont for sure thats marvelous sir onsley burgess gasped this interview had seemed the last slim thread of hope to save him from bringing in the sheaves for his uncle phineas and alan had privately assured him it was bound to be disappointing at the end but suddenly here was this word of assured employment as a serving officer sir pardon me if i inquire at least a little with the east india company sir onsley nodded im on the board im privy to certain nay itll be discovered to you later i should think at least as a lieutenant mister chiswick tell me now and tell me true if youre a mind for it and a heart for it itll be damned hot and dusty duty halfway round the world and like as not itll be sickness bugs and flies and god knows when youll lay eyes on your dear family again in this life but tis a duty like as notll confound our foes better than anything youd accomplish in a lifetime of regular soldierin are you game for it i am indeed sir onsley burgess piped up lead me to it toppinm sir onsley shouted back wincing a little at the end as he moved his gouty foot and suffered a spasm of agony ill speak to the board tomorrow leave me your bona fides and all that to show them irregular skirmisher indian fighter just the sort of lad we need mister lewrie i do believe fate sent you to me with young mister chiswicks plaint at exactly the right time and grateful i am you could do my friend a service sir onsley alan replied flat aback at this energetic development he had not seen the old twit that bombastic or awake in years and alan could hardly wait until they could get back to st clement street to tell the rest of the chiswick family most especially caroline she would be impressed to no end that it was alans influence and connections that had turned the winning trick for her brother it would disappoint her though that he would have to sail around the world into that land of pagan hindoos she had feared so much where burgess would be exposed to so many cruel diseases and chances to die a young untimely death matter of fact alan wondered if hed done burgess much of a favor at all sir onsley was sober enough to not let slip what sort of devilish danger this new duty was but it didnt sound like anything alan would want a part of not if he had at least five minutes warning and a head start some new wrinkle on what lieutenant lilycrop of shrike had termed war on the cheap dreamed up by some crystalball gazer map reader and quillpusher who had no idea about what life was like outside his own doorway much less how deadly it could be for the men on the shitten end of the stick a world away mums the word my lads until you hear from me by letter sir onsley cautioned but stand ready to shift yourselves at a moments notice no man is to hear word of this appointment you have my solemn oath sir onsley burgess promised proudly which oath alan had to chorus as well damme but caroline is going to kill me alan sighed once they were in a hired coach on their way home i had no idea things would turn out like this burgess i shall be forever in your debt alan burgess assured him taking his hand and giving it a hearty squeeze of gratitude he was all but piping his eyes in joy at his sudden salvation from civilian dullness dont fear what caroline thinks well he didnt make it sound like canterbury fair you know god what have i gotten you into if anything happens to you and it sounds hellish like it might ill never forgive myself and neither would your dear sister alan objected youve given me the world alan burgess said with a catch in his voice his face aglow like a martyr promised crucifixion before sunup oh tis fine for governour to farm and pore over the accounts hes set up with a vicars daughter in the county but for me alan you remember when you took me aboard your frigate during the siege as a guest of the wardroom just the smell of a ship foul as they smell alan drolly pointed out the smell of distance burgess waxed lyrical of adventure in faraway places hemp and tar salt and spices peasoup farts and rotting cheese alan said scowling to lay eyes on the east indies to live a life of new things to taste and smell my god how wondrous its going to be burgess went on in his rapture oh itll be hard i know and itll like as not be dangerous but the chance for glory moren most peopled ever suspect you must know im not cut out to be a farmer before the revolution id half a mind to run off and trade with the cherokee over the appalachians to see what there was to see cross mountains and rivers all the way to the other ocean and now youve given me my chance alan ill break free now ill know what you felt as a sailor you do not know how much ive sometimes envied you your life as a sea officer just as long as you do come back a chickennabob alan said realizing there was nothing he could say to dissuade burgess from making a total fool of himself and when you do fetch home all those diamonds and rubies better tote along a small sack for me as well i mean damme whod have thought old sir onsley would have a place for you i warned you going in it was a slim hope a clerking position at best this though well maybe you should think about it id have never forgiven you for certain if that was all i could aspire to burgess cracked thumping him on the knee damme you should be glad for me alan glad as i am well if it pleases you burge theres nothing more i can say alan surrendered how could he tell him he thought the lad was not cut out for desperate doings any more than he was cut out for farming how do you tell a friend you think him too starryeyed to prosper alan lewrie i should despise you caroline hissed at him harshly once the celebration had begun she took him by the hand and led him to sit with her on a ratty older sofa away from the others who were singing and mixing a large bowl of lemons sugar hot water and gin for a gala punch caroline i swear i had no idea he began it was the first time hed ever seen her angry at anything or anyone and it was most disconcerting to be the target of her anger this this hushhush adventure youve gotten poor burge into she whispered no word of what it was no inkling of how much danger therell be none only that hes to keep mum and be ready to be received in a few days one way or another alan told her sadly feeling just a trifle sheepish under her hot glare i was all amort that the old foold offer anything at all much less something like this i tell you truly and burgess didnt have to accept it so quickly either he could have asked for a few days to think it over but no he had to just leap up and go all shinyeyed over it dont take it out on me i beg you caroline i did what governour and your mother bade me i used what influence i could how was i to know itd turn out like this but so far away from us caroline insisted with the chance well never see him again in this life oh i know it isnt your fault alan but you must see how frightened i am for him hes always been so unprepared for how cruel life can be alan whispered back you recognized it too she gasped taking his hand and wringing it like a washcloth pressing his hand to her troubled breast surely unaware in her bereavement of what she was doing god almighty alan thought feeling his innards lurch at the touch of her i could spend the rest of the day like this hell go under sure as fate i know it she said weeping softly its what he wants caroline alan told her better one chance at an adventurous life than drudging on a farm and feeling trapped he told me as much god pity him he envies me all the shit sorry ive been through all the exciting and exotic places ive sailed and he may prosper ive seen others do so in the navy god help me i prospered and i didnt know a futtock shroud from a horses fetlock when i first began but youre the sort of man who does prosper alan she told him lowering her hand and his to her lap before her mother noticed if only i knew there was someone as courageous and steady as you to look after him out there in india or wherever hes going to be me alan tried a smile mine arse on a bandbox im not as steady as you think no one is outside their memoirs well i think you are she whispered so sure and capable as you were when i first met you when you organized us into your ship to escape wilmington momma in her vapors and poor daddy half out of his mind with grief and poor me so weak and helpless i never thought you weak and helpless alan assured her i have always considered you the most resourceful and clever of females caroline that softened her up right smartly say you forgive me please he beseeched oh alan i do forgive you she relented and gave him a wee smile sad and wan though it was hell not have to purchase this commission which shall please uncle phineas if it comes to fruition there is a possibility it may not isnt there theres many a slip twixt the cup and the lip pray god they may choose a more experienced officer in his stead which would crush poor burgess though alan sighed and hed be right back where he started i know you cant stay in london hoping much longer hed be back to counting sheep it would kill him no we cant she agreed i must own to you alan that i hoped you would be here that we might regain our acquaintance your letters meant so much to me your memory oh pray do come to see us down in surrey now that we have had a chance to speak almost daily and to be together like this i remember all over again how much i have delighted in your companionship i would so enjoy you being our guest in the country when the weather is better and we could write each other in the meantimes could we not alan she suggested sweetly nothing would give me greater delight as well caroline he told her ive never known anyone i like talking to more than you come take a cup of cheer you two governour ordered from the far end of the room there was no more privacy for them caroline wiped her face quickly with a handkerchief from her sleeve and put on a happy expression for her family we must dine together tonight mrs chiswick insisted half gone on a large glass of gin punch already itll be sad even so knowing my little burge will be going off among the heathens but well know hes doing something for king and country as he did so nobly during the rebellion she stifled her fearsalmost with your shield or on it like the spartans alan thought grimly why dont they all fall down bawling instead of acting so proud he wondered god knows id be into the sackcloth and ashes by now and our benefactor alan lewrie governour proposed he must be guest of honor tonight they raised their glasses and toasted him making him feel even more a total fool than he had a moment before make no fuss over me alan suggested and i wouldnt feel right anyway spend your time with burgess sir onsley didnt say when the summons would come besides i cannot alan caroline cried in sudden disappointment i have a dinner invitation already that i cannot break he told them setting his glass down but i hope you shall let me treat you to supper another night once weve learned what burgess is down for would you allow that caroline saw him down to the first floor and dismissed the houses servant to help him on with his watchcoat herself tugging his collar snug about him and smoothing the fabric to lie flat i wish you could have stayed alan i begrudge every minute you are away from from our family now were reunited she said with a hitch in her voice i we feel so much gratitude and admiration for you for so many things youve done for us i could not not tonight caroline i fear for him too and i couldnt have sat there with him i understand she replied softly i shall do my weeping in private too she raised her arms and he took her in his arms holding her snug and safe stroking her back as she almost gave way to her emotions whispering there there to comfort her if he was able and secretly enjoying the closeness and the feel of her slimness against him how tiny her waist was how neat her breasts felt how sweet and clean she smelt her hair and her slight hint of hungary water scent caroline peeked over her shoulder to see if any of the servants of the lodging house were about then turned her face up to his and closed her eyes with an offer like that alan could not turn it down he kissed her as gently and as shyly as he had just that once years before her lips parted just a little and her clean breath mingled with his then her eyes flew open and her arms locked behind his neck pulling him down to her and there was nothing shy about it i must ask your forgiveness once more alan muttered shaken to his core by this entrancing creature all over again as she fell away slightly dropped back from tiptoe and leaned back to regard him with such a smile of wonder and delight mine arse on a bandbox alan lewrie she said grinning and then whispered with secret glee between us i pray there shall never be anything to forgive my god he gasped all the english ladies tell me its most improper to be quite as forward as i am she added laughing im but a crude rustic from america dont you know do sup with us tomorrow and the day after and the day after that spend your every waking moment with us with me i would enjoy it so awfully much before were parted again youd be scandalized alan gawped governour would run me through i trust to your gentlemanly nature alan and to your sense of decency what harm to my good name could you ever do me god help the poor mort alan thought if you only knew i had no sense of decency youd run screaming behind your mommas skirts lord knows id think of something sooner or later he admitted at last he tried to pass it off as a jape i would trust to the affection you already show for me she said with such a solemn little face it almost made his ears ring as i trust how admirable i hold you in mine one more quick kiss and then he had to go out into another freezing cold afternoon but warmed right through by her regard and the feel of her lingering upon him damme shes the sweetest dearest young thing he said to himself as he trudged along the street dodging darting youngsters mongers and traders oh if only what christ on a cross lewrie youre cuntstruck next thing you know youll be thinking of asking for her hand and havent i done enough to her family already dear alan lady delia cooed as he entered her morning room and took the preferred hand to kiss she stroked his face with a hothouse rose shed been toying with delighted to see you again milady he told her soberly do be seated and break your fast with me sir she said she turned to her servants and told them they could depart on their errands once the door was shut she was out of her chair in a twinkling into his arms and raining kisses and endearments upon him devil a bite of roll or sip of tea he got until they had fallen into a swoon across her soft bed in the other room strewn their clothing to the winds and slaked their lusts with the frenzy of rutting stoats lewrie lay back on her soft pillows panting and grinning so pleased with the world in general and his lot in it in particular a young girl in love with him hed half a mind merely half a mind so farto pursue with fantasies of wedded bliss tender and succulent young abigail to roger all over his suite whenever he wanted her and lady delia cantner to top the bargain off for as long as his luck was in hed not shed a tear of course if he went down to surrey and pursued caroline he would have to give up all this he pondered as he got his breath back well abigail was merely a convenience nothing more and her delight was in her obvious heroworship and her talented young body shed play the game with another lodger get her couple of shillings for her troubles from another man lady delia though that was fun he had to admit part of it was the covert glee of covering old lord cantners lawful blanket sneaking and taking their pleasure as they just had with the servants out of the way and playing the merry andrew the next moment a devoted family protege when the stupid old coltstooth was around nothing lasting there either ecstatic as it was he knew if he begged off lady delia would have another admirer gnawing on her magnificent breasts as quick as she could change her dress there were legions of them waiting in line for a chance at her affectionate as their relationship was it was not love not the sort of jove that carolines eyes promised and he was getting a little jaded with simple sex alan thought once his grandmother died and he inherited hed have enough to care for the lovely caroline in the manner she deserved i have seen so little of you these past few days my chuck delia crooned sliding a thigh over him those beastly friends of yours have kept you from me i believe you just made up for it mdear alan chuckled not a jot of it she promised and did you secure your friend a place at last that i did alan replied expressing his doubts hed done burgess any favors lady delia had put out some feelers for him as well though with his lordship out of the country there was little direct she could do without his presence so the task is ended she beamed and you may begin to pay attention to me again how delightful its rare enough to have roger out of the house much less over in holland so i may be with my darling lad i thought i would die of happiness to know that wed have so much time free of interferences then the weather and those chiswick people did you miss me alan tell me you did tell me how much you did she teased lazily her long raven hair spilled over his chest and his face her large firm breasts mashed down onto his chest as she rolled astride of him and held herself on knees and palms breathing on his neck and into his ear rocking back and forth from side to side maddeningly better i show you instead alan laughed deep in his throat taking hold of her bouncers and squeezing them kissing her neck in return eliciting her deep groans of impending bliss ummm yess she muttered shaking with husky amusement as well devour me alan ooooh yess ummmm tumescent as a belaying pin he slid back into her for the second time in half an hour and she leaned back and flung her arms to the ceiling to ride st george on his member grinding her hips down against his clasping him with her thighs and moaning with heartfelt abandon as his hands kept possession of her heavy breasts leaning forward into his grasp with her hands clawed into his shoulders and grinning and crying out wincing with each thrust and movement panting and grunting as their pace quickened she looked magnificent perspiration sheened on her body her nipples hard and rasping on his hungry palms her soft thighs clasping and slipping with sweat and her heels under his buttocks to drive him deeper her hair was matted and a stray lock clung to the corner of her crumpled mouth as it hung open hot burning dark eyes glowed down at him urging him on begging him for more well damme a petulant voice interposed sufferin shit alan gasped looking toward the door to espy a very thin reedy lord roger cantner standing in the doorway i think ive been here before alan thought sadly christ this time im going to get my young arse killed my dear lady delia said looking back over her shoulder calm as youd like youre back early how how dare lord cantner sputtered that young swine behind me back you whore surely you must have known roger dear delia replied still astride and making no moves to break away if not about alan then about any of the others she did pull up a sheet to cover herself alan included for which he felt only slightly grateful get the fuck off you cow he screamed mentally let me get on my feet and out of here i need clothing and a head start me own wife lord cantner tried to howl in outrage but it came out little more than a petulant screech in name only roger as we both are well aware a wife may expect conjugal relations now and again delia said smiling wickedly of a successful and pleasing nature nestce pas lord cantner put a hand to the hilt of his smallsword and alan gulped in total fear his suntanned complexion aiming white as delias flesh but lady cantner only chuckled deep in her throat at that threat would you run me through dear roger or alan thats murder you know too public a thing to share with the mob and you might swing for it at tyburn even so alan couldnt credit it under the secrecy of the sheet she was stirring her hips once more as if she wanted to torment the old cuckold into mayhem and god help him what should have shriveled up like a deflated haggis was now hard as a marlinspike inside her god i promise you let me get out of this with a whole skin and ill be good i swear he prayed silently ill marry caroline chiswick ill be monogamous as a bloody swan forevermore or would you rather go to pickering place and duel for your honor my dear delia almost snickered come slap him if you wish ill hold him down for you for gods sake alan finally gave voice you little bastard lord cantner rasped his sour little mouth working around what was left of his teeth should have known when i come in on ye an this bitch aboard that schooner you all snivelin on her tits oh i knew then ye were spoonin her yer creampot love even then one o me own i praised t the skies the hand had however dropped away from the sword hilt and both were wringing themselves in quandary alan felt a moment of hope murder then roger dear delia sniffed at her husbands indecisiveness a challenge to a duel no then please be good enough after me fruitless years we have spent together to go away and make up your mind and leave me to my pleasures lord cantner stamped one of his little feet and gave out with another feeble bleat of displeasure bedamned to ye ye bitch and goddamn yer traitorous blood mister lewrie ill see the both of ye in hell i swear i shall youll pay oh my yes youll pay ill have both yer hearts blood ye see if i dont but amazingly the old man quavered out another unintelligible warning and doddered out the door slamming it behind him well im damned alan gasped going limp as italian pasta against the pillows christ thats torn it hell have me dead he wont dearest delia cooed stirring her hips to revive him as coolly as if one of the servants had dropped off clean towels and departed easy for you to say alan raved after drawing a deep breath alan dont flatter yourself youre not the first delia said giggling weve slept in separate rooms almost from the wedding night and he knows his limitations at his age would he take the risk of dueling my darling lad he shakes too much to hold a pistol and the weight of a sword is quite beyond him for more than a minute hes too stubborn to die and leave me everything and too proud to ask parliament for a bill of divorce hes known about you then how could he play cards with me if he did how could he stand to have me eat his fare what he knows is one thing delia grinned leaning down to him once more what he wants others of his circle to know is quite another they believe him capable in bed and i give no sign hes not i brought enough money to this miserable marriage to walk out anytime i cared to so far i have not my family was rich trade he was respectable aristocracy so we have no heir as of yet before he dies i shall present him with what he wants most had he his wits about him hed have sent word on ahead from dover he was returning i expect the sea voyage upset him poor thing by god youre a cool un alan marveled hed thought hed met some crafty scheming women in his time and had suffered at their hands more than once but hed never seen the like before even mrs betty hillwood back on jamaica hadnt been this icy if he hadnt been addled by mal de men id have known when to receive him back and you would not have been in this predicament wed have been sitting around the card table or truly having breakfast when he arrived she went on hed have known what wed been up to in his absence but hed have been spared the actuality well he wasnt alan said trying to lever her off him so he could get dressed and obey his instincts to take a long vacation in scotland perhaps change his name and herd sheep with the chiswicks down in surrey until lord cantner had the good grace to die and hes seen the actuality you said he has his pride that means hell get even no matter what you think hell do you heard what he said hell hire himself some dockyard toughs to stop my business i give you my best assurances dearest sweetest alan that he shall do no such thing she said laughing hugely amused you dont know what a relief it is to end this pitiful charade at last just like that night he retired early remember oh i surely do and we sat up playing backgammon until he was fast asleep yes it had been one hell of a night sneaking into her chambers trying not to make a sound tumbling onto the carpet before a ruddy fire all the while the old man had snored in the room next door and all night long they had lurched fearful between strokes each time hed coughed muttered or turned over only to begin again she pressed back down on him trying to revive his flagging interest in the proceedings i shall most like have to get out of town for a while alan told her i mean i cant just trail my colors in his face can i oh do spend some time in bath warm spa waters gambling in the long rooms beau nash is dead and its getting more lively now he isnt there to demand decorum delia enthused i could join you there for a couple of weeks if you wish lets not press our luck hmm alan snapped dont rub salt in the wound ill be an old hound too one of these days and id surely kill the first young pup that sniffed around my wife how possessive you suddenly are she pouted darling if we must indeed be parted give me something to

on being wellarmed he thought he had a ferguson rifle from his time with the chiswicks a saddle musketoon his brace of naval pistols and another brace of dragoon pistols his hanger and there was a cutlass around somewhere for cony to wear as well damned right hed go armed he wouldnt put it past lord cantner to raise a battalion of pursuers no matter what delia thought with a hundred guineas for the man who harvested his liver cony went off with a note for the bankers and alan wrested a traveling valise from his armoire and began cramming things into it anyoldhow but he was interrupted by a scratch at the door ah abigail my little chuck he said not pausing in his haste i gotta talk to you sir she said tremulous as the first time hed clapped eyes on her you packin t go somers just for a couple of weeks alan shrugged it off alan she drawled out and he stopped packing long enough to take her in his arms give her a fond kiss and set her down out of the way be back sooner or later well have more fun hey dont know as ill be here when you gets back alan me love oh why well the housekeeperll probly turn me out without no refrence she intoned with a hard gulp did she discover about our little arrangement alan asked abandoning his packing once more howd it happen i think im gonna have a baby alan she managed to say her lower lip quivering and tears starting to flow from her eyes yours well shit what next he sighed and sat down at the table with her as her face screwed up and copious tears bubbled out alan she wailed whas gonna happen t me i cant care for a baby ill be out in the streets an no houseu take me on not with a littlun comin alan you gotta do somethin i knew it was too good to last i knew it i knew it god he thought miserably remember that promise about swans i

rooned alan if you love me in the middle of this while alan was trying to think of some way to escape being bound to the little mort for all eternity there was another scratching at the door wait your bloody turn damn yer eyes alan barked with his best quarterdeck rasp which startled abigail into a fit of hiccups what he demanded flinging the door open lieutenant alan lewrie royal navy the messenger from the admiralty sniffed at his unexpected greeting he took in the bawling girl at the table and gave another audible sniff i am then this is for you sir if you will be so good as to sign here to shew i have delivered it to you i have a stub of pencil sir no need for a pen the old pensioner intoned with all the hauteur of a flag officer i was instructed to await your reply sir alan scribbled off his name and slammed the door in the mans face he broke the blue wax wafer on the parchment and opened it to read it bloody bloody flaming hell he muttered sir our lords commissioners of the admiralty have seen fit to offer you an active commission the exact nature of which we shall be glad to discover to you should you deem yourself able to accept immediate employment you shall be appointed th lt into a ship of the line the gun rd rate telesto now lying inordinary in the port of plymouth for three years commission in foreign waters please communicate to us your availability or state reasons why you cannot fulfill a term of active service pursuant to the customary usages such as loss of halfpay reduction in seniority from the roll of commission sea officers etc yr obdt srvnt phillip stephens sec to admlty god i meant that bit about the swans but this is a trifle extreme dont you think he said to the ceiling wot abigail hiccuped not you look my girl marriage just aint in the cards see alan told her matteroffactly yes im going away ive been ordered to go to sea ill give you some money to take care of you and to see to your lying in thats the best i can do oh my god you heartless bastard she wailed twenty pounds to see you through abigail and another twenty pounds so the babys looked after tell people whatever you like i cant marry you and you know it id make you bloody miserable miserables i am now she spat changing emotions quickly worse most likely he replied trying to gentle her he knelt down next to her and put an arm around her shoulders and held her even as she tried to shrug him off look girl im fond enough of you youre a sweet little chit that you really are theres plenty of homes would like a healthy baby if you dont want to keep him or her youll have about six years wages for food and lodging if you dont squander it on foolishness and there are houses thatll have you ill write you a letter of reference if you want ill say you worked for me blame it blame it on some sailor who took advantage of you on your day off tell the parish you were raped by some sailor you never saw before or since longs you have money to keep yourself and youre not on their poors rate they wont care a whit but you wont marry me she sobbed quieter now and put her arms around him sadly im going to foreign waters abigail three years and more dry your eyes now call me a bastard if you like but ill try to do right by you as much as im able but marry you im sorry he shooed her out scribbled a quick acceptance letter for the admiralty messenger who fled before his old soul was corrupted any more than it most probably was and sat down to relish a huge glass of brandy god knew he needed it about then chapter the more he thought about the arrival of the admiraltys offer of immediate employment the better he was resigned to it a commission in foreign waters far away from lord cantners wrath and any hulking minions he might hire was probably the best thing it also got him out of london out of england so little abigail could not cry belly plea on him before a magistrate if she found his terms of settlement unacceptable once she had a chance to put her little brain to work on them surprisingly cony had seemed suddenly eager to go to sea with him as a seaman and cabinservant as well the matthewses said theyd store his furnishings in the garret of his lodgings on panton street though sir onsley had been mystifying as all hell about why fate had chosen that exact moment to bless him with active service the old admiral had made offers before but nothing had ever come of them and after three years privation in the navy alan was not exactly cherrymerry to go to sea again though he showed game enough when sir onsley talked about the possibility there had come another letter from the admiralty before the week was out though delivered by the same pensioner porter and this one had advised him to travel to plymouth at once in civilian clothes what had been the point of that he speculated at least his route took him through guildford where the chiswicks resided it was the final disappointment to his feelings to learn that they were not at home he sighed heavily left a letter for caroline with their housekeeper and got back on the road i thinks theys a rider comin up ahind of us sir cony warned once leaving guildford they had taken the coast road for plymouth from dorchester to bridport and honiton skirted south of exeter for ashburton across the southern end of the dartmoor forest highwaymen were rife with so many veterans discharged with nothing but their needs but so far they had traveled safely enough in company with other wayfarers ever since leaving their last inn that morning they had seen no one though when they stopped to rest their horses they had thought they could hear one perhaps two riders behind them the wintry air was chill snow lay thin and bedraggled on the muddy ground like a sugar glace on soaked fields rooks cried but did not fly in the fog that had enveloped them it was thinning now not from any wind but from the midmorning sun and sounds carried as they do in a fog easy to hear from afar but without any true sense of which direction they came from they were two men on horseback with a twohorse hired wagon to bear their seachests driven by an ancient waggoner and his helper of about fourteen they had gotten on the road just before dawn and now stood listening about halfway between buckfastleigh and brent hill a lonely place a perfect place for an ambush alan thought he cocked an ear towards the road behind him trying to ignore the creaking of saddle leather and bitt chains ear em sir cony whispered sounds more like two now how far to south brent from here alan asked the carter jus shy of a league sir the grizzled old man replied looking a trifle concerned maght be an ighwayman ye know lonely stretch o road erebouts r could be travlers lahk yselves sir lets be prepared then alan ordered the carter and his boy had bellmouthed fowling pieces under their seat and they took them out and unwrapped the rags from the firelocks alan drew one of his dragoon pistols checked the priming and stuck it into the top of his riding boot that pistols mate went into the waistband of his breeches finally he freed his hanger in its scabbard so it could be drawn easily tis two men sir cony muttered cautiously as two riders hove into sight on the slight rise behind them like specters from the mists they checked for a moment from a fast canter then came on at the same pace stand and meet them here then whoever they are alan ordered he reined his mare out to one side of the wagon while cony wheeled his mount to the other side the old carter kept his fowlingpiece out of sight but stood in the front of the wagon looking backward with one hand on his boys shoulder to steady him but once within musket shot the two riders slowed down to a walk and raised their free hands peaceably alan kept his cautionthey looked like hard men one was stocky and thick tanned dark as a hindoo and sported a long seamans queue at the collar of his muddy traveling cloak the second was a bit more slender a little taller though just as darkly tanned he seemed a little more elegant but it was hard to tell at that moment as he was just as unshaven and mudsplashed as his companion gentlemen peace to you the slender one began halting his animal out of reach of a sword thrust weve heard your cart axle this last hour and rode hard to catch up with you tis a lonely stretch of road and thats no error fog and mist and ill confess a little unnerving to ride alone on a morning such as this alan nodded civilly but gave no reply allow me to name myself the fellow went on andrew ayscough and my man there thats bert hagley on our way to plymouth to take up the kings service you going that way as well sir the road goes to plymouth eventually sir alan replied then for as far as you fare wed be much obliged to ride with you sir ayscough asked if you do not begrudge a little company on the road sir four men are a harder proposition for highwaymen than two our horses are fagged out being alone out here made us push em a little harder than was good for them that and having to be in plymouth by the first bell of the forenoon watch sir youre seamen the both of you alan asked losing a little of his caution aye sir ayscough admitted down to join a ship ive a warrant to be master gunner and bert theres to be my yeoman of the powder room already down for a ship hey not just going to plymouth to seek a berth alan queried further the man looked like the sort to be a warrant master gunner he even had what looked to be a permanent tattoo on one cheek from imbedded grains of burnt gunpowder i suppose thered be no harm in you riding along for as far as we go what ship telestos sir ayscough replied evenly alan lewrie he said with a relieved smile untensing his body and kneeing his horse forward to offer his hand to ayscough thats my man will cony cony say hello to mister ayscough and mister hagley aye sir cony intoned still a little wary near to with his hands empty of weapons one hand on reins and the other groping like a sailor out of his depth on horseback at the front of the saddle ayscough appeared to be a man in his late thirties to early forties the hair was salt and pepper worn long at the back in sailors fashion the complexion matched as well scoured by winds and sun and pebbled with smallpox scars but the mans speech was pleasant almost gentlemanly and the eyes were bright blue and lively telestos did you say alan said as they began to ride along together smirking a little at the mans unfamiliarity with the greek pantheon what do you know of her shes an eightygunned twodecked third rate sir bought inframe at chatham in ayscough chuckled as they headed west completed but never served she did by the time she was launched and rigged the war was over and you know how eighties are sir too light in the upperworks some say snap in two in a bad sea some of em did but telestos had her lines taken off a french lineofbattle ship laid up inordinary for a while then just got sold as a trading vessel here ayscough tipped him a conspiratorial wink now shes to fit out as an indiaman for the east india company alan asked a little confused if he was to join telesto as a navy officer what was the need for subterfuge about being an indiaman and ayscough said he was in possession of a warrant for a kings ship thats all they told me sir ayscough commented with a shrug telestos alan said feeling cautious once more thats greek is it not i read a little greek horrible language why i believe tis one of zeus daughters sir the ancient goddess of good fortune ayscough replied brightly a favorite of mine sir shes always treated me well do you know sir you have the look of a seaman yourself you and your man cony might you be on your way to join a ship as well only going to visit relations near plymouth alan lied not knowing quite the reason why he did so i know little of the sea nor do i care to sir life is brutal short and nasty enough on land for most people is it not ah i thought you to be sir ayscough said frowning after all you have what looks like seamens chests in your cart why at first i fancied you to be a sailorman sir perhaps even an officer ive heard tell of an alan lewrie a navy lieutenant i believe lots of lewries here in the west mister ayscough but thankee for the compliment alan replied now chill with dread one of my distant cousins perhaps my family is from wheddon cross the navy god no not me he pretended a hearty chuckle i mean who in his right mind would really be a sailor i see ayscough said pursing his lips he put both hands on the front of the saddle and frowned once more as if making up his mind bert he shouted digging under his cloak for a weapon ambush alan screamed raking his heels into his horses flanks and groping to his boottop for his pistol he sawed the reins so his horse shouldered against ayscoughs as he tried to thumb back the hammer of his pistol ayscough got a weapon out a pistol though he was having trouble staying seated alan lashed out with his rein hand kicked ayscoughs mount in the belly making it rear and shoved hard the other horse shied away and ayscough came out of the saddle to tumble into the slushy road there was a loud shot and a million rooks stirred up cawing time slowed down to a gelatinous crawl alan jerked the reins to turn his terrorized horse saw ayscough rolling to his knees to free his gun hand and begin to take aim alans muzzle came up and he fired first missed thanks to the curvetting of the damned horse alan dropped his smoking barker clawed at his waistband to get its twin all the while looking down the enormous barrel of ayscoughs gun there was another loud shot another angry chorus from the wheeling rooks and ayscough grunted as the air was driven from his lungs he pitched facedown into the slush the mud and the stalings from myriad animals his pistol discharging into the road with a muffled thud his cloak flapping over his head like a shroud the back of it had been rivened with a positive barrage of pistol balls cony alan shouted from a terribly dry mouth wheeling around to face the next foe ahm arright sir no thanks t the likes o thisun jesus the waggoners lad said trembling in awe of having killed his first man jesus mary and joseph it was his shot from that fowlingpiece that had taken ayscough down a mix of pistol and musket balls birdshot and whatever else looked handy alan dismounted handed the reins to the boy and pulled ayscoughs head up out of the mud but the man was most thoroughly dead so was conys foe run through by his seamans knife wot yew suppose twas all about sir cony asked dismounting and coming to his side they were both shaking like leaves at the sudden viciousness of the attack at how quickly two men had died and at how easily it could have been them soaking in the snow and mud something about that ship were joining i think alan said they must have something on them some kind of clue you search that one yonder bloody ighwaymen the old carter grumbled as he got down from the wagon seat and began to strip off ayscoughs hightopped dragoon boots he tried one against the sole of his worn old shoes to see if they would be a good fit and grunted with satisfaction wotiver appened t stand an deliver j asks ya they wuz gonna kill ever last one of usn i reckon an then rob the wagon too pretending to be honest seamen alan said shuddering our lucky day you and your lad were so quick on the hop sir cony and i would have ended our lives here if it hadnt been for you why thankee sir thankee right kindly the old man preened alan found a purse of gold on ayscoughs body one and twoguinea coins along with a goodly supply of shillings nigh on one hundred pounds altogether there was also a note written on foolscap in a quite good hand it described lewrie and cony gave a hint of what route they would be taking the name of the ship they would be joining and an assurance that they would be staying at the lamb and flag inn in plymouth your lucky day too sir alan said once the old carter had his new boots on and was stamping about to try them out alan counted out a stack of coins and gave them over i put a high price on my hide and theyll not be needing these where theyre going howd yew know sir cony asked once he had turned hagleys pockets inside out and helped lumber the corpse into the back of the wagon ah well you see cony alan sighed ayscough there said the ships name was telestos not telesto he claimed to have studied greek but he called her fortune one of zeus daughters but its common knowledge her name translates as success and she was one of oceans daughters and hesiods theogony is almost the first thing one reads in greek so he couldnt have been a real student oh i see sir cony said in awe of his employers knowledge and he mentioned our seachests trying to confirm if we were sailors on our way to plymouth and if i was the alan lewrie that was in the royal navy while he swore he was a master gunner with a warrant for our ship you see but where were their seachests sent on ahead sir by coaster and what sailor would ride a horse when he could coast along with his chest cony alan drawled at his ease once more and with his nerves calmed down to only a mild afterzinging it wouldnt do for cony to know that he suspected that it was lord cantner who had sicced these bullybucks on them or too much of the why had to be him no question alan thought as he retrieved his dropped pistol cleaned it and reloaded the old fart wants me dead and he swore hed have my hearts blood i cant remember mentioning plymouth and i didnt tell cony i dont think the talk around my lodgings was i was going to sea again but lord cantner could have snooped aroundhe knows everyone worth knowing back in london he could have found where i was going easy enough but whats this about this lamb and flag inn ive never even heard of the bloody place and id have gone direct to the ship to report aboard i just hope theres no more of these murderous bastards on my trail he thought grimly by the time they got the bodies to south brent and whistled up the magistrate their own mothers would not have known them the carter and his boy had outfitted themselves in their hats and cloaks and shoes putting their old castoffs on the corpses which made them appear even more the very picture of desperate highwaymen the magistrate had not even opened more than one eye from a midmorning snooze to adjudge the matter perpetrators dead hoist by their own petard no one local from the looks of them to stir up more trouble all they needed was burying case closed lieutenant lewrie come aboard to join sir alan said to the officer on deck once he had gone up the gangplank to the quarterdeck a little bit less of it if you please mister lewrie the officer in the plain blue frock coat told him there was much about the man that bespoke a naval officerthe way he held himself erect the hands in the small of the back and the restless grey eyes that cast about at every starting but instead of naval uniform the man wore dark blue breeches and black stockings and there was nothing on his cocked hat or his coat sleeves to show any indication of rank sir alan replied taken a little aback although he had obeyed the strictures of his letter from the secretary to the admiralty phillip stephens and worn a civilian suit he had expected a nicer welcome than that im at a loss then sir he admitted and you are i am captain of this vessel andrew ayscough the older man informed him civilly offering his hand it was not the first time that alan lewrie had been totally stupefied in his lifecertainly it was not going to be the last but the way his jaw dropped and the ashen pallor which claimed his phyz did much to convince his new captain he was dealing with a slackjawed fool are ye well mister lewrie ayscough asked i would be a lot better sir if i hadnt seen you dead in the road east of ivybridge alan finally stammered to make matters worse there was a superficial similarity to the dead ayscough this living version had saltandpepper hair eyes of a most penetrating nature a seamanly queue of hair over the collar of his plain blue coat and the same weathered face though the man that stood before lewrie bore the unconscious outward ton of command that the other had not my cabin mister lewrie ayscough suggested with a harsh rasp aye sir they made their way aft from the starboard gangway to the quarterdeck then under the poop aft of there were many cabins usually not found on a manofwar before they reached the captains quarters right aft there was no marine sentry no one to guard the lord and masters privacy and as alan had observed even in his present confused state no inkling of navy anywhere aboard telesto now what the devil is this ayscough asked flinging his hat across the cabins to hook onto a peg with a practiced motion sir i should like to see some bona fides that you are who you say you are before i say another word alan finally managed piss on what you want you impudent puppy ayscough rapped back prove to me youre who you say you are first alan dug into his coat and drew out his letters from the admiralty laid them on ayscoughs desk and let the man peruse them alan lewrie to be fourth officer right ayscough allowed grudgingly here he produced his own papers from a drawer in his desk a drawer that he had to unlock first postcaptain royal navy alan read aloud very well sir i shall have to take on faith that you are a commission sea officer now what the devil is this tale of yours alan repeated his assertion and filled the man in on what had occurred on the forest road he produced the note and what was left of the guineas in the purse we found nothing else on them sir alan concluded at first i thought it might be well something of a personal nature someone trying to gain revenge for an incident that happened in london before i departed but the coincidence of the name well now i wonder what sort of an incident ayscough demanded mollifying his tone and his suspicious glower enough to trot out a squat leather bottle of brandy and offer lewrie a glass urn it was a lady sir her husband names arent important surely for the ladys sake now the gentleman was quite old unable to duel but he swore hed have my hearts blood alan tried to quibble around the meat of the matter he had suspicions you were tupping his wife a little stronger than suspicion sir alan shrugged feeling as atsea and cornered as he had during his first interview with his captain aboard ariadne back in ayscough raised his eyebrows and almost unbent from his stiffness for a moment not flagrante delicto surely ayscough finally asked well engaged sir alan said nodding in affirmation damme what sort o sailors they going to send me then the captain barked cant even manage a boarding action without witnesses yes i can see why you thought it might be personal except for the following facts one this assassin used my name two he knew the name of this ship three he knew you were to join her and four he knew the route you were taking daddies trying to head off their daughters on their way to gretna green to elope with some smarmy bastard have less information i dont like the smell of this lewrie i want you to go ashore and take lodgings for a couple of days until we have more of our people assembled the lamb and flag is good not there sir alan protested the man knew that too goddamn my eyes ayscough roared slamming a tough fist on his desk hard enough to make the deck quake theres a spy about back in london unless i miss my guess i know it involves the honor of a lady lewrie but just who was this son of a bitch you think was behind your attempted murder lord roger cantner sir hmm ayscough pondered drumming fingers and staring at the overhead beams dropping out of his energetic anger in a flash no ive never heard of him and surely it wasnt anyone at the admiralty pardon me sir alan interrupted ayscoughs musings but if i might inquire what the hell am i doing here and what the devil is this commission all about they told you nothing no sir only that it would be discovered to me after i got to plymouth alan confessed why mister lewrie were off to the east indies ayscough replied snapping erect and pacing his spacious cabins off to see elephants and fakirs bombay madras calicut well not be allowed to carry trade from there to england no thats for the honourable east india companylong may leadenhall street and india house standbut well be engaged in the country trade just one more interloper in a whole bloody fleet of them up and down the coast over to siam to canton in china and back during the trading season sir i thoueht we were a warship alan protested beginning to get a sinking feeling had sir onsley matthews gotten an inkling of his affair with lady deliawas this his way of ending it god help me is this part of the same mad scheme poor burgess chiswick was saddled with he wondered starting with an audible gasp if needs be we are mister lewrie ayscough chuckled i have it on good authority that youre good with artillery with small arms youve done some hellish desperate deeds ashore too yorktown was it on the florida coast well youll get your chance to shine let me tell you telesto will be wellarmed just like an indiaman twelvepounders on the quarterdeck and the focsle for chase guns eighteenpounders on either beam on the upper gun deck well turn the lower gun deck into quarters and cargo hold with a few thirtytwopounders hidden away just in case thirtytwopounder carronades for you to play with i dont understand sir alan said shaking his head still in a fog were armed but were not a warship officially were the only vessel of a new trading company in the east indies what the nabobs of john company call a country ship ayscough continued in a softer voice leaning back onto his desk conspiratorially youll have no need for your naval uniforms well have a letter of marque from the admiralty and from john company so we may pass as a privateersman if needs be hmm might as well reveal all now ive your rapt attention shut your mouth mister lewrie you catch flies like that aye sir theres a section of the peace treaty ending the last war that allows us the frogs the dutch and the spaniards only five warships in the great south seas ayscough muttered softly pouring them some more brandy and none of them will be anything larger than a fifth rate frigate or a fourth rate fiftygunned twodecker see but the frogs aye the bloody frogs its always them isnt it we got wind they were putting ships like us out in the far east based out of pondichery and the island of mauritius shadowing the china trade the round the cape trade laying low until the next war innocent as you please for now and whats worse stirring up the local pirate fleets giving them modern arms creating native levies for the next war only so much our five obvious ships can do about it but what a private vessel out on her lawful occasions may do is quite another so were to lay low out there til the next war sir stir up levies of our own arm pirates against the french trade as well not quite that far confounding the french will suffice the captain replied smiling bleakly for now i want you to act a role for me as a halfpay lieutenant a little short of the wherewithal and god bless me what a wonderful charade your recent troubles are youre fleeing a step ahead of an angry husband so youre taking a berth in merchant service for your prosperity and your health its perfect and the crew sir were all navy aft except for a few gentlemen whose expertise in the east indies is vital to the venture and our two supercargo our putative owners dyou see navy down to our bones ayscough said thumping the desk once more this time more softlycovertly warrants mates quartergunners and guncaptains yeomen and all are in on it the ones we thought we could trust have brought friends from other commissions we know who to look for at the lamb and flag ordinary seamen landsmen idlers and waisters we can pick up reliable hands enough long as the pays good most english seamen dont care much what the job is longs they get their merchantmans pay and decent tucker and a hearty rum ration sir alan smiled for the first time thats the truth by god it is sir ayscough barked in glee well i thank you for your information about this false ayscough i have a feeling youd have been replaced with a fake if hed succeeded and thankee for the word on the lamb and flag somebody knows a little too much for my liking before we even got the sails bent onto the yards too many coincidences to think it a personal vendetta against you no i think someone in the pay of a foreign power wanted to delay our sailing eliminate one or more of our key people and keep us in port until wed whistled up others you come highly recommended mister lewrie its only natural some frog spy would want you dead i see sir alan preened a little it never hurt his feelings to have a little more praise heaped on a little daunting though to think that somewhere out there in plymouth theres a frenchman just waiting to put a knife between my ribs perhaps i should stay aboard no well have to act natural ayscough said waving off his suggestion watch your back for the next few days though dont travel alone theres some good mates already aboard wholl do for keeping you alive real scrappers if it comes to a fightmen from my last ship take them along on your errands um doesnt it strike you though sir that if someone is on to us already and tried to put me out of the way that the whole gaff is blown alan pointed out we might as well sail into bombay flying battle flags and we wont know which french ships are our enemies as far as im concerned every french ship is a foe captain ayscough snarled and theres a good chance we may nip this in the bud before we sail there werent half a dozen people in london who know about our existence were being paid for out of private funds east india company crown general funds admiralty victualling board and ordnance board nothing anyone may trace but somebody talked out of turn or someone is in the pay of the french we shall find out who and when we do that bastardll wish he was never born that was all ayscough could or would impart other than the fact that to the admiralty alan would remain listed as a halfpay officer with a note for him not to be called up as if there were a black mark against him he would receive no more than regular navy pay from their purser and his halfpay would not be disbursed or saved for him until he returned to england there would be no official record of this service that was galling and a little disconcerting after all he had made a good record and now for the sake of secrecy he had a big question mark about his abilities or suitability for promotion or service in his records even if it was a sham how easy would it be for a clerk to get befuddled and that would stay with him for the rest of his life i mean damme he thought the bloody navys the only thing i ever stand a chance of being really good at lewrie strolled to the quarterdeck bulwarks to look down on the bustling wharves and warehouses next to which telesto was tied up the stone dock teemed with seamen carters chandlers stevedores and mongers of every gewgaw trinket notion and edible known to man im half a civilian alan thought gloomily i suppose i should act like one he stuck his hands in his breeches pockets and leaned on the bulwark something hed not done since his first day of naval service so long ago and had almost gotten caned for it then and slouched damme ill have to go ashore just to buy plain coats and a hat or two he speculated most of my kit in my seachest will do once were out at sea why oh why didnt anyone take the trouble to tell me all of this before i left london probably didnt think i could be trusted probably thought id beg off if i knew how barearsed an adventure theyd dreamed up and i would have too lord cantner and his bullyboys be damned trot this lunatick idea out in the comfort of a club chair and id have been halfway to liverpool before they could even begin to think of trying to catch me scuse me sir cony said coming to his side i checked in with the pusser an e gimme your cabin sir got yer kit stowed away ready for ya yer on the upper gun deck starboard side third cabin forrud o the wardroom table tried fer larboard sir but hit was no go whats the difference i heard tell from a mate o mine in desperate all the quality goes larboard east starboard ome on an indiaman

out on a dark night t all hands aloft an reef sail it do sir that wont last longer than your meeting with the first mate alan gloomed perking up a little at taking conys expectations of an easy job down a peg or two well wont be the first time i went t sea anyways is it sir cony almost cackled my god but youre in a particularly good mood sorry sir cony sobered up hits just well london was beginnin t get a little boresome i guess ya could call hit sir i got right used t bein a seaman an all an if id stayed well twas best when ya got yer letter an i could come away with ya mister lewrie

what i should do bout it you bein a fair hand as i said cony began to blush and stammer turning his gaze to the sanded plank deck an uh uhmm oh for gods sake cony how bad could it be alan demanded will cony was probably the last of gods own innocents though how he managed that feat being around lewrie for very long was anyones guess well twas that pretty little abigail sir the one who done for ya when i ad me days off sir well uhm some nights belowstairs sir lord sir i have i been a bad influence on you cony alan smiled well sir when i seed all them pretty lasses ya spooned on hit set my umours t ragin moren a nightr two an well me an abigail i guess ya could say we sorta indulged ourselves a timer two sir on the sly i would have been even more amazed if you hadnt cony alan told him

getout until she tol me right afore we packed up an come away t plymouth sir that we was gonna have a baby she never alan gaped yessir she did my get sir i didnt know what t do bout hit sir so i give her what little id been able t save from my prizemoney an all twenty pounds sir cony wailed in conclusion ah alan intoned turning away to look out toward rame head and the harbor mouth before he began cackling like a demented cuckoo it was all a lie damn her little black heart he giggled inside goddamn ive been had if she truly is ankled ill lay any odds you want half london is trembling in their boots and paying up their fair share oh she played me perfect goddamn my eyes what a little scamp she ought to marry clotworthy chute and bilk the rest of england and poor cony he thought what to tell

objected iffen hit werent for the baby comin s soon i mighta but awfully young and you need someone a little closer to your own age cony someone whos had the rough edges knocked off first somebody

settled more mature and suited to your nature by then one never knows aye i spect yer right sir cony said brightening a little and in the meantime ill make up what she cost you cony taint rightly the money sir what was botherin me but i thankee kindly and remember were on our way to the fabulous east indies alan said trying to cheer him nautch dancers giris in veils so thin you can count their freckles china and almondeyed darlings the tsar of all the russias cant have no matter how rich he is its a big wide exciting world cony take joy of it alan spread his arms and beamed a hopeful grin at his servant and cony began to chuckle then alan looked over the bulwarks as a coach clattered up and burgess chiswick climbed out and looked up at the quarterdeck and the boarding ladder to the starboard gangway oh no it aint a big world alan cringed its too damn small and getting smaller all the time goddamn were part of the same harebrained terror i tried to talk him out of is it too late to break my leg or something uh aint that young mister chiswick sir cony asked it is indeed alan almost moaned as burgess espied them and waved gaily pantomiming that hed be aboard as soon as he paid off the coachee and got his chest up the gangplank er wasnt you worried bout what e was gettin isself into sir cony inquired with a worried note to his voice that i was cony godamercy mister lewrie sir cony blurted in alarm ya dont think that we im an usn that same thing i eard ya goin on about looks devilish like it cony alan groaned godamercy were fucked aint we sir cony whispered chapter of all the luck burgess chiswick opined draped across the transom settee in the officers wardroom a warming mug of flip in one hand and a long churchwarden clay pipe fuming in the other yes wasnt it lewrie agreed in a sarcastic drawl sorry you missed us on the road though burgess went on oblivious to alans disgruntled feelings you must have been out of your lodgings like a race horse soon as the letter came we left london behind you went by panton street but they told us youd already gone would have been nice to have coached down together alan had been barred from discussing the murderous incident on the road so all he could do was nod in agreement and then to find youd stopped off at the farm and gone on burgess told him experimenting with blowing a smoke ring caroline was very disappointed shed missed you was she well alan asked abandoning his putupon sulking my sister is very fond of you alan as is mother thinks you hung the moon or at least helped out shes a fine young lady well thats moot for three or four years aint it alan sighed hope you didnt mind but she adopted your cat she did didnt know you were fond of em burgess marveled still i can see the attraction affectionate old thing purred away like anything soons she picked him up and rode in her lap all the way to guildford in the coach thought hed be happier on the farm and well hes a part of you dyou see alan she said to tell you shed take good care of him until you got back yes i suppose thats best alan agreed trying to picture anyone picking william pitt up and trying to dandle him after a warship hed enjoy terrorizing a herd of sheep devilish good mouser more a lapcat the last time i saw him burgess chuckled shoes thundered on the double companionway ladders from the upper deck and their attention was drawn to the newcomer the sight drew both of them to their feet for its novelty if nothing else a man stood there a man with skin the color of a cup of cocoa fierce dark eyes glared under thick browsthe rest of the face was hidden behind a greying beard and a thick mustache that stood out stiff as the catheads up forward that held the ships anchors the man was dressed in sandals over thick woolen stockings loose kneelength trousers a longskirted coat that buttoned from waist to chin with a glittery multicolored silk sash about his waist a burgundy colored oldstyle frock coat over that for warmthand a turban what the devil burgess muttered namaste sahib the apparition said putting both mittened hands together and bowing slightly to both of them meestair twigg sahib want speech with elooy sahib i think that might be you alan burgess told him yes but who the devils this twigg alan wondered my master elooy sahib kshamakejiye excuse me i am being ajit roy you come jeehan yes yes alan replied is he ashore naheen sahib ajit roy told him pointing upwards is here on ship keep the flip warm burgess alan said to his companion and if im not back soon the servant padded back up the companionway to the upper deck cabins under the poop where the captain usually had his quarters there were other cabins forward of his that alan had thought might be reserved for passengers ajit roy rapped on one door and someone inside bade him enter the servant swung the door wide and stepped aside to let alan in it was a fairly spacious cabin considering about twelve precious feet long bow to stern and ten feet abeam piled as it was with chests it seemed more like a storeroom though or a rug merchants tiny stall or an opium den alan thought sniffing the air achhchaa royji kuchh der men vahpasahiye jeehan twiggsahib roy said bowing himself out lewrie im zachariah twigg said the man who had been sitting on the bunk as he unfurled himself to his full height this twigg was tall and lean almost impossibly lean all arms and legs he was dressed all in black like some dominee your servant sir alan replied automatically still befuddled and thinking that he would most likely remain in that condition for some time to come sit twigg commanded pointing out a chair with the flexible tube he held in his hand captain ayscough has related to me the peculiar circumstances of your incident i want to ask you more about it and you are sir alan demanded as twigg perched himself crosslegged on the bunk again and began to draw from the tube which alan now saw was attached to a tall glass hubblebubble pipe in the faint gloom illuminated by only a single lantern placed on one of the crates twigg resembled some kind of bird of prey the face was all hollowsin his cheeks behind his eyes on either side of his temples and his eye sockets were deep and pouchy he wore his own hair combed back thin and close to the skull and a prominent peak jutted like a cape between receding temples and twiggs nose was long thin and narrow like a raptors beak until it reached the nostrils where it flared out into a pad of flesh and cartilage an adult walrus could have envied let us just say that captain ayscough answers to me as do you lieutenant lewrie twigg told him with a brief damnably brief glint of humor with the mouthpiece of the hubblebubble pipe out of his mouth the lips were caricaturethin and pursed flat against each other in an expression of perpetual asperity i and my partner mister wythy are ships husbands and the owners let us say we were the ones bought her raised the capital and bought the cargo should anyone ask you were here to discuss lading with me as the fourth mate of a trading ship ought now discover everything to me it was not a request alan stumbled out the story of his attempted murder and the reasons he and ayscough thought might be behind it alan supposed england had spies any sensible nation did and he gathered that twigg and his partner were the front men for the adventure the plausible story that would hang together should anyone become inquisitive the prime movers of this subterfuge doesnt make any bloody sense twigg snapped after a long silence not to take anything away from your abilities lewrie but youre a rather small fish to fry if someone was intent on delaying our departure if its murder theyd stoop to better me and tom wythy or ayscough himself better a fire in the hold than slay a junior officer might have even done us a favor given us time to find a more seasoned mariner than you ive read your records lewrie youve come up hellish fast considering if i do not please you sir perhaps you should alan snapped back it aint like im talking to an admiral he thought hes no patron of mine whose back i have to piss down they can send another man down from the admiralty and i can hide out in wheddon cross with granny for a while until lord cantner cools off boring as that would be maybe coach back to guildford and stay with the chiswicks would but for the fact that you rose without too much interest from those above you twigg allowed acting as if he was amused by alans irritation with his remarks youre not the runofthemill placeseeker lewrie and you have this fascinating talent for snatching victory from the very maw of defeat for survival i value that more so than i do dullwitted competence its a talent rarer than pluck and daring or bravery any fool can be brave i see sir alan said wondering if he had been complimented or insulted either way he was still part of this lunatick venture it seemed down for three years of naval service unless he begged to be dismissed well get to the bottom of this before we sail at any rate twigg shrugged and sucked deeply on his hubblebubble pipe caving in those already cadaverous cheeks even more stores to be loaded on the morrow furniture light artillery military supplies for east india company luxury items for our people out there as well i expect well be awash in beer ale and wine youll see to keeping the crew out of it that its locked up securely bring a fortune in kalikatta once its landed they cant brew their own sir muslims wont drink spirits of any kind hindoos have their own muck thatd flatten an englishman he were fool enough to partake twigg frowned water cant be drunk in the east unless its been boiled and let cool in a clean vessel case of wine thatd cost you three shillings the bottle in london will go for five times that and its safe to drink i expect our cargo will pay for the purchase of telesto and her outfitting first cargo to china with bengali cloth and spices will defray the cost of our first year of operations my god alan gaped trying to total that sum in his head a rd rate ship even with half the artillery landed ashore would go for at least twentyfive thousand pounds and their profits would cover that ive been in the wrong bloody profession he told himself as captain ayscough instructed not a word of this incident with your fellows in the wardroom show me your plan of lading after breakfast ill have nothing broken mind aye sir and keep in mind well put in at oporto or vigo maybe touch shore at madeira as well for passengers and more spirits save some cargo space in the deep hold for that thatll be all for now mister lewrie a pleasant night to you er aye sir alan was forced to say rising to leave ajit twigg called out jeehan sahib the indian servant said through the closed door idhar ahiye mujhe sahib wythy se baht karnee hai twigg ordered have an ear for languages mister lewrie not much of one really alan confessed wondering if his lack of fluency in anything but english would suddenly blissfully disqualify him from this goosebrained voyage youll pick it up i just told ajit to come here that i wanted him to bring wythy to talk with me theres enough bearers in kalikatta who understand a little english and if you pick up a word or phrase or two you can stagger by bring this fetch this yes no too hot too cold youll sound like a monosyllabic barbarian to the bengalis but then thats pretty much what we are to them kalikatta alan assayed bengali name for calcutta up the hooghly river where were going twigg rasped out i thought it was calicut sir thats how captain ayscough said it then hes as big a noddy as you are twigg snapped goodnight sir namaste um right namaste whatever the hell that means he pondered as he got out of twiggs sight as quickly as dignity allowed fortunately in the next week he had little to do with twigg or his partner he was busy being the most junior office aboard working with the masters mates and the purser in stowing cargo in the holds and on the orlop deck above the bilges hundreds of kegs and tuns of spirits saltmeats crates of broadcloth and readymade shirts and breeches uniforms for the east india companys native bengali troops weapons and accoutrements books and a printing press blank ledgers for the writers and clerks to fill up with numbers in their counting houses and trading factories all those items of english life so sorely missed by the english in india and the luxuries that made life worth living in an alien land and there were ships stores to be piled away as well to feed and clothe the officers and crew a second complete set of sails and spars replacement masts miles of variously sized cordage for the standing rigging and the running rigging by which the sails and yards were adjusted powder and shot for telestos guns spare hammocks bag after bag of ships biscuit holystones to scrub the decks with pikes and muskets bayonets and cutlasses to repel any pirates handtohand it all had to be wedged in tighter than a bung in a barrel and gravel ballast had to be packed in between the heaviest items lowest in the holds cut firewood and kindling jammed between so that nothing could shift an inch once telesto was out at sea pitching and tossing and rolling at the whim of the sea once out of harbor it was life or death and could not be redone if a storm overwhelmed them alan had to admit telesto was an impressive ship compared to any other he had served in she was massive tons of oak and iron feet long on the range of the gun deck feet long at the keel and in the hold and that hold was feet deep and feet wide at her widest point with a pronounced tumblehome to her upper deck that narrowed the quarterdeck and poop broad and bluff in the bows gently tapering narrower aft like the head and tail of a fish that shape adjudged best by naval architects to swim the seas of the world an eightygunned rd rate was the biggest ship in the navy that could mount two decks of guns and not hog or strain down at both ends and break her back the royal navy had not been lucky with them since they were too light in the upper works to keep them from snapping like a twig in heavy seas but telesto was patterned upon the french foudroyant after it was taken as prize in battle and had its lines taken off by the admiralty to study and copy she was as long and beamy as a onehundredgunned st rate flagship of three decks as if she had been razeed shaved down by one deck to make her faster and lighter and as with french ships in alans experience she was a little finer around the cutwater at the bow and in her entry she promised speed and with so much cargo aboard would ride out a gale of wind without as much angle of heel as other ships even counting the wide span of her yards and upper masts for propulsion new as telesto was her hull was still golden under the preserving oils not yet baked almost black her two rows of gunports were painted with twin stripes of bright red paint no one was going to spring good money to fancy her up like a flagship so the usual gilt trim around the entryport gates beakhead taffrail carvings and the walkways and windows of her three stern galleries had been omitted and a light yellow lead paint had been substituted shell fly like a seagull artemus choate her first officer predicted happily you take passage on a john company indiaman its six knots when the suns up and they reef in and wallow slow as churchwork sundown to sunrise dont want to upset the passengers i suppose the towheaded man in his middle thirties grimaced at the habits of civilian seamen four months to round good hope and another three to the bay of bengal if the seasonal winds are with you its five shillings a day for an officer too sir alan pointed out whod be in a hurry at that rate of pay ha youve a point mister lewrie deed you do but well drive this ship like jehu drove his chariot weather permitting telesto sometimes felt navy in the way things were run even in harbor but of an evening she was as much a merchantman as any indiaman ayscough and choate and tom wythy the other partner liked music so telesto had a good selection of bandsmen fifers fiddlers drummers and the unheard of luxury of a bellows pumporganthat mostly for the passengers amusement she also had six men in the crew who doubled as bagpipers and most evenings would perform a concert on the upper gun deck up forward by the forecastle and the belfry alan wished they wouldnt but ayscough was some sort of lowland scot and doted on them it irritated lewrie and put the milk cow off production the sheep pigs goats and chickens in the manger didnt care for them much either as for passengers there wasnt much joy there alan had fantasized about a few english females taking passage to india but no such luck their forty or so paying guests were all solidly male all fairly young and just a trifle seedy in appearance clerks and writerstobe young tradesmen whod finished their apprenticeships and were heading out where the competition wasnt so fierce some men like burgess of limited means who would take military service in john company as subalterns not one sign of a mother abbess and her brood of whores to service all that emigre masculinity out in the indies either god help him they all looked so skint and short of money even a card game would be unproductive they warped telesto away from the stone docks on february sent the temporary wives ashore the next day and put the crew back into discipline alan got to go ashore just the once to pick up his last personal stores and purchases to compjete his kit and almost drowned in the rough harbor waters out and back in a ships boat under lugsail that tried its best to capsize or pitch him out on the dawn of february the winds came fair and the weather moderated telesto sailed anchors in sight alan bawled to the officers aft from his place on the forecastle heave and in sight choate urged his crew on as they tramped in a circle round the massive capstan on the lower gun deck bosun hands aloft there lay out and make sail ayscough bellowed loud as a steer mister lewrie hoist away jibs forrud murray hoist away flying outer jib and fore topmast staysl chearly lads alan ordered anchors awash ready with the cat to seize her up there larboard men telesto paid off from her headtoweather anchorage free of the last link with the land they backed her jibs to force her bows around to face the harbor entrance as the large spanker aft on the mizzen filled with air and made the noise of a gunshot canvas boomed and drummed and rustled in the middling winds standing rigging that held the masts erect and properly tensioned creaked and groaned as a load came on them blocks squealed and sang as hands on the gangways and upper decks hauled away on lifts halyards and jeers to raise her massive yards up from their resting positions drummers drummed on snares and bass fiddlers and fifers gave the tune and the pace and the hands chantied well rant and well roll like true british sailors well rant and well roll all across the salt seas until we strike soundings in the channel of old england from ushant to scilly is thirtyfive leagues braces there brace her in ayscough almost howled ease your jib sheets alan ordered walk em to the larboard side murray trim for starboard tack aye sir walk away wi the larboard sheet so let evry man raise up his full bumper let every man drink up his full glass for well laugh and be jolly and chase melancholy with a wellgiven toast to each truehearted lass anchors catted sir one of the hands told him well the cat ring up the fish alan said leaning over to see how the hands over the side on the rails were doing after being dangled to seize the hook in the ring of the anchor to cat it if nothing worse than a good soaking had occurred it was a good dayhandled badly anchors could kill those poor men very few sailors of any navy knew how to swim alan lewrie least of all and going over the side for any task was enough to shrivel any seamans scrotum those men came scrambling back up to the deck up the heavy chain wale and beakhead rails almost on the waterline soaked to the skin and turning blue from the frosty air and waters one had to stay hung in canvas hawsebreeches to hook the fish onto an anchor fluke to swing it up parallel with the bulwarks his bare legs trailed in the ships nowapparent wake and he shrieked as the icy waters surged as high as his waist oh be a man spears murray the focsle captain told him nother dunkin lahk at an me manoodll be froze off the man shouted back got it haul away on the fishdavit ring her up let fall courses starboard division hands to the braces they ordered from back aft there was enough labor for a warships crew of men usually allotted to such a vessel with the lower deck artillery mostly gone telesto had more a frigates complement of and everyone had to bear a hand to see her safely out of harbor had she truly been a civilian ship she would not have carried all told and some of her men would already have been ruptured so it was half an hour before they had her put into proper order with one reef in the courses on the lowest yards one reef in the topsails the royals raised at two reefs on the fore and mainmast and the spritsail under the jib boom and bowsprit set to take advantage of the northerly wind gradually the confusion shook down to a pull at this a tug on that and the rats nest of heavy running rigging was coiled up flaked down hung on rails in giant bights and out of the way already the galley funnel was smoking as the first meal at sea was being boiled in the steeptubs starboard has the watch dismiss the larboard watch below alan gave everything a last onceover and went aft along the starboard gangway to the quarterdeck oh for gods sake gentlemen please he shouted to the passengers and landsmen of the crew who were experiencing their first bout of seasickness as the ship began to feel the channel morion if you have to spew do it to larboard over there downwind so it wont blow back on you hey downwind so i wont have to send you over the side to scrub off your breakfasts oh not on the deck you oaf sorry burgess didnt recognize you with your face that particular shade of green oh god im so ill i think i could die burgess wailed in his misery as alan tried to help him to his feet you wont die of it alan offered you only wish you could you heartless bloo bloo burgck chiswick retched and cast up more of his accounts on the starboard bulwarks were you ill when you sailed back from new york to charleston from charleston to england alan inquired n no burgess sighed as alan led him to the larboard side of the ship across the quarterdeck to the lee rail well youre going like the town drains now i must say alan said cheerfully tell you what send down to the passengers mess get a brimming bumper of hot rum stay up here on deck the cold air will brace you right up for gods sake dont watch the ocean closeaboard stare out at the horizon think pleasant thoughts he added in closing unable to help himself and trying hard not to grin bastard burgess hissed im on watch so ill leave you to it for now alan sighed steward he went aft to stand by the sheltered double wheel where four quartermasters threw their weight on the helm as telesto butted her way through the offshore channel chop there was now and then some hint of the atlantic to come a long roller crossset to the chop the wind once out of shelter of the coast was a live thing that tried to throw the ships head down southerly for the coast of france requiring those four mens strength to hold her course captain ayscough took a last look around nodded to the second officer mr percival and took himself aft under the poop into the passageway to his great cabins right in the stem percival strolled up the canted deck from amidships to the windward rail taking a look at the compass card and grunting his satisfaction in passing alan didnt think he was going to like percival the man was one of those massive beasts all chest and arms with a neck like a breeding bull and a heavy jaw percival had the brow ridge of a mountain gorilla and looked to be the sort who could break oak beams with his bare hands he was certainly the sort of fellow who had grown up being the biggest and toughest of his playmates the one who enjoyed being the topdog in the pack and would fight anyone to keep his status in the last week they had sparred verbally so far even asking for the jam pot was a challenge to percivals dominance all prick and no personality alan muttered to himself and one of the quartermasters grinned at the comment as he shifted a quid of tobacco from one cheek to the other west souwest half west as she goes aye sir other than percival the wardroom was a fairly decent gathering there was choate bluff and steady glad to have active employment now the war was over he had a wife and family in harwich and was more in need of full pay than most the third officer colin mctaggart was one of ayscoughs protges a slim and wiry young fellow of twentyfive or so he had black hair as curly as a goat dark eyes and a pug nose being a scot he was better educated than most young men who joined the navy and was enjoyable to converse with so far to make room for their supercargo twigg and his mostly unseen partner tom wythy the sailing master one mr brainard had been shifted below a deck to the officers wardroom he was another of those mysteries like ajit roy brought in on account of his familiarity with asian waters he was also like twigg and wythy civilian in origin never having served in the royal navy brainard had a civilians usual disdain for the navy and its way of doing things a sneer here a lifted eyebrow there and a heavy sigh or two of exasperation met any evolution that differed from merchantman practice brainard was as rolypoly as a toby jug but held no cheer and sheltered his past and any conversation behind an aloof air of duty he was as weathered and dried as a piece of hawsebuckler leather baked to a permanent brick color so far he had not been seen to imbibe anything but water or small beer or crack the slightest smile in the mess indeed it would have been hard to determine if he had any facial expressions at all since he swathed himself in the heaviest grogram watchcoat even below decks where a small coalfired stove attempted to warm the wardroom it seemed a chore to remove his mittens so he could partake of his meals and the one time alan had peeked through the opened door of his cabin as one of the ships boys cleaned it the bunk had been mounded with no less than four blankets one thing alan had learned in his naval service though was that even the worst messmates could be abided he hadnt expected the voyage would be all claret and cruising people gave others personal space as much as was able and ignored the worst offenders limiting their exchanges to professional work far enough off the coast now that england was an indistinct smear of headlands almost lost in low scudding clouds the ship was going like a hobbyhorse in a playroom alan clung to the weather shrouds on the starboard side of the wide deck and began to wonder why he had thought telesto a big ship the open atlantic rolled and heaved up in dully guttering hills before them shrinking the massive ship to a toy that groaned and creaked as she rolled and pitched with a slow ponderous gait soaring up as the scend of the sea deigned to raise her cocking downward as the waves receded behind her one moment telesto was elevated high enough to expose miles and miles of ocean to alans view the next sunk down into a trough sliding forward as though she would butt into the next wave and shatter but always riding up and away from danger and at those times he could see no farmer than the creaming tops of the wavecrests that hillocked like frothy ink on either beam as high as the weather deck going like a race horse he muttered aloud feeling telesto as she trembled up from keel to oaken decks below his shoes she was indeed riding the sea and careering forward at a wonderfully prodigious pace mister hogue he called for one of the masters mates in his watch who was secretly a senior midshipman enlisted in their adventure aye sir cast of the log if you please i doubt very much if well get a decent sight for our position today and id not like to set her on ushant before the voyage is even begun aye aye sir hogue came back several minutes later his watchcoat and hat speckled with drops of seawater and his mittens soaked nine and a quarter knots sir hogue said proudly shes a fast un no mistake about her sir indeed she is alan said grinning he climbed up onto the mizzen shrouds for a better view with his telescope i make that to be the high point just west of looe just aft of abeam now where would that put us were you navigating mister hogue allow me to fetch my sextant sir every time the ship rose up on a surging billow of ocean they took a land sight comparing compass bearings trying to compute on a slate how far offshore they were if the high ground west of looe was known to be feet high and only subtended a degree or so above the indistinct horizon then on this course allowing for telesto making a certain amount of leeway to the sutherd well fetch lizard point with at least ten miles of searoom alan stated finally if the wind stays fair sir hogue commented more sage than his scant eighteen years might allow bound to come more westerly as we leave the channel a hard beat then but with the tidal flow not against it until at least midnight else well have to tack and fight the tides losing everything weve gained sir hogue warned inshore in the dark thankee mister hogue alan said rolling up the chart mr brainard had left on the binnacle table and if that happens alan thought lazily itll not happen on my watch thank the good lord he strolled back up to the windward side and took out his pocket watch to take a peek at the time three hours to go until his watch would be dismissed below he threaded an arm through the shrouds once again and shivered in his thick clothing the wind was wet and a little raw a live thing out at sea a continual noise that a landsman would never notice above the murmurs of the ship if the winds did come more westerly they could harden up to closehauled and beat within six points of its origin he decided just enough to keep telesto in midchannel well clear of the lizard and a safe twenty leagues or so from the rocky coast of france he debated with himself if it would be worth it to tack northrd if it really came foulembay themselves south of falmouth then tack once more due south to clear the lizard he turned his face to the raw wind and felt its strength on either cheek sniffing for the source of all that awesome power that moyed their ship still well north of west and not so strong theyd have to take another reef aloft just yet a gaggle of passengers came boiling up from below reeling in another bout of illness and alan smiled as they staggered down to the leeward side to spew so far his own stomach was showing its castiron consistency and he realized with a start his sea legs were returning those sea legs that in the beginning he had never even had the slightest desire to achieve not so bad once youre in he mused aloud like young jack told his first whore depriving and dull a voyage might be but it was something he had become somewhat good at his ability to shrug off the natural reaction to the ships motion and spew his guts out or reel like a sot as she pitched and rolled beneath him was pleasing to his pride as was his ability to decypher their rough position with the briefest of clues from the coast and didnt telesto ride well he thought she was a true thoroughbred properly laden and ballasted with as much canvas aloft as she could bear for the momentslicing through those hummocking seas with a surefooted nearness of motion that gave him a thrill of dare he call it pleasure with every swoop and rise damme this feels good he declared to the winds and seas his first watch ended at four in the afternoon and he headed below face and hands raw with the wind and chill eager for warmth for a seat near the glowing stove and a glass of something cheerful but he was delayed from those simple pleasures by the sight of tom wythy their other owner a word with ye mister lewrie the man beckoned since wythy had been pretty much an unseen presence so far it was more curiosity that led alan aft to the doorway to the passage that led under the poop to the supercargo cabins aye sir alan replied and followed the rotund man into his cabin across the passageway from twiggs he hoped hed get some liquid refreshment at the least tot o rum wythy offered once the door was shut wythy took up most of the cabinhe was rounder and heavier than even mr brainard the sailing master his face hidden behind a thick greying beard and that in an age when most fashionable men shaved closely there was a redveined doorknob of a nose ruddy cheeks round as spring apples and bright glittering eyes lost in the pudding face the beard most likely concealed ive made some inquiries about yer little excitement wythy told him rubbing the side of that bulbous proboscis with the side of a thumb as thick as a belaying pin took this long t get even a fast rider t london an back an i asked about ashore thats whats kept me busy an out o sight so far so this is our first opportunity to make our acquaintances hope yell forgive me that of course sir alan told him and what have you found oh weve stirred up an anthill no error wythy grinned baring a rather sparse but strong set of teeththose remaining in his head at least even caught us a french spy or two so it was the french sir alan enthused at the proof of a devilish conspiracy the rum racing in his veins and warming his chill belly nothin t do with ye sir wythy informed him turning the broad smile off we winkled a brace o informers out o the woodpile but that was more serendipity yeve been a bad boy mister lewrie deed ye have a very bad boy was it anyone i told sir alan cringed waiting for the thunderstorm of rage he imagined would follow i was thinkin more o yer taste for married flesh mister lewrie not yer indiscretion wythy said glaring at him imagine it for a moment us expectin the worst word o our venture leakin to our foes cross the channel no end o shitestorm as our people trace back every man in the know ye included t see if someones blabbed in his cupsr whispered in the wrong wenchs ear but i knew nothing to blab before stepping on board sir alan replied springing to his own defense out of longestablished habit hed gotten rather good at ithad to have gotten good at itsince hed been breeched sir onsley only said burgess chiswick would be going to the far east on some vital mission but i had no idea i had any part of it until the old fool until i received my letter from the admiralty and i didnt connect my appointment into this ship with him until chiswick came aboard either sir ah but yer patron sir onsley could wythy hissed evilly whats more natural among gentlemen in their clubsn t answer an inquiry bout where ye are lad under the rose as it were well let me say yer former patron sir onsleys stock round whitehall s not so high anymore find another s my advice t ye but had ye not been swivin with another mans wife hed not have set henchmen on ye to kill ye wythy drummed out beating lewrie on the head and shoulders with harsh words

tuppin her in the first place lord cantner alan burst out in a nearscreech of surprise aye wythy snarled funny what a manll stand for longs he dont have t be confronted direct funny the things a manll

ye hadnt stirred up the waters mister lewrie well we stopped their bloody business stopped the business o those hired killers too dead bodies floatin in a seaport townr nothin much t get exercised about jesus alan gulped at the calmness with which wythy spoke of having four human beings dispatched he took a pull on his tot of rum one o our people had a little chat with yer lord cantner as well wythy went on pity ye aint back in london t console the poor widow shes become a devlish wealthy widow of a sudden you you had him killed alan shuddered expired on his own damn his blood wythy spat as though he would have relished throttling the old coltstooth right in the middle o bein told we had him dead t rights for attempted murder an how vexed the crownd be with him apoplexy they say gods teeth lewrie chilled raising his tot to drain it dry well at least that was behind him hed not have to fear any more attempts on his life from lord cantner anyway though he wasnt sure as to wythys or twiggs intentions hold on now sir you said that you made inquiries did you ask of the chiswick family did you pester them did you harm them in any way by god if discreet inquiries nothin more wythy

up with these these blackamoors work for the crown good ye may go then by the way yes mister wythy lewrie said damned eager to get out of the door but held mesmerized like a bird by a snake seems that lord cantner might o died happy in one respect wythy allowed the latest jape runnin round his circle back in london s how he finally fathered an heir and the effort killed him lady delia bakin some young bucks bastard aye wythy noted grinning briefly seems to be a lot of that going round sir alan grimaced may i go sir is that all you wish of me for now aye mister lewrie thatll be all wythy said retrieving the glass from alans nerveless hand and i do mean all ii the nature of things is in the habit of concealing itself heraclitus chapter falconers marine dictionary by now wellthumbed and stained with tar proved prophetic on the subject of winds when alan referred to it running down past portugal one hundred leagues offshore they had reveled in the expected noreast gales from degrees to degrees north then with winter waning they met the southerlies south of degrees north against which they beat hard to make forward progress and below that latitude when the winds did indeed come more easterly they brought gloom and heavy seas in the region known as the rains where telesto was sometimes becajmed sometimes boxing the compass in slight vexing airs to the fourth degree of north then had come stronger easterlies ferocious gales accompanied by chickenstrangling rainstorms and lightning displays worthy of the first portals of hell to blow them south and once round the cape of good hope it was hard gales black clouds and rain like buckshot telesto shrinking from fifteen hundred tons or so to the burthen of a rowboat pitching and swooping like an errant water butt it was sometimes reassuring that falconers consoled him in item the tenth under winds that between the fouthern latitudes of and degrees in the indian ocean the general trade wind about the se by s is found to blow all the year long in the fame manner as in the like latitudes in the ethiopic ocean and during the fix months from may to december thefe winds do reach to within two degrees of the equator but during the other fix months from november to june a nw wind blows in the tract lying between the rd and th degree of fouthern latitude in the meridian of the north end of madagafcar and between the nd and th degree of fourth latitude near the longitude of sumatra and java lewrie was a bit leery though of the footnote from roberts navigation that the fwiftnefs of the wind in a great ftorm is not more than to miles in an hour and a common brifk gale is about miles an hour he saw winds greater than that daily once far enough north they found the tract of wind which falconer mentioned that ran like a racecourse between madagascar and the african coast fresh from the south souwest which at the equator changed to the west souwest and then came the monsoon winds which at that season of the year were out of the souwest in the gulf of bengal none too gentle either as the lateyear noreast monsoons would be all in all it was a horrid voyage for the most part captain ayscough lit a fire under everyones tails and drove telesto like jehu drove his chariot skating the ragged edge of being overpressed by the winds all the way beating their way southerly along the coast of africa below the equator instead of taking the easier way over toward the brazilian coast as most indiamen did duty sun sights baking or boiling in tropic heat shivering by turns in fear and cold drenched to the skin in easterly gales and the air and water hot as a mug of flip sweltering in tarred tarpaulin foulweather gearweary enough to use his fingers to keep his eyes open in the middle watch which was his by right of being juniormost officer if i ever get back home im going to become a farmer he kept telling himself they smelled it before they could see it even with a wind up their starboard quarter in the last few hours of darkness before the sun burst above the horizon like an exploding howitzer shell for a change the winds were light the seas calm and barely ruffled barely heavingmore like lake sailing telesto gurgled and soughed instead of roaring and sloshing her forefoot and cutwater under her bows parting almost still waters in a continuous lazy surge what the hell is that lewrie wondered aloud wiggling his nose like a beagle on a puzzling new trail after six and a half months barring the occasional portcall when they broke their passage at oporto madeira and table bay at capetown for hurriedly laden galley fuel water and cargo his olfactory senses had been brutalized by the stench of ship tar and salt fishroom rancid cheeses and butter saltmeats fermenting in brine livestock in the manger the odors of his fellow travelers below decks land sir the middle watch quartermaster speculated from the huge double wheel which now could be held and spun onehanded in the light airs yes there was a hint of coastline rotting seaweed and the fishy aroma that most people called an ocean smell but there was something else peeking from beneath that a hint of cinnamon pepper coriander almost like a hungary water that ladies dabbed onperfume first a tantalizing fantasy then a real whiff flowers alan yelped in glee lots of green plants and flowers ahoy bow lookouts see anything nothin sir mister hogue leadsmen to the forechains i think were in soundings boy he directed the sleepy cabin servantships boy on deck to turn the watch glasses on the halfhour bell go aft and inform captain ayscough were in soundings wake im oop zir the boy yawned stirred from his nap hell yes wake him up witty take a telescope and go aloft it lacks two hours til sunrise but you might be able to see something even so a good morrow to you mister lewrie a voice called in the darkness there was but a sliver of moon to see by but alan knew ayscoughs stern tones well by then soundings is it smells hellish like it sir ive sent a man aloft with a glass mister hogue the masters mate and hands to the forechains with the deepsea leads last cast of the log showed just at five knots ayscough came close by his side clad in nightshirt and his watchcoat his hair tousled by sleep by the faint glow from the binnacle lanterns alan could see him close his eyes and sniff deep patchouli ayscough muttered smiling fondly perfumed tresses perfumed mustaches cooking ghee jungle forests and a million flowers opening charcoalburners garbagemiddens sacred cow and elephant dung exotic attars and shite india at last hundrayed faathim a leadsman in the chains sang out slowly one hunndrayd faathim t this liine six and a half months alan chuckled a damned fine voyage a dam fast voyage you mean ayscough commented leaving his pleasant reverie tonly joy of it was passing those john company indiamen like they were anchored fast in the pool of london still it had its moments proper navigation cut weeks off it one thing i picked up from an evening with jemmy trevenen and captain king of resistance during the war i met king once sir at turks island did you indeed clever men most masters would stagger from landfall to landfall you know ayscough mused way over to here double the distance of their passage just cause thats the way they learned how to do so but with a reliable chronometer the skills at plotting position one may cut the odd corner now and then taking the unknown shorter way most of emd be satisfied if they could hug the coast like breaking across the atlantic to the west indies know that ninety percent of the ships still fall as far to the suthrd as the latitude of dominica then cross due west to make their landfall just cause dominica s peaks are a sure seamark one cannot miss when the trades are the same south of cape verde and one could scuttle across diagonally and save a week a week sir as we have sir alan agreed toadying a little hope you learned a little then mister lewrie something to consider on future commissions boy go run and wake the master mister brainard ayscough directed tell him my compliments and were in soundings of the hooghly bar hundred fathom now and i desire his expertise before the coast begins shoaling iss zir the boy replied a trifle dubious he could remember all those breakteeth words in one sitting fiive an ninety faathim a leadsman crowed loud as single rook on a foggy moor morning fiive an ninety faathim t this line botttim o grey mudd grey mud aye ayscough grunted in familiar pleasure just what id expect hmm five knot ydid say mister lewrie pipe up to six by sunrise if im any judge of these waters have the bosun pipe allhands at the change of watch well take in tgallants and feel our way in gently same times we scrub decks coffee id admire some yes sir ill send you a mug once my stewards brewed up a pot for me and mister brainard ayscough said as he was leaving good thinking on the leadsmen and the overhead lookout mister lewrie thankee sir alan replied to the departing back ayscough was not lavish with his compliments to earn even that slight grudging notice was as much approval as most men would get from him in a full three years commission indeed a redletter morning for him low marshes swaying oceans of reeds straggling off to dryer ground and heat harsh crushing damp heat worthy of a washerwomans boiling steaming tub of laundry water and the fire that stoked it the sort of fire that could melt iron and forge artillery once past the hooghly bar and into the river proper lewrie envied the hands aloft up where the wind still rilled the sails on deck it was hot as the hinges of hell and the pounded tar between the deck planks softened and ran sluggish and shiny as treacle my god he cursed mopping his face with a sleeve under his cocked hat his hair was plastered to his head with perspiration and sweat glued his shirt and breeches to his body serge or broadcloth brainard sniffed taking a rest from dashing about the decks from one beam to another to take sights on distant spires or landmarks from tasting and sniffing at what the waxed plumb of the sounding lines brought up you dress like you was paradin on the strand in all that heavy clothin youll be dead as mutton by sundown mark my words sir think you have to look like an officer all the time think the hands wouldnt recognize your phyz by now shuck or die gladly alan agreed doffing his blue wool officers coat and serge waistcoat they collapsed in wet bundles on the baking deck where he threw themalmost left puddles he imagined he tore his neckcloth loose as well and almost shivered with relief as a puff of wind touched his skin once were anchored theres ten thousand good tailors ashore glad to run you up some lighter clothes duck or serge de nimes i prefer the lightest madrassi cotton meself you and your man hire a darzee wont cost moren a half a crown for him to run you up a coat waistcoat too if you really feel you need one but i tell you id not wear one before sunset brainard cautioned twigg and wythy were on deck taking their ease in canvas chairs atop the poop screened from the sun by an awning below the boom of the spanker the servant ajit roy was now bare from the knees down clad in only a loose pair of pyjammy trousers a sleeveless white cotton shirt that billowed free round his waist and his turban he was trotting out fresh lemonwater while another man theyd hired off a passing native boat as flimsy an excuse for a craft as alan had ever seen worked the rope of a pankah to fan them and keep the flies off weve made good progress even so alan said unbuttoning his shirt down to his navel to let the light winds play with him aye brainard sighed wiping his own face quarterpoint to larboard on your helm quartermaster less things have changed much theres shoals yonder id admire we didnt strike ah there dyou see that lump of reddish rock yonder looks like a squashed anthill aye sir alan replied raising a telescope just over the tops of the trees he could barely make out something more substantial than the foetid coastal lowlands and marshes fort william be anchored by sunset if the wind holds the sailing master told him pity the poor frogs their bengal trading factory is far upriver from ours chandernargore even worse a sail to get there its a wonder they kept it after the last war hello here comes somebody lewrie said pointing to a small ship that had appeared in midchannel shimmering like a mirage in the heat waves on her way down to the sea what is she sir venetian ha appears to be local built good god havent seen a ship like that in a long time brainard laughed most country ships out here are built outa good hard teak wood lasts forever seen a wellcaredfor ship last a century out here whilst good english oak rots away in five years shes like an old venetian caravel she is mighta been felucca or dhowrigged once see below the crossed spars how she carries forenaft sails on lateeners good to windward this time of year probably started life as an oared galley god knows how long ago and got rebuilt over the years i dont recognize the flag though sir ah hmm house flag part portugee part parsee sharp businessmen they are sort of arabs brainard sighed wistfully old and shabby she might be alan thought but she was definitely exotic exotic in the extreme just like everything they had seen in the last two days on their slow passage up the hooghly there were people working in fields in turbans and dhotis oxdrawn carts with only one axle and squealing ungreased wheels one could hear nearly a mile away with loads piled prodigiously high swaying along slowly dak bungalows here and there a days slow bullockcart travel apart elephants bathing and splashing mud on their broad backs on the river bank their mahouts watching for snakes and crocodiles women in sarees long headcloths or cotton shawls out pounding clothing on the banks occasionally around some larger town or village there were men doing the same labor the dhobees from a prosperous house a rare buddhist priest in a saffron robe and his begging bowl more often hindu priests a local rajah or rich trader with his procession of loaded gharies his retinue of gaudily dressed mercenary soldiers on horseback curtained sedan chairs borne by sweating lowercaste men that might contain a babu a fat native clerk or a patchouliscented courtesan and once to burgess chiswicks delight a column of infantry on the march exotic they were too to one used to the sight of an english regiment red coats white pyjammy trousers white crossbelts sandals and kurtaa shirts brown bess muskets held at shoulder arms cocked hats with neckcloths bouncing against their necks to keep off the fierce sun and not a stitch more of european clothing on their backs but they were wellclosedup and marching to fifes and drums their english officers riding stocky native horses with their bearers trotting alongside and india did smell as ayscough had said smelled powerfully flowers green sap perfume and spicecooking aromas that made the driest mouth water and rot and corruption too there was nothing about the place that could be considered a halfway measure it was a place of strong almost violent contrasts and they hadnt even set foot ashore yet to discover one percent of them try to acclimate on the last stretch of the voyage as they could the first sight of calcutta set everyones mind into a hopeless spin the harbor and the city banks were as busy as the pool of london with hundreds of ships anchored everything from stately john company indiamen to ancient copies of galleons from the largest to the smallest riverine trading ships hidebuilt coracles and rowing boats worked in a plague from the ghats built up along the river bank warehouses and docks stretched as far as the eye could see with reddish fort william brooding over it all and behind the ghats there were pleasure gardens as gay as covent garden or ranelagh spacious as st james or hyde park where in one moment rich men rode in their carriages or strolled slowly and the next a lowercaste mehtar would dash by carrying his bucket of excrement to be dumped behind the european quarter the cantonment where it was adjudged safe to live there were native quarters teeming with life crowded elbow to elbow from sunrise to sunset except in the hottest parts of the day sacred cows strolled oblivious through the greenest lushest cricket pitch anyone had ever laid eyes on while the players waited for their bearers to shoo them away gently and without offense native markets hummed and buzzed with commerce and smoke rose from cooking fires fires where brass and bronzeware was molded and hammered where hides were tanned or clothes washed it was all of london crammed into half the area still huge enough to daunt almost all of them from going ashore into such an exotic alienness they found a safe anchorage where telesto would have room to moor and dropped the best bower anchor the sails were clewed up to the yards then brailed up and secured with harbor gaskets for the first time since capetown yards lowered slowly and squared away navy fashion a stream anchor was lowered from the stern and rowed out to keep her from swinging afoul of another ship the sun awnings were rigged across the decks and unlike navy fashion would be left deployed day and night instead of being taken in each day at sundown for they provided some protection from the rains that would come during this season very well mister choate dismiss the hands ayscough said after the last bit of tidying and straightening had beendone to his the bosuns and the first officers satisfaction um the matter of shore leave sir choate ventured firewood and water first mister choate ready the ship for sea should it become necessary then well consider it the captain grunted though his own nose was twitching to get ashore bosun watering party choate yelled excuse me if i suggest something twigg interrupted coming down from his regal perch on the poop deck with his servant in tow youll want to rinse out the ships water barrels of course id suggest boiling water for that er they are a bit foul sir even being sluiced at capetown not so long ago the purser chuckled a bit on the tan side our water is yes see to it and from my prior experience all the water we take aboard should be boiled first else itll come out of this river ayscough harrumphed they had all seen the garbage floating in the hooghly the excrement dumped thankfully downstream from the city and their anchorage you read my mind sir twigg replied with a slight bow and a twitch of those tight lips of his further though it is my experience in asian waters that thin gauze should be procured for insect netting if not for each hand to swath about his hammock then at least for the hatches that lead below i do not know why nor do any physicians of my past acquaintance but the incidence of malaria is much reduced if this is done as long as it does not come out of ships funds though the purser objected why the navy boards silence twigg snapped raising a hand in warning and i tire of reminding you sir that i and mister wythy are funding this vessel you may not care about the health of the men in your charge but i do if only for the inability to find trained seamen enough in india to replace the ones who die and die they will in job lots no matter what precautions we may take i merely meant the purser stammered on redfaced ill speak to you in my cabins later mister abernathy the captain snapped do what our owners suggest after witnessing that entertaining exchange at the expense of mr nipcheese as abernathy and most pursers were termed lewrie went to the larboard bulwarks to stare at the ghats that led down to the river in terraced steps hed seen insect netting used before in the west indies and sickly as that region was hed expected nothing less of the east indies besides he consoled himself ive had the yellow jack once before and everyone said back on antigua that once you survived it you couldnt get it again he rubbed the top of his left arm where the family surgeon had punctured him over and over and made him howl with pain and terror even before he was out of nappies to inoculate him against the smallpox there were two major risks of the tropics taken care of as for the rest he was young healthy as a rutting yearling bull wasnt he he was welloff financially an established english gentlemanhis kind was bloody immortal as for other diseases hed sleep with the nets drink nothing but imported wine or ale make sure his water was boiled first should he be forced to drink such a dull beverageperhaps nothing but tea he speculated one had to boil teawater if one wanted a decent pot food could be washed in boiled water he supposed and anyway there was saltmeat to fall back on and he would take his sheepgut condom ashore with him should he ever be allowed ashore twigg and wythy hadnt snarled at him in the last two months so he supposed he had outlasted their anger at him hed not been allowed ashore at oporto madeira or capetown surely hed touch landand a few other softer thingshere in calcutta chapter with so many hired stevedores and those working for less than anyone could credit the cargo was finally landed in their warehouse and factory ashore twigg and wythy went with it thank the good lord to establish their putative trading firm telesto rode higher out of the water firewood and water were brought aboard and stowed away a distillery was established at the factory to supply them daily crates of chickens small flocks of goats and sheep were hoisted aboard for fresh meat the crew complained about the lack of juicy fresh beef no matter the explanations that cattle were a protected species to hindoos the passengers had left the first day burgess chiswick included theyd shared one last bumper of claret and then he was off to fort william for his assignment with the east india companys army there were some more chores that captain ayscough wished performed before shore leave would be allowed the ship was smoked and scoured below decks the bilges pumped clean and the many rats that had come aboard with the cargo hunted down and dispatched or at least thinned out rigging had to be rerove to replace spliced or stormraveled cordage sails had to be patched cosmetics about the look of the ship could go hang for a while but she must be made ready in all respects to go to sea at a moments notice before the hands were to be allowed a monumental rut or two finally after six days of labors ayscough summoned all hands aft and announced that he was pleased enough to let them have leave now this is a rupee tom wythy said counting out coins on his desk in the factory offices ashore while alan fidgeted and wriggled with impatience worth about fifteen rupees to the pound sterling you run across a gold coin thats a mohur same as a guinea aye sir think of a rupee as a strong shilling now these are annas like pence but sixteen to the rupee have you got that so far sir aye i think so mister wythy alan almost groaned and pyce are like hapenniesfour to the anna youll be amazed how cheap things are here in calcutta how muchi say kit naht alan recited bahut mehanga is too much god help me if the bastard wants to haggle though im flat out of the lingo round the port fort william and the european cantonment yell find enough bazaarwallahs and bunniahs who savvy english wythy growled their stores and stallsd die if they couldnt mind now yell be safer not goin into the native quarters without a guide or bearer yih achcha jaga naheen sahib a no good place specially for aferinghee such as yself end up with yer purse lifted poxed to the eyebrows by some curcfcwhore or knifed in an alley by some budmashes the third officer and i and my man cony will go together sir alan assured him swords for all and a pocket pistol each good thinking wythy allowed well yere on yer own god help ye enjoy enjoy alan did though for the first few minutes he wasnt sure he could walk hed not been off a ships deck for over six months rocketing from beam to beam in storms permanently heeled over in strong winds and used to the motion of a ship even during their brief port stays telesto still snubbed at her cables lifted and rolled gently to tide or offshore breezes and heavy as she was was never still once outside theyd headed up one of the major thoroughfares aiming for a grove of monstrous trees they couldnt recognize anxious for some shade but they simply couldnt attain them the land was so still yet it seemed to heave and roll to yaw to windward like a ship with too much weatherhelm alan found himself paying off to leeward staggering and shambling as if hed just put down half a dozen bottles of wine colin mctaggart and cony were not much help either either they were staggering on the opposite tack crossing under his hawse and threatening to trip him up or they were bearing down on each other in collision holding on to each other to raft up for mutual support wasnt such a good idea either for they tugged in opposite directions even standing still god elp me mister lewrie sir cony wailed hant nivver been landsick afore but hits acomin over me ellish strong dammef hit haint perhaps if we closed our eyes mctaggart suggested his dark tan turning very pale noo thats nae the way alan had tried that but as soon as he did the canals of his ears began to swirl like milk in a butterchurn making him feel as if he were spiraling out of the sky like a wellshot duck cant be the cholera or malaria could it alan paled nae sa soon surely not mctaggart sighed an ale shop up yonder lets hae us a sitdoon for the love o god a few milds and some time safely ensconsed in solid chairs seemed to help abate the reeling looks as if were not the only ones suffering alan pointed out three hands off another ship were shorttacking up the walks in front of the european shops on the far side of the street careering from storefront to the verge of the curbing in a series of short tacks from beam to beam quick as a regatta of tiny pleasure boats on the thames one grizzled bosun followed them older and wiser to the predicament he trailed the fingers of his right hand along the buildings for a reference point groping like a blind man they espied several others who did not suffer mal de terre as badly these bucketing along normally as any other pedestrian but with the rolling gait of a longpassage sailorman once the symptoms abated somewhat they found their tailor a darzee named gupta who measured them and ran up their requirements light locally loomed cotton shirts duck waistcoats light as number serge de nimes sailcloth for use in the softest weathers he could supply cummerbunds to wrap about their waists which he assured them was a healthy thing to do purvey hats in european styles made of tightly woven straw that let their scalps breathe but kept off the cruel sun alan fingered a bolt of cloth a very light almost metallic midblue fabric that shone richly as the light struck it gupta went into raptures assuring him it would make a coat as fine as any rajah wore rich as the great moghul himself in distant delhi and only paintis burrasahib only thirtyfive rupees heroic as alans stature was brass buttons extra of course alan knocked him down to thirty rupees and fabriccovered buttons and ordered more in silvergrey and pale blue two pounds sterling each for a coat he marveled that a titled lord would gladly shell out fifty guineas for back in london if he could get it he outfitted cony with a straw hat cummerbund and lighter cotton shirts and a dark blue duck jacket to take the place of his wool sailors jacket brass buttons one rupee extra of course then they were off for a tour of the bazaar my god it truly is pucks fair alan exclaimed it was as grand a sight everywhere he looked as the most intriguing rareeshows he had ever paid to see back home in england and it was all free to the eye here there were rickety stalls spilling over with flower garlands and necklaces with bundles of blooms the like of which he had never seen or smelled there were ivory carvers to watch wood carvers to admire strange multiarmed little statues in awkward dance poses to haggle over rug merchants and weavers sewing dhurries from bengali cotton or imported fur persian or turkey carpets down from the highlands of the northwest with their eyesearing colors and intricate designs in another corner were grouped the brass and copper wares here gem cutters there gold and silversmiths in between there were stalls heaped with fruits vegetables and livestock now and then there would be a cooking stall with the most enticing steams and spices wafting into their parched nostrils doves and snipe ducks and wild fowl chickens flapping as they hung upside down by one leg from overhead poles prior to sale there were pet birds in cages colorful and noisy monkeys on leashes and there were elephants actually being ridden by a man some workingplain but a rare few painted with symbols and caparisoned as rich as a medieval knights steed adrape in silks and satins real gold tassels and silver medals brocades with little mirrors winking from knitted rosettes and crowned with feathered plumes and bejewelled silk caps and camels swaying under heavy loads there were swordswallowers and sworddancers beguiling the shuffling throngs for tossed money snake charmers tootling on flutes as they swayed in unison with deadly cobras there were jugglers and acrobats magicians and dancers some young boys as beautiful as virgin brides who pirouetted to the enthusiastic clapping and cheers of a circle of onlookers ankle bangles and bells jingling with their eyes outlined lasciviously with kohl there were girls in tight bodices and loose gauzy skirts with their midriffs bare the skirts and the gauze headdresses flying out behind them as they danced showing more to the amazed and lovestarved eyes of him and his companions than most husbands would ever get to see of their wives back home in england there were puppet shows the rajah and ranee version of punch and judy there were groups of singers streettheatre troupes up on flimsy stages ranting some historical or religious dramas or they might have been comediesalan couldnt tell and india wasnt all of a piece either calcutta was a rich trading town so down from the mountains inland there were afridis and pathans nepalis and ancient aryans persianlooking moghuls all with their pyjammy trousers stuffed into ornamented boots with love locks dangling from beneath their puggarees they bore curved swords and knives with little bells jingling from their hilts poor zamindars in town to sell their produce rich landowners shopping for bargains among the imported european items hindoos and muslims jains sikhs parsees and the rare buddhist in time alan might learn to tell the difference between them as well as the difference between the bengali majority and the visiting dravidians mahrattas dogras the people from assam and nagaland to the east the tamils of the southeast and the harsher people who hailed from the oudh north of the vindhaya hills the great dividing line between permanently conquered india and semiautonomous india that the aryans and the moghuls had never been able to rule for long worth the voyage i swear alan exclaimed as they sat in the shade of a tree munching on dates sugared almonds and pistachios aye tis a rare land ill grant mctaggart agreed as he essayed his first banana after watching the natives to see if one took the bright yellow husk off first or ate it entire colin was calvinistpresbyterian dour most of the time overeducated like most scots compared to their english counterparts who thought that too much intelligence was a dangerous thing but could be nudged to enthusiasm now and again enough to prove that he was human but with food sae cheap how do ye explain sae many mendicants besides the exotic pleasures of the bazaar there was the irritation of seeing so many poor so many beggars minus a limb an eye covered with running ulcers so many people barely clad in a ragged filthy dhotee and puggaree who couldnt even afford the cheap but wellmade sandals the mochees nimbly cut from their sheets of leather speaking of mendicants alan said sighing as a pair of beggars appeared near them one limping grandly on a crutch one leg gone and the other sightlessone eye rolling madly and the other flat gone with the empty socket exposed naheen yer buggers cony snapped feeling protective of his people juldi jao and the beggars sheered off under the amputees robes alan could almost spot a leg and a foot bound to the mans backsides fakin hit mister lewrie fakin r maimed opurpose gods teeth cony whered you pick up such mastery of the language alan marveled been talkin t that servant ajit roy sir cony replied flushing ypick up a wordr two ere an there ya do sir an ajit done warned me habout some o the shams they kin get up to sir lame their own kiddies t make em look pitiable worsen midland gypsies but what did ye say ta them mctaggart inquired naheen thats no plain as day sir juldi jao is kinda like bugger off sir cony replied getting sheepish yer a man o many parts cony mctaggart said praising with an appreciative chuckle lucky our lewrie is ta hae yer services long as i dont have to pay him more than i do already alan thought chiming in with verbal appreciation as well conys paltry vocabulary came in handy once more on their way back to fort william s wide maidan the drill ground and the quieter regions of the european quarter frankly after wandering about the bazaar and its many twists and turns they were lost they could see one of the forts ramparts down the length of a narrow meandering lane of small twostory mud houses and decided to take a shortcut music was more prominent in this quarter sitars and flutes palms beating alien rhythms on madals that alan couldnt quite get the gist of no matter how hard he tried the music was mildly irritating to a european ear but oddly pleasing after a little while one more wonder to be savored of this grand experience paid for with so much labor terror drudgery and misery at seasavored for its difference even if it had been noxious several girls leaned out of doorways along the narrow street and came out to greet them making the twohanded gesture of greeting and bowing gracefully to them namaste burrasahibs namaste namaste alan replied feeling foolish giving them the two hands at brow level just to be polite encumbered as he was with his little basket of nuts and fruits hamare ghalee ana achcha din one lovely maiden intoned giving him an appraising grin milkcoffee brown not a minute above eighteen or so bounteous breasts bound in by a snug sateen minijacket bangles on her wrists and ankles midriff tapering to tininess above taut but womanly hips contained in a sash and series of gauzy skirts her hair was long loose and flyawaycurly under a gauze chudder headcloth that hung to her hips weighted down with little gold coins mere sath chalenghe burrasahib she cooed good god lewrie ye dinna think mctaggart almost strangled in shocked prudery as the girl and her equally lovely compatriots wriggled their hips slow and sultry comfirming their suspicions whores aye they are colin bit broad in the sternquarters for my liking alan replied appraising them coolly and damn near strangle a man with those stout little legs of theirs suppose its the fashion in the east still man ye canna be considerin mctaggart gargled turning red as a throttled turnip saat rupee burrasahib the girl whispered invitingly as seven o them hindoo shillins sir cony supplied in an even voice feeling in his cummerbund for loose change between the folds that little maid back in london had had a powerful effect on him might be a bit steep sir and peppered wi the pox ta her very brows mctaggart gasped ye may count on it tell her no thank ye ham bahut kaam hai girl cony told her were busy dont ya know but good day come into our street traditional whores greeting will you come with me great lord not to my taste cony however she might be to yours alan allowed we could meet you at the darzees thankee sir cony replied brightening main phir laut kar ahoongaa be back later girl teen rupee three darlin make it easy on a poor sailor chha rupee the girl demanded and she wouldnt go any lower than six much as cony wheedled panch or chaarfive or four cony finally sighed and they proceeded on down the street accompanied by the derisive shouts of the spurned girl cutchadmi banchuts sastaa banchuts jahntee none too thrilled sounds like alan said with a grin enjoying himself hugely whats she saying from the sound of it id say its something close to cheap bastards mister mctaggart right cony ajit e didnt learn me none o that sir cony admitted spect id better ave me another lessonr two they got back to the docks and the factors offices just after midday glad for the coolness of the mudbricked walls and thick tile roof wythy had told them most white men took up the practice of napping through the heat of the afternoon and not stirring out until the sun was beginning to descend below the lowest yardarms to one so lazy as lewrie if left to his own devices it sounded like a marvelous invention he had just found a bale of cotton on which to doze off when burgess chiswick came to look him up damme but you look hellish dashing alan said in greeting chiswick was now clad in a red serge coat with broad white turnback lapels and cuffs the uniform coat of the east india company with many figured buttonholes and brass buttons a gorget of officers rank hung on his upper breast and each shoulder bore a silvered chainmail patch of rank which could also turn a swordcut from above an ensign in john company now are you a captain no less alan burgess preened in charge of the light company of our battalion can you imagine it by god how bloody grand for you alan laughed shaking his hand warmly here now do i dine you out tonight in celebration or is it your treat to wet down your promotion poor excuses for men scum cheap scum oh one pubichairs oh ive already been dined in at our mess burgess replied fanning himself with his black cocked hat good bunch of rogues they are let me tell you settled into my quarters been swotting up my hindee with my bearer nandu im the only white officer in the company you know rest are natives god you should dine at my bungalow my own private bloody house if you can feature it and cheap at the price too whole squad of servants well i share it with another officer but its so damned huge you must see it had a chance to get leave yet just this morning and more to come once the suns down tonight cony and i spotted a little street near here full of whores thought i might go back cutchwhores burgess sniffed having picked up the language awfully fast a lot faster than alan had fessenden the other captain i share the house with has three native girls in his bibikhana his own bloody harem rent clean uns cheaper by the month than an hour or two with the public girls or just buy em outright by god i could get to love the east indies alan exclaimed in delight knocked back on his heels by the possibilities but why im here met my battalion major when i was dined in and hes asked me to supper at his bungalow this evening and he extends an invitation to you as well now why the devil would he do that for me alan wondered i mentioned your name whilst i was giving my record burgess replied that business at yorktown the siege and our escape in those barges you cobbled into seaworthy boats came up and once he heard your name he was dead keen on hearing the whole thing start to finish and when i told him you were fourth officer in the ship that brought me out here he perked up sharp as a foxhound damned near ordered me to bring you round stap me if that dont sound hellish like somebody in this world thinks im famous for something alan exclaimed beaming still a little bemused by the whole thing but eager for a chance to shine with his bettersand a shot at free victuals god knew hed had little of either in the last year so who is this fellow major sir hugo willoughby burgess informed him he was once in the th regiment of foot the kings own knighted after gibraltar in the seven years war can you imagine a hero such as he taking service with john company oh alan replied weakly positively shivering with dread no it cant be him not out here he thought heard of him have you weve met alan allowed turning pale has to be some imposter using the name some poseur who can pull the sham off for a safe profitable billet out here in the back of the beyond back in london or during the war in the caribbean london alan admitted know him well then i say alan you look a trifle burgess pried his suspicions aroused by lewries sudden discomposure well enough i suppose burgess alan confessed see unless theres two of em in this world hes my bloody father chapter the old boy aint done half bad for himself alan had to admit as he partook of their regal meal officers of the east india company military or civilian had to provide their own quarters unless they lived in collegiate commons in the rougher posts such as bencoolen on sumatra or some taxgathering fort far inland and cheap as things seemed to be so far in india the house must have set him back a pretty penny or two they were dining on the second floor in a great room that ran the entire length of the building and overlooked the huge courtyard where the horses were stabled and the carriage was kept a courtyard aromatic with flowering bushes and trees the lower level was kitchens guest bedrooms office and library the bungalow was large enough for a rajahs palace hindoomoghul style more like a fairytale persian fortress set in a plot of ground that would have served for a small park back home the floors were highly polished teak on the second floor up where the breezes were tile and marble on the lower level the furnishings were a mixture of transportable militaryfunctional or chinee filigreed mahogany much like the chippendale styles that were growing popular back in london just before lewrie left sir hugos majordomo an older bengali in full regimental figobviously his personal bearer as wellstood by the sideboards to oversee the meal while younger males some no more than stripling lads neatly dressed in native styles served as khitmatgars to wait on table one for every two guests silver candelabras bowls and serving plates for the removes and made dishes made a parade up and down the long table alongside the brassware the plates were also chinee in the latest canton export pattern they dinedthey being sir hugo alan mr twigg and his partner mr wythy captain ayscough and burgess chiswickon a pleasing mixture of the familiar and the novel they had started with a rich oxtail soup just like they would have back in england but that had been followed by a spicy chillie omelet then a prosaic fish dish the khitmatgars next trotted out jangli murgee and teetar jungle game hens and partridge baked tanduri style with removes of mashed curried peas and carrots fried ladyfinger okra and pulao rice they had the traditional beef course though stringy and hard to chew possibly a recently expired munitions tonga ox but then had come shami kabab thick coinlike slabs of highly peppered minced mutton with lentils and instead of the thick soft spadeshaped nan bread the servers passed chapattis and then came the last dish the goat curry with the sambals of blanched slivered almonds shredded fresh coconut mango and coconut chautnee and a dozen more things alan couldnt identify but made such a pleasingly hot sweet crunchy blend of textures and flavors since they were in calcutta in the middle of bengal with all its sugarcane they had a choice of desserts fetched out on a teak and silver cart alan opted for khir a thick white milk and rice custard flavored with a glutinous sugar and lemon juice syrup finally the tablecloth was removed the port and cheese and extra fine biscuit set out along with a silver bowl of assorted sweet or salted nutmeats and the servants left sorry if i turn this splendid occasion into a durbar twigg began sighing in ecstasy as he eased his waistband and cummerbund but i thought a conference in social settings might be less noticeable than something more formal at fort william or aboard ship do you know if any of your houseservants speak english sir hugo chandra my personal bearer no others major willoughby replied and that only a few phrases excellent twigg barked obviously much happier with native foods in his belly and a superior port making the rounds well i suppose you must have been wondering why your regiment was chosen to deal with us obviously mister twigg you wish military forces that can cross the kala panee the ocean without breaking their caste major willoughby replied something involving your trading ship the telesto youre not really a country ship are you else youd not have had warren hastings ear over in fort william and gotten john company to cooperate with you so this is something palatikal and i trust secret hmm well ill be blowed tom wythy rasped out his face red as a beet from the heat the meal and the cargo of wine hed already put below decks hope youre the only one that can puzzle us out so easily never knew the old fart was so smart alan mused to himself damme if he aint smart as paint the old bastard the gup making the rounds is youre something under the rose sir hugo went on his face wearing a pleased expression of being more in the know than he was supposed to be that same look of smug selfsatisfaction alan had quailed at when he was living under the same roof with the man when sir hugo got pleased with himself it usually meant a spell of the dirty for somebody else and it was best to make ones self scarce as hens teeth but the other tradersll keep mum really now gentlemen dont look so confounded big ship like yours armed to the teeth overmanned even by east india standards and you arrived with a cargo that the company snapped up at premium prices soons it hit shore for which i say thank god for i bought moren my share of it and welcome your wines and brandies are out here youre almost too late to make canton for the trading season september to march even so but early enough to keep an eye on all those indiamen anchored out there in the hooghly loaded to the deckheads as they are with taels of silver to trade for china goods well im blowed wythy reiterated mopping his face clear of moisture from the afterglow of a hearty spicy supper i see where your boy lewrie gets his canniness sir hugo twigg nodded somberly his thin lips pressed together so snugly between sentences they almost turned white and one could not have shoved a slim nail between them veins on his temples pulsed betraying the obvious agitation he felt aye we are palatikal and we do have to get to canton or at least to lintin island before september where the hell was this lintin island alan wondered a little disappointed that he might not see the fabled canton after all he poured himself another

me remind you without the annual treasure galleons spain suffers id not expect a lot of help from them but to sanction piracy not them that leaves the french ayscough harrumphed clawing the idle port decanter to him and pouring a crystal glass to knock back without tasting whatever drove him ayscoughs hatred for the frogs was hot as a wellstoked forge cunning bastards sir hugo rumbled had my fill of em in the last bit of the war out here helping hyder ali and his son tippoo sultan skulking behind the scenes and urging them on to fight us but never having the nutmegs to take us on in a real fight aye sir hugo you find skullduggery in this world and ill lay you any odds you want itll be some modernday richelieu behind it ayscough agreed hotly spitting out the name of the old cardinalschemer like a sour turd hed dredged up in his soup the first to claim their superiority in this world like theyre the chosen people but theyre sneaking low vile torturing monsters under all their silks and lace their gilt and beshit manners and their honeyed words oh aye tis sharper than a serpents tooth they are we shall find these pirates captain ayscough let me assure you twigg prophesied grimly reaching out a hand like a taloned paw to pat the man on the shoulder and they will lead us to the frenchmen behind this hideous plot then well have revenge enough for all after ayscough had calmed down from his sudden fit sir hugo blew a lazy cloud of smoke at the ceiling and refilled his brandy ah thats more like my old father alan thoughtcant stir his arse up without a snifter in his hand so you wish me to supply troops from my pultan my regiment for this expedition against the pirates sir sir hugo asked yes twigg nodded theyre lowcaste did you say the nineteenth native infantry are mostly bengalis sir hugo informed them not a bad lot of scrappers though no brahmin no kshatriya and damme few vaishya caste if any were they were damned poor merchants cause they came into the battalion with nothing but the clothes on their backs no theyre almost all sudras serfs ryots or zamindars at best well needs must in wartime when we recruited anyone and i suspect ive an untouchable or two lurking mongst em but that dont signify longs they may form line and fire three volleys a minute theres even some goanese some half portugee mixed in from our being down south toward the end of the war out here no theyll go across the kala panee for you and not worry about breaking their caste when and where do you need em sir a halfcompany now aboard telesto for our voyage the rest transferred to bencoolen on sumatra to place them closer to the action until we need them a damned unhealthy place sir hugo replied shivering my god where out here aint alan muttered yih achcha jaga naheen eh mister wythy like you said this morning sickliern most young sir wythy assured him yes sicklier in fever heat and in morals sir hugo went on anyone sent there is sure to be peppered to his eyebrows with the pox regiments serving there go down like flies pox drink and just when did father ever worry about morals alan thought the death rate among even native levies is nothing short of extermination sirs sir hugo complained not to mention the effect the utter anarchy of bencoolen exerts upon troop discipline had you the brigade of guards in bencoolen you couldnt put a halfbattalion on parade fit for a days march a month later and thosed be so raddled and debilitated so mutinous youd not be able to turn your back on em for a second im sure your colonel would disagree with me sir hugo twigg replied his voice calm and reasonable but alan had seen that thinlipped asperity often enough to know he was on the verge of an explosion besides what good do your troops do us if we needs must return to calcutta to fetch em on short notice we do not have a colonel for this regiment sir hugo admitted he died of cholera and for your information the nineteenth ni is only six companies only a little better than a halfbattalion to start with it was never more than a onebattalion regiment anyway the hell you say sir wythy burst out covertly restraining his senior partner before twigg blew up at being sassed as i said we saw a lot of action down south against hyder ah and tippoo sultan sir hugo told them we suffered more than our fair share of casualties and when the war ended more than a few of my men cut their names to take their small pensions i doubt i could muster three hundred men this moment including officers the band and the colorparty and that sir sir hugo huffed with a cruel grimace at twiggs discomforture is why this battalion was made available to you we are all that may be spared trouble west and north in the oudh trouble with the mahrattas west and south trouble on every border of the bengal presidency if you transfer us now with no chance to recruit well sir hugo blew a smoke ring which seemingly mesmerized twigg were fit for garrison duties only now and theres not money enough to flesh us out send this battalion to bencoolen at its present strength equipped as we are and one might do my sepoys a better kindness by simply shooting them here in calcutta sir hugo related with a sad smile weve one foot in the grave already for what you want to do were a broken reed at present that is sir well damme twigg sighed at last leaking air and authority like one of that frenchman montgolfiers hotair balloons would it be possible to recruit the nineteenth here in bengal before we sail assuredly sir sir hugo beamed there is the matter of pay for the men though the joiningbounty uniforms muskets and if we become a fullfledged tencompany battalion once more the nineteenth would have need of a colonel once again that last made twigg smile bleakly even after being ordered by the east india company to comply with twiggs desires sir hugo was angling for a promotion to lieutenantcolonel alan raised his brows at what his father was hinting at no one else on the face of the earth would have the utter cockawhoop gall to do it he thought what have you now sir hugo twigg inquired a grenadier company light company and four thin line companies mister twigg had to combine a few to even field that and artillery alan asked two sixpounders id imagine at present yes son sir hugo replied eyeing him with a quirky bemused expression that had his dander up son indeed we might need moren that wythy opined if were gonna go up against pirates ashore ships artillery with suitable carriages twigg agreed excuse me sir lewrie interjected the pirates will live in jungles around lagoons with lots of sand then better we have lighter guns on light carriages three or fourpounders perhaps even some twopounder swivels or do we expect stone fortresses to be battered down in that case some heavy guns would come in handy yes more artillery light guns something like gustavus adolphus light horseartillery guns sir hugo pondered going for the brandy decanter again easier to manhaul through swamps and jungle id suspect a full battery six pieces too half battery for each wing should we encounter a whole village of pirates but that would take skilled gunners more than are available here in bengal most of the native artillerys a poor joke and the good artillerymen are mostly english already spoken for i might add i could procure the guns and carriages and i might find natives whove been around cannon it would help immensely though if some of your gunners could be seconded to my command to train and stiffen my lads i couldnt spare many ayscough squirmed why if were to trail our colors looking for pirates or run up against these french privateers well need every skilled man on my great guns surely mister twigg we could consider it sir hugo twigg allowed and lewrie thought he could hear the mans teeth grinding all the way across the table now how long do you think it would take for you to raise the nineteenth native infantry to fullstrength and train them properly well should hastings approve the expense this very instant id expect i could put ten companies in the field welltrained as an english battalion in four months more like six really if you want em steady sir hugo informed them damme sir i thought we were to be given full cooperation by john company ayscough carped we need trained troops now do we not better we should go back to this fellow hastings and tell him the nineteenth wont suit surely theres another unit that could take ship earlier than that we could find these buggers in the next two months and then were hamstrung without sufficient force caste captain ayscough twigg snapped this lot are the only ones available who could cross the black water without breaking their bloody caste and alan suspected twigg couldnt even dare go back to see this hastings fellow over at fort william he had requests from the crown in his pocket not orders from his fellow midshipman keith ashburn whose family was high up in the east india company he had learned long ago that out here in the far east and most especially in indian matters john company was a law unto itself right now they had a lot more on their plate than this one expedition no matter that it was east india company ships being taken as well as country ships theyd much prefer a navy of their own than have to run to hm government for help or let parliament get a fingerhold on their affairs what aid twigg had been offered unsuitable as it was was all he was going to get from the company nabobs and sir hugo knew it and then sir hugo went on blandly there is the matter of how much all this is going to cost arms uniforms accoutrements pay passage to bencoolen with all rations and supplies whats more just who exactly pays for it mister twigg partly from crown funds twigg harrumphed looking like hed been robbed at knifepoint john company will contribute their fair share andhere the grinding teeth could be imagined once morepartly from the proceeds we gain in our guise as merchants well if alls been approved so farsir hugo smiled once morethen id better be about beginning shouldnt i if we are agreed in all particulars hmm the nineteenth to recruit to full muster light artillery to be procured and carriages built troops to be trained for action somewhere in the far east transport to be provided to bencoolen once theyre ready of course he paused yess twigg drawled out his face flushing with restraint from mayhem upon sir hugos grinning phyz it strikes me as how you shall have a halfcompany detachment of my light company sir sir hugo sighed and one of my white officers and an experienced native subadar perhaps i should recruit to flesh out the existing light company in their absence and add a second light company for skirmishing stead of another line company that will put us over our usual troop allotment but under the circumstances it seems reasonable and in jungle conditions they might prove more useful or do you not think so mister twigg do what you think best within reason sir hugo twigg replied i cannot profess to proficiency in the arcana of soldiering but he said with one of those bleak little smiles let us say that we load cargo for canton beginning tomorrow we may be in the pearl river by the beginning of the trading season or slightly before late august we may stay the entire six months in canton we may not depending on whether we discover the identity or presence of those french pirates who have been preying upon english vessels we may need your troops earlier than march of so once you have recruited and trained your sepoys to a fair level of competence you will take ship to bencoolen on sumatra the problems there notwithstanding and continue to train in jungle conditions awaiting our summons the transport will stay with you so you might practice embarkation and amphibious landings in ships boats i do believe we are agreed in all particulars now sir hugo and i am sure that your brevet to lieutenantcolonel shall be forthcoming if you satisfy my desires hmmm i believe we understand each other completely mister twigg sir hugo smiled back of course they did alan thought his father had just picked twiggs pockets gotten himself a boost in rank and had the man over a barrel twigg had to give in or have nothing to fight pirates with the deployment to bencoolen was twiggs only sop to his ego sir hugo would pay that price for everything else thisll be expensive wythy sighed thank the good lord cotton an opiums deadcheap well still have a full cargo for canton opium mister wythy chiswick asked breaking his long junior officers silence thats some sort of medicament is it not sir an a most powerful one sir tom wythy beamed the chinee desire it moren anything we could haul from england their mandarinsd cut your head clean off yer shoulders for smugglin it but the profits so great they cant stop the trade ye smoke it sir smoke it an see the dragon bliss of heaven in a little pill of it rolled up in a pipe hard as life is for the chinee they need it an once they try it a few times they need it even more until they pay any price t get it the co hong merchants wont touch it but their creatures or the mandarinsll slip down t lintin island or nanao an buy evry scrap we may carry pay good silver too taels o silver lacs of the stuff see tis the only goods we have so we may get silver to support the china trade or wed bankrupt the treasury back home else country ships sell opium for silver the silver goes t the east india company for our legal cargoes and they use the silver t purchase teas silks furniture an such we make a profit on the opium the company makes money too couldnt make a farthing on the china trade without it captain chiswick sir hugo added the socalled celestial empire turns its nose up at most english wares oh some berlin goods some english woolens go down well clocks expensive gewgaws and toys but for bulk trade as im sure mister twigg will agree theres little we may offer they would buy arrogant bastards gangetic opium bengali and madrassi cotton from which they weave nankeen twigg added lazily with a wave of one lean hand i lay you any odds sirs that whatever frenchmen are behind this nefarious business will be deep into the opium trade as well so what better cargo for us the profit besides the stuffs cheap as dirt and goes for its weight in silver damn near from which profits we shall outfit sir hugos battalion and confound the plans of our foes tis only fitting if one thinks about it for a moment to opium wythy proposed raising his glass opium and lashes of silver once they had drunk the health of the humble poppy twigg rose well that should do it for this evening sirs sir hugo my thanks to you for a splendid repast whilst back in england i despaired id ever eat as well as ever i did in india and your khansamah is worthy of the great moghuls should you tire of having to beat him when he goes ghazi on you id admire to hire him as my personal cook twigg didnt even sound half disgruntled at being had so happy you enjoyed it sir sir hugo replied courteously knowing it was pretty much a gilt and beshit compliment that twigg was offering his hospitality a covering for the bile he really felt they filed down to the first floor entry hall to reclaim thenhats swords and canes prior to departure if you travel so wellarmed sir sir hugo seemed to come upon like an idle thought your ship telesto stands a much better chance of making macao than most your talk of opium to enter better into the spirit of your venture what would you say to allowing me to round up a few pounds of my own to purchase a few crates to go with your cargo as well full charge on the carrying fee of course a few crates aye sir hugo twigg smirked and alan suddenly realized why his father had seemed so pale and upset by the news about the indiaman the macclesfield disappearing hed probably had a ton or two of opium consigned into her but just why should i expect the greedy old fart to not essay every avenue on the way to bloody showers of blunt he wondered come to think of it if its that bloody profitable i wish i had a thousand pounds to purchase a share of the cargo for myself its nothing that evilits the backbone of the china trade twigg said so himself bide awhile alan sir hugo bade just before he got out the door if you may excuse my son returning to the ship captain ayscough we have much to catch up on oh shit alan sighed inside i should have known id not get away with a clean pair of heels chapter they repaired back to the upper level to another room that was screened off from the dining area by a carved wood purdah screen that ran the whole width of the huge main salon sir hugo shucked out of his regimentals doffing red coat waistcoat rank gorget and neckcloth he kicked off his shoes and dropped his clothes willynilly but there was a bearer there to catch them before they even hit the floor the white powdered wig with the tight sidecurls and short false queue went next as sir hugo unbuttoned his shirt and rolled up his sleeves make yourself comfortable lad he offered there were no real chairs or couches in this room so alan wondered where he could indeed make himself comfortable sit on the floor on the piles of richly brocaded pillows on the intricate carpets yes that was where sir hugo was seating himself on a bengali dhuree rug that held a dozen huge pillows while one of the younger khitmatgars came trotting in with a folding table support about eight inches high made of ebony wood and a second servitor fetched a huge brass table or tray maybe it did duty as both alan thought to sit atop it oh for gods sake take your ease sir hugo snapped there that tone in his voice was more like the scheming petulant bastard that lewrie had grown to know and despise you must be stifling in that neckcloth the khitmatgars were back with another load of goodies to set upon the tray table wine and spirits clay pipes and tobacco humidor a bowl of fruit and some candied dates even some persian muck they called halvah gauzy diaphanous insect curtains were lowered over the wide windows to the balcony whilst from outside i for gods sake a band alan grimaced as a set of native musicians hit their stride with something plaintively twanging ululating throbbing and thumping on sitars flutes and madals you do live well ill allow you that sir hugo say father do alan sir hugo grunted mine arse on a bandbox alan snapped back have it your own way but sit the hell down and have some wine at least sir hugo pressed in a reasonable tone alan heaved a heavy sigh and untied his neckcloth sank down to sit crosslegged on the cushions and took a glass of claret there were a couple of tall candelabras made of brass between them elaborate things fashioned from the arms and bodies of hindoo gods and goddessesthank the lord most of em had eight or ten arms to hold that many candles off to either side there were shallow charcoal braziers now fuming with sandalwood incense amid some other aromas keeps the mosquitos away sir hugo yawned sandalwood citron and patchouli christ knows what else better not to ask if im delaying your retiring alan offered impatient to go not at all i can still keep up with the young bucks of the first head sir hugo smiled lazily puffing on his pipe once more you always could i grant you alan agreed but then you were damn near a chartermember of the hellfire club back in your early days werent you he concluded with a suitably arch sneer and when did you become a regular churchgoer my boy sir hugo replied god if i only had penny to the pound of all the blunt i spent bailing you out of trouble id still be a rich man wasnt my caterwauling got you in debtors prison alan sulked wasnt me damn near pressganged me into the navy so you could lay your hooks on the lewrie fortune and how is grandmother lewrie these days mistress nuttbush now alive and kicking spry as a pup her kind always was harder to kill than breadroom rats sounds like you considered it now you do me too much injustice alan mdear oh please alan said starting to rise but sir hugo reached out and put a restraining hand on his arm bide awhile son he said and for once he sounded as if he was begging sir hugo st george willoughby never begged alan made up his mind to stay for a while longer if only to see him beg again how can you call me son alan shot out sure of his superior position over the older man for the first time in his life aye you sired me thats true but when it came to being a father to me you had your chance and all i ever got from you was a cold shoulder a snarl now and then i wasnt a son i was an investment your holecard to take the lewrie trick once was of an age to inherit and granny passed over and soon as it looked like happening you packed me off with that crimp captain bevan and had me off at sea so id never even know there was a lewrie family to inherit from you told me my mother elisabeth was a whore dead at my birthing that i had no family other than you god pity me you and pilchard forging documents left right and center to get what you wanted neededs more like it sir hugo confessed with a deprecating shrug and a sip of his brandy yes you always needed money alan pressed on harder trying to get a rise out of him to puncture that slightly sad but maddeningly calm demeanor damme he thought does the old bastard truly not have a sense of honor to shame and there was belinda and gerald their inheritance you squandered before they came of age too how was your marriage to the cockspur widow your second wife bloody depressing most of the time she was a termagant twit sir hugo chuckled slightly and gave alan a rueful grimace and a shake of his head in less than fond remembrance and how are belinda and gerald faring what the alan was rendered incapable of cogent speech by the mans sangfroid as if you care youre right i dont but i thought it would satisfy my curiosity about them sir hugo replied tippling another sip of brandy bloody awful children right from the start yet yet you treated them as the rightful heirs and me as the barely tolerated bastard alan barked well goddamn you of course i did agnes bloody sisters were still alive to plague me and to all intents and purposes you were the little bastard the byblow of a youthful indiscretion you wanted for nothing what else did you desire a damned pony and cart yes yes i bloody well did alan howled with rage i wantedalan was so full of rage of tears that he had to get out of the place before he killed the mani wanted a father i wanted a mother he shot to his feet to flee you had a mother sir hugo roared getting to his feet and seizing alan who struggled to get away she died and god help you you had me for a father such as i was you told me she was a whore alan screamed she was sir hugo screamed back know why i ran off with her jewelry in holland because i caught her in bed with another officer of my regiment whod made the crossing with us after we eloped you lying hound youve only heard your grannys side boy sir hugo ranted how sweet and innocent she was how i seduced her for her money and left her without a penny well let me tell you if shed lived id have lost count of how many times shed have put cuckolds horns on me god help me id be here in india after all cause itd be cheapern trying to get a bill of divorce through parliament i might have ended up on the gallows for killing her and her latest do you under stand me you little jinglebrains the last was punctuated with some massive shaking that almost loosened alans teeth in his head each time his jaw snapped shut elisabeth could be the sweetest liveliest most alluring damn woman ever i did see alan sir hugo relented at last easing his tone and his grip but i found out i couldnt trust her out of my sight oh we went to holland yes her daddy dudley lewrie cut her off without a farthing so we lived on my army pay and what little was left of my family estate after my elder brother got through with it mortgaged to the bloody hilt and do you really think i wanted to enter the army when i was sixteen like bloody hell i did i didnt get much of a choice either but that doesnt excuse alan almost sobbed i know son nothing excuses it sir hugo shuddered ive treated you like dirt your whole life thought i was doing well by you by my own lights and nothings going to make up for it but id like you to at least understand me if youre going to despise me to the end of time then at least do it for the right reasons if nothing else you miserable bastard alan hissed on the verge of weeping of falling on his fathers shoulder and crying his eyes out either that or fetching a curved tulwar a persian sword off the wall and hacking his head off sir hugo put a hand on his shoulder and gave him a soft patperhaps as close as he would ever get to empathy or comforting thomas de crecy sir hugo muttered heavily turning away good honest cheerful unfailing tommy my fellow officer in the th twas him arranged the minister and all for us to wed aye i remember alan said with a snort and a hiccup but it was a false justice married you i guess he didnt know you needed real clergy just a sham to get her into your bed no need of that alan sir hugo replied grinning elisabeth had the shortest pair of heels of any girl id ever seen wed already been bedded and i want you to know this laddy i loved her so dearly i was totally besotted money be damned i really did want her to be my wife ah but tommy de crecy knew what he was doing came over to holland with us brought my last installment of army pay stayed with us in the same town to see us through until elisabeths family came round and accepted the marriage do you see what he had in mind no frankly alan replied blowing his nose well there we were rapidly running out of money cause your grandfather dudley lewrie was tighter with a shilling than a maltese pimp and hed never admit the match but there was always good old tommy tommy with his little loans tommy with his lords purse tommy with his kindhearted generosity sir hugo turned somber and just a trifle angry even after all these years as he related this or as alan suspected he was a consummate actor and was putting on a sublime theatric you mean he was the one caught in bed with her alan asked dubious still hed wanted her all along aye sir hugo grumbled and bent over the tray table to pour them another stiff refill of brandy his face was older heavier lined the skin mottled by years of too much drink too much tropic sun in the last few the fine shock of light brown hair was receded and there were liver spots on the exposed scalp and alan noticed as hepoured the spirit so were the backs of his hands sir hugo st george willoughby was no longer the fashionable buck of st james place whites almacks he was a slack old man or near enough to it not to matter gone ropey and croupey he was waiting for the moment when elisabeth was at her weakest i suppose sir hugo maundered on when we both realized the enormity of what wed done and that things were most definitely not going to turn aright knighthood or not she was married to a penniless captain of foot currently unemployed trading down from good lodgings to the cheapest we could find and still wondering where the next meal was coming from im sure she wished she could repent and go back to her family and she always was an impulsive girl what i loved about her most really what better moment for good old captain the honourable thomas de crecy to inform her that the whole thing was a sham id dreamed up to get hold of her familys money and dont ye know hed just learned of it from another officer in our regiment and he simply had to rescue her from me but alan started to say then shut his trap hed never thought of his father as anything but inhuman never allowed that he could be hurt or feel pain especially since hed been so good at handing pain out to others so liberally this brutal bastard should be incapable of sorrow shouldnt he he asked himself elisabeth was carrying you by then making the whole thing worse and tommy swore hed always loved her more than life couldnt stand to see her in my brutal callous clutches all the sturm und drang so popular in womens novels these days all that gothick fright and flummery well dont ye know she spooned it up like cream the brainless little baggage sir hugo related sinking down onto his pile of pillows and stretching out on his side probably told her hed do right by her and the child maybe he really meant to ill never know but he came back from holland without her after a few more months after she began to show and he couldnt trot her out to anything elegant hold on though alan objected you still ended up stealing her jewels and abandoning her didnt you yes i did sir hugo nodded with not a twinge of shame twas the only way i knew how to get back at her after i caught them well i didnt exactly catch them bareback riding like i was with belinda when you arranged to catch me hmm no nothing that flagrant sir hugo snickered she was in her bedgown untied mind and nary a sight of stockings stays or corset to be found tommyd dressed so fast hed buttoned his waistcoat to his breeches flap oh twas a devil of a row we had after id horsewhipped him down the stairs she lit into me mind you also this was the first i knew that we really werent married so all i could do was rant and swear tommy was lying but she wasnt having a bit of it and dyou know lad but termagant as she was at that moment i had a sudden premonition of just how ghastly life was going to be with her from that moment on no trusting her with other men thout a leash on tears sulks and screaming fits for the rest of our natural lives ah but suddenly it struck me if were not married if tommy diddled the both of us then i was free as larks all i could think of was thank bloody christ this is over with and hit the road that night singing with relief as i remember but you took her last money she had tommys money sir hugo sneered then rose up on his elbow to look alan square in the face god knows i loved her more than anything or anyone else since alan but i really did need the money devilish bad and with tommy lusting after her hed replace what id taken and be damned to both of themthey deserved each other when you come right down to it jesus you really dont have any shame alan snapped getting righteous again too damn poor to have any shame you want to see shameless you should have been in my shoes with agnes cockspur belinda and geralds mother alan supplied fetching enough in the beginning fore she turned into this drab pudding sir hugo sighed chickenchested thick as a farrier sergeant rather wrestled a publican than put the leg over her like climbing into bliss on the belly of a bear and her two children were rotten from the start still she was absolutely stiff with chink and there i was in bath trying to parley what little i had left into something to live on had to resign my commission dont ye know an officer in the kings own knight of the garter or not cant abscond with young heiresses not unless ones successful mind then they make you colonel of the regiment and dine you in once a year i made three thousand pounds selling up my commission but it was going fast no i may be a bit harsh on poor agnes drab she may have been dull as ditchwater and graceful as a three legged drayhorse but she was a kindly stick meant well and then she died having our child and the child died too and elisabeth had died having you and i got to brooding on what had happened to you that was after you and your solicitor mister pilchard had forged that letter of permanent coverture over agnes cockspurs estate alan accused aye soon after that talented bugger that pilchard what else was i to do with agnes in her grave her even more ghastly sistersd have gotten the estate and the money and id be out on my bare arse again stuck with two brats id never have wanted if they came with the crown of prussia attached so you heard i was still alive alan pressed and you were as you put it brooding on me the only real child i ever had alan i found you and took you in because i swore id never marry again sir hugo told him of course i was just disreputable enough that the idea of me marrying into a really good family couldnt be mentioned in polite society pretty much the same thing really but you didnt act like i was your only son like i said i had to pretend to be caring for agnes brood for society to keep the sisters shut up after all if i didnt have them to care for a court would find it easier to take them away and award them to the sisters and the moneyd go with em what did you want beyond what any other lad of your station got my parents saw me at tea perhaps at supper once in the evening just before the governess tucked me in and after that it was a good public school somewhere far enough away so they wouldnt be bothered except when term ended why did you arrange for me to get caught in bed with belinda why did you exile me into the navy alan demanded though in a soft voice as he sat down crosslegged on his pillows once more the lewrie money sir hugo muttered barely inaudible and you were almost broke again werent you and you needed the money so devilish bad after much hemming and hawwing sir hugo could only nod his assent goddamn you alan slumped alan i am truly sorry sir hugo whispered your father is a miserable bastard i thought i was doing right by you not letting you end up dead in that parish orphanage feeding you clothing you getting you a good education you dont know how many times i was proud of you of how many times you reminded me of me even when you were up to your ears in pranks that backfired to my cost fine way of showing it alan muttered back staring down in his brandy and watching the candle flames dance in amber to the trembling of his fingers i thought you hated me alan no never hated you sir hugo insisted reaching out to put a hand on his shoulder maybe i didnt show you or tell you but i took you in out of guilt about elisabeth and about agnes i loved you alan i love you still ah right alan tossed off if i seem too selfish then thats my curse if i treated you standoffish then thats my loss sir hugo insisted and im still proud of you youve made lieutenant in half the time most people could expect commanded a ship of your own for a while made a name for yourself by being brave and clever i read every issue of the marine chronicle and the london papers looking for news of you came into the downs this sunday last the shrike brig lieutenant alan lewrie commanding to pay off at deptford hard with a sum in excess of thirty thousand pounds prize money owing officers and men from service with the leeward islands squadron most recently off cape francois under admiral sir samuel hood and commodore affleck i memorized it i cut it out and saved it i can show you maybe you could it dont signify alan replied bitterly your idea of affection is hellish like indifference to me your idea of love i could trade for two dozen lashes and stand the better sir for better or worse i am your father alan i dont expect you to ever love me or respect me either id admire if you could at least not despise me take whats past like the fine young man you are and put it behind you behind us sir hugo implored i imagine that youre the best of elisabeth lewrie and the best of me with all the rotten parts cut out like an apple only half goneover lot of pith left even so ill not ever expect us to be reconciled that would take a power of doing and longer than either of us have on this earth i expect alan answered well thats the way of it then sir hugo harrumphed and wiped a tear from the corner of one eye just do one thing for me what dont end up like me will you lad i dont know i have a fair start on it alan grimaced and found himself amused in spite of himself you take after me when it comes to the ladies hey sir hugo teased in frequency perhaps not well i havent cheated anyone not yet anyway alan allowed that captain bevan dropped me a line now and then about you i know about the ladies in jamaica sir hugo chuckled thats not the half of it thought id offer you a treat sir hugo said getting to his feet rather awkwardly part age and stiffness alan thought and part being halfseasover with drink sir hugo clapped his hands and the narrow door in the purdah screen opened three girls entered the room one dressed in a translucent saree the other two in the bright gauzy skirts and tight satin jackets that left so little to the imagination like the nautchgiils hed seen in the bazaar earlier my word he breathed they were unutterably lovely every one of em kohl outlined eyes shy smiles and bright teeth complexions clear and smooth and as brown as pecan shells or as golden as wheat this is padmini sir hugo said indicating the one in the saree who stood no higher than alans chin namaste sahib the girl whispered though grinning with an impish expression a bengali she is alan once youve had a bengali woman youre spoiled for anything else sir hugo chuckled draupadi shes rajput and apsara aptly named too for the playthings of hindoo gods though i doubt shes hindoo from up north in the oudh i think maybe from the foothills a little tigress all can do a dance thatll set your blood to boiling like to see i dont know alan sighed feeling anything but lusty for once all passion had been shouted or cried out of him maybe some other time sir good christ is it me saying that too late to be wandering the streets even in the english cantonments alan if nothing else accept my offer of bed and breakfast draupadi was stirring slowly to the beat of the madals from the courtyard smiling with heavylidded eyes full of promise her extremely long straight dark hair swishing maddeningly as far down as her fingertips and alan watched it sway he transferred his gaze to apsara she of the dark frizzycurly hair and the golden wheat skin who gazed at him with such a welcoming openmouthed smile er hmmm he pondered come alan sir hugo demanded i know you of old my dear son whats worse you know me id never cut my nose off to spite my face nor would i turn down such exquisite quim just because i bore a grudge against my host and i doubt if you would either ah alan tried to reply i have a lot to make up to you for alan his father said coming close to his side to speak privately maybe i never can like you suspect id buy you that bloody trap and pony if i thought you still wanted it but right now this is the best i have to offer and it may be your last chance before you sail off out of my life again safer than some bazaarirandi too and wont cost you tuppence marketwhores hmmm alan speculated at last dont suppose your band knows when first i gazed in chloes eyes would they hardly sir hugo barked out a short laugh ah well alan finally allowed sinking back to the carpet and reclining against one of those impossibly thick and round barrelshaped pillows with a crook of his finger sir hugo summoned padmini to join him alan crooked his own finger at apsara who beamed even wider and seemed to slink to his side with the lithe grace of a panther her patchouli and sandalwood scent enveloping him like her gauze chudder as she drew the headcloth about their faces to share a brief nuzzle before pouring him another full bumper of wine apsara he said alan ahklahn she breathed taking a sip of his wine my god in heaven he laughed with an anticipatory shudder of raw lust mind you father he said over apsaras smooth young shoulder you have one bloody hell of a lot to make up for yknow the evenings young sir hugo replied softly my son and draupadi began her dance her ankle bangles jangling iii divitis indiae usque ad ultimum sinum to the farthest gulf of the rich east town motto of salem massachusetts chapter another watch with percival the second officer alan sighed as he mopped his brow another broiling forenoon on a deck holystoned to pristine whiteness that reflected back the heat of the sun wondering if percival ever felt the heat ever grew faint and weak plenty of people drop dead of apoplexy back home alan thought why not this bluff ginger bastard bad as their relationship had been compared to the easy acceptance hed gained with the others in the wardroom it had gotten a lot worse after the durbar at sir hugos house to which even choate the first officer had not been invited and alan had lewrie suspected percival despised him in the beginning for rising so quickly in the navy and now most heartily despised him for being in the know for being privy to secrets for seeming so wellconnected with the people who matter here in the far east and back home with the admiralty yesterdays noon sights placed them exactly on the equator almost even with the johore straits the normal passage and by this noon they would have made fifty leagues to the north farther on even with fitful winds staggered almost to nothing by the heat at the equator with such a late start from calcutta theyd be lucky to make canton or macao by the start of the trading season if they arrived too late there might not be a member of the co hong who would agree to be their compradore in their legal trading mr wythy had worried there would be so many other ships anchored off whampoa full of cotton and spices that the value of their goods arriving so late would not fetch a price good enough to defray expenses all of which made lewrie wonder once more if this whole thing hadnt been dreamed up this tale of piracy to bilk the foreign office and the admiralty out of a free ship and cheap goods to make twigg and wythy rich if they cut up a pirate fleet or two in the process it would make a grand report back home but who couldn t find some pirates to bash out here he wondered its not as if one had to go looking for them very hard the whole ocean teemed with them like lice in a rented bed back home mr brainard the sailing master was an old china hand along with twigg and wythy in the country trade for years even captain ayscough had sailed in asian waters in the last war on the surface it would make sense to hire their services on but they all might be in combination to make a pile of money of course alan lewrie had always been a suspicious and somewhat cynical observer of his fellow man if the whole thing was so much twaddle he hoped there would be some profit for others out of the venture such as himself sail ho the mainmast lookout hailed fine on the starboard bows a little off the beaten track surely alan commented most merchantmen would be farther west nearer the malay coast id think say sir percival demanded softly aye aye sir alan picked back with a bright smile two sail both fine on the starboard bows the lookout added boy run and inform the captain alan told one of the ships boys my decision to make mister lewrie percival huffed i am senior officer in this watch and ill thank you to remember that aye sir go aloft mister lewrie report what you see i want an experienced pair of eyes in the crosstrees percival snickered aye aye sir alan was forced to reply much as he hated scaling the masts hed done enough of it as a midshipman and had been damned glad to make his lieutenancy which at least let him stay firmly rooted to a safe and solid deck most of the time but he slung a heavy dayglass over his shoulder like a sporting gun went to the windward shrouds and scampered up the ratlines out over the futtock shrouds that inclined outward to anchor the maintop platform and the deadeyes and shrouds that held the topmast erect hanging by fingers and toes briefly then up the narrower set of stays to the crosstrees where the lookout perched on slender bracing slats of wood a fat pigeon would have cast a wary eye upon where away hodge alan asked the grizzled older man three sail now mister lewrie the sailor replied pointing forward he cupped his workworn hands round his eyes to shut out the blinding sun an i aint so sure they aint summat up tlarboard as well sir jus a cloud mebbe sir cloud hell alan puffed trying to steady his shaking limbs to hold his telescope after that grueling climb four sail to starboard and perhaps two to larboard tell mister percival youve better lungs than i while hodge bawled his report down to the deck alan studied the view they were passing between a sprinkling of small islands and islets between two larger land masses anambas to the west of their course and a larger island of natuna to the eastrd there was a safe channel of at least one hundred miles width but littered with these reefs and islets perfect lurking grounds for malay or borneo pirates he thought theyd try to catch ships passing to the west of anambas after using the johore strait course they could be fishermen alan thought but as they drew closer hullup over the horizon alan could see they were using the barest and crudest of sail rigs and the froth about them was not a wake but the working of many oars and paddles far more oarsmen than any fisherman would take to sea the hulls were blood red winking with what he took to be gilt trim hodge inform the deck i believe theyre pirates alan stepped out of the crosstrees took hold of a backstay and wrapped his legs about it to let himself down to the quarterdeck hand over hand in seamanly fashion half a dozen to starboard three possibly four to larboard sir alan told the captain red hulls lots of paddlers or oarsmen war praos ayscough nodded grimly mister brainard aye sir any hopes the wind will pick up no sir the sailing master informed him not with this heat not this far easterly of the usual track weve everything cracked on now but the stunsl booms and not a fraction above seven knots do we make i see captain ayscough grunted then if we cant outrun em well have to fight mister choate beat to quarters what is it alan burgess chiswick asked as he came on deck drawn by the drumming and fifing of the ships small band his lean dark sepoys were struggling into their red coats below them on the gun deck just below the quarterdeck nettings pirates burgess maybe the ones weve been searching for subadar burgess bawled shouting for his senior native officer and clattering down to the gun deck telesto mounted a light battery of two twelvepounders forward on the focsle as chaseguns and another two right aft in the wardroom one to either side of the rudder and transom post to deal with ships attempting to rake her from astern there were six more twelvepounders on the quarterdeck three to each beam each gun took a crew of seven men to operate it efficiently in naval usage with a ships boy serving as powdermonkey to fetch and carry from the magazines for each one her main battery was on the upper gun deck twenty eighteenpounders which required nine men apiece even in the royal navy both sides could not be fully manned at the same time so there were only eleven men per gun to share between which would require some nimble hopping back and forth if the pirates attacked from both sides at once three men to load and charge each gun and the rest milling about in the center of the gun deck to haul on the tackles to run the guns out and throw their weight on handspikes and crows to shift aim right or left while the guncaptain would adjust the elevation of the guns with the new rotating screws all were mercifully equipped with flintlock igniters like a musket instead of the older types that required a tin or goosefeather quill priming tube and a slowmatch fire it was on the lower gun deck though that telesto hid her heaviest punch roughly amidships behind what seemed to be unused gunports that had been expanded in size for ventilation in harbor or ease of cargohandling she had a battery of thirty twopounder carronades these were light shortbarreled guns that could be handled by only two men per gun they threw a massive sixandtwothirdsinch shot not for much over two cables or thirteen hundred feet but when that solid shot hit at lower velocity than the conventional guns above them on the upper deck they ravaged whatever they struck they were mounted on slides with a greased block of elm between two wooden rails with an iron roller to handle the lighter recoil and they could pivot on a large iron wheel much farther forward or aft than a gun on a wheeled truck and had a much higher rate of fire than anything but a light swivel gun as junior officer that was alans station the carronades were his charge he thundered down to the lower gun deck passed down the narrow passageway between bales and crates of cargo into the secret section amidships that held his battery four guns to each side tompions out he ordered tossing his hat to one side about ten native pirate ships stand ready to engage on either beam lets keep the gunports shut until theyre close enough in to scare the bejeesus out of em aye sir charge your guns serge bags of mealed gunpowder came up from the magazine on the orlop and were handed over by the powdermonkeys to the guncaptains who inspected them for dampness weight and rips or tears then they were handed off to the loader who inserted them into the short widemouthed barrels the guns had been run back to the last extent of their recoil slides so a flexible rope rammer with a wooden head could push the charges down to the base of the gun with a hard shove shot your guns both men heaved up solid iron balls from the shot garlands made of armthick hoops of discarded anchor cable with a little elevation screwed in already the balls rolled down to thump against the powder bags easily requiring a lighter shove with the rammers to seat them firm to cut down on too much of the charge escaping past the windage difference of ball and muzzle thick hairy patches of raveled rope were soaked in the firebuckets and rammed down atop the balls prime your guns cartridges were pricked with the sharp end of a linstock a measure of powder from a flask hanging from around the guncaptains neck was dribbled into the touchholes and pans of the flintlock mechanisms now pulled back to halfcock the frizzens over the pans were shut stand easy lewrie ordered he wished they could open the ports if the deck had been a roasting pan then below decks was an oven and the aroma of crate after crate of opium balls of it as big as a mans head was making him a trifle dizzy the hatchway over his head was rigged with a grating that grating covered with a tarred sheet of sailcloth so there was no hope for any air the gun crews swayed to the easy motion of the ship sweat running down their bodies in buckets shirts cast off looselegged sloptrousers rolled up to the knee legs and feet bare with only their kerchiefs above the waist now tied round their heads to save their hearing once the guns began to sing stand by the forrud chase guns a voice bellowed and above the sound of the ship as she worked and groaned they could hear drumming not the jerky uplifting drumming of the ships bandsmen but a steady monotonous boomboom boomboom reckon atll be th slavedrivers sir the senior quartergunner speculated as he shifted a large cud of tobacco in his mouth keep t pace fer th oars saints praysairve us an irish loader whispered crossing himself and fingering a tiny silver crucifix round his neck and good artillery preserve us hoolahan alan said with a brief grin good artillery and sharpeyed gunners a twelvepounder barked from the starboard battery then the lower gun deck drummed and echoed as the upper deck ports were drawn up and out of the way and ten eighteenpounders rumbled across the oak decks on their little wheels and ungreased axles loud as a cattle stampede alan crossed to the starboard side to peer out a slitdrain in one of the gunports about eight cables off now half a dozen of them i can see he was interrupted by the blast of the forwardmost eighteenpounder as it lit off followed in stately controlled progression by the rest of the starboard battery telesto groaned and rocked guncarriages squealed as they ran in to the limit of the breeching ropes with the recoil oh good shooting the leaders been hit hard dismasted lot of oars smashed too as he watched a gun in the bow of the prao returned fire a large brass gun overly adorned with the scales mouth and dorsal fin of a dragon for such a large burst of smoke the shot fell short throwing up a huge gout of water in a tall feather of spray stone shot sir the quartergunner said bad powder winds dying alan whispered and shared a worried look with the man the ocean was flatter hardly ruffled by wind heaving slow and steady almost glassycalm farther off toward the horizon do you know how to whistle owen ill get on it directly mister lewrie sir telesto sagged a little heaved and rolled more gently a sure sign that the wind was failing them and that they would be becalmed at the worst moment in the middle of a fleet of pirate vessels that could row circles around them it was an ancient belief that whistling aboard ship brought more wind than any seaman could handle at that moment alan would have settled for a good hope gale the hatch grating over their heads was drawn back and cast aside and hogue the masters mate stuck his head down to yell at them mister lewrie youre to try your eye once theyre in your range both sides at once if you please sir undo the lashings on the gunports and be ready to raise them gunfire roared out again this time from the larboard battery and they could hear other guns off in the distance pirates guns telesto rocked a little more energetically as a heavy stoneshot struck her somewhere aft there were some warbling sounds as handhewn shot crossed over her decks from either beam but then the starboard battery crashed out its defiance once more and men above them gave a great cheer alan put his eye to the venthole of the gunport and saw that one of the praos had been struck in the best english manner twixt wind and water and had opened up to the sea like a shattered tea cup weve one to starboard closing us bowson about three cables off alan shouted open the ports run out your guns take aim cock your locks this prao was about seventy or eighty feet long low and rakish there was no deck just a platform in the stern for the helmsman and captain and a focsle deck forward for two guns between there was a walkway that ran the full length of the boat like an etching of an ancient roman wargalley it bristled with flatfaced little men in turbans and printed skirts armed with spears and swords and a few muskets here and there there was one mast amidships with an arabiclooking lateen sail furled up rowers thrashed the water to a foam as they drove in on telesto the guns fired telesto was hit once solidly and once in ricochet as one ball splashed short and raised a great waterplume close aboard ready alan called as you bear fire the carronades barked as their light powder charges went off ran back to slam into the stops of their slides wool rammers soaked in the firebuckets were swabbing out at once as the smoke slowly dissipated lewrie could see that their target had been smashed the prao roped and pegged together like a dhow had broken into pieces spilling her hundreds of warriors into the water her bows were torn open and she was already on her way down which caused the ones behind her to falter in their rowing and turn away from a headon attack it was then that alan could see the many skulls festooned on the closest ones gunwales for decoration ready larboard he gulped in alarm jaysus hoolahan yelped there was a prao not a full cable off the larboard side arrows and blowguns were working quilting their ships side as the little yellow men slaved at readying a pair of guns run out they beat the pirates to the first shot four thirtytwopounder balls hit her squarely abeam and she shook like a kicked dog huge holes opened in her sides the guns canted up and disappeared somewhere amidships and they could hear the screams she rolled back upright shaking her mast down in ruin and kept on rolling filling with the sea and went down like a stone thats the way lads thatll teach the heathen devils the chaseguns fore and aft were firing the upperdeck batteries were speaking now a lot faster than those controlled steady broadsides of earlier now and then there were sharper bangs as a light twopounder swivel gun up on the upperdeck bulwarks was fired loaded with grape or canister to starboard one pirate vessel was almost under the bows too closein to be hit with any guns alan could hear muskets going off in volley and the screams of the pirates as they were scythed down there was a heavy thump and telesto still with a slight way on her shouldered the foe aside with contempt as she drifted down the starboard side a hail of grenades with their fuses burning was tossed into her and a couple of swivels went off spewing death and pain down into her open hull even as her yelling crew tried to scale the ships sides a pirate appeared in the foremost starboard gunport curved sword in hand they had no boarding weapons on the lower gun deck usually they had no need of them no pikes cutlasses pistols or muskets even alan was without his sword it was hoolahan who gave a great celtic howl of rage and rammed a handspike into the pirates face tearing it open and shoving him back over the side with a shriek of agony lowest elevation number two gun ready fire lewrie shouted the prao swirled on the faint bow wave and drifted off about forty feet the carronade roared and almost immediately the ball hit the prao in the sternpost which tied her together with the keel members the helmsmans deck and the entire stern disappeared and that was one less to worry about even if half her cutthroat crew was still clinging to telestos side as they reloaded it rained bodies outside the gunports as chiswicks native troops stabbed and shot with their muskets and bayonets and the upperdeck gun crews plied cutlasses and boarding pikes filled shot alan demanded give em grape and canister hollow iron balls were fetched from the garlands rammed home and seated the next prao that loomed up to larboard under the guns of the upperdeck battery got it full in the face when they hit they shattered into whining razoredged iron shards scattering their contents of plumsized grape and musket balls in a flash the prao rocked and heaved and her crew went down in piles hewn down like corn stalks she was still afloat but she was out of the fight bearing her cargo of dead and dying at that sight the rest of the pirates bore away paddles flashing quick as runners heels to escape the unequal slaughter the upperdeck guns began to bark once more in controlled broadsides out to about a nautical mile and a quarter the eighteenpounders could hurt the foe while his weaker older guns could not respond out of our range alan said finally as their last volley from the carronades fell short quartergunners stand your crews easy sponge out but have charges and shot ready to load if theyve a mind to try us again aye sir alan was soaked to the skin even in his lightest clothes he wanted air and a long drink of water from a scuttlebutt take over for me ill go on deck where i may see the better he flew up the ladder to the hatch and emerged on the upper gun deck mctaggart was there among his gun crews as they sponged out and reloaded warm enough work fir ya mister lewrie mctaggart teased wearing a pleased expression twas a plucky pack o rascals they sent ageen us we almost had them in for tea below decks mister mctaggart alan replied with a smile not to be outdone in calmness now that the enemy was flying shocking manners they had though och aye nae the sairt ya could take tae plite compny mctaggart laughed which made his gun crews respond in kind cease fire choate the first officer bellowed from the railing of the quarterdeck mister lewrie aye sir take a ships boat to yonder praot choate ordered a file of those soldiers as well mister twigg wants prisoners if there are any at once sir the pirate boat they had gutted was rocking slack on the sea her red hull slimed with fresh crimson from all her dead and wounded no one challenged them as they came alongside no swords were raised as they gained her bulwarks and dropped over to the rowers benches those pirates that were not incapacitated shrank away with fear as they saw european faces on their decks followed by a havildar or sergeant of bengali infantry and a squad of sepoys came on board with bayonets fixed on their brown bess muskets my god alan gasped the smell of death was everywhere so quickly in the searing sun coppery odors of spilled blood mixed with spilled entrails smashed limbs opened visceras loose bowels and bladders pirates now looking small and wiry instead of seven feet tall and dangerous lay quivering in their death rattles or whimpering and crying in pain stopped their business most wondrously sir twigg said as he poked and prodded the nearest corpses with his smallsword aha what have we here he bent down to tear a necklace loose from a dead man who was dressed in silk it was heavy gold links and depended from it was a large pectoral about inches across set with emeralds and a large ruby in the center big as a robins egg twigg pocketed his prize wrapping it in a calico print handkerchief a bloody prince of someones blood he spat a successful searobber until today that is havildarji disarm those men and bind them jeehan sahib the sergeant replied what are we looking for sir alan asked wishing he was anywhere else evidence mister lewrie twigg said expansively a bit of loot from a ravaged ship some clue that these might be the ones we seek and some sign of who encouraged them its not often ive seen their kind take on a ship big as ours even if the wind was against us theyre not fools mister lewrie the hope of gain would have to outweigh their fear of european firepower poke about see what you may turn up aye aye sir alan replied he wandered up forward towards the focsle platform his sword drawn and ready should one of those mangled bodies show signs of life god knew there were weapons in plenty scattered about to use should one of them wish to take one of the infidels with him to paradise the peoples of the region were mostly muslim hed learned killing him would raise their stock with allah what he found was some gold coins of asian minting a heavy gold ring or two some earrings all useful he thought so he stuck them in his breeches the muskets were chased with silver of an ancient pattern with long barrels and crude matchlocks or even wheellocks the swords and knives curved easternlooking things or wavy bladed krees mottled with damascan forging techniques profit for the mornings work twigg exclaimed back aft as he turned up a small chest of treasure the sailors and sepoys were not averse to looting the corpses either sir alan called come take a look at this one of the cannon on the forecastle platform was a ninepounder the truck had been smashed and its crew draped about it in death but it was not a brass or bronze asian gun with fanciful adornments it was a brutally plain and functional european gun with a flintlock striker and british proofmarks to further prove its origin there were serge powder bags scattered about and a flask of quickburning priming powder hung round the dead gunners neck no way of knowing which ship it came from but its a start twigg nodded rubbing his horny palms together could have been off any of those ships reported missing and the date is within the last two years no rust sir alan commented kneeling by the cannon id not expect their sort to take this good care of an iron gun shes freshpainted and wellgreased still for an iron barrel at sea to be this clean it had to be very recent and flints sir you know how often flints break or wear out look at this one in the dogsjaws of the lock thats english too sure as im born very astute of you mister lewrie twigg congratulated he was interrupted by the havildar who had turned up several brown bess muskets short land pattern also fairly new now well have the truth out of these rascals fetch me that one havildar well find where they hailed from and well go pay them a visit theyll not soon forget twigg was not too particular about how he got his information in local lingo he began to shout and rave in front of the first man fetched up by the sepoys he made passes with one of those wavybladed knives lewrie thought he was merely threatening until he at last made contact along the struggling pirates bare waist just the slightest touch and there was an instant line of blood droplets twigg seized the man by the scruff of the neck and shoved him to the rail to look over the side with the krees at his throat the tropical sharks had been drawn by the blood in the water the dead of the other praos theyd shattered and sent down with gunfire fins cut the calm sea some lazy and searching some darting and quicker on a scent the pirate began to scream and shout louder than twigg and his accusations and questions look here mister twigg sir alan was finally forced to say when he knew the older man was deadserious about dumping him over the side as sharkfood hes not anybody id care to know but damme sir its just not done if youd rather not watch youre welcome mister lewrie twigg replied go back to the ship then its not just that sir surely theres a better way than to alan protested both he and his english sailors were upset by this treatment try as they had not too long ago to cut these people to minced meat once a foe surrendered to their code he was to be well treated british tars had a strong sense of what was right or wrong and were not averse or slow to voice their opinions even under the threat of naval discipline feeding survivors to the sharks is nothing more than they expect sir twigg argued his blade still to the struggling mans neck no more than we could expect from them were we at their mercy we are not dealing with honorable foes whove struck their colors you damned puppy theyre bloodthirsty murdering piratical butchers look over the side look under their bows sir see the skulls of their victims some of those are englishmen sure as youre born aye we can treat em christian and theyll laugh in our faces for our pains but wed not know where they sailed from nor who supplies em and thatll mean more english sailors murdered or tortured to death for their barbaric amusements now which do you prefer sir seems to me mister twigg that one persons barbaric amusements is pretty much like yours alan drawled sir goddamn you you priggish little hymnsinger back to the ship ill deal with you later leave the sepoys and fetch me when ive done gladly sir they rowed back to telesto still lying slack and idle on the gently heaving ocean with her sails slatting and booming for want of wind hammers and saws thudded or rasped as repairs were made to what damage theyd suffered lewrie accosted captain ayscough on the quarterdeck and related what twigg was doing ayscough drew his pocket watch from his breeches and studied the face then cast an eye aloft to the coachwhip of the long narrow private house flag which flicked lazy as a cats tail in the weak zephyrs shall we allow him to proceed sir alan asked hoping for an order from his captain to go back and tell twigg to leave off as he waited for ayscough to answer there was a shrill scream from the prao followed by a splash and a sudden commotion in the water as the sharks found a tasty new tidbit id admire if you assisted the third officer aloft mister lewrie ayscough grunted his countenance dark and suffused with repressed emotions theres damage to the foretopmast to put aright god grant therell be wind soon so we may proceed stead of lying here boxing the compass but sir enough ayscough snapped then relented with a bitter sigh welcome to the mysterious and cruel far east mister lewrie aye sir the wind came up about an hour after noon sights and telesto made her way north once more the prao they burned as a warning to the others her survivors those that had not suffered twiggs cruel attentions hung like plucked fowl from her lateen yard by the neck chapter they anchored at macao two weeks later after riding out several heavy gales of monsoon winds and rain twigg wythy and ayscough went ashore to the chinese customs house to get what they called a chop which would allow them to proceed up the pearl river to the traders anchorage at whampoa an island twelve miles below the city of rams china s only trade outlet to the outside world in the meantime they would transfer cargo even before their party had returned from shore a rickety local lorcha came alongside with written instructions from twigg that they should transship the opium to her reputable merchantmen could not be seen engaging in the opium trade that was for the local portugese who did not require a chop to go upriver a short way the captain and mate of the lorcha were filthy brutes part indian part chinee and only part portugese oh they were clean enough to not stink as bad as telestos crew but there was about them such a nefarious and desperate air of the practiced cutthroat that no one especially after the affair with the pirates wanted to get anywhere near them as though they reeked of evil the lorcha was long low rakish and fastlooking armed to the teeth with swivels and lighter fourpounder guns and her crew sprouted wickedly sharp weapons from every pocket they look as though they sleep armed to the teeth alan commented to mr brainard the sailing master once he was in warmer waters brainard had shucked most of his woolen clothing for light cotton or nankeen and looked particularly keen and energetic once more if one wants to stay alive in macao one does brainard said with a chuckle the most sinful city on the face of this earth no error too much money to be made here too many temptations to steal or murder for it and engaged in the opium trade as they are theyre on the razors edge who knows when the mandarinsll decide to take em and strangle em for smuggling you cant trust anyone except the members of the co hong upriver not to cheat you or pirate you for your shoe buckles man wholl trade with you one tripll have you killed the next and them not a week apart there were eight rules for traders from the outside world in the pearl river no foreigndevil warships above the bogue at the mouth of the river no women guns spears or any arms allowed at the factories or hongs in canton all ships had to register at macao as well as all river pilots and ships compradores each factory could have no more than eight chinese working for them so the fewest people would be contaminated by foreigndevils foreigners had to forego the pleasures of sailing the river for pleasure only on holidays could foreigners go to the flower gardens or the honam joss house and then no more than ten at a time and only when accompanied by a linguist they could not stay out after dark or carouse foreigndevils could not present petitions to the native viceroy everything had to go through the co hongs eight members the co hong could not go into debt with foreigners smuggling was forbidden and lastly foreigndevil ships could not loiter about outside the river but must go directly to whampoa instead of selling to rascally natives goods subject to duty that these may smuggle them and thereby defraud his celestial majestys revenue it was also alan learned against his celestial majestys law to teach foreigndevils chinese so trade was carried on in a mix of portugee chinese and english called pidgin the closest the chinese could come to saying business anything anything that upset the touchy mandarins could bring a total cessation of trade which hurt everybody so merchantmen had to obey tremblingly as the chinese officials concluded their documents yet at the same time a lively and illegal trade went on downriver at lintin island and at nanao brainard had even told of mandarin boats ordered to enforce the ban against smuggling and the opium trade which contracted lucrative deals and smuggled the stuff up to canton themselves tonight this lorchau be receiving a government mandarin on her decks brainard explained hell get his tobacco and wine warn about lingering in the estuary instead of going direct to whampoa and then hell get down to brass tacks how many chests hell ask and well tell him outright then hell figure out what he thinks were worth and ask for his singsong hell want a serenade alan grinned god help him if mister twigg takes his bagpipers along then no his singsong is his cut his cumshaw his custom allee same same singsong allee same custom brainard laughed after hes been feted and bought off thats the signal for the real traders to come aboard and purchase then the lorcha comes back to macao full of silver taels and taels of the bloody stuff maybe five or six lac with the amount of opium we have on board young sir a lac let me inform you is worth about ten thousand pounds merciful god alan gasped in awe and youd better believe the custom official ashore yonder in macao knows exactly what were doing here and our chop will conveniently not arrive aboard til weve disposed of the opium so we can sail upriver innocent as newborn babes gad what a country so what are the chances of our suspected french privateers being at this lintin island sir alan asked depends on whether theyve arrived or not we may ask about but not too much else wed raise too much suspicion might even affect the price of our cargo brainard frowned if theyve looted all the ships we suspect they have what they didnt have to share out to their native associates they might already be upriver off whampoa piefaced innocent as any other merchantmen then theyd be a big ship like us sir alan pressed possibly something fast like one of their latest seventyfourgunned third rates converted to a merchantman like us but that pretty much describes half the ships in the world that could get here if they came here at all well sir alan speculated theyd have to dispose of their illgotten gains somewhere why not here oh ill grant you that soonerr later theyd be stuffed bung to the deckheads with loot brainard snorted but they could drop it at he de france in the middle of the indian ocean at pondichery or chandernargore and ship it home on a compagnie des indies ship with no one the wiser but theyve taken indiamen and country ships loaded with silver or opium the silver they could keep maybe load it into a second vessel but the opium would have to be sold here where else is there such a market for it and where else on the chinese coast would the mandarins collude with em which is why were here young sir we may not be right but it is a strong chance once were up at whampoa and at canton ill warn you to keep a weathereye peeled for anything out of the ordinary as if china isnt enough out of the ordinary sir alan said with a shrug i doubt if id know what to look for i leave that to our supercargoes twigg and wythy they know the trade well as anybody and pirates alan muttered under his breath i know that cut a bit rough on you to see what twigg did brainard said comfortingly but theyd have gotten the same after an admiralty proceeding stretched by the neck by captain swing wish wed had the time to hunt down their anchorage and chastise em just a bit more i was thinking more of the way he got his information sir and not much of that either ive spent years out here in the far east and the great south seas its the way of things out here something to leave behind you once you get back into the bay of bengal or the cape of good hope dont fret on it if you say so sir alan replied but seeing that made me feel a lot less guilty about my own faults i dont think i could ever torture a man to death or feed him to the sharks for the fun of it wasnt fun mister lewrie brainard sniffed just business chapter whampoa reach was so densely crowded with shipping when they dropped the hook after a fourday voyage up the teeming pearl river that they barely had room to swing the river had narrowed from a wide estuary to a proper river at the bogue after the first two days the river pilot that guided them had gone hoarse cursing the sampans and junks full of fishermen mendicants and permanently poor to get out of their way and the closer they got to canton the more it seemed that the pearl river had been cruelly inaptly named it stank worse than the old fleet ditch the hooghly or the thames bearing as it did the ordure and the garbage of untold millions of chinese from its mountain birthplace to their anchorage there were ships of every nation there crowded into the reach as cheektojowl as the thousands of native boats that made up floating suburbs too poor to live on land dane and dutch flags fluttered above vessels so beamy they looked like buttertubs there were spanish and portugese ships swedish ships and a few merchantmen from hamburg and the baltic even a pair of prussians there were british east indiamen as lofty and trim as the stoutest ocean bulldogs of the royal navy and country ships looking more rakish and piratical than something from a defoe tale there were russian ships even some austrians and lesser nations from the mediterranean and there were three or four racebuilt and oversparred vessels a little smaller than most flying the new stars and stripes of the late rebel colonies now graced by the name of the united states of america and the french huge merchantmen of the compagnie des indies and their own country ships whampoa island from september and the delivery of the first teas from inland to the first of march when the chinese would order them out and the monsoon winds shifted to make faster passages home would be a floating international city of its own below the distinctive islands pagodas and towers alan lewrie reckoned it would have to do for the next few weeks with so many strictures on merchantmen as foreigndevil barbarians there wouldnt be much in the way of recreation except for the infamous hog lane ashore in the factory ghetto of canton bumboats came alongside in a continual stream offering whores and gewgaws but no captain in his right mind would put his ship out of discipline in such an alien harbor outnumbered as they were the hands eschewed these poorer offerings and waited their turn to visit hog lane where they could swill and swive no matter that the women would probably be peppered to their eyebrows with the pox they heeded no warnings and no captain could enforce celibacy without having a mutiny on his hands the men had had enough of boxing the jesuit and getting cockroaches as they termed solitary stimulation there were other ships to visit if ones idea of fun was going aboard another ship after spending up to six months aboard one already most provided what little entertainment they could and telesto was popular since she had bagpipers the handbellows organ and some accomplished fiddlers and fifers to amuse her visitors and her own hands but even here they were limited by the strictures of the host nation once at anchor they had put out a ships boat so the bosun could row about to see if the yards were squared away properly and a mandarins junk had been there in a twinkling shouting pidgin orders against boating for pleasure alan suspected the mandarins got a cut from the many sampans that ruled the tweenship traffic who charged exorbitant fees to ferry foreigndevils about their prices changing with no rhyme or reason almost from one hour to the next the visiting back and forth would have made it easy to snoop and pry to find their suspected french privateers except that alan wasnt allowed to after their last encounter he was pretty much in twiggs badbooks again and idled aboard ship most of the time there was work to do and he was made aware that he was indeed the fourth officer the most junior therefore the one most liable twigg and his partner wythy were thankfully out of his hair they had gone ashore to take borrowed or rented digs at one of the established hongs in the factoryghetto doing arcane trading things such as turning their lacs of silver into checques for safer transport arranging the purchase of teas silks nankeens to be woven by hand from indian cotton and showing patterns for sets of china and lacquerware and diagrams for the latest styles in furniture wanted back home in england so they could be manufactured in time for departure their cargo of opium the officers were informed in the captains quarters had fetched over eighty thousand pounds sterling above what theyd had to pay out to customs officials and mandarins as bribes which sum made every officer lift his eyebrows and make small speculative humming noises hmmm damn profitable work for navywork hmmm made them wonder just what percentage would be droits of the crown what part droits of the admiralty and what precedent there would be about shares after the expense of the voyage was subtracted in peacetime there was no prizemoney for fighting and taking a ship in combat and there never was much profit in taking a privateer which was why they flourished so easily made them wonder if anyone from the crown would mind if they laid a few thousand guineas aside for contingencies and never reported it never reported any profit at all perhaps and pocketed the sum entire lewrie finally got shore leave after a couple of weeks in company with mctaggart again he went over the side and took his ease in a large bumboat a scow or barge practically as wide as it was long for the twelvemile row to canton they were ensconsed in capacious chairs on the upper deck while seamen had to idle on the lower deck in a herd of expectant and recently paid humanity they sampled mao tai brandy and lolled indolent as mandarins though the fussy and presbyterian mctaggart had some qualms about being too comfortable in this life they wafted up the narrowing river between the mainland and honam island a faerieland of willows delicate bridges parks and ponds where the joss house was and the homes of some of the richest chinese merchants of the co hong but honam island to larboard was not their destination they were landed at jack ass point next to one of the customs houses the sailors from several ships gave a great cheer and dashed to the right of the huge square for hog lane leaving mctaggart and lewrie to descend and alight theres mair commerce in this ain place than the pool of london mctaggart exclaimed as they goggled at the piles and piles of goods the hordes of coolies fetching and toting and the sampans being loaded and unloaded on the far side of the square there was a long row of factories broken only by hog lane china street and a creek on the other side of the factories or hongs there was a wide boulevard and the consoo house the headquarters of the yeung hong sheung better known as the co hong and a matching row of old and delapidated minor hongs of chinese merchants there on sufferance from the co hong the whole thing was walled in from the rest of the city to prevent the natives from being disturbed or corrupted by the barbarian traders but the consoo house and most of the hongs on that side of factory street as theyd been warned were offlimits for them except for a few shops in old clothes street and carpenters square at the far righthand end of the ghetto feeling naked without a pistol sword or even a clasp knife they made the best of their time ashore first stop was at the chun qua factory third building east of china street to their far left where theyd established headquarters conveniently right next door to the french compagnie des indies factory ah welcome ashore at last tom wythy grated sounding anything but welcoming as he sorted through packets of tea on a table have an ale chinee muck but not as bad as some he had a large tub near his feet filled with ice and rice chaff from which he drew two stone bottles and preferred them cold ale alan frowned aye ice comes all the way from siberia fars i know run by some poor coolies an god help em if it melts on the way the way they like it wythy belched no accountin fer taste among savages refreshin on a hot day though i must admit mm not bad at that alan commented after an appreciative eructation of his own close enough to homebrewed mm if the inns commonroomsr chilly as most back in england let it stand awhile if its too cold fer ye mister mctaggart what are you doing sir mctaggart asked gradin tea such as i may sit ye down to see as they quaffed their ales wythy laid out samples explaining their grades and desirability the smaller the leaves the better the tea there was coarse black bohea from late in the growing season worth something in trade but not much a poor mans tea another black tea was congou what the east india company bought in quantity the best black teas were souchong scented with flowers and pekoe which was only of the best young spring buds delicate and very dear then there were the green teas gunpowder and pearl tea and yu tsien which were the choicest spring pickings and in descending order hyson skin and twankay which was mostly used to adulterate batches of the better pickings yes ive always found the younger the bud the more fun to pick as well sir alan grinned unable to contain himself as the lecture ran on and on and on more like deflowerin mister lewrie wythy rasped yed be the best judge o that im sure ye mind my warnin about the local lasses both o ye twas macaor nothin no women in the factories ye know yet there are women in hog lane sir for the sailors alan inquired do the chinese mean no foreign women or no women at all aye fer a whiff o silver ye may find custom though i warn ye both theyre sure to be poxed so bad even the surgeons mercury cured only slow it down wythy allowed but something more discreet uhm more select for senior traders sir alan pressed softly and was pleased that wythy gave him a shrug and a sly wink so the mans not a total lout he thought a tai pan head of a trading house well there are places wythy grunted not at this time of day the chinee is a hardworkin bugger the days fer making profit if the humors on ye so devilish hard mister lewrie ill give ye the fairest wind to steer yer course by but pon yer head be it mind aye sir alan agreed id expect nothing less well be off with ye ive work to do sup here with us at seven o the evening in the meantime enjoy the sights take a peek about go visiting wythy enjoined winking once more and jerking his head over his shoulder to indicate the french hong next door i spotted some nice bargains along china street they finished their ales and went outside into the heat of the day after a couple of cold ones it didnt seem that bad any longer and there was a decent breeze to keep the hordes of flies at bay and cool the air at least it wasnt calcutta or the equator i despair o your immortal soul mister lewrie mctaggart sighed with a longputupon air wenching is that all ya hae on your mind sir if left to my own devices yes alan confessed willingly youre as much a heathen as een o these yellow fellas a bluidy pagan mctaggart spat i doan know why i abide your compny church of england actually not pagan alan corrected same bluidy thing mctaggart sighed they shopped in china street running into burgess chiswick who was out browzing in company with his native orderly nandu both wearing civilian clothes burgess was loaded down with packagesor at least his orderly was the most unbelievable things alan burgess enthused laces as good as any from flanders or holland and damnall cheap too a whole tablecloth for the price of a mans shirt can you credit it hollo whats this in need of fanning burge alan teased for mother and for caroline even one for mammy your grandmither mctaggart inquired somewhat confused family slave been with us for years burge informed him offhandedly couldnt bear to sell her off at charleston so she crossed to england with us practically raised me those smaller bundles are silk shawls for all cant go to a drum or dance without a fancy shawl and a chinese fan now can they slavery mctaggart shivered and wandered off on his own what the devil did he mean by that chiswick huffed by god if hes slurring my family because we no reason to take offense burge alan said grinning between my morals and you a slaveowning carolinian hes having a hellish hard day of it the devil take him then him and his bluestocking airs my dear burgess the devil wouldnt dare alan drawled after plunging into the market alan was entranced all over again just as he had been in calcutta there was so much to see so many new aromas to savor so many goods in so many shops that would have gathered mobs of oglers back in london though most of them could never afford most of it as novel as any rareeshow on earth and once more he was glad hed sailed halfway round the world to see it hard as the sailing was between ports this experience was something hed never forget as mementoes he bought a fieryred silk dressing gown for himself all figured with dragons in green and iridescent blue that leaped off the cloth a small carved ivory junk some marble models of temple dogs for his mantel wherever that would be once he was home and with mention of the lovely and gentle caroline chiswick he purchased a pair of earrings and a necklace made of jade ivory and silver beads to go home to her on the first indiaman clearing port for england they loaded nandu down like a packpony and sent him trotting off to the chun qua factory while they took a standup repast of hot soup and noodles from an openair vendor and strolled the square most particularly that part of the square behind the french factory now what the devil alan mused aloud as they saw some of the items being carted up to the factory from the docks and customs house on the quay can you tell me what these are sir alan had inquired of a man dressed as a european seaman mseur the man replied turning to face them park vous ianglais mseur can you tell me ah mais out zose mseur ze shark feens the man said well now ive heard just about everything burgess griped whatever are they for pour ze potage mseur the sailor explained pardon jsui marcel monnot notre ship la malouine et vous after they had introduced themselves monnot went on ze shark feen soup mseurs zese chinetoque zey manger zese potage mak zem he could not think of the english word so he rammed an expressive fist at them grasping his arm at the elbow pour ze old homme wiz ze fair jeune fille n estce pas mak iverge formidable ha ha like oysters burgess cried in delight for renewed vigor with the ladies god as many sharks as we saw on the voyage here i wish wed known of it do they pay dear for them then ah mais oui mseur monnot agreed heartily un feen zey pay trois quatre livresl he told them with an expansive gallic shrug vee ave beaucoup feen mak beaucoup livres hah bon well damme alan commented merci mseur monnot vee ave also ze ginseng mseurs vair good same aussi monnot allez vite revenir aux travaille some petty officer barked and the man bowed his departure leaving chiswick and lewrie to stroll among the boxes and crates as he went back to work i never heard that ginseng was a restorative in the carolinas burgess said made a good healthful tea was all we used it for mother swears by it but its hard to find maybe i should buy her some and ship it home well there were some slaves who said it was an aphrodisiac but you couldnt put much stock in some of their tales and furs alan pointed out oh yes mister twigg said the chinese dont have many good furs have to come from russia or somewhere ermine sable glutton mink or suchll sell dear here in canton i met one of those yankee doodle skippers this morning said hed been to the nootka sound on the bering sea he was trading furs quite profitable he told me my you have been busy this morning alan snickered them that had a little english burgess allowed with a shrug as they idled against a stack of crates to watch the coolies and the french crew unload a junk that had lightered their cargo up from whampoa reach rest of it was way over my head never thought id have to learn anything more than a little cherokee back home im lucky i can savvy just enough hindee so nandu and my subadar dont cock their heads and look at me queer i say good pelts those that yankee captain didnt have better what do they sell for alan asked idly finding the spying business a dead bore as the hot afternoon wore on he told me hed get almost one hundred of their dollars for a pelt burgess informed him hmm wonder what that is in real money alan mused aloud i think its somewhere between five and six pounds sterling but heres the profitable part alan the nootka sound indiansll swap you a prime pelt for one fourapenny board nail struth can you credit it course you were among the creeks and the seminolee well we werent doing much trading cept for my wife your what and on their way back to the chun qua factory alan regaled chiswick with the tale of impregnating the cherokee slavegirl rabbit and being forced to purchase her from her owner for a dragoon pistol a cartouche pouch a shirt and a pair of deer hides and there you are paying court to my sister caroline and you a married man burgess japed i should write and warn her how fickle your enthusiasms are chapter their supper that evening at the factory was another of those marvels to a palate ruined by ships rations or by the blandness of english cooking alan thought except in the rarest instances oh there was lots of rice but like the supper at sir hugos bungalow in calcutta it seemed that hundreds of dishes made their appearances as removes some fiery hot some crunchy and only mildly spiced some almost recognizable and some that could only be identified by comparing them to puppyspew or one of william pitts hairballs the lone chinese tableservant announced the name of each dish with wythy translatingpork chicken beef lobster bits shrimp oilfried omelets and such lewrie decided they could call em devils turds long as they kept them coming wythy alone of their company ate with chopsticks in the native manner and put away as much as two of them together with a frantic neatness not a wasted motion when he was at table ah wythy said at last when the final dish and the gigantic bowl of rice had been removed perfection from the soup to the nuts speaking of soup mister wythy alan asked attention fixed on the port decanter that the servant placed by twiggs elbow do these chinese really eat soups made out of birds nests and shark fins oh aye they do daft on em they are wythy rumbled with a laugh birds nests well thats the mandarins style eat such exotic shite suchs their emperors court can obtain like the old romans larks tongues mouse cheeks an such to show off how wealthy they are twigg commented the rarer the victuals the better show they put on for their guests to flaunt their wealth an yell have noted no doubt how most o the really nabobrich chinese tradersr fattern falstaff wythy added alan hadnt noted any such thing but he gave the comment a sage nod of agreement wythy had fed himself into such a good mood and alan wanted nothing to upset him wythy hadnt told him where the safer brothels were yet peasants in the countryside are one crop away from famine twigg said and its short commons for most of em just take a look at the people who live on all those sampans we passed on the way upriver for comparison poor as irish crofters and about as starved most of the time its a virtue to the chinese to get rich and set a table such as a duke could afford back home er about the shark fins though burgess pressed does this soup really restore an old mans vigor well im nowhere near needin restoration yet sir wythy boomed with amusement like a thumped barrel but theres more wonders in this worldn ye could shake a stick at ive heard tell it works mind ye that was from chun qua himself who knows whered ye hear o shark fin soup oh there was a french mate on the customs dock this afternoon alan replied finally getting his hands on the port and pouring himself a full bumper they were unloading bales of the damned things strung together like fish on twine must have had thousands and getting three or four livres apiece for em too he told us a french ship twigg commented raising his eyebrows to alan to start the decanter leftward down the table to his empty glass aye sir and what else did they land on the docks twigg inquired furs sir burgess supplied nootka sound pelts quite a lot of em uhm birds nests all sorts of stuff right alan well most of it was crated or bundled i did see the furs and the shark fins though alan allowed id have to take your word on the birds nests burge that and the ginseng ginseng twigg barked and set the decanter down on the table with a loud thump ginseng dyou say sir oh yes burgess bubbled on their mate what was his name monsomething no matter said they had ginseng aboard i believe he said its about as good as shark fins to aid old men in passion our old slaves back home in north carolina said mister wythy twigg interrupted almost shushing chiswick to silence correct me if i err but ginseng is primarily a chinese herb is it not sir aye tis wythy agreed but is there not another source in this world for ginseng twigg pressed i speak of another member of the araliaceae family the panax quinquefolius which produces the same five leaves scarlet berries and succulent root and is not north america the colonies former colonies now the only other known source of ginseng ah ha wythy grinned slowly in confirmation tell me more about this ship sirs twigg demanded well shes the la malouine sir alan stated ah ha wythy said once more maddeningly obtuse to them do you think she might be the frog privateer we seek sir chiswick asked she very well might be twigg replied nodding grimly well she stands out compared to those ships weve snooped around so far wythy informed them most of em seem fairly innocent see sailin outa pondicheryr chandernargore isle of france or all the way from lorient or nantes on the french biscay coast may not signify but yes but for several intriguing buts tom twigg rasped such as sir alan inquired by then totally mystified to have furs a ship must sail to the bering sea to trade in nootka sound twigg said beginning to tick points off on his long knobbly fingers then trade among the sandwich islands cook isles otaheiti and all to get the birds nest sandalwood and shark fins but for even the smallest crew to sail that far and live among the polynesians for the duration of that voyage they would have to forego much cargo on the way outward for supplies to keep the hands fit now tell me young sirs were they landing anything else indian goods perhaps aye sir cotton bales brassware spices crates of silver well now thats an extremely odd mix of cargo far out of the ordinary for most french indiamen or country ships twigg mused tenting his fingers under his cadaverous chin and gazing at the ceiling and i need hardly tell a seafarer such as yourself the near impossibility of that do i mister lewrie uhm lewrie commented stalling for time and wondering what in hell twigg was talking about twigg dropped his gaze from the rafters to alans face like a tutor expecting him to recite have to go to nootka sound early in summer late spring sir he began grasping for ideas all the plum wine hed put down with supper didnt help that process that means theyd have to leave pondichery or wherever even earlier in the oh oh indeed sir twigg said grinning a little the monsoon the summer monsoons are out of the souwest as early as theyd have to leave alan continued and about the time theyre changing from the winter noreast winds theres violent weather then no one in his right mind would try that and then theyd have to sail clear across the entire pacific maybe a three or four month voyage to be first in for the furs as early as may when the ice melts and then to gather all the rest on the way back maybe they have an arrangement with some o the polynesian islanders t arrive an pick up shark fins an all on the way out or dont have t spend too much time on the way back wythy added so they might save a full month all told already loaded to the deckheads though with cargo lewrie beamed wheres the room for food water firewood loaded with what wythy snorted cotton sure t take fire if ye close it up too long get a seepage an watch it swell like a hundred tons o sponges an break yer hull by god opium dont keep that well that long either either lose yer ship get marooned with the savages or watch yer best cargo spoil on ye they could leave here in march and go direct to nootka sound twigg prompted or make a round voyage every two years instead of the one like some of those former rebel skippers do then they would have to spend their time fighting the noreast monsoons east and north of guinea alan said remembering his falconers with the same storms when the winds shift out of the soueast about six weeks later than the indian ocean as i recall it would be impossible to make much headway tacking closehauled into a norwester and if they went directly from macao to nootka sound whered they get all the indian goods then excuse me sirs if a landsman sticks his oar into the water burgess chuckled but what if they go to india in march thence to the nootka sound riding the favorable winds and only do the twoyear round voyage money burgess alan replied smirking they aint navy who could afford to pay a crew for twice the work and only once the profit and there is the matter of spoilage like mister wythy said fascinating speculation is it not sirs twigg said happily and finally there is the matter of this ships name la malouine we may deduce that her master could possibly be a breton we may further imply that he is from st malo on the northern brittany coast who else would name a ship la malouine bretons have been pirates privateersmen and shipwreckers since before the times of caesar ideally placed to play merry hell with channel commerce an activity in which theyve indulged since the last legions marched out of england and france theyre some of the best sailors france may boast of as good as any liverpool or bristol privateer and twice as bloodyhanded bit obvious though alan said in the long silence that followed i mean the name of the ship too i dont know pass me that bloody port lad theres a good feller wythy said while you cogitate ont theres closer places to get birds nests spice brass and shark fins you know twigg told them a lot closer to canton or the bay of bengal the malay pirates even from mindanao they hate sharks so much they go out of their way to kill them catch them and force spiny seaurchins down their gullets so theyll take days to die a painful death make them suffer for every one of theirs the sharks take or mangle best lead weve turned up yet wythy summarized yes tom twigg agreed we must look into this la malouine find out if shes compagnie des indies or a country ship where shes homeported where shes been seen the last year or so have any of us paid her any mind yet is she a tubby little merchantman or is she a converted warship small crew large crew how well armed who and what are her officers how much opium she sold at lintin island too if shes payin her way sames us wythy stuck in course if shes the one were lookin for ye may count on looted opium an pure profit damme i wish id been on the customs dock this morning twigg rasped one sight of those shark fins and that ginseng and id have tumbled to em a lot sooner speaking of sir where would they get ginseng sail all the way to boston for it burgess inquired the ginseng aye mister chiswick i suspect theres a yankee merchantman gone missing we shall have to ask around among our dear divorced cousins they may have overreached themselves in that matter maybe they took it maybe their native confederates took it and handed it over for arms thinking it might be worth something either way theyve blown a hole in their cover a small hole but a hole nonetheless and what may we do to help sir burgess asked looking as tailwagging eager as a foxhound pup about to be let out with his first pack not a blessed thing twigg replied quickly and with some affrontery you two leave this part of the business to them that wont give the game away ill not have these frogs put on their guard by a mistake by some cunnythumbed cackhanded amateurs oh but yeve done grand nough so far lads wythy interceded wed not know anythin but fer yer observin and bringin up the subject of that ginseng but remember were trying to pose as innocent as the frogs are yer not practiced at this so ye go on with yer duties and yer sightseein sames the frenchd expect from ye do keep yer eyes peeled though on the sly dont go too sneakinr actin suspicious but just idle about and take note i see sir burgess replied still in a bit of a pet after twiggs scornful dismissal of his services no matter how wythy had softened the blow circulate act the calfheaded cullys but watch when ye may not a sharp watch mind but watch wythy concluded chapter they waited and they watched in fact once telesto was totally unloaded and riding high in the water there was very little else to do whampoa reach was the place to idle from september to march their cargoes of tea were not in canton for quick loading they had to come down from the hinterland what they had purchased were only sample packs of the years pickings the lacquerware furniture and china had to be manufactured during the winter season then loaded lot by lot it took chinese laborers time to weave nankeen cloth silks ribbon and fancy goods wallpapers had to be made first then meticulously and slowly printed by asian methods or painted by artists by hand with their bamboo pens and brushes ropeyarn sunday thank god alan muttered to himself as he emerged on the quarterdeck it had rained during the night and the masts sails and rigging overhead dribbled fat cool drops of water from aloft as if it rained still there was a slight fog over the pearl river and whampoa reach a fog that amplified the creaking of the myriad of vessels as timbers and planking settled anew as rigging slacked tension and the masts worked against themselves as thighthick mooring cables groaned against the hawsehole timbers and tinny watchbells tinkled like a forest of windchimes all set on chronometers that would never agree with each other telesto had been a scene from the ancient egyptian pyramids the day before gundrill repel boarders drill striking the upper masts and yards down to the lower fighting tops and gantlines only to hoist them aloft once more and reset the standing rigging starboard watch against larboard watch anything to keep the men from going stale with idleness today though today was ropeyarn sunday a day to celebrate idleness a day of makeandmend bedding and hammocks could be aired and resewn personal clothing could be washed and darned those intent on their carvings their scrimshaw shipmodels and hobbies could indulge themselves there would be music a time for dancing napping or pleasant conversation sailors could caulk or yarn to their hearts content if they stayed aboard or go ashore and sample the dubious pleasures of hog lane once again a member of the sailmakers crew would get rich today he had found a source for sheepgut and would exhaust his stock of condoms among his shipmates after the first few days and the first hands had wept in agony each time they made water off the beakhead up forward the surgeon had made a good living too fifteen shillings per sufferer was the tariff for the good doctor to administer the mercury cure a sheepgut condom sewn up by a trusted shipmate was only eight shillings which left money for enough rum to allow a man to forget telesto for a while and avoid the pox morning mister lewrie sir young hogue the masters mate said doffing his hat in greeting hogue looked ill enough to be already counted among the dead hed been one of the surgeons first customers and the mercury cure was no stroll in the park on a sunny day hed lost fifteen precious pounds had gone by turns white as a ghost or grey as old linen and even now freed from his sickbed looked about as cadaverously deceased as zachariah twigg anything stirring mister hogue alan asked nothing yet sir though tis hard to tell with this fog lets be at it then alan sighed he handed hogue a large mug of sweet hot tea taking in exchange a brassbound telescope as large as a swivelgun and they mounted to the poop deck above the captains greatcabins went aft to the taffrails over the stern and lashed the telescope to the barrel of a swivelgun to steady it alan swept back the sleeves of his fiery red silk dressing gown and bent to study their quarry la malouine as they did every morning naming that ship la malouine was about as toplofty as calling tom turdmans scow the flagship of dung wharf hms victory alan thought sourly la malouine had turned out to be a rather old rather shabby east indiaman in fact she was so old she still sported a lateen yard for a spanker on the mizzenmast over the poop rather than a more modern gaffrig inquiries had revealed that she was of about nine hundred tons burthen short bluff and beamy as a dutchmans wooden shoe and had been a familiar sight in the far east for years she had at one time long before he was born alan suspected been a compagnie des indies vessel but had been discarded and gone independent once newer construction became available as her adriatic oak had succumbed to rot and teredo worms shed been rescantlinged with teak until she could truly be said to consist of teak almost totally teak lasted damnnear forever even in the tropics and with new coppering on her quickwork below the waterline la malouine might aspire in future to that full century of service mr brainard had spoken of her home port was pondichery on the southeast indian coast her master m jacques sicard was a delightful little gotchgut with a waggish sense of humor a sharp nose for trade and a repute as a moderately honest man bloody waste of time alan grumbled standing back up to sip his own tea seems to be sir hogue agreed glumly he gave a great yawn from being up all night in the middle watch to spy on their neighbor being newly returned among the healthy didnt help either anything occur during the night alan inquired setting his mug down and taking a fastpaced stroll round the confines of the poop deck swinging his arms to dispel the sluggish nighthumors from his blood hogue almost had to trot to keep up with him there was some visiting sir off a couple of french ships hogue related puffing a little music and dancing some breastbeating saints day i think st vitus by the looks of it but all quiet by ten of the clock i say sir oh sorry mister hogue alan relented slowing his pace as hogue almost sagged to his knees i forgot youre lightduties yet still nothing better than to be up and stirring good for you if left to himself alan lewrie would be anything but up and stirring at that ungodly hour and well he knew it but there were certain platitudes naval officers were supposed to mouth to juniors certain examples to set for their edification aye sir hogue replied looking a trifle dubious under his firm nod of agreement a captain of marines once told me to stay fit alan related aboard ship if ones aft on the quarterdeck its too easy to go soft and potty gets you killed in a fight never gets you the ladies he concluded with a knowing wink after the mercury cure sir i hope i never cross the hawse of another woman in my life hogue groaned nonsense just fother a patch over your hull before you hoist battle flags mister hogue see archibald and buy yourself an eightshilling condom good as any from the green canister in half moon street back home well cept for being poxed to her eyebrows she was a cunning little wench sir hogue had to admit albeit sheepishly after four more circumambulations of the deck they returned to the telescope and made a great dumbshow of studying all the ships within sight through the thinning fog always coming back to la malouine nothing stirred but the crewmen of her night anchorwatch alan saw a french masters mate take off his hat scratch his scalp and give out a great yawn so wide it was almost painful to watch which made his own jaws ache at first then yearn to gape in boredom as well doesnt much resemble a pirate does she sir hogue whispered as he sat down on one of the signalflag lockers to enjoy his tea cant imagine her catching an indiaman much less cowing one with her little battery alan agreed theyd been rowed past the ship several times on errands or visits to other vessels farther down the reach la malouine mounted eightpounders fore and aft as chaseguns and iron twelvepounders on either beamonly sixteen of those in total too there were no secret lowerdeck gun ports such as telesto had either and la malouines waterline was so bearded with marine growth the tendrils seemed to wave at them in passing no matter that she was coppered to slow the weeds down flying everything but her masters shirt and breeches it was doubtful shed attain nine knots in a full hurricane hmmm alan muttered as a native sampan came sculling out of the fog behind their quarry damn early for a social call hogue took the eyepiece while alan retrieved his own mug of tea and sipped it with pleasure the wardroom servant had made it almost boiling hot and thickly laced with molasses sir hogue hissed hes bound for her theyre hailing the anchorwatch now hollo heres a newun let me there was a european in the sampan dressed in white shirt and black breeches white stockings and woven sennet hat as lewrie watched he stood up grabbed the manropes and ascended the boarding ladder battens with a lithe easy grace alan got the impression at that range of reddish hair remarkably pale skin and a faint smudge of beard on the strangers lean face yes he is a new visitor alan mused do you keep an eye on him mister hogue this fog should blow off soon perhaps by the time he departs we may spy which ship he came from ill be below shaving sing out if you discover anything aye aye sir hogue replied with a small nod and the sigh of the permanently putupon well bedamned to him alan thought as he made his way forward to the ladders that led to the quarterdeck hes a midshipman even in disguise hogue ought to know by now to expect the shitten chores snotnosed younkers he sneered god save me from lazy midshipmen hogue was waiting upon him when hereturned to the deck as were the rest of the ships officers eight bells had rung ending the middle watch and all hands had been piped to begin the ships day ropeyarn sunday or not the decks still had to be scrubbed down washdeck pumps were being rigged and the hands were milling about rolling up the voluminous legs of their sloptrousers above their knees holystones ready to begin wetsanding the decks the captain twigg and wythy brainard and choate were all present on the quarterdeck percival and mctaggart were forward supervising the bosun and his mates a good morrow to you mister lewrie ayscough grunted looking no more thrilled to be up and about at that hour than anyone else captain sir alan replied doffing his hat yon visitor aboard la malouine ayscough continued sounding hoarse as a bear with a head cold seen him before have you no sir well mister hogue informs us he departed not a quarterhour after he came aboard her ayscough harrumphed went back downriver to another vessel still foggy but she seemed to be about the fourth or fifth somewhere thereabouts that would be either salem witch or poisson dor sir alan said recalling the rough chart of the anchorage theyd sketched over the last few weeks a massachusetts yankee lots of them were privateersmen during the war sir maybe this ones not yet given up the trade and what of this poisson dor twigg demanded newly arrived sir choate stuck in shes a small threemaster about six or seven hundred tons burthen she looked to be arrived just at the end of september sir suppose she got her name from her paintwork ochre hull picked out in white along the bulwarks and gunwale black chainwale sames most ships poisson dor gold fish dyou see he concluded with a sharp laugh they did but didnt find the play on words as amusing as choate did which forced him to utter a cough and harrumph of his own to sober his thoughts youre the only one thats seen her so far i take it twigg pressed what did you think how was she built manned and armed well mister twigg sir shes about the same size as one of their new frigates choate continued were she a french royal ship id take her for a thirtytwogunned fifth rate pretty finecut entry and forefoot so shes not that old some of their latest construction she had what looked to be eightpounders for chaseguns what else she mounted i couldnt tell the ports were shut but when i was rowed past her she was unloading cargo and i didnt see over one hundred hands all told were she a civilian ship shed not need sixty hands in peacetime mister brainard speculated in these waters thatd be about average for a crew and if mister choate says shes fairly new shed be fast as the very devil just like most frog ships thatre frigatebuilt outrun pirates fastern you could say jackketch what else did you espy mister choate twigg grunted what impression did she make upon you well sir she was set up good as bristol fashion looked to be a pretty ship choate shrugged in confusion saucy sort of hands were dressed neat hull was coppered and her waterline was pretty clean like she was recently careened and breamed i see twigg rasped pulling at his long nose in frustration odd though for visitors to come calling so early in the morning even before mseur sicard could be expected to have his breeches on so far twiggs enthusiasm about la malouine had seemed to be sadly misplaced although the ship had a larger than average crew that would be only as expected in a country ship that had to face the danger of piracy on her lonely voyages she was slow as christmas couldnt outrun a wellpaddled prao so those extra hands would be necessary to man her guns repel boarders if necessary or deal with the natives on those mysterious islands far out in the great south seas where la malouine traded for sandalwood birds nests furs and shark fins what made la malouine at first suspicious could be explained away easily and after a time had been there were at least ninety french ships in whampoa reach and all during september and october they had speculated upon all of them now it was nearly midnovember and they still had no solid leads no standout suspect to bait alan felt a twinge of sorrow for twigg and his eternal suspicions about even the most trivial thing but only a slight twinge of sorrow he had to admit so far this adventure was a dead bust and they knew no more today than they had the morning theyd sailed from plymouth perhaps their disguised foe hadnt come to canton at all and was lurking somewhere far out to sea outfitting to begin another season of piracy once the opium and silver began to flow outward from india the next summer twigg and wythy were from some shadowworld anyway lewrie sighed as he watched their lanky secret agent pace deep in thought god knows hm government paid the bastard to distrust everyone show twigg an entry hall back home point out the blackandwhite marble tiles and the bloody wretchd see grey between the cracks get out a crowbar and have em up to see whats underneath and ill bet that ajit roy of his tastes his food and drink first too alan suspected might not have come off this poisson dor at all sir alan said hiding a wry grin of almost cruel amusement at twiggs expense i mean this fog hasnt burned off or blown away whos to say what ship he really was from once near salem witch or poisson dor he could have doubled under their sterns and gone somewhere else and neither hogue nor i recognized him could have been anyone sir why the covert visit at such an hour then sir twigg said turning to stamp back to them why double under another ships stern or bow to throw us off as you put it unless there was a good reason id not expect even a blind man could miss our continual observations by now mister lewrie should never have entrusted spyingout duty to you or any of the ships people in the first place i sir hogue intruded on the beginning of twiggs latest tirade against amateur sleuths damme if this aint the same bugger to the letter sir a little decorum if you please twigg snapped none to take notice but us be about your regular duties tom wythy went to the starboard rail with him and they proceeded to stroll the gangway as innocent as newly risen babes alan went back up to the poop deck to supervise the scrubbing jiggling and thumping the mizzen shrouds and backstays with a belaying pin to test their tension as a ships officer or mate would every morning there was a sampan coming by and a european sailor sat almost in the bows on the squarish bow thwart a man dressed in tan canvas trousers faded blue shirt and dark blue sailors jacket with a red kerchief about his neck his feet were bare and horny as any sailors and he looked sublimely at ease to ride without labor for a change leaving the poling or sculling to the chinese at the matching stern platform a clay pipe fumed lazily in his mouth just forward of amidships not quite under the thatchlaced cabin of the sampan sat another european though and damned if he wasnt the same man alan had seen scaling la malouines side not half an hour earlier closer to when he could steal a glance at the sampan he could espy a very slim young man perhaps only a few years older than himself there was that same dull red hair pale skin and a slight very tenuous attempt at a beard which was the same dull ginger a beardlette which followed the line of the jaw very low down perhaps the mans essay at hiding what seemed a rather slack chin or drawing the observers eye upward from a prominent adams apple well ill be blowed alan whispered they come calling the sampan was not exactly aimed at telestos main chains and boarding ladder but she was tending slowly enough in that direction to give the impression that that was her destination what the hell alan strode to the rail to look down upon them directly as the sampan got within good musket shot about yards off since no one else seemed ready to do their duty or even take outward notice of the sampan as they sostudiously avoided eyeing it someone should do the normal thing damme yer eyes bosun he shouted to the quarterdeck below then turned to face the boat and cup his hands to shout ahoy in the boat there passant the sailor on the bows replied with a wave of his pipe jabbing the stem upriver in the vague direction of jack ass point bon matin mseur and a good morning to you as well sir alan waved back bon matin a vous aussi off to cherchez las putain in hog lane which raised a great gallic shrug and laugh from the sailor if you are i hope your weddin tackle rots off alan muttered still smiling you poxy frog bastard the sailor waved back once more as did the other man and then they were past amidships on their way upstream but damned if they werent swiveling slowly on their seats and eyeing telesto devilish sharp i do believe theyre spying on us alan thought what a lot of sauce these bloody frogs have chapter choundas twigg told them a week later one guillaume choundas his ship poisson dor has been out here in the far east for the last two years coincidence i think not thats about the time the first ships began to disappear i see sir captain ayscough nodded awfully young to be a ships captain though what more do we know of him come now captain ayscough twigg sneered how many fond daddies get their sons made postcaptain at the same age most young officers could only expect their lieutenancy admiral rodney made his sixteenyearold boy post into a fine frigate soon as he arrived in the west indies on his last commission let me ask again sir what do we know of him ayscough retorted with a growl twigg had not become any easier to swallow in the past months and his harshness grated upon their captain most of all forced as he was into the closest familiarity with him i mean damme sir what a few royal navy officers do for their own dont mean this popinjay benefits from someones interest in the same manner ayscough went on who and what the hell is he he like your officers and senior hands captain ayscough is reputed to have been an officer in the french royal service twigg replied snappishly well thought of at one time im told by certain informants commanded a sloop of war what they call a corvette to be well thought of in their fleet hed have to be royal himself choate pointed out snuggling deeper into his coat despite a coalfired heater in their captains quarters it was a cool night and a stiff wind on the pearl river made it seem even chillier some dukes byblow at best not titled twigg supplied a commoners lad from brittany perhaps from st malo i believe his fathers family is in the uhm fishing trade wi the profit from his voyages sae far sir he could buy any bluidy title he desired once hes hame mctaggart chuckled twigg glared in mctaggarts direction shutting him up alan was glad he was seated on the stern transom settee out of range of twiggs considerable amount of bile yet he rose in the french navy twigg went on only because he couldnt get into their army most like alan said in spite of himself never made officer with hay still in ones ears that takes both a title and lashings of livres quite right mister lewrie twigg allowed sounding almost pleasant for once so why did they not send one of their titled and successful frigate captains on this mission for pretty much the same reason they sent us sir brainard the sailing master griped were nobodies expendable and not much loss to the fleet if we fail thank you mister brainard i didnt know you thought so well of us ayscough laughed bitterly if youre correct though one begins to wonder in what repute you were held to be part of our band eh aint we a merry crew alan burgess marveled with a cynical shake of his head burge theres so much brotherly love and cooperation in this cabin i feel positively inspired alan whispered back back to the subject at hand please twigg ordered and if you two could hold down the schoolboy twitterings over there yes mister brainard the french sent this talented young peasant to do their dirty work for them cause they cant sully their limp little hands at it for one for a second theyre not ruthless enough to deal with native pirates and prosper and perhaps because they knew if they held out enough promise of reward to this wretch choundas hed leap at any opportunity for continued employment for a summary it still sounded hellish like the reasons they had been called to service themselves to alans lights hes an aspiring brute from brittany clever enough in his own fashion im sure perhaps like i said a st malo corsair so was this sicard sir percival stuck in breaking his usual silences sicard has the large crew in la malouine this choundas of yours has a small crew damme hell fry his brains if he keeps that up alan muttered to chiswick yes twigg rapped out impatient to go on and a bit surprised to hear from percival after all these months well sir seems to me choundas has the ship made for privateering sicard has the perfect old tub to act as the cartel for all the loot percival stammered out turning red from being on the spot from the effort of erudition and from the possible fear he was making a total ass of himself they could both act innocent or something the two of them working in collusion alan blurted unwilling to see percival take a single trick well damme we have no proof of that mister percival though the connection is tempting twigg allowed sicard seems honest enough and hes never been in their navy been out here for years dabbled at privateering in the last war against our trade but then what french sailor didnt at one time or another cargoes zachariah wythy rumbled whered sicard get his bloody odd cargo then furs from nootka soundd tie one ship up fer a tradin season take two of em tdo all we suspect mister percival may have a point at that rmember theres no sign this choundas put into macao nor traded opium fer silver with the mandarins come straight upriver an what hes landed so fars general runothemill indian cargo what if its this sicard whos the leader and choundas and poisson dor are merely his bullybucks sent out to enforce what hes arranged choate enthused look captain sicard has been in the far east and the great south seas for years you said so yourself mister twigg hed be the one most like to have contacts in past with native pirates this choundas is a newcomer with a new ship what connections could he establish with em on his own gentlemen this idle speculation twigg gloomed those lips growing hairthin in dislike at the direction his conference was going you suspected sicard and la malouine for good reasons sir in the first place alan pointed out not without more than a slight amount of glee maybe choundas is just a messenger from france a catchfart from their ministry of marine and a bloody pirate who needs his business stopped but not the leadermerely a henchman that means we got two ships tkeep an eye on wythy added relentlessly thats all right longs were anchored here in whampoa reach damme well need a second ship t follow both of em in the spring if they stay that long and two captains to shadow now ayscough said smiling thinly ajitji wythy instructed as they stood near a stack of cotton bales ashore in canton nanduji jeehan weethsahib they chorused piccha karna fransisi havildarsahibi vahahn ajitji neela koortie milna nandu vo admi lal gooluhband milna piccha karna jeehan hoshiyar khatrah badmashes aiee jeehan weethsahib ek dum nandu and ajit agreed and walked away into the mob of sailors and traders milling about as hog lane got into full motion for another night that takes care of the bosuns or coxns wythy sighed as the indians put on a remarkable performance of two revelers wandering around in a daze but following the two sailors from poisson dor and la malouine who had come ashore with sicard and choundas they had come in separate sampans but even so their movements would be covered closely and hopefully surreptiously well take sicard twigg whispered and he and lieutenant percival went in one direction leaving wythy and lewrie to loiter by the cotton bales until choundas dismissed his coxn the same sailor theyd seen giving telesto the eye the week before in the boat with him a handful of coins changed hands then choundas clapped the fellow on the shoulder and barked a short humorous comment before the sailor departed on his own errand or amusements there he goes nice an slow now mister lewrie wythy instructed no need t trod on his heels nor breathe down his neck just keep the bugger in sight mister cony is it follow the french mates there ajit the onej in the blue coat see nandu that man in the red scarf follow them yes carefully dangerous thieves yes lord at once aye sir thats me name sir cony whispered a trifle nervous ye know whats wanted wythy inquired you go on ahead of him stroll along at a fair clip like ye know where yere goin an if this choundas bugger veers off from behind o ye dont worry bout it cause were still followin him if he gets outa sight try an spot where he went t ground an come back t join us right right sir cony said with a deep sigh of commitment achcha conysahib wythy praised chabuk sawi ijazaht hai daw mut good conylord clever fellow you may go now dont fear jeehan mister wythy sir cony essayed a brief grin before he took off on his dangerous chore hell be safe enough should he not mister wythy lewrie asked aye hes a cleverun picks things up quick as a wink like hes learned more hindeen most englishmen out here ten years its us thats in more danger those frogs know were officers off the ship thats been payin close attention to their doins and yell mind how theyve been givin us the eagleeye the last few days aye sir alan replied feeling absolutely naked among the throngs of drunken reeling sailors in hog lane god id give my soul right now for the feel of a little rigging knife though and its be yer soul if the mandarins soldiers caught ye armed wythy warned one of their eight bloody rules ye never violate not if ye know whats good fer ye applies t the frogs sames us thank the good lord choundas wandered hog lane for a while strolling into thirteen factory street at last and wandering right past the factories to the bank of the foetid creek and across the plank bridge to the front of the king qua hong he looked to be in no hurry to get where he was going but there wasnt much down that way mou quas hong a wide lane that did little business that late in the evening and then one of the large customs houses which would be shut clever bugger clever as paint wythy commented taking lewrie by the arm and steering him back the other way hell turn about and come right down our throats t see if anyones tailin him not the skills ye expect t see in a french naval officer dammef they aint choundas did reverse his course and struck out west once more making a beeline for the bridge cony had already crossed over and was across the street from him there was nothing for it but for him to turn into carpenters square and try to look as innocent as he could wythy and alan turned their backs on him and suddenly got interested in an openair grog shop that spilled out into hog lane with all evidence of nothing more important in their lives than a mug of rum and hot water sorry mister wythy sir cony apologized once he had rejoined them alan offered him the rest of his grog it was far below the standards of navy issue from the victualling boardthe rawest stuff hed tasted since leaving the west indies god thats awful sir you stay here cony well follow him now headed for the french factory cony alan asked nossir es on tother side o the street just goin into old clothes street now sir cony related dead end else hed get into the city proper an i doubt hes got that much clout with the mandarins wythy grinned no our lads off t put the leg over some chinee lass better cut o bagnios lays in that direction bout a dozen of em co hong quality stuff aha alan commented wythy had at last informed him where he could get some quim hell be in there bout an hourr so wythy said pulling out his pocket watch if the brute has any taste that is if hes the peasant zachariah thinks him id make it a quarter o that lets be meanderin so we may keep a sharp eye peeled for when he comes out cony ye want the rest o my rum as well well hit aint so bad once ya gets some down sir thankee right kindly cony agreed they strolled west past the chow chow hong the east india company factory the swedish to take guard across the street from the entrance to old clothes street well damme percival said as he and twigg heaved into sight sicard wythy asked in there twigg whispered pointing with his chin same fer choundas wythy snarled now whats so allfired secret they gotta do their talkin in a brothel aint their ships good nough this may be some theatric to keep us offbalance twigg sighed with the exasperation of a longtime expert at the art of tailing a man unless theres someone theyre meeting in there someone they wouldnt want even the chinese or the co hong to know about a chinese pirate maybe sir percival asked or do these malay or mindanao raiders ever come up the pearl to trade in canton like anyone else how many brothels in there tom twigg asked only four i know of that cater t western custom rest is fer the co hong r the chinee exclusively theres touts enough in the street if ye wish t ask about if they went t one of the best ones ye can wager the pimpsr still pickin their chins up off the street at the novelty of it wythy imparted with a soft laugh well i need some volunteers then twigg demanded to enter those brothels that accept europeans ill go sir alan piped up it had been a long time since calcuttaand padmini draupadi and apsara speak fluent french mister lewrie twigg simpered speak chinese come to think on it would you know what to look for would you sir alan shot back without a pause most probably i would not sir twigg smiled but i would know most of the french compagnie des indies officials by sight and more than a few of the notorious chinese coastal pirates as well tom were in your hands now aye zachariah look you an percival try the last two on the left lewrie an ill look into the others hope the pimps speak pidgin at the best the pimps did though it didnt do much good old clothes street was full of european barbarian foreigndevils that night and to the chinese they all pretty much looked alike so even the offer of some cash didnt get them any useful information everbody got a condom wythy asked just in case percival didnt he was relegated to street lookout on the other side of thirteen factory street percival was very putout we can use yer services again cony wythy said aye sir though uhm i haint got much money sir i didnt come prepared for sport either sir alan said not in the financial sense anyway do you think the tariff would be dear he asked with an innocent expression well damme twigg griped but dug out his purse and handed over enough golden guineas to pay for their socketfees an act which half killed his soul and made alan delight in the prospect of getting the leg over at twiggs expense they saw cony into one of the brothels assuring the warder at the door that cony was a minor tai pan no matter that he was dressed as a sailor ye want thisun then wythy asked an ill take the last but one on the right meet us at the chun qua factory whether ye learn anythin or no dont dawdle mister lewrie half an hour shall we say wythy grinned the things i do for king and country sir alan smiled back an not a jot on what ive done in the kings name boy aye sir the expedition took a lot longer than wythys stricture of half an hour and lewrie suspected if his own experience was anything to go by none of the others would be getting back to the chun qua factory before he didmight not even get back before dawn first he had to pay the warder to get into the bloody place it was nice to learn that the bobbing little weasel could speak pidgin no matter what the mandarins laws had to say about limiting the number of chinese exposed to foreigndevil barbarians their languages and alien ideas it did however cost him six pence which was not so nice he was lit into a small alcove through a semicircular archway by a giggling little maidservant there were several of the alcoves along the main hall screened off by folding ricepaper screens painted with some truly aweinspiring oriental pornography try as he would he could not overhear any french being spoken nor did he see either sicard or choundas in any of the alcoves wythy must be right he muttered to himself the mans not here or hes a damn quick worker on off and wheres my shoes the maidservant seated him on pillows before a very low blacklacquered table and began lighting lamps another maid came trotting in with a serving tray offering steaminghot towels steaminghot tea an excellent earlyspring picking yu tsien he noted and plates of tiny dumplings called dim sum for an appetizer the first little maid returned with a strawwrapped bottle of mao tai brandy and delicate little paperthin drinking cups an older chinese lady entered dressed in a black silk robe all figured in goldandsilver thread birds she looked hard as flint and twice as old you wan guhl she began one guhl two guhl wan see mak choose have you any french customers mother abbess alan asked no got french guhl china guhl got no he reiterated speaking slowly as possible have any men who are french come here in the

so wan guhl yes i bling she huffed i fear this is not going to improve my conversational skill alan commented to the little fourteenyearold maid as she poured him a revivifying cup of brandy she covered her mouth and giggled the girls arrived four of them at once and they didnt titter or giggle thank the good lord hair black as ink and elaborately coiffed stuck through with long decorative pinshair as lacquered and shiny as polished ebony wood faces painted bolder than any english whores with pale powdered faces and bright rouge and lipgloss their eyes and lashes outlined and brushed so that they loomed enormous upper lids brushed with powder so they seemed like almonds enameled in blue and black they talked among themselves waving the huge sleeves of their intricately designed and figured silk robes ive died and gone to heaven lewrie breathed at the sight of them choosing could be a hard process for they were as lovely a quartet as any hed ever suspected existed and this was one of the brothels that specialized in europeanssurely these would be thought of as mundane with the absolute very best saved for the chinese as tooprecious pearls to be cast before foreigndevil swine they enveloped him one seated to each side one seated by the doorway to play a stringed instrument for his enjoyment while the fourth began to sing lolloping out some horribly offkey to his occidental ear nonsense in a quavery breathy voice the one to his right plied chopsticks to feed him bites of dim sum while the one to his left kept the tea and brandy flowing and after each song they would trade places to introduce him to all their accomplishments speak english he asked each of them as they settled in at his side speak pidgin french bloody latin sadly three of them could not but wei yen could she was youngest of the four it was hard for him to judge just how old she really was but he guessed around sixteen or seventeen her skin was clearer her features more delicate than the others her mien not as artificially gay and cherrymerry as the other three either there was more tea more dim sum some more appetizers fetched out another bottle of mao tai and then the madam was back with her hand out for more silver to pay for the treats supplied so far you mak choose now the woman said making it sound like a demand more than a request you wan one guhl two silla two guhl fo silla wan keep aw fo ten silla one girl wei yen alan replied forking over two shillings for the girl and another six pence for the entertainment the others bowed their way out and tripped down the main hall toward the front of the establishment their services already in demand wei yen beamed at him with a maidenly little smile then took him by the hand and led him in the other direction towards the back give bath she promised a steaming wood tub sat sunk into the floor of each bath cubicle some already full by the sounds coming from them lewrie took his time dawdling on his way to his trying to peer into each one or linger long enough to listen to see if he could hear french being spoken he shrugged thinking choundas either not there or long gone by this time wei yen hung up his garments wrinkling her pretty little nose each time and singsonging something in chinese laughing softly as she did so lewrie preferred to think that they were jokes when he was bare to the world she indicated that he should get into the tub he slid down into the extremely hot water wincing on his way down and found a bench to sit on by the side wei yen walked with mincing little steps to the other side of the tub and disrobed down to a very thin nankeen undergrown which she slipped back off her shoulders as he watched entranced she was a little bit of perfection middling shoulders slim neck creamy skin the color of pale ochre wheat the silk robe she had worn had concealed the springy young bounty of her breasts that stood up firm and proud and straightahead fitf gether shadowing a dark cleft he wanted to dive into there was the slightest bit of stockiness around her rib cage but the waist was waspthin as a dolls and her belly was so firm and flat with a ridge of what he hoped would prove to be damned talented muscle down the center leading to shaved he asked the room as she came toward him she slid down into the tub with him gracefully and came to his side if she had seemed maidenly shy and tender before it had been a theatric for she became an unleashed tiger she sat straddling him on the bench seat reaching down to seize his member which sprang awake as the brigade of guards in a twinkling they slopped around in the tub splashing water everywhere she almost let him enter her then slid away from him until she had him roaring in frustration but no he had to leave the tub sit on another damned stool while she soaped him from head to toes and scrubbed him clean with a sponge sliding away from his soapy embraces and laughing all the while back into the tub for a cleansing soak and then she was toweling him dry letting him towel her dry then they gathered up their clothing and went up a back stairway to a private chamber he came to his senses just long enough to remember his condom and then they were delightfully engaged at long last both making noises more usually associated with iroquois massacres fathers wrong ya know he said between gasps bengali women have nothing on you my dear he lay utterly spent at long last used up far further than he could ever remember while the girl stroked him and kissed him working him over with a small towel and loosing her long dark hair that spread like a cloak to cover them both shed come unpinned somewhere in the second bout whilst teaching him an entirely novel manner wrists and one ankle behind his neck as he sat on the edge of the bed clasping her small bottom like holding two small melons her teasing fingers and the moist warmth of the towel strayed to his member and it flickered with renewed interest you wan gin qua she said with a gasp of wonder again after that he chuckled well in a few perhaps no wan gin soon you go qua she said in a soothing whisper nudda man he wan i got go you stay nudda one silla you wan chai mao tail wan eat gin allee same ua i stay alan replied mao tai you and me both right she gave him a kiss and slid out of bed to slip on her undergown open the door and call for one of the maidservants while they drank and recuperated he quizzed her as much as he was able he learned that she had once been one of those little maids purchased from a peasant family far to the north when the crops failed girl children could always be sold to support poor families it was a prime reason to keep them instead of putting them to death at birth as a hedge against an uncertain future they were just about to partake of another spell of amour when alan got down to his real questions and the reason he had chosen her instead of one of the others who had no pidgin or english does a redheaded man ever come here red wha red like this pillow tassel red alan prodded dull like ginger aw fon debbil red ha she tittered pale skin like yours he has a thin beard alan had to make a partial

nipples dat she pretended to slap and choke him dat teeth took hold of his shoulder and neck dat she told him biting lightly jesus christ what a monster lewrie agreed as she sat back up whi lak dead him wei yen shuddered once more bear mak sclatch no wan guhl wan bebbee no wan bebbee guhl him on top him wan she slipped off to one side of the bed knelt with her head on the pillow arms held behind her back as though they would be tied if with choundas then slapped her rump wan go ba place allee same guhl place the pervert lewrie growled what an utterly rotten bastard otten bassah wei yen said sitting up once again rotten lewrie corrected lotten bassah the girl parroted then said it to herself several times trying pervert on for addition to her vocabulary as well well youre not with him now youre with me and im not a rotten bastard or a pervert lewrie assured her drawing her down to him well not much of one anyway then there came a muffled scream from down the hallway and a series of yelps wei yen stiffened in his arms burying her face in the pillows it him red ha fon debbil hes still here lewrie said starting off the bed almost dragging the frightened wei yen with him oh what luck more wails of terror and pain hiccupy little strangling wails such as a very young girl one even younger than wei yen would make the sound of cuffs or blows perhaps preceding each new outcry lewrie went to the door and opened it to hear better even as wei yen tried to drag him back he saw another door open saw captain jacques sicard lumbering to the noise as the madam and one of her bullybucks came up the stairs from the front of the bordello their singsong voices sounding anything but musical sicard was rapping on the door whispering guillaume lewrie ducked back as sicard began to remonstrate with the madam opening a purse to pay her off for whatever damage or harm his man was causing another door opened only a couple of rooms beyond his own and a distinguished chinese gentleman emerged drawn to the commotion he stopped in his tracks though and squinted his eyes when he saw lewrie just shutting his door you no go him hut wei yen rasped dragging him back into the room completely and slamming the door with her behind ver ba man him wei yen mak you contentee no silla you stay way what are they saying alan asked trying to shake the little baggage loose from her deathgrip on his body and find his stockings him pay muchee silla muchee tael cash fo yi wei yen translated olio woman ma she say fon debbil go him no comee back is good doors opened voices rumbled in chinese pidgin and french as lewrie began to dress much against his better judgement wei yen was trying her damnedest to coax him back into bed with her but hed had his fun expensive as it had been even if it had been twiggs money he had to be ready to shadow choundas once he left the brothel with his stockings and shoes on his breeches pulled up and buckled he heard footsteps coming his way ignoring the girls protestations he stepped to the door and opened it just a crack standing well back in the shadows so he could see what was happening the shoes sounded different two pair perhaps of hardsoled european shoes with heavy heels and the swishing sound of a pair of slippers alan saw the chinese man now dressed in an elegantly embroidered silk robe with a round pillbox hat on his head adorned with one coral button on the top and a long peacock or pheasant feather the man cut his eyes towards his companions and there were sicard and choundas shoulder to shoulder behind the chinese man sicard paced on past but choundas slowed down to a crawl as he passed the crack in the door and he grinned a brief sardonic mocking grin before resuming his pace and joining his companions the cheeky bugger alan thought at first his second thought was for a weapon for that brief glance was as chilling as coming face to face with old scratch himself there was no shame in the leering grin no fear of discovery only scorn for whoever it was behind the door ill wager he grinned cause he thinks theres a poor whore in here hes tortured before alan thought gloating at her or maybe he was daring whoever he took me for to come out and say or do something about it or he realized with another chill of dread that chinee bugger saw enough of me and recognized me christ sorry love duty calls damme her eyes this is for you he said handing over two of twiggs golden guineas i go follow bad man and when we catch him he made a scritch sound and the motion of cutting a throat alan trotted out of the door for the end of old clothes street where it opened out onto the wider main road he looked about for a sign of twigg or wythy for will cony but his was the only occidental face present and as he emerged the number of chinese in the dark street melted away into the doorways and the darkness between the few oil lamps he was almost out of the street when something made a quick swishing noise and his skull exploded there was a burst of light he could taste something brassycoppery and then a pain that made him wish to scream like he never had before except that it hurt so much to draw a deep breath that he couldnt without knowing how he had done it he was facedown in the dust of the street eyes barely able to focus on a pair of bare and horny feet at the edge of his vision they were coming towards him a knee appeared as if whoever it was was preparing to kneel without thinking he lashed out with his left arm and leg and the agony that doubled and redoubled in his head was so exquisite he found breath this time gasping for air to let out a scream of pain as he swept whoever it was off his feet the man went down overturning some baskets spilling garbage against the dingy walls a stout stave clattered against the bricks howling with more pain alan clawed himself onto his assailant but the man retrieved the stave and rolled over to strike him across the top of his shoulders alan yelled some more though the blows didnt hurt nothing could hurt as bad as his skull did in comparison there seemed to be other cries now stirred up by his howlings and the drumming of feet heading toward the street opening his foe shrugged alan off and got to his feet to flee but alan got both hands around one ankle and held on for dear life getting dragged through dirt and garbage for his pains he could smell blood he could smell mildew his face pressed against the back of the assailants ankle the salt and mildewmoldy reek of a sailors clothing the man stumbled to one knee kicked backward to free himself as lewrie tried to scale him nails rasping on rough duck cloth as he got a couple of fingers in the mans waistband from the rear more blows from the stave one on the skull again this one bringing back the explosion of light once more he couldnt hold on and dropped away the next blow swished past his drooping pate to thock on the wall with a horribly hard blow hold on there ye bastard alan heard a voice say and then there was a flash of light that winked as alan tried to look up one small glimmer of flickering oil lamps on metal knife ignoring his skull for his life he scuttled back against the wall turning over more tall wicker baskets as he tried to rise and crab his way up the rough bricks a shadow bulked from the street entrance hes got a knife mister wythy look out alan screamed two bodies swayed against each other two quick blows two more winks of steel and then the foe was gone running east down thirteen factory street for the creek and the plank bridge there was a hue and cry the babble of chinese voices my god wythy sighed as he stumbled to the wall to lean on it sinking to his knees my god alan lurched away from the wall to sink to his own knees by the older man as wythy pressed both hands over his abdomen that bloody bastard he grimaced his expression turning to a cockeyed grin of sarcastic surprise think the bastards killed me hoy alan called his head splitting with every breath hoy the watch a mans been stabbed here somebody help us oh my god wythy whispered as his blood flowed like a spilled bottle of claret and steamed in the cool night air alan staggered to the street entrance yes sailors from a dozen nations were coming on the run he could see twigg and percival with cony bringing up the rear that way a sailor with a knife somebody stop the bastard alan yelled and then his own vision began to turn into a dim tunnel pinpointing twiggs ugly phyz he sank to his knees again oh will no one catch the murdering shit he moaned oh my god wythy wept in reply chapter the consoo house was crowded with traders ships captains and europeans for the execution the eight members of the co hong sat to one side trade taking a poor second place to justice in this instance the chinese mandarin viceroy for canton sat on his inlaid throne on a pile of silk pillows with his banner men soldiers behind him and his linguist at his feet lewrie had missed the trial laid up with a concussion but he had been told it was a brief affair the chinese officials had been highly upset that one of their strictures had been violated there had been more than a strong rumor that all foreigndevil ships would be ordered out of chinese waters if more of these fights between the french and english occurred fight hell alan had protested but twigg had told him to stay silent there was too much pressure from the east india company to let it go for what it appeared to be a bungled attempt at robbery by a drinkaddled french sailor on an english trader trade was too good this season the pickings corning down from the hinterland were the best anyone had ever seen and the prices were for once reasonable so twigg had to sit silent and let his friend and partner pass over as a man in the wrong place at the wrong time who had died trying to aid an english shipmate it had taken wythy a couple of days to die from the suppuration of two deep belly wounds that were untreatable and a death sentence lockjaw had been added to the insufferable agonies of his last night on earth the surgeon had shaved alans head staunched the bleeding and sewn up the pressure cut for the moment he was forced to wear a wig until his hair grew back out mseurs someone said in a soft voice from behind them alan turned awkwardly it still hurt to turn his head so he pivoted on one heel guillaume choundas capitaine la poisson dor a votre service he said i am mos sorry for your loss zat it was a french sailor who did this words cannot express my sorry twigg laid a hand on lewries arm before he exploded choundas was turned out in his sunday divisions best a dark blue masters coat trimmed in white lace and silver buttons short white tiewig over his dull ginger hair silk shirt and neckcloth dark red waistcoat and black breeches and stockings on his left sleeve he wore a wide black riband tied in a bow in mourning for the french sailor choundas turned up the corners of his mouth in a sad smile he had droopcornered eyes orbs of a pale washedout blue that were as icy as greenland bergs though belying his evident sorrow zis pauvre homme messieurs choundas went on zis poor lad what e did was a gallic shrug but e was in drink nestce pas a good matelot one of mine as you know e is tres so very young messieurs surely brittanique gentilhommes such as you may find ze christianite not my decision sir twigg said glaring he killed one of mine ah mais ouis mais ouis m seur tweeg choundas sighed like a disappointed

demeanor he certainly seemed sincere but then so did sir hugo when he desired something a fine pair theyd make he thought sourly both of them consummate actors and frauds and damme if he aint laughing at us even now i swear standing there judging his performance like i do i have to admit now and again but bedamned to the bugger twigg took his arm and gave his elbow a squeeze i could be prepared to spare the young fellow if he was only confused and drunk captain choundas twigg replied slowly weighing every word as you say we are of one race sprung from the selfsame rootstock that flourished in gaul and brittania before the time of the caesars before the german barbarians came the romans ah mais ouis mais ouis choundas nodded his eyes glinting with unexpected triumph the pious expression he wore flickered to a revealing brief smile a smile tainted with just the faintest bit of a leer at twiggs stupidity he is awfully young is he not sir twigg sighed and his stern visage creased into a grin god i pity the poor surely not alan thought but the courts have given their decision death by strangulation to put a curb on this unfortunate animosity between english and french in their port the assault on one of my ships officers and no matter the reasons the death of my most trusted and beloved longtime partner tom wythy with a forbidden weapon well ah but mseur tweeg choundas floundered a bit and the poor lad when one gets right to the meat of it is a liceridden scurrilous frog aint he now captain choundas a murdering cutthroat son of a frog bitch ditchdropped by a frog whore twigg went on those lips pursing temples pounding but a beatific grin creasing his lower face a brisketbeating superstitious slave to rome and like all french of my acquaintance born under a threepenny hapenny planet never to be worth a groat choundas recoiled as if slapped dropping his pious pose and slitting his eyes if this court dont scrag him ill volunteer to twist the cords myself

fishmongers farts you insult me beyond all honneur mseur i demand try it and see whose ship gets booted out of this port sir try it and see who ends up in a chinee grave twigg hissed who knows from what mister lewrie tells me your demise might make a few poor whores happiern pigs in shit takes moren that pitiful excuse for a beard to make a man a real man right mister lewrie to quote the bard sir who is he who is blessed with one appearing hair or something like that lewrie fumbled out only french have ihonneur you english have none perhaps but we do have bloody marvelous artillery twigg simpered do but give us the opportunity to prove it to you choundas spun on his heel and stalked noisily away to join the rest of the french traders and shipcaptains heels ringing on marble good on you sir alan said firmly that was bloody well said told that perverted monster off good and proper do but dwell upon this mister lewrie twigg whispered turning back to the court as the accused was led in we might have just struck flint to tinder created a blaze hot enough to goad him into something rash like following us once we leave canton stead of us having to track him the gloves are off now ours and his for old tom wythys sake ill have that bastards hearts blood you watch your back from now on cause its war to the knife the viceroy began to speak singsonging formal phrases which his linguist translated bit by bit for the foreigners by the will of our emperor son of heaven complete abundance solitary prince celestial emperor lord of the middle kingdom and swayer of the wide world my master viceroy for the prefecture in the city of rams yu quang shen wang speaks hear his words make kow tow and obey tremblingly the eight members of the co hong and their creatures and every chinese went flat on the floor while the europeans performed elaborate bows doffing hats and making legs the british barely inclined their bare heads psst lewrie said nudging twigg when the linguist began again third from the right sir do you mark him he whispered from the corner of his mouth and cut his eyes to twigg who swiveled to glare at a minor mandarin in a sumptuously thick and rich embroidered silk robe and pillbox cap with coral button and feather twigg nodded and turned back to face the viceroy on his throne and disturb the heavenly harmony of our celestial kingdom we tolerate the rude behavior of foreigndevil barbarians who know no better the export of our valuable goods in exchange for what worthless items they bring to the city of rams until such time as they displease us beyond measure you are quarrelsome slaves whose crude barbarian chieftains cannot control your rustic kings have sent ambassadors to pledge fealty to our celestial emperor made their kow tow to recognize the superiority of the son of heaven made themselves subjects to the one who sways the wide world the foreigndevil louis of france the foreigndevil george of england so that the solitary prince might stay his hand and not conquer them like to see the buggers try lewrie muttered hush twigg warned with a hiss we order that there be no more fighting the linguist shouted no more murderings or the lord of the middle kingdom shall withdraw his chop for you to be here see the punishment witness tremblingly and obey damme lewrie was forced to say as he recognized the prisoner it was choundas coxn the one in the sampan with him the morning theyd first seen him the executioner came forward with a silk rope while two banner men soldiers held the sailor by each arm and led him into the center of the gathering and made him kneel down for a man about to be garroted the seaman seemed unusually calm gazing about disoriented but obeying the soldiers without struggle his eyes seemed glazed and his mouth hung open slackly with a bit of drool at one corner theyve drugged him twigg whispered lots of opium i doubt he even knows whats about to occur they strangled him taking their time about it too applying one turn of the silk rope at a time then waiting to see the results the executioner looked gleeful as he readjusted his grip before taking another twist or two which had all the europeans muttering and shuffling some coughing they continued to strangle him slowly until the mans tongue stood out and his face went blue his head was so suffused with blood his eves almost nonned and trickles of blood ran like sparse tears until he went totally limp and ceased breathing lewrie found it as satisfying as any hanging hed ever seen at tyburn though the poor wretch hadnt had his wits about him enough to go game with a final japery or two and a crowd of fellow bucks cheering him on the doxies throwing flowers and kisses to a brave rogue he turned his head to look at the french choundas particularly surprisingly for one so affected by the sad fate of one of his own crew choundas was remarkably blase about it standing slack and bored with his weight on one leg he looked more like a man waiting for his coach to be brought round ready to drag out a pocket watch and wonder what was keeping his ostler choundas looked around and shot a glare at them fuck you lewrie mouthed slow and silent hoping the bastard could read lips then gave him a sly grin and just who was that chinee you pointed out to me lewrie twigg asked once they were outside after the ceremony was ended he was the third partner in the brothel with sicard and our jolly friend sir alan replied hes not one of your pirates none i recognize no twigg said pulling at his long nose by the color of his button hes wellconnected one of the viceroys staff too wellconnected for my liking could get us sent away emptyhanded if he wishes or ambush us downriver between here and lintin island once he boots us out they couldnt get away with that sir not with so many ships in the reach armed as they are lewrie protested why wed blow their city to flinders if they tried nothing official twigg replied frowning set upon by pirates if you will so sorry nothing to do with his celestial emperors glorious navy or his crooked mandarins and trade is too good for anyone to protest too much not this year just a country ship not john company theyll say back in london anyone wish to dispatch a fleet and army to canton no any questions for his majestys minister end of session then arrogant shitten bastards lewrie spat who mister lewrie twigg asked lightly the chinese and their arrogance or parliament little of both mavbe mister twigg excuse me sir youre wanted on deck hogue said bursting into the wardroom like a bombard all officers to the quarterdeck they grabbed their swords on the way sure it was the suspected attack by pirates or a demand they sail away at once surely they wouldnt dare not in the middle of whampoa reach burgess chiswick panted as they dashed topsides should i muster my halfcompany dyou think ayscough and twigg stood together by the taffrail of the poop and they ascended in a thundering pack to join him aft just got a note from the superintendent ashore at the john company hong ayscough explained mad as any time alan had ever seen him seems we have to go ashore tomorrow and entertain more questions from the mandarins about the murder and look yonder the bloody bastards percival shouted quite beside himself and ready to tear up a section of taffrail to shred in his bare hands poisson dors been ordered out of harbor ayscough grunted for the sake of the rest of the traders he continued the sarcasm hotly dripping her chops been withdrawn and her cargos been impounded by the same mandarin choundas and sicard dealt with twigg surmised you may lay any odds you like therell still be profit enough paid to sicard to reimburse choundas for this penalty poisson dor had already gotten her anchors up and was paying off from the land breeze with foresails and spanker her hands aloft ready to let fall her topsls once her stern was clear of the american trading brig salem witch damme to hell with the mandarins alan cried lets be after them then well never find the bastard until next autumn else wed be fouled by every mandarin junk in the river mister lewrie ayscough snarled to keep us here for more questioning see might even touch off a war them and us alone goddamn and blast that poxy french bugger goddamn him to the hottest fires of hell smarter than i thought twigg sighed sounding sadly amused i underestimated them dyou see gentlemen which mistake i shall not make again they could have gotten choundas coxn off with ten pounds bribe paid to the court but i suppose they thought it was better the poor wretch got scragged so he couldnt talk now we know were dealing with craftier foes choundas gets clean away kicked out of the port while we have to wait here for our cargoes to arrive and sicard stays here ever the innocent to keep an eye on us after murdering the one man who knew most about the native pirates and their lairs i hate to admit it gentlemen but theyve made fools of us and of me this whole thing was planned long before we tailed them ashore the night tom wythy was knifed they lured us sir mr choate asked aye lured us gulled us more like it twigg snorted one of us tom or i was to die that night perhaps both to cripple our endeavor why else meet with a mandarin on the viceroys staff so openly trail their colors before us like a false fox then pin us in port with more questions and boot poisson dor out freeing her to continue her plans for the next seasons raiding but before the next year is out well have them you mark my words damme another year out here alan groaned to himself choundas might be waiting for us to sail in the spring ayscough said his ship and sicards combined against us ah but for now captain ayscough our crafty little peasant has left something of great value behind in canton twigg spat an item he cannot do without or threaten us with such combination and what is that sir ayscough wondered gloomily why la malouine captain twigg almost chuckled sicard and la malouine mister percival said something a few weeks ago that set me to thinking i believe he was correct sir percival gawped swelling with pride but unsure about what he had done in spite of himself who has the largest crew sicard but who has the frigatebuilt ship with more gunports choundas somewhere out at sea in the islands perhaps among the native pirates i believe these two ships trade hands back and forth perhaps theres more of his fell crew waiting with the mindanao pirates or the sea dyaks even now for his return for them well at the moment hes a little short of the wherewithal and shall be for some months if la malouine will play the innocent here in canton no point in her not sir ayscough agreed theres little profit in taking an outwardbound vessel less hes willing to give up hands enough to take her all the way back to france better he lays low until the opium and silver start heading for canton next summer then once sicard sails we follow him and he leads us to choundas sir choate asked then its two ships against our one aye hed like that im thinking twigg replied nodding in fact this departure could be another ruse to draw us out with sicard in pursuit a few days later for just that purpose well we shall not be drawn sir truly we shall not it occurs to me though sir the first officer went on surely if we know who he is now sir and may lay this plot to our government officials back in calcutta thered be a stiff note to the french ambassador and the games blocked at both ends for them and they know who we are mores to the point mister twigg surely this choundasll haul his wind and cut his losses go back to france and go home a failure twigg barked rounding on choate i think not that wouldnt show him clever enough to remain a secret and if we did send a stiff note as you say its fourteen to eighteen months before a reply could be sent out here from london or paris once theyd wrangled over where the commas go and whod take his place sir soon as were called home how many more shipsd disappear the next time well were here now and we have a chance to stop this buggers business so thoroughly the frenchll give up on the whole bloody idea wrap things up neat and proper before we lay eyes on the lizard poisson dor let fall her topsls as she took the night wind abeam drifting slantwise away from her anchorage her taffrail lanterns were burning as were many smaller worklights to illuminate her crews labors they could espy choundas by the quartermasters by her wheel on the quarterdeck they could watch him stroll over to the starboard bulwarks to look back at them as his ships bows turned downriver there was just enough light for those with telescopes to see the smug sense of victory on his face iv nunc love sub domino caedes et vulnera semper nunc mare nunc leti mille repente viae but now that jupiter is lord there are wounds and carnage without cease now the sea slays and there are a thousand ways of sudden death the poet sickto messalla tibullus chapter in march the trading season ended in canton whampoa reach emptied slowly as ships drifted downriver to macao at the mouth of the pearl river estuary for many traders and merchants their families awaited them and for a time macao rang with balls and parties in celebration of a successful season for some ships there was time enough to celebrate their freedom from the strictures of chinese law in one of the most sinful seaports known to mankind then hoist anchor and hope for the best in

the straits of malacca and in her wake sure as fate another ship dared the changing monsoon windssicard and la malouine they could recognize her hull down over the horizon during the first day of passage and though she fell back until only her topsls could barely be espied as the days passed she was there every morning the sight of which topsls made twigg almost hum a snatch of song now and again in sheer delight ships company off hats lieutenant choate commanded the hands brought aft by the summoning call from the spithead nightingales the bosuns pipes took off their flatbrimmed dark tarred felt hats or the tarred woven sennet ones and stood swaying and shuffling in a dense pack perhaps they thought it was a call aft to witness punishment the sight of their officers and mates wearing steel on their hips was rare rarer still was chiswicks halfcompany of native sepoys clad in dhotis red coats and crossbelts tricornes and puggarees for the first time in over six months drawn up like a marine detachment on a proper warship with their muskets held stiffly at shoulder arms chiswick and his native subadar and havildars before them men captain ayscough began in a rumble that could carry as far forward as the focsle belfry i know there have been some rumors flying below decks about just what it is were doing out here amen to that most of the men nodded in agreement what are we doing with such a heavy battery hidden away below why do we have hindoo troops with us ayscough continued hands in the small of his back and rocking easily to telestos motion from the vantage point of the quarterdeck nettings overlooking the waist and upper gun deck maybe you wondered why we run this ship admiralty fashion and im sure since poor mister wythys death in canton youve been wondering what led to it well its come time to tell you all its the french lads the bloody french ayscough sketched out for them the fact that they were a navy vessel in disguise he outlined what sicard and choundas were up to with the native pirates how good english sailors had been overcome and slaughtered far from home for opium and silver by not only native pirates but by the french as well he drew a sheaf of documents from one large side pocket of his dark blue frock coat i bear a letter of marque from john company lads i hold active commission from our good king george the third and i have a frog pirate lurking off my sternquarters they risked drawing steel on mister lewrie one of your officers they murdered an agent of the crown back in canton and then their leader choundas threw his henchmans life away let him be strangled to death at the hands of those goddamned heathen chinee rather than let him answer questions choundas is out here somewhere men and were going to find him and kill him him and all his sneering torturing godless frog crew and any pagan pirate thatd deign to shake hands with him for now though the ship that gathers up his spoils washes good english blood off their foul booty and sails the seas acting innocent as your own babies is astern of us well well stop this buggers dirty business well do it to save the lives of other godfearing english seamen well do it to revenge mister wythys murder and well do it to put such a fear of retribution into the bastardly frogs and all their helpmeets in these waters that them that survivedll tremble in their beds and piss their breeches whenever they think of it there was a ragged howl of agreement with captain ayscoughs sentiments no fouler creature drew breath than a frenchman to true english thinking no jolly jack would abide a pirate unless of course he was english and preyed on other nations shippingthen he was drake and robin hood rolled into one and sailors were a most sentimental lot their feelings simple sometimes but close to the surface and closely held dear ayscough had them except for one hand speaking for a pack of whispering messmates er scuse me capum but er beggin yer pardon an all sir dont mean ter uhm one of his mates gave him a nudge dzat mean we goes back ter navy pay capum he finally stammered out it does not ayscough smiled merchantman payrate until we pay off back home in old england if anything that raised an even greater chorus of cheering mister abernathy we shall splice the mainbrace ayscough said in conclusion mister choate dismiss the hands ships company on hats and dismiss choate yelled all hands forward to splice the mainbrace abernathy and his jack in the bread room the assistant purser went below with a bosuns mate masteratarms and ships corporals to fetch out a keg of rum there would be no debts due on this issue no sippers for sewing another mans kit back up for taking a watch or for a favor or debt all would get full honest measure in addition to whatever issue came at seven bells of the forenoon watch at clear decks and up spirits still there mister hogue ayscough shouted up to the crosstrees of the mainmast still there sir hogue assured him with an answering yell mister percival id admire you hoisted the cutter off the midships tiers in the day watch and dismount the taffrail lanterns aye sir percival replied mister choate gun drill in the day watch as well sharpen em up say an hour and a half on the great guns and then rig out boarding nettings along the bulwarks and chain slings aloft on the yards strike useless furniture below once its dark aye sir mister mctaggart fetch a spare stunsl boom and a boat compass to install in the cutter if youd be so good sir aye aye captain before dawn gentlemen this bastard sicard will wish he never laid eyes on our telesto ayscough predicted grimly well begin to get some of our own back with these poxy frogs it was a nacky ruse lewrie had to admit as he saw it put into service the heaviest ships boat the thirtysixfoot cutter was swayed off the tiers and lowered over the side around three in the afternoon a studding sail boom about twenty feet long and six inches thick was lashed across her sternposts at each end of the boom a heavy glass lantern had been lashed the captains coxn was put in charge of her given a boat compass and a small crew to set sails a barricoe of water and some dry rations in case they were away from the ship for longer than planned and then they were paid out to be towed astern they were given muskets pistols cutlasses and a small boatgun mounted in the bows partly to counteract the weight of the lanterns and boom the coxn was entrusted with slowmatch flint and tinder and a hope they could find them in the morning as the late afternoon progressed and the armorers whetstone competed with the fifers fiddlers and pipers telestos lower courses were reduced taken in by one reef the staysls between the fore and mainmast and the staysl between main and mizzen were lowered the ship soughed a little less lively in the sea slowing by perhaps half a knot just enough to allow la malouine to draw a few miles closer to them before full dark so that any lookout from her crosstrees or upper royal mast cap could just barely with a strong telescope make telesto out as riding a slight bit higher above the horizon enough to make out her topsis in full and reassure them she was still there chiswick and lewrie paced the quarterdeck from nettings on the starboard side to the taffrail and back each time pausing by the stern to raise a telescope though seeing anything from the deck was a forlorn hope the sun was westering rapidly and the skies to the east were already gloomy the skies to their starboard side going amber and the highpiled billows of clouds beginning to take on the colors of sunset in one of those magnificent tropical displays i would suppose the timing of this is rather tricky burgess opined staring down at the coxn and his crew lazing happily in the cutter being towed about one decent musketshot astern in their wake with time on their hands one definite job to do and sheer blessed idleness until they were let slip they were napping or skylarking to their hearts content ive heard of it done mind alan admitted never thought id see it attempted like clubhauling off a lee shore at least the moons going to cooperate be dark as a cows arse by eight of the clock what little is left before the new moonll get hidden by those clouds too i trust what if this frog sails up too close burgess asked then we might go about and give him a sharp knock anyway god in heaven what if its not him after all burgess fretted i mean it could be any ship couldnt it this sicard could have slacked off once he saw we were headed south let another ship pass him and gone off to play silly buggers with his pirate friends if that happens burge lewrie assured him with a wry grin well look like no end of idiots or captain ayscough will that would kick the spine out of the crew alan thought taking on some of burgess fretfulness and turning to stare at the captain and mr twigg up forward by the wheel binnacle all the spine hed put in them that morning it made the hands easier to control if they knew what they were about he realized and hed seen enough examples of captains who explained things to their crews contrariwise there was the risk of saying too much of ones expectations and when those expectations or predictions turned out false a captain could expect to lose renown in his own ship making the seamen and mates even the officers suspect his abilities the next time if the ship astern of them turned out to be something other than la malouine it would be disastrous for morale not to mention the noendofshit wrangling if they fired into a stranger or loomed up on her beam like well like a pirate themselves could be just about anybody back there burgess reiterated oh for christs sake alan harrumphed lets not go borrowing trouble burge it has to be la malouine she chanced the taifun weather to keep an eye on us shes been there big as life and twice as ugly every hour since we left macao why would sicard go off east now when hes just as loaded as we are with profitable cargo he has to get it to pondichery and send it home in one of their indiamen or lose money i doubt king louis could pay the bastard that much else ive been wondering burgess began again sounding a bit more tremulous and doubting yeess lewrie drawled lazily if sicard is dogging our heels like this that must mean that choundas is somewhere up ahead where they could combine against us burgess mused as lewrie turned to go forward again leading the army man with him wordlessly he left canton the end of november last year time enough to get back to wherever hes based reman his ship clean her bottom to make her faster what did you call it careen and bream alan replied yes id expect him in the malacca straits if thats what he was doing narrow waters where we have to pass but remember its patrolled out of bencoolen and other shipsd be about perhaps too many for what he has in mind he cant let anyone see him fighting us hes supposed to remain as covert as we are mind maybe farther north on the eastern side of the malay peninsula closer to the johore strait among the native princes burgess grimaced and pirates never let it be said that you dont give a world of joy to your companions burge alan moaned sarcastically i only speculated to pass the time burgess replied a trifle archly tis not my nature to get the wind up over nothing like some sailors of my acquaintance or is that the result of a peasoup diet thats a natural wind alan told him tapping the stiff back of chiswicks cocked hat to tip it forward over his nose i know what you and caroline think of me alan chiswick said stiffly refusing to be japed out of his sulk a calfheaded dreamer too starryeyed to prosper i heard you that day we came back from sir onsleys its because i wept in the boat when we escaped jenkins neck after yorktown isnt it well what governour did to that little shit he had it coming i know that now but it was against everything wed fought for up to then he shot him in the belly a fifteenyearold little hound but a civilian hound alan he wasnt even armed it wasnt right and i had a perfect right to be upset well how much of a hardhanded warrior do i have to be before i live that down with you burgess elder brother had put a dragoon pistol into the lads stomach and blown it away down low where it wasnt immediately fatal so death was days away days of unspeakable agony hed gotten past their pickets run all the way through the marshes and creeks to tell the french and virginia militia they were at his mothers plantation down jenkins neck if not for him and his misplaced heroism theyd have gotten clean away and half of governour and burgess men would still be alive half of alans seamen would be home now on a pension or enjoying life a lot of virginians in their militia would still live and the stern veterans of lauzuns legion would be swilling cheap vin ordinaire slurping down snails and veal cutlets in some french tavern instead of laid out in deathrows by the ferguson rifles and his sailors cutlasses it had been a smoky horror at little more than arms reach and when it was over the dead greatly outnumbered the living all for nothing cornwallis had surrendered and the war was to all purposes over and lost governour had lost neighbors and lifelong friends from his orphaned detachment of north carolina loyalists hed done what felt right at the time yet burgess stumbled into the boat shaking like a whipped puppy i hold nothing against you burgess alan whispered softly i doubt you gave the harsh side of life and soldiering enough thought before you took this commission and caroline and i were worried about you out here in the east indies mind now he said taking chiswick by the elbow that was before i even suspected id be stuck out here myself you didnt volunteer toburgess gaspedto look after me for carolines sake do i look that stupid alan sighed yes i thought you did ah i see sorry alan all this time i thought youd volunteered for caroline burgess fumbled i mean the volunteering part not about your looking stupid ey thats a fine relief excuse me ive been nursing this not a grudge actually ever since we sailed i was rather glad to see the back of you when i went ashore in calcutta and here we were together again and i thought it was your doing something you said to your father major willoughby burgess you idiot alan grinned the less i have to say to sir hugo the better man no im not your governess and no i never held you in less respect because of jenkins neck i think youre a gloryhunting fool sometimes but that dont signify youre not as brutal and direct as your brother governour so yes i do think you less suited for all this deathorglory venturing but that dont mean i consider you soft he still had his doubts about that but burgess was a friend god bless you then alan burgess brightened standing taller in his own estimation and what he took to be alans heres my hand on it it wasnt concern for a helpless fool you felt it was concern for a friend a firm friend i trust aye to that burge alan replied shaking hands with him a fellow id be proud to have as a relation someday thankee kindly for your opinion burge alan said feeling cornered now the little oaf was buttockbrokering his sister at him maybe id be better off if he despised the very air i breathe im much too young for that sweet as caroline is he thought ahoy the lookout ayscough wailed upwards to the crosstrees still there his permanent litany it seemed royal bove the orizon sir the lookout shouted back just after full darkness before the last waning sliver of moonrise they let slip the cutter telesto had brailed up her main course taken a first reef in all three topsls and reduced her tgallants to third reef to reduce their silhouette against what was left of the sunset horizon from the deck it appeared they were alone on the ocean an inkblack shadow on an inkblack sea with lugsail winged out and a small jib set forward the cutter paced alongside telesto for half an hour slowly drawing ahead from sternquarters to bowsprit from spritsl boom to larboard bows a cannonshot away another spectral imagining four knots sir alan reported to ayscough after a check of the knotlog ayscough nodded and drew out his pocket watch leaning over the single candle in the compass binnacle to read it other than that one tiny glimmer the ship was dark as a boot eight of the clock sound eight bells forrud end of the second dogwatch ayscough ordered ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting the last echoing on and on time to begin the evening watch time on a wellrun ship to call the lookouts down from aloft and post the oncoming watchstanders on the upper deck vantage points time to recover the hammocks so men could sling their beds on the messdecks and sleep for ships corporals to prowl about below to see if every last glim was extinguished for the night time to light the taffrail lanterns to help illuminate the quarterdeck for the watchkeepers and warn other ships of her presence to avoid collision ahead on the larboard bows there was a tiny flurry of sparks as the captains coxn struck flint on steel several times until the tinder caught a brief flare of light then the sullen ruby glim of a burning slowmatch swaying about in the darkness and the lord said let there be light ayscough whispered as first one then the other taffrail lantern began to glow their yellow whaleoil cheeriness mister choate all hands on deck stations to come about chapter if he holds his course sir mr brainard said in the airless chart space all ports and doors all partitions doubly cloaked in covert canvas at a pace of about uhm say five knots with nightreefs aloft hed be here by now a pencilled x appeared on the ocean chart after a moments thought brainard drew a guesstimate circle around the x we put about here norwest with the wind abeam at ten past the hour held that course for one hour tacked to east soueast at ten past nine of the clock we should if god is just be somewhere off his starboard sternquarters now we should see him dead ahead or slightly excuse me sir mister choates compliments captain and the hands are at quarters lewrie reported leaning through the folds of canvas that served as a light trap for one betraying lantern that swayed and winked coinsilver bright over the chart table any sign of his lights mister lewrie ayscough asked none sir hes sneaking along to trail us like a footpad in a london fog twigg sniffed all the more sign hes out there an innocent ship would be burning her running lights evidently twigg and ayscough had shared the same doubts burgess had expressed earlier as to the identity of their dogged pursuer as i was saying brainard continued marching a brass divider across the ocean chart slowly punching a small pinhole in the paper and turning to protractor and rule do we come about to our original course in ahhumm five minutes say and well be astern of him he should be dead ahead or fine on the larboard bow i say five minutes so we do not overrun his track in the dark very well ayscough grunted satisfied as much as he was going to be until he could throw rocks at la malouine and hear them go chunk six after ten mister lewrie let me see your watch ah with mine my respects to the first officer and he is to lay the ship back on our original course of sousoueast half south in four minutes aye sir alan replied stumbling out of the chart space to fumble his way to the passageway that led forward to the quarterdeck he relayed his message to choate now how the hell do i know when four minutes have passed choate griped even the compass binnacle candle had been extinguished now just in case night black as a moors arse i hadnt thought about that sir alan had to admit perhaps if you prised the glass cover off your watch sir read it by feel not my watch mister lewrie my wife gave it me my father gave me mine sir alan stated mister lewrie choate coaxed tis for the king excuse me sir ill go aft into the passageway perhaps ill find a glim there sir damned if hed ruin a prize watch for anyone they were saved by ayscough and the others coming on deck and issuing the instruction to come about ropes slithered and hissed through blocks sheaves squealed in those blocks loud as opera stars sails rustled and boomed and the hull groaned loud as a storm as she adjusted to a new angle of heel resettling her timbers in complaint there was nothing to see and damned little light from the occluded stars to see by the sliver of moon was not enough light to help pick out a man on deck were he dressed all in white keep close watch astern ayscough warned just in case but there was nothing there either the only sign of motion on the sea were the taffrail lanterns in the cutters stern far out ahead of them and those almost on the rough edge of the horizon so low were they to the water and so far off by now after their triangular diversion it took a sharp eye to make out that there were two and not one foreshortened together as they were well damme ayscough muttered after half an hour had passed where is that bastard not hide nor hair of him cant even smell him anyone see phosphorescence from his wake ahead no damme has to be ahead of us twigg insisted might have reefed for the night same as us choate opined still even at the four knots we were doing before we turned wed at least be abeam of them hed have slowed to keep his interval or ayscough wondered aloud sicard would have dashed on ahead the cutters lights are closer together than our taffrail posts by eighteen feet and lower to the water he might have cracked on more sail to catch up mister choate hands aloft lay out and let fall the topsis to the second reef loose tgallants to the first reef aye sir bosun no pipes topmen of the watch lay aloft there sir hogue almost screamed from the larboard gangway ladder something went between us and the cutters lights two points off the larboard bows sir avast mister choate quartermaster put your helm down one point closer to the wind make her head sousoueast ayscough barked hands to the braces aye sir the quartermaster replied spinning his spokes on the huge double wheel slowly helm down a point sousoueast wind large on the larboard quarter sir thus quartermaster steady as she goes aye aye sir sousoueast thus the man intoned maddeningly after that brief tantalizing glimpse there was still nothing to be seen another half an hour passed they allowed the hands at quarters to stand easy or lay down to nap on the bare decks they rotated the lookouts to allow fresher eyes to peer into the almost stygian blackness searching for their foe another halfhour passed there percival rasped in a harsh whisper hear it very faint almost like a fantasy there came a chiming six bells o the evening watch ayscough agreed damme for us to be able to hear that he has to be up to windward of us and not too far to windward at that hogue with his incredibly sharp eyes was back from larboard tugging on the captains sleeve and pointing to their left over the larboard side the captain stood behind hogue letting his arm be a pointer ayscough sucked in a quick breath then let it out in a sigh of contentment ayyye he whispered there was something out there something a little more solid than the spectral shadows that had played at the edge of their vision for the last hour the kind that are seen but not seen apprehended and then lost to sight the harder one peered for them this one did not go away helm down another half a point quartermaster handsomely does it ayscough ordered aye sir the senior quartermaster agreed grunting as he put his weight to the spokes and the steering tackle ropes on the wheel barrel groaned softly three four spokes of larboard helm and telesto leaned a bit as the wind came larger on her left beam yes alan muttered sir a light it wasnt much a tiny insubstantial afterthought of a light not so much the light itself but the outer glow it threw like the glow of a seaport under the horizon reflected on clouds one two ayscough counted yes one at his binnacle one forrud thatd be by his focsle belfry damme look at that a smoky brown square appeared barely discernible from black behind the second glimmer an almost butcherpaper brown captains or wardroom quartergallery sir alan supplied theyve some canvas screens or curtains over the windows but theres a lantern behind aye ayscough was almost panting with excitement if he ayscough held up his hands calculating angles and distance left hand by the brownish hint of illumination right hand and index finger aimed at the foremost glow like a gun two points off the larboard bow and i make the range to be two cables weve got him mister choate wake the hands at quarters i intend to rake him in passing with the starboard battery boot him right up the arse then wear ship and give him the larboard battery from close aboard if we take him by surprise hell fall right down to us to hell with the wind gauge hell not be expecting us to fight from leeward alan dashed down below to the lower gun deck as midshipmen and ships corporals passed their messages he found hoolahan his irish gunner resting on a jutebound bale of cloth bolts silk bolts that were worth more money than his entire county back home owen the senior quartergunner was napping with his back leant against a carline post that supported the upper deck his feet propped up on a crate of tableware worth a dukes ransom stand by men weve spotted him starboard battery first right up his stern then larboard guns at twenty paces they could hear gunports being drawn open overhead and the heavy dull rumble of guntrucks as the eighteenpounders were drawn foot by foot to emerge from the opened ports they unpegged and opened their own cool night air damp and salty entered making them all tremble with chill with anticipation and a little fear too ah yes alan said sticking his head out a port once one spotted la malouine it was hard to believe that she could ever have been hidden by the night there was the wash and greenish phosphor glow of her wake the faintest reflection of that phosphorescence on her lower hull at the waterline and those betraying glimmers of belfry and binnacle lanterns can you mark her owen uhmm might need a set of younger eyes sir here hoolahan you could poach a bunny at midnight why so oi kin sor hoolahan grinned ever the cheerful one jus dont let im be loik t last lot barely got the deck clean just look dont prose on boy owen groaned aye sor mebbe cable cable un thalf now mister owen telesto leaned to starboard more as she went up to windward gunners removed tompions spun the elevating screws to compensate for the heel of the ship greased slides whispered as the short brutal thirtytwopounder carronades were run out iron wheels creaked as the lay of the barrels was corrected oi kin smell er now sor gahh bloody frog stink as you bear a voice shouted fire it crossed lewries mind that this ship had better indeed be la malouine and not some parsimonious merchantman that begrudged even a haporth of whaleoil for lanterns the starboard twelvepounder chase gun barked as the forecastle ranged even with the strange ships stern sending a hellish finger of pinkandcoral flame into the night fuzeeflashing just how near they were to their target and how large she bulked there were not a hundred yards between them then the larger deeperthroated eighteenpounders spoke loud as thunderclaps from a lightning bolts near miss shot after shot as each barrel came even with the foe more pinkandcoral flames more redandamber sparks of halfspent gunpowder clouds of foulsmelling smoke wafted downwind wreathing about the other ship ready cock your locks as you bear fire lewrie intoned the forwardmost carronade belched with a fiery eructation whipping backward on its greased slide quick enough to shriek wood on wood and set the grease smoking most satisfying deep bangs of guns going off followed immediately by the crash of heavy iron hitting timbers the moaning wail of oak and teak as scantlings were shattered and the thonk of balls ranging down the entire undefended length of the hull inside their target shattering tableware and vases ripping precious cargo of wallpaper silks teas apart in aromatic clouds ripping men apart as they hung closepacked as sausages in a butchers window in their hammocks killing men with the air of their passage without making a mark upon them breaking at last into savage iron shards among a sleetstorm of broken beams and frames which in those enclosed spaces below decks would whirl and maim as ruthlessly as irate razortipped sparrows now ready the larboard battery lewrie yelled as the last of their carronades had recoiled inward ports slammed open making space for the widemouthed barrels to be run out hull the bastards when i give the word owen aye sir owen replied around the stem of his pipe now guncaptains lowest elevation an wait for the downroll wads atop your ball rammermen dont dribble the damn things out now the ship creaked ominously as she slewed about cargo made dry rustling sounds as crates and bundles shifted slightly against restraining ropes and baffleboards the helm was put over so quickly telesto churned the sea to a greenwhite froth of phosphor and foam being oversteered so that she would slow down and not run her jibboom and sprit into the stern of the enemy she went wide off the wind as her deckhands strained to loose sail and haul the yards around to gain speed no longer working slack with the sea but beginning to oppose its will with her own desire for a faster pace then she was brought back up to the wind a couple of points to steady on a parallel course to the stranger to steady her own decks for a surer gunplatform half a cable lewrie estimated leaning out one of the ports alongside the cold iron barrel of a carronade the larboard chasegun banged and he ducked back inboard quickly wait for it eighteenpounders roared out their challenge lighting the sea amber and bright red between the two ships giving him short snatches in which to see the other ship it was la malouine hed stared at her long enough for seven months to recognize every tar stain cock your locks stand by on the downroll together fire all four larboard carronades took light as one there was some spectacular noise that had everyones ears ringing a brilliant burst of light worthy of a lightning strike fading from bright yellow to a dull burgundy and a wave of burnt powder rushed back in the ports as bitter as rotten eggs with the wind fine on their larboard quarter once again most of it blew away past the bows but enough was blown back onto the lower gun deck to befog them and set them all wheezing damme to hell but i love artillery alan exulted silently the power the noise even the stink of em and what they can do yes by god he crowed leaning out the port once more in the afterflash of the last eighteenpounder he could see large ragged rents in la malouines lower hull one right on the waterline that sucked and blew spumes of foam as the waves rushed past the hole the other three higher up in her chainwale theyd nailed her twixt wind and water shattering her mainmasts starboard chains that complicated array of deadeyes shroudtensioners heavy horizontal timber through which the stays for the lower mast threaded and terminated reload la malouine was not as asleep as they had thought her side lit up in flashes as well her twelvepounder cannon returning fire but not as organized as the shipkilling broadside theyd just delivered here a forward gun there a piece in her wardroom aft then two guns from her waist together musta kept alf their hands at quarters t fire that quickly sir owen guessed usually it took ten minutes for even a royal navy vessel to clear decks load and run out their batteries mighta been plannin on doin the same for us this night theres a biter bit boi god hoolahan whooped then the guncaptains were standing back from priming their carronades fists in the air while their excess hands tailed on the tackles to haul the guns up to the portsills once more the upper deck guns began to howl again and it was time for another crushing broadside five six times they firedabout ten minutes of battle at the hottest pace the crews could sustain for a short time slowly the return fire from la malouine slacked off she was not built to take such punishment she was a merchant ship with widerspaced timbers and lighter scantlings of perhaps no more than six inches thickness strong enough to protect her in storms against rocks and shoals and to stiffen her when she was laden with cargo but not enough to guard her vitals when heavy iron was flying even the toughest oak or teak gives way when hit with eighteen pounds of metal at twelve hundred feet per second at such short range telesto had been built to bear twentyfourpounders on her lower deck twelve or eighteenpounders on her upper deck and her sides were ten to twelve inches of seasoned english oak laid over much heavier and thicker framing spaced closer together she had been laid down for warfare some of la malouines twelvepound balls hurt her even so but she was built to take much heavier battering and live for hours in the line of battle la malouine had drifted down closer to her as captain ayscough had predicted she would perhaps her helmsmen had been scythed away by the quarterdeck twelvepounders the twopounder swivelguns and the muskets of chiswicks sepoys perhaps her crew had been so decimated that no one could tend her braces or be spared from the gun battery to go aloft and loose more sail now the range was almost hulltohull and when the carronades erupted shattered wood came flying in the ports at once making more hazard for lewries crews than anything that the french had done yet mister lewrie one of their midshipmen yelled from the after companionway close your ports secure your guns and come on deck for the boarding party please sir aye aye they gained the upper deck dug into the open weapons tubs at the baseof the mainmast and fetched cutlasses and pistols this time alan had his own pistols the small pair hed purchased long ago in portsmouth when he first kitted out as a midshipman and a brace of dragoon pistols hed carried away from yorktown he checked the primings and stuffed them into the hindoo cummerbund he still wore drew his sword and led his party to the larboard gangways where chiswicks troops were still firing away with their muskets grapnels bosun choate was yelling form up lads stand ready lower the boarding nettings now away boarders with a concerted howl they were up and over their own bulwarks leaping onto la malouines bulwarks across the gap created by the tumblehome of the two hulls there was an irregular volley of pistol and musket fire as the french met them men shrieked and clawed at sudden hurts lost their footing or their handholds and fell into the narrow tiderace between the ships to be crushed to death as the hulls ground and bumped together every halfminute or so pikeheads stabbed up at them stopping leapers in midair one sailor screamed as sharp iron found his belly his weight dragging the shaft of the pike down atop the bulwark the wielder must have been a strong man for he held the sailor there kicking wildly and vomiting blood and halfdigested rations before he slipped off and fell howling between die hulls lewrie leaped banging one knee on the ships side getting one foot on the frenchmans bulwark and a precious handhold on a loose stay that felt like it was half shotthrough and ready to come free at any second he had a brief glimpse downward at the bloody water foaming between la malouine and telesto saw a mans head crushed as flat as a frying pan an imploring arm and hand waving madly at him as another drowned below the surface trapped by untold tons he hauled hard on the stay to throw himself forward out of danger and stumbled to his knees to the deck ignoring the pain in his knee he rose up and started swinging his sword for his life a man tumbled into him from behind knocking him flat once more then there was a volley of shots that cleared the deck around him for a moment allowing him to get to his feet at em telestos he yelled a french sailor came at him with a pike leveled like a charging cavalry lancer a quick move to parry from left and below pushing that wicked pikehead away to his right and past his shoulder then a riposting thrust at the belly the frenchman screamed almost in his ear a foot of gills best english steel in his entrails lost his grip on the pike and dropped away like a spilled sack of meal almost dragging lewrie with him as his ravaged stomach muscles tried to clench around the blade alan had to plant a foot on the mans chest and thighs to drag his sword back out bringing forth the slithering horrors contained within dark faces with swarthy mustaches and whiskers came raving on la malouines gangway chiswicks sepoys less practiced at boarding and slower to cross over now that the seamen had cleared them some room they were trotting forward and aft bayonets fixed and their havildars shouting encouragement mam maro ghanda fransisi kill kill the dirty french percival and mctaggart were headed forward with a large pack of seamen teetering their way over the boattier beams to get to the larboard side as well alan spun about and led his men aft where it came from he had no idea but there was now some light on deck enough to see the party of frenchmen rushing to defend their quarterdeck it was disconcerting to see marcel monnot in their lead the sailor hed spoken to on the docks one morning but monnot had a cutlass in his hand and he began hacking away at an english sailor lewrie let his hanger dangle from the wriststrap pulled out his first dragoon pistol and pulled it back to full cock stepping forward with his men he took aim and let fly the fight with monnot swirled out of his aim but another frenchman was struck by the ball in the chest plumping a sudden burst of scarlet on his white shirt front and dropping him out of sight he drew his second pistol and shot a hulking french seaman right in the face who gave a great howl and flipped over backward making a gap for more english sailors to dash forward and crowd the french back cutlasses sang and whished in the air ringing steel on steel pikeheads and bayonet points stabbed out in short thrusts then there was monnot again leaping back into action and hewing a sailor down pushing forward and leading more of his hands with him against everything vous he exclaimed spotting lewrie espece de salaud strike monnot throw down your sword its over va te faire foutre monnot cried throwing himself forward lewrie jerked his wrist and brought his sword into his palm leading with a thrust that monnot beat aside but the speed of it made him drop back a pace alan stamped forward countering a hard counterswing of monnots cutlass blade they were too hemmed in by struggling bodies to do anything more than beat at each other vertically after that bayonets stabbed on either side and frenchmen were dying going down as the sepoys loaned their strength to shove their foes backward and upward to the quarterdeck beginning to thin them out enough for lewrie to have more fighting room it was disconcerting to fight a man he knew even slightly he had nothing against monnot personally so it felt less like a duel a stranger he could have crossed swords with gladly but it was his life to not kill him monnot was monstrously strong a bit unskilled with a more gentlemanly smallsword perhaps but ruthlessly competent with a cutlass his wrist hard as an iron anvil monnot fetched up against the ladder that led to the quarterdeck last of his men still standing on the gangway and he howled in glee as he swung his sword in the full cutlass drill there an opening as monnot swung backhanded fumbled backward to take a step up the ladder still facing his foes lewrie leaped for him raising his sword to block a further swing but ramming the lionheaded pommel of his sword into monnots mouth the man stumbled onto his back one hand grasping at the rope balustrade of the ladder thrusting with his cutlass a thrust which lewrie parried off low and then he was inside monnots guard with a backward slash of that superbly strong and razorhoned hanger across the mans belly and chest monnot howled again reaching upward to take lewries throat in one hand drawing his cutlass back with the other alan started turning purple as he reached out to take monnots swordarm wrist in his hand and hold off a killing blow drawing his hanger back behind his knee to turn it upward and thrust the point into the frenchmans jaws up through throat skin through the tongue into the sinuses and the brain monnot grunted and twisted like a piked fish bumping down the steps of the quarterdeck ladder one at a time dragging alan with him with one hand yet gripping his throat in a final inhuman spasming strength sailors and soldiers dashed past them while alan was dragged to his knees gasping for air and watching the world go dim until at last monnots heels began to drum on the deck and his hands lost all strength his eyes flared once more with anger then rolled up into his head and glazed over unblinking alan rocked back onto his heels and gulped great lungfuls of air massaging his throat with one hand and tugging his sword free with the other he felt like shooting the man just to make sure he was dead not shamming until hed stepped over him to ascend to the quarterdeck then strike him from behind he settled for a slash across monnots throat as he sprang up and rushed aft getting away from the brute as quick as he was able jesus christ he muttered once hed gained the deck no wonder it was light enough to see la malouine was on fire after lightsout aboard any ship it was the officers aft who could keep a lantern or two burning past nine pm and their gunfire must have overturned a lamp killed a guncaptain who had dropped his smoldering slowmatch onto something flammable smoke drifted and curled from between the deck planks pounded tar to waterproof the joins was running slick and hot sticking to his shoes one corner of the poop deck farther aft already showed gaps through which tiny flames licked he turned to see if telesto was safe and saw no sign of fire but amidships in la malouines waist there was a bright red glow under the tarred canvas that covered the midships cargo hatches and companionway hatches even as he watched the tarred canvas took fire with a sullen whoomp and disappeared in a sooty shower and long licking flames leaped aloft with a roar like a bellows had been applied to a forge back to the ship choate was yelling waving their men back to telesto with his sword move lads if you dont want to burn there was no greater fear for a sailor than fire aboard ship once it got a good hold on the dry timbers the tarred ropes greased running rigging and canvas sails a fire was almost impossible to extinguish in the blink of an eye a ship could flash into a ruddy horror roasting her crew who would be fearful to abandon her until the last minute for most sailors could not swim back alan yelled back aboard our ship stir yourselves they were lucky to make it for the small crew that had stayed aboard telesto were chopping and sawing at the grapnel ropes even before everyone could reach the rails to prepare themselves for the leap it was a panic sepoys crowded the rails their eyes rolling in fear ready to abandon their weapons in their haste to flee chiswick was raving back and forth shouting at them in hindee and pushing muskets back into their hands arranging a party of some of his largest men to literally throw some of the others across to telestos bulwarks to be caught by seamen la malouine was keening as the flames began to roar in earnest the sound a soaked river rock makes when placed in a campfire men wounded and unable to move were screaming and gibbering in terror damnit alan sighed sheathing his sword he picked among the bodies searching for his own the dead he could do nothing for but there were surely some english wounded that simply could not be left behind to suffer oh god sir archibald the condommaker keened shrill as a frightened child as he lay on the gangway with blood soaking his leg help meeeee im here archibald lets go he got him to his feet an arm around him and halfdragged him to the rail yelling for help hodge the topman came swarming over to them with a free line and quickly whipped a loop in it they got archibald seated in it and let it swing even if he bashed his head in on their ships hull he was away cony returned with it as they began to search telestos lewrie called almost choking on the stink of burning cargo below decks singed tea leaves swirled around him like a plague of locusts hoy telestos sing out and well save you a gutshot french seaman raised an imploring hand from the deck terror in his eyes they passed him by he was not one of theirs hodge drew a heavy belaying pin from the railing and did the man the favor of knocking him senseless so hed know less about his immolation dont think theys any more of ourn mister lewrie cony said tugging at his sleeve lewrie leave it ayscough called from their ship leave it or die over there i cant keep station on her any longer flames were shooting up the mainmast now furled sails bursting alight standing and running rigging covered with tiny shoots of fire like some expensive holiday illumination good enough for me lewrie responded climbing over the rails they threw them lines and they swung across suspended from gantline blocks and yardtackles lewrie thrust out his legs to take the shock of impact but it knocked the wind out of him anyway he dangled for a moment against the hull by the gunports until someone reached over and grabbed him by the collar to haul him up he landed in a heap on the larboard gangway almost getting trampled by sailtrimmers as they heaved on the yard braces to get the ship underway he could barely hear the shouted commands over the roar of the fire aboard la malouine ya awright sir cony asked helping him to his feet and disentangling him from the gantline block and threepart loops of line christ wot a mess when he had a chance to look back at their foe once telesto was far enough to leeward that she wouldnt catch fire herself he could see that the french ship was alight from taffrail to the tip of her bowsprit her upper yards were raining down in chunks like dripping embers no matter that they were heavy they were almost floating against the fierce roaring updraft of the fires now and again there was a bright bluewhite flash and dull thud as a powder cartridge burst or a loaded gun took light sparks would fly against a yellowwhite cloud of powder making la malouine look even more like carnival fireworks men dribbled from her too men whose clothing whose very flesh had caught fire and swarmed staggering and blind in unspeakable agony swathed from head to toe in greedy gnawing flames like animated torches they keened and howled reeled and dropped out of sight or tumbled over the bulwarks of their ship to raise great splashes in the water alongside where only a greasy smoke and a circle of foam marked their passing they dropped into the water beside others who floundered and thrashed in the glowing amber water thrashing clumsily for any bit of flotsam to support them before they drowned pleas for help went unnoticed cries to god went unheard amidst all the screaming and wailing amidst the crackle and roar of the flames la malouine had had four ships boats all nestled on the tiers that spanned the waist between the gangways over the upper deck and three of them now roasted like unattended steaks on a grill the fourth was in the water one side charred black and half sunk reeking with smoke half a dozen men clung to her and two sat on her aftermost thwart fighting the others to prevent them climbing in and swamping her there was one large gridworked hatch cover in the water and more men clung to the sides while others who could swim splashed in its direction out of la malouines crew of roughly onehundredfifty men not thirty could be discovered alive now oh christ sir look cony shuddered dark triangular fins cut the glassy illuminated redandamber waters sharks lewrie winced with a sudden cold chill as a fin went underwater just behind a struggling man that man suddenly shot out of the ocean as if hed been tossed by a bull screaming louder than he could have thought possible from anyones throat setting off more panic among the survivors pale white fish bellies rolled with him as they seized upon his flesh bit and shook like bulldogs to tear off huge chunks of living meat more fins darted in from nowhere summoned god knew how from the depths more men thrashed and wailed as they were taken the survivors who had been clustered around the halfsunk boat swarmed up on it in a wave climbing over each other in their haste as the boat rolled on its beam ends and capsized there was no time to put boats down telestos crew lifted up their own curved gridwork hatchcovers and tossed them in as ayscough had her steered through the thickest pack of frenchmen the tailends of halyards lifts and braces were slung over so that those that could might reach them and climb to safety and life but it was futile three french sailors who could swim climbed aboard shaking in terror perhaps three more made it to the floats by the time telesto had sailed on past wore ship and came back into the area there was no sign of living men around the overturned boat and not seven altogether on all the floating hatchcovers girded round entirely by circling fins and facedown bodies that one by one were taken under there had to be a thousand sharks by then around la malouine striking at anything whether it moved or notpaddles broken oars charred flotsam or discarded clothingit made no difference to them la malouine burned for two hours before she went under still a spark on the horizon by the time telesto found her cutter and took her back aboard she finally winked out around two in the morning about the time mr twigg finished interrogating the shattered remnants of her people chapter i should think weve done rather well so far mr twigg said somewhat smugly as they held durbar or conference ashore at bencoolen on sumatra theyd run into port before a punishing south china sea taifun that had loomed up above the johore straits and telesto had been lucky to make a safe harbor before the full fury had broken upon them the storm had passed ravaging the settlement but sparing the wellanchored ships in its aftermath a crushing humidity had settled in along with steady rain and choking heat and not a breath of breeze if bencoolen had been the arsehole of the world before the taifun had done nothing by way of improvement and what is to be done with our french prisoners sir captain ayscough inquired as he poured himself another healthful mug of lemonwater and brandy the men dont much care for having them around you know pitiable as they are perhaps itd be a kindness to leave them here at bencoolen twigg said with an idle wave of his hand a passing french ship may take them eventually them that survived that is theyd picked up ten terrified frenchmen some had been bitten by sharks and their wounds turned septic immediately and the gangrene killed them not five lived now and two of those were in precarious health lewrie suspected twiggs penchant for cruel interrogation may have hastened the departure of some of those from life leaving them here in bencoolen is no kindness sir lt col sir hugo willoughby granted alans father had grown even older since hed last laid eyes on him his hair thinner and greyer his face more carelined and leathery hasnt been much of a kindness for my battalion either let me assure you you agreed it would place your troops closer to the action i might remind you sir hugo twigg said frowning the vilely hot weather had not improved anyones tempers but it was almost too hot and humid to argue as for the frogs i care less if all the buggers succumb no real loss is it though i would wish for one or two to survive to bear the tale back to paris the effect would have been welcome and do you feel that same impartiality to my men sir sir hugo snapped sir hugo twigg drawled colonel willoughby unlike my utter lack of sympathy for piratical frenchmen i feel most strongly and deeply for the plight of the men of the th native infantry and i assure you i shall be most happy to extricate them from this hellish stew at the earliest opportunity that moment has almost arrived sir but you must bear the deplorable conditions here for only a few more months soon i promise you it had best be soon sir sir hugo replied evenly controlling his own temper with remarkable restraint as lewrie could attest we arrived in midfebruary with a grenadier company eight line companies one and a half light companies and the full artillery detachment and now with captain chiswick and his halfcompany returned to me i may only field eight eight sir allow me to protest most vigorously that if this battalion is not removed to a more healthful climate i wont have a platoon of men available to you by autumn i demand of you if you have any estimate of when we may depart this reeking cesspit pray inform us of it i quite understand sir hugo twigg replied on the edge of an explosion of his own temper no matter how much the weather might dampen his fuses two months three months at the most weather permitting and you shall be out of here at sea and in action that created a stir of interest among the army officers seated behind sir hugo and among the naval officers as well you see sirs twigg continued calmly getting a smug look on his face i know where this fellow guillaume choundas is and where he shall be in a few months time twigg looked about the damp and gloomy room a wood and thatch imposture of a proper building letting the stirring and chattering of their excitement swell and recede like a breaking wave of adulation before continuing shaken as the french survivors were it was fairly simple to play upon their fears catch them out when they were at their weakest twigg explained have we a good chart of the south china seas captain ayscough could it be hung where all could see it good here gentlemen in the spratly islands twigg chuckled pretty far lost and gone from anywhere ayscough commented but located so nicely for piracy sirs twigg informed them flat tiny and worth nothing to anyone as our sailing master may attest brainard stood to address the assembly flushing a bit at being before so many people theres water enough wild goats and pigs to eat seabirds and their eggs nobody lives there though not permanent too small to farm too low to make em safe durin taifun season cept for the highest hills inland good anchorage ill admit chinese pirates sometimes shelter there same for other pirate bands like the sea dyaks have to bring in saltmeats and such if you plan on stayin there a long time brainard shrugged and reddened trying to think of what else he might impart but twigg waved him off which brainard accepted with a whoosh of relieved breath the spratlys are twohundredfifty miles southeast of the annamese shores three hundred miles northwest of borneo right in the middle of the mouth of the south china sea twigg related a ship or ships working out of here could control the shipping trade in time of war especially if one were to be allied with native pirates who could patrol in their praos for likely pickings too far west for the spanish in the philippines to worry about too far north and west for the dutch or portuguese to deal with too far north and east of even this poor trading settlement of bencoolen for england to look in on im told a man named francis light may develop trading stations on the malay peninsula soon so that situation may change but properly fortified and garrisoned this little group of islands would be a hard nut to crack even in time of war when a fleet might be available this is where choundas shall be this is where he is based during the summer months where the pirates meet him where captured ships are looted and their crews taken and did we discover with whom choundas and sicard were in league mister twigg lieutenant choate asked would some of our prisoners be there still that we might rescue as to the last part of your question im afraid the answer is no mister choate twigg replied frowning while rubbing the bridge of his nose as though in pain there is little chance that any englishmen survived capture for very long especially if it was the native pirates who did it should they have theyd have been taken east to sulu island and sold in the great slave markets there and it would take a fleet to sail in there and free those unfortunates as to the first part we now know that the french are allied with the bloodthirstiest of the lot the lanun rovers from the illana lagoon on mindanao oh stap me brainard hissed with alarm more likely our people are skulls adorning their bloody praos by now goddamn french ayscough spat trust them to take hands with those devils not just as allies but friends well not for very much longer sir twigg said chuckling dryly i propose we strike the spratlys sometime after midjune when choundas and his piratical crew will be there when the lanun rovers will spend the summer with him we may catch them all in one fell swoop and just where is your pirate now sir sir hugo asked he left canton in late november sir hugo as i told you i suspect he waited downriver at macao for at least a week or so to see if we would pursue him when we didnt he most likely stopped in at the spratlys then sailed for the french possessions in the indian ocean we have information that his first stop would be lie de france to have a refit in the yards there those same yards service the royal french navy i might remind you his usual course of action his modus operandi if you will allow metwigg sniffed loftily but gave them all a brief smile to remind them that he was human after allwould be to sail on for pondichery where he would load a cargo of indian goods destined for canton in the fall a cargo that he would land at the spratlys since the goods would prove a liability to a privateering cruise he does not load opium only runofthemill wares that will not spoil during storage ashore the opium comes from our ships and he didnt sell any out of macao as i recall sir captain ayscough stuck in indeed not sir twigg agreed part of his innocent pose is to deplore the opium trade and a man so highminded as to forgo the profits of opium could never ever be suspected of anything so vile as piracy now could he hmm which set them all into ironic laughter then he and captain sicard of la malouine would meet in pondichery to put the bulk of their combined crews into poisson dor so hed be as wellmanned as any royal frigate sir percival asked with a hopeful expression exactly so mister percival twigg beamed at him like a fond daddy exactly as you surmised right then heres choundas waiting in pondichery for sicard and la malouine to arrive by at least the first of april but she wont this year nor next year either ha ha by midapril hell have smelled a rat whats worse for him sicard was to bring the profits from both ships to him he lost no money by having his cargo confiscated by the viceroy in canton their arrangement with that particularly corrupt mandarin made sure hed get full value from it and give him freedom of action to boot but suddenly hes starved of operating funds theres nothing to purchase a cargo with in pondichery no money to buy arms and powder for his piratical allies and more importantly no ship such as sicards to serve as his cartel for all the loot he expects to take this year of our lord weve limited his options to an early raiding summer here it strikes me though mister twigg lewrie spoke up that even the most valuable goods such as silver and opium take up a fair amount of cargo space surely la malouine could not carry all of it if only a quarter of the booty ends up in canton there must be some other ship or ships involved with choundas yet if he has as you say a full believable cargo stashed in the spratlys for his appearance in canton in the fall where does the rest of it go a great deal of it would end up in the market at sulu sir twigg countered brasswares copper indian cotton goods all of it would be just as valuable among the pirate bands as it would in canton no itll be choundas on his own this year ill wager driven by desperation to take more risks than before if hes any brains at all hell know the games over sir lieutenant choate insisted time to lay low for a season or sail home for france and let someone else take over for him for a while ah but he cant do that mister choate twigg insisted if he leaves the indian ocean he loses everything hes built up out here no rendezvous with the pirates in the spratlys say then what pirate would ever trust another frenchman to keep his word hed not only be discarding his present alliances hed be ruining a chance for anyone who follows the french ministry of marine who dreamed up his dirty business would never stand for that oh no why theyd break choundas to common seaman if he simply sailed away and i dont think our lad is the sort to cave in so quickly hes an ambitious little breton peasant a jumpedup fisherman who has no desire to end his days netting sardines in a filthy little smack pride goeth before a fall and our boy has an ocean of pride no he might be late for the rendezvous he may come emptyhanded but hell be in the spratlys by june so we should get telesto back to calcutta as soon as possible captain ayscough surmised after a year in asian waters and all that time idle in whampoa reach we have to careen and bream her bottom the weed on her quickwork looks like the forest of dean land our cargo unload the artillery first then refloat her and outfit her for battle and be back here toward the end of may to pick up sir hugos battalion and escort the lady charlotte transport to the spratlys twigg said bouyantly sail into harbor land troops and guns and blow choundas his ship and any pirates clean off the face of gods seas there was a lot of cheering that ringing speech cheers for a chance for action after festering at bencoolen in sodden heat and agues for final retribution against the hated french who had outmaneuvered them during the winter for a chance that this whole affair would end and telestos flexible term of commission could end snug in some english harbor by early they would be two years away from friends and family by then two years gone from their homes and did not relish the prospect of a third lewrie was not enthused though troubling questions had their way with his imaginings while he was most junior naval officer there he knew he had to speak them aloud before the conference ended later would look like croakum and twigg would not change his mind once they had settled on the plan unless forced to and afterthoughts would not be force enough excuse me again mister twigg he said clearing his throat to draw silence enough in which to speak his piece but choundas has had four months freedom to refit hes lost profits from this years work but theres no telling how much they earned the first two years he could outfit another ship to work with him hire a new crew to replace what he lost aboard la malouine and theres nothing to prevent him from already being in the spratly islands we didnt peek in to see if anyone held the islands for his return or if these lanun rovers were already there waiting for him we have no idea what were to sail into really and he has all the time in the world because i did not want to alert anyone who might have been in those islands until we were in all respects ready to strike when the basket was full so to speak mister lewrie twigg sneered in objection and as i have just related i have it on the very best authority that choundas will sail to pondichery first waiting for sicard to return and join him that is his usual wont twigg looked as if hed enjoy picking up a barker and firing a pistol ball right through lewries heart the durbar had been going so wonderfully well and his plan had carried when up popped lewrie with his moraleeroding carping his usual style sir lewrie replied smiling but things arent the usual this year he has us to worry about what the survivors of his crew remembered him doing in the past dont signify he could have looked into the spratlys and left some men behind as a garrison this time hired hands to man poisson dor with the hopes of meeting us on our way back to calcutta with la malouine tailing us to make it two against one he could be up in the nicobars or the straits of malacca waiting for that this instant or rush back to the spratlys ahead of last years schedule while we have to sail for calcutta and back to gain a march on us seems to me sir if we wait til june we either hit an empty bag or walk right into a bloody fleet of pirates and wideawake frogs he turned to his father who was scowling at his audacity to speak to authority like that as my dear father may tell you sir his troops would do us no good aboard their transport if choundas is ready for us his men would stand no chance at all and what would you suggest my lad sir hugo inquired stifling any objections that twigg was more than ready to raise that we hit the spratlys now sir alan stated that we do not allow choundas to form a combination against us with pirates of another cartel ship or hire another french captain to side with him were here even against the noreasterlies two weeks sail away with nearly a full battalion of troops trained for shore landings and equipped to fight land our cargo here in bencoolen for the nonce if we have to even if you have to sail to calcutta and back afterward we would hold the island before choundas even knows sicard is lost oh god twigg sighed shaking his head as though at the fireeating impetuosity of youth mister lewrie i thought better of you if we do take the spratlys and choundas arrives earlier as you say then he escapes before were ready to strike him and god knows what secret lair he establishes next ill not spend all this summer and all of chasing him round the great south seas and if we do take two precious weeks to delay our refit in calcutta we lose any chance of pursuing him the spratlys are a healthier climate for my fathers men than bencoolen sir alan rejoined and we would not have to depend solely upon telesto for support if you could dispatch another wellarmed country ship to our aid once were ashore and where pray do we find funds enough to do that sir twigg fumed why from the profits of this years trading season sir lewrie responded thats what theyre for surely twiggs jaw dropped open for a brief moment at the suggestion and before he could put a refuting argument into play sir hugo stood up and cleared his throat wandering to the map to peer at it sounds like a good idea to me he announced does it not to you as well as the senior navy man captain ayscough does your sailing master think a battalion could find decent provender there for a period of some months would it be healthier for my men if the place may swarm with pirates and frogs sir hugo itd support them decent enough brainard allowed and you have saltmeat and such for rations here and in the transport you could hold out long enough for us to get to calcutta and back with more and theres goats pigs and fowl enough here in bencoolen to take with you as to the climate its be not near as hot and a lot drier sea breezed make it seem ten degrees cooler and there is the possibility that this choundas fellows pirates might already be there could they not sir hugo speculated i dont know much about em but it seems to me itd be better to fight them now before they could ally with french artillery and trained gunners a battalion of welldrilled troopsd make mincemeat of em once were ashore why wait until your foe is lined up and ready to fire i say my officersll agree with me the way to defeat a larger foe is chew em up into penny packets first then boot hell out of the remainder knacker the buggers bit at a time gentlemen we twigg tried to object lewries right i think ayscough stuck in enthused from his torpor as you are sir hugo take them on in manageable portions is the best way lets also allow as how mister lewrie could be correct in thinking that theres much too much booty for only one or two ships to carry we might discover another frog cartel ship such as la malouine there hamstring the bastard even more i might point out twigg griped that it is nearly two thousand miles back to the spratlys sirs fifteen days sail against the prevailing northeasterlies at this season say three more to load the troops aboard the lady charlotte then nearly a month from there back to calcutta tis the third week of march now first week of april would put us here off the spratlys then three weeks back to calcutta would be the first of may not enough time to refit telesto and clean her bottom and make it back to the spratlys before choundas arrives it simply cannot be done sirs but from here to calcutta is only ten days a week to unload cargo lighten ship and careen her a week to set her to rights again and be back here to escort lady charlotte and the troops to our destination by the end of may sirs by the first week of june at worst when choundas most certainly shall be there and may be confronted and defeated then by all means sail to calcutta direct from here sir hugo said but let me take my battalion north now the same argument obtains we take the islands and the harbor defeat what pirates we encounter destroy or commandeer what works the french have built and await your return snugly ashore and entrenched as soldiers best understand sir and you dont wait until your ship is ready to put to sea do what do what my son suggested charter or purchase a fast wellarmed ship and crew to come reinforce us therell not be half a dozen suitable vessels in the hooghly to choose from sir the bulk of the country ships andeast indiamen will still be in macao or on passage still twigg snarled the slow ones will sir lewrie stuck in but we dont want anything to do with a slow ship like that rebel privateer john paul jones said give me a fast ship for i intend to go in harms way did he not and whats even harder to find in the east indies than trained european soldiers are trained european seamen and gunners twigg said in reply i captain ayscough began that is you and i mister twigg have writ from the crown to commandeer or recruit as we will the lady charlottes crew for one the crews of the patrol cutters and small brigs here in bencoolen why theyd trample each other to get out of this pesthole and see some action a fair amount of any merchantmans crew have navy experience who knows what loot there is to be found among those pirates enough lure of loot anyway to get any number of hands to sign aboard its not like we were meant to show a profit out of our voyages the earnings were to help support our work not line our pockets or end up surplus droits of the crown and heres another thought for you if you gentlemen would join me here at this window such as it is the assembly of infantry officers navy officers and civilian experts was drawn by ayscoughs prompting away from the table and the maps to gather by the window and stare out through the rains and the water guttering off the thatch and bamboo roof i conjure you to feast your eyes on the transport yonder the lady charlotte ayscough directed for the benefit of you army lads shes the shabby old bitch on the left not the splendid bristol fashion lady on the right ha ha lady charlotte was indeed shabby an old neglected drayhorse of a ship of about eight hundred tons burthen she mounted some sixpounder chase guns and sixteen twelvepounder great guns on her upper deck but had the gunports of a betterarmed ship my bosun may give up what paint we have ayscough told them merrily and he will if he knows whats good for him lady charlotte may be transformed into the very image of the stoutest fiftygunned two decker as ever swum a proper ocean bulldog or sir choate snickered she could end up looking remarkably like la malouine why bless my soul you nacky young bastard ayscough said with a booming laugh the first anyone had heard him utter in months i do believe youve been conniving with mister lewrie yes with a lateen yard on her mizzen for a spanker stead of yon gaff and boom she could be laying at anchor in the spratlys waiting for choundas to return imagine the consternation he would feel to expect her lost and there she is big as life sir lewrie chortled hed have to sail into harbor to speak her close enough for us to hull him with artillery he might sail right into a trap oil or varnish to darken her upper works and shed resemble la malouine well enough hed never fall for it twigg carped one never knows sir ayscough sniffed he might he just might and if telesto and the second vessel lewrie suggested that we hire were to be lurking offshore somewhere to the north yes to the north would be best i believe a shore party could send a signal to alert us as to the best moment to fall upon the harbor i most strenuously object to this dribbling of our assets into intotwigg splutteredpennypackets as crown representative captain ayscough damme sir any delay in getting to calcutta and there will be no second ship dispatched from there to succor colonel willoughbys troops and there will be the transport in harbor and defenseless her loss would destroy any hope of pursuing choundas should he not fall for your ruse in disguising her and strand our troops on this island a thousand miles from nowhere she could be escorted north by one of the patrol vessels here in the harbor already sir ayscough allowed turning to peer out the open window once more theres a ketchrigged ship out there thats suit see her yonder and if not her perhaps the brig lying farther out that might be best after all in addition to whatever vessel we may send out from calcutta before telesto is ready to rejoin our endeavor little better than fishing smacks and packets twigg scoffed some fresh paint the proper flag flying and at a distance who may deny they are not wellmanned warships ayscough shot back he was in a fine and confident fettle now and would not be gainsayed were i a pirate id not wish to fight one of them one hard battle yardarm to yardarm would cause so much damage the raiding season would be over right there thats the risk a privateersman takes i doubt if this frog choundas wants to fight a real battle against a flotilla after all overpowering one weak merchantman at a time is more his style even more reason for him to turn tail and run for god knows where as soon as he spots strange ships in his harbor twigg gloomed they might look like early captures lewrie suggested if they were in harbor sirs even more reason to enter and moor to see what the booty amounts to so far and should choundas arrive early enter harbor twigg carped and not be utterly destroyed then telesto hits that empty bag you spoke of with him days gone and free to plunder still come mister twigg you cannot have things both ways captain ayscough smirked either he will arrive early as lewrie suspects or he shall keep to his previous schedule as you bejieve either way sufficient force shall confront him twigg opened his mouth to make further objections but ayscough raised a restraining hand and cut him off you sir have fulfilled your brief you were charged with an investigation into the disappearance of so many of our merchantmen of identifying which native pirates were responsible and that you have done you were further charged with the task of unmasking the french behind their activities and that too you have accomplished you have found their base of operations when to expect their arrival to launch more depredations against english shipping and have raised a naval and military force to destroy them yes but but now sir ayscough hammered on the said destruction is a naval and military matter the proper use of those forces allocated to you and that use mister twigg is my bailiwick at sea and it is sir hugos on the land from here on out sir allow other batsmen to have their innings now you may hold our coats and about bloody well time too alan thought damn all civilian meddlers especially the ones that dreamt this horror up in the first place are you familiar with the vessels in harbor sir hugo the captain asked hmm i fear its my son who understands things nautical captain ayscough sir hugo replied chuckling the brig i believe though is a macao packet ive heard tell the whatyoucalledit a ketch is the local supply ship from calcutta or madras ive met their owners i shall wish to speak to them about hiring or selling us their ships should they prove suitable ayscough said decisively i believe that we have sufficient funds aboard telesto at present to do so and pay a guinea joiningbounty for every hand that signs into service do we not mister twigg aye sir we do twigg nodded all fight blown out of him sir hugo took alans arm and steered him out to the verandah as the details were thrashed out it was a little cooler but not much out of the overcrowded rooms they could hear twigg still insisting they sail for calcutta as soon as the weather moderated thank you for that back there alan oh youre welcome sir id have done just about anything to get my troops out of this malariaridden sink sir hugo said with some heat do you always up and speak your mind like that cant promise you an ambitious naval career if you keep that up but for now im grateful and for what you said about your dear father well about that sir lewrie cringed it was the only way to get your support you see get you to listen to what i had to say and back my play i expected you wanted to get your arse out of bencoolen before you went under to some sickness so what you want and what i thought needed doing could work together damn you you little shit sir hugo stiffened get mine own arse out of here do you think what i said about my men was so much moonshine ive never known you to care very much about anyone i dont know what to believe lewrie replied evenly by god alan you may think me the biggest sinner youll ever meet but youll not lay that on me his father growled before i wasted seed enough to quicken your miserable life i was a soldier may not have been a great one may not have been a glad one most of the time but i was good enough think what you will of me but by god above this battalion is mine i fought with it marched with it killed with it and bled with it weve cracked lice together eaten the same rotten food swilled the same filthy water and they look to me to do whats right by em and i will no matter what you think you may sneer at em sneerings a thing i remember youre quite good at so theyre not a fashionable english regiment think theyre not good soldiers just because theyre hindoos think its a comedown for me all i can command is a tagragandbobtail pack of barearsed bengalis well let me tell you even when they were at their worst theyre the best troops ive ever seen goddamn your blood and now theyve been fleshed out and equipped proper i could take them through the brigade of guards like suet through a goose something else im prepared to do and they know it im their colonelim ready to die with em if it comes to that aye you sneer all you bloody well want maybe you were born a bastard after all sir hugo reset his waistcoat the hang of his smallsword and thumped down the steps to the muddy yard leaving lewrie at a loss for words redfaced with sudden shame sir alan called out stepping down into the mud and drizzle father sir hugo halted and turned around squelching mud on his boots yes he snapped im sorry i didnt know alan admitted i didnt even know there was anything you really cared about except for money and quim well they still rate pretty high on my list of favorites sir hugo confessed doing what im best at horrible as it can be is on that list too you know i most heartily apologize father apology accepted son to be expected i suppose you know very little about me part of thats my fault come to my quarters you havent brought your band with you have you alan smiled no and the girls are in someone elses bibikhana now still i never travel without a decent wine cellar theres some claret you might appreciate sir hugo laughed id admire that thankee father you know sir hugo commented as they trudged across the muddy maidan of die military cantonment i dont half trust your man twigg ive yet to know what to make of him yes what bothered me most was what you said about scouting out the islands were to capture he sounded more eager to get his precious goods back to calcutta first ship in would reap a fortune fortune to fund your expedition out here yes and fortune enough to line the pockets of a palatikal with whats left over he knew alan spat out thats what surprised me right after we sank la malouine he knew by that morning at the latest and yet he kept it to himself told no one didnt suggest we look in on the spratlys if that taifun hadnt forced us down here to bencoolen for shelter i expect wed be halfway up the malacca straits by now your battalion be damned and hed sit on his news until wed crossed the hooghly bar probably wanted something to impress warren hastings with ah well hed better be quick about it then hastings is under a cloud theres talk from home of him sailing for england to face impeachment charges with john company might have someone new in the bengal presidency soon someone who doesnt know a bloody thing about our mission that could make things very interesting sir hugo frowned damme here come the bloody rains again i assume a sailor can run run or get soaked this sailor can alan said matching the older mans stride easily one thing to expect sir hugo puffed what twigg probably cares for you now as much as cold boiled mutton sir hugo replied between breaths look for a spell of the dirty chapter it didnt seem like a spell of the dirty even if twigg had a hand in influencing the captains decision ayscough had explained it to him lieutenant choate as first officer and his most reliable man would be the one first in line to take the job normally but he would be needed to take command of whichever suitable vessel they hired in calcutta while telesto was refitting to fill his vacancy he had to draw upon his nextmost experienced and skilled officer lieutenant percival to remain aboard telesto to advance to first officer in choates absence lieutenant mctaggart had to remain aboard telesto at least to calcutta and go as first officer for choate in his new captaincy captain ayscough could advance the midshipmenindisguise now serving as masters mates to mr brainard into acting lieutenants but they would be slender reeds upon which to depend to command the escort north with lady charlotte as i said in my journal about this matter mister lewrie the captain had told him that leaves only you but you have shewn yourself to be more than reliable competent and daring but not too daring i also made note that you only of the remaining commission officers had no matter your lack of seniority commanded a kings ship even briefly the chore is fairly simple if you do not exceed your brief and go off chasing pirates too rashly if they dont kill you then i shall lewrie got command of culverin she had started life in as a bombketch laid down in calcutta once the last war had spread from the colonies to a worldwide conflagration against the spanish the dutch and the french to be a bombketch she had to be solid and heavy enough to absorb the kick of two twelveinch mortars firing at high angle so she was made of teak as overbuilt as a st rate lineofbattle ship though her sides did not need to be as thick she would never have been required to stand in the line of battle anyway she was further stiffened with riders that were scarfed from her frames as crossmembers to the keelson up to the deck beams making her interior a maze totally unsuitable for large cargoes with much of her centerline length taken up below deck as magazine and shot racks for her former weapons the huge mortars were gone though the wells where they had sat remained one forward of her mainmast and one forward of her shorter mizzenmast culverin had been sold out of naval service once the war in the far east had ended in bombs were too easily replaced if war broke out again the admiralty decried the expense of maintaining many of them inordinary and their usefulness was limited to those occasions where highangle explosive shells needed to be hurled into harbors and fortifications along a hostile coast she would have seemed like the perfect answer to an enterprising captain for coastal trading about ninety feet on the range of the deck roughly the length of a trading brig about twentysix feet in beam and shoaldrafted to let her get within firing range of coastal forts her rig was only two masts instead of three making for less crew and ketches sported large gaffrigged foreandaft sails on the rear of her masts making sailing tacking and wearing ship even simpler all of whichher ease and cheapness of operation rigidity and stout construction and shallow drafthad convinced young captain dover to buy her and put her to work on the bencoolencalcutta run contracted to service the needs of that fearsome settlement with the occasional jaunt to macao running opium lurking somewhere in the back of his mind as well the only trouble was that she was not particularly weatherly even with foreandaft sails she could not go closehauled against the wind she could point closer to the wind yes but her shallow draft made her slip to leeward too much unlike a deeperbellied ship with more grip below the waterline and then there were those riders in her innards that limited the amount of cargo she could carry they could not be removed without dismantling culverin completely bolted as they were from the outside of her hull right through planking her beams and frames keelson and futtocks but at four thousand pounds sterling she had seemed a bargain so he had bought her and had been losing money on the deal ever since scrimp as he might to make her pay which was why captain dover had leaped at that chance not simply to hire her out but sell her outright even if twigg had only offered three thousand pounds neither was the enterprising captain dover quite so enterprising or ambitious as to remain aboard as part of the venture so he took passage for calcutta aboard telesto along with his first mate and four of his small crew that hadnt decided to cut his gizzard out yet most of the remaining crew were just as happy to see the last of captain dover though he left their pay in arrears so when ayscough harangued them to sign on at civilian pay rates with a golden guinea for a joiningbounty and the promise of untold loot they had agreed to stay with her he would have no surgeon or purser no sailing masternone of those excess warrants who made an officers life easier lewrie suspected hed have to swot up on how to lance boils issue biscuit and rum do his own navigation and almost serve as his own bosun he did get mr hogue promoted to acting lieutenant to serve as his first mate which helped immensely and ayscough gave up hodge and witty as senior hands owen the quartergunner hoolahan and some of the lower deck carronade gunners murray the forecastle captain to serve as bosun and cony to come along as cabinservant coxnseaman all in all he had including himself only sixtyfive people aboard thirty of them her original crew not exactly inspiring circumstances but she was a command and she was all his and once ayscough had delivered new paint and bosuns stores to put to rights the neglect shed suffered he had to admit that culverin looked almost saucy fresh red paint inboard bright blue upper bulwarks and the rest of her hull freshly varnished and some yellow paint to touch up her transom beakhead entry port quartergalleries and railings and fresh black paint grease and varnish for her guns she had once been outfitted with ten sixpounders in addition to those two monstrous mortars but they were gone now they had been replaced with ten twentyfourpounder carronades another sign of her recent civilian nature the carronades were lighter to mount only took two men per gun to fight them which required fewer paid hands and their recoil was lighter most merchantmen were switching over to carronades for those reasons and captain dover had swapped the original battery for them in madras finally four days after her purchase and refitting with her new crew sorted out into a semblance of naval discipline her holds former magazines and shotracks crammed with edibles and her mortar wells so crowded with livestock that she resembled the original ark they got under way chapter this aint all claret and cruising he sighed to himself on the sixteenth day of passage trying to take culverin north was a thankless chore with foreandaft sails hauled in close squaresails furled and flying all her staysls and jibs she would point within degrees of the apparent wind a whole point of sail higher than a squarerigger but she made so much leeway for every two feet gained forward it seemed she slipped foot sideways so for a course of roughly norwest she had to make a long board on the starboard tack to make progress then come about and do a short board on the port tack headed almost due east to correct her drift if not theyd have ended up somewhere in the gulf of siam and for a vessel with such a wide beam compared to her hull length she obstinately refused to put her shoulder to the sea on either tack never heeling over more than degrees or so like a proper ship with morerounded chines you say something sir hogue asked turning his head i said its not all claret and cruising mister hogue lewrie repeated louder this time well sir it is to me hogue smiled still bedazzled by his sudden advancement to partsailing master partlieutenant for myself this couldnt be a better day were roaring along like a whale they stood aft on the miniature quarterdeck which did not measure twentyfour feet by twenty out of the way of the long tiller bar by which she was steered and the bulk of the after capstan it was more like a poop deck steeved higher than most to give almoststanding headroom below in the officers and warrants quarters under their feet culverin was bucketing along ahead of lady charlotte they had decided to keep station up to windward where their little ship might have room to point up higher and slide sideways quicker without ramming the slower but betterbehaved squarerigger the winds were quite fresh trending more easterly than when the voyage began as the monsoon breezes shifted to their summer direction of soueasterly culverin rattled and banged her rigging sang to windsong and her wake spread out wide and white behind her creaming down her sides and frothing into a huge mustache under her bluff bows up shed ride on a long pacific swell then down shed swoop sedately cocking stern or bow into the air now and again when her bowsprit rose up to the blue skies shed fling a cloud of saltspray droplets around herself and now and again a fleeting rainbow would form across her focsle and shimmer in the slots between her jibs where air was compressed and sped along imparting drive those sails bedewed with atomized ocean nearly to the maincourse yard well ill be damned lewrie breathed taking in the glory of it dont know as how ive ever seen that before us lucky sir hogue laughed out loud weve a lucky little ship here now shes back in proper hands that is and i think she knows it captain murray said raising a knuckle to his brow nigh to seven bells o the forenoon sir permission t pipe clear decks an up spirits sir aye murray on the bell how are our hands doing with their merchantmen counterparts below main well sir murray shrugged theyve heard tell o all our ships disappearin an most o them had mates aboard some so theyre rarin t have at the frogs sir an the pirates too an the bootys got em pretty keenlike sir no problems so far the deck angled a bit more to leeward the starboard side going about six inches higher than before and lewrie turned to look at the helmsman at the tiller then at the long coachwhip at the peak of the mizzenmast truck winds backing on us at last he cheered put your helm down to larboard and keep her full and by aye sir the helmsman agreed full an by now she lays nornorwest half north sir well make that bloody island by sundown if the windswill only cooperate sir hogue stated we wont have to jog to the west so far now nor do a board back excellent if the wind does indeed stay backed lewrie said fretting for a while at the pendant seven bells chimed murray put his bosuns pipe to his mouth and blew the call for labors to cease and rum to be issued look sir murray exclaimed pointing over the windward bow to starboard dolphins sir come t play on our bow wave and flying fish too hogue added as a school of the fish broke the surface and began to beat their wings to race alongside culverin leaving a tiny frothing wake behind each dolphins an a rainbow captain murray sighed happily i blieve everthins gonna turn out aright this time the island is occupied chiswick stated once he was back aboard lady charlotte they had fetched the lowlying island just before sundown and had laid offshore out of sight sending a cutter in with a party of scouts from chiswicks light company then should we risk entering harbor and landing troops captain cheney of lady charlotte asked he was not a navy officer merely a civilian transporter of military and naval goods and people and had never been called upon in a long career to do anything really risky any ships in the harbor lewrie asked leaning over the chart hed obtained from mr brainard before telesto sailed for calcutta aye there were alan burgess nodded youd have to ask lieutenant hogue as to what they were though one small trading brig sir anchored here hogue said tapping the chart of the harbor with his finger and a slightly larger threemasted ship here we landed here on this narrow peninsula to the west of the harbor theres quite a good beach on either side and the ridge down the center is just high enough to screen anyone from view who lands on the seaward side theres not much vegetation for cover anywhere that i could see chiswick added looking up to match gazes with his colonel but these rocks were pretty jumbly the main encampment is farther along in the center of the curve of the harbor beach here so we could land troops here at the base of the peninsula sir hugo said humming to himself set up artillery atop the ridge here and advance down the beach and from slightly inland theres a flat place perfect for artillery sir chiswick agreed what about the ships mister hogue could their guns interfere with a landing once they were over the harborside of this peninsula lewrie inquired theyre moored foreandaft sir sterns to the peninsula starboard beams facing to seaward and the harbor entrance hogue went on the small brig is a yankee named poor richard out of boston i think she might be a prize tother is french for certain stella moris i couldnt make out her homeport gad what eyes the lad has sir hugo chuckled they were unloading cargo sir lots of worklanterns on both ships and long torches stuck into the sand a bonfire or two burning ashore as well hogue explained no mindanao pirate boats about yet i heard no english spoken though aboard poor richard thats why i think she was a prize just french was all i heard you went aboard captain cheney gasped well i swam out as close as i could sir hogue grinned making a night approach through a sharkinfested lagoon sound like nothing much but secretly pleased with his own fortitude as to guns theyve no springs on their cables sir none that i could see there was too much light on the water between ships so i could not approach stella maris but it didnt look as if she had springs fixed what about artillery ashore sir hugo pressed theyve a log and thatch fort sir rectangular with one long side facing the sea and the beach there are what look to be storage buildings inside the compound chiswick replied where they got the lumber god knows probably from looted ships theyve four guns on that seaward side and two each on either shorter end light stuff by the look of the platforms they were mounted on fourpounders on naval trucks not field carriages and there was a lot of drinking going on and i suppose you snuck up to the walls like a red indian sir hugo snorted well yes sir chiswick smiled proud of himself as well well then sir hugo beamed clapping chiswick on the shoulder that was bravely done sir now lieutenant lewrie just what do we do about this i defer to your military prowess colonel willoughby alan said in return when would you like to land your troops for an assault now sir hugo purred right bloody now while their attention is elsewhere and their bellies are full of pisspoor brandy any lookouts watching to seaward burge alan asked none that we found theres a start on a fourlegged tower in the palisaded encampment but its too low yet to even see over this peninsula i dont think theyve had this place constructed long weathers decent lewrie pondered captain cheney whats the state of the tide around first sparrowfart say at four am about the middle of the ebb sir but surely you would wait for the stronger ship to arrive from calcutta cheney replied paling since i dont know when that will be sir and i am here now and ready i cannot delay lewrie stated firmly not feeling quite as firm inside goddamn my eyes will you look at these fools looking at me as if ive moses scrolls tucked into my sidepockets ayscough surely couldnt have meant this much responsibility for me i might be going into as big a hornets nest as that idiot captain nelson did back at turks island and look what a ballsup that was how long for your troops to assemble on this beach set up artillery on this flat bench at the base of the peninsula and be ready to advance sir hugo i assume you prefer a dawn attack first boatloads on the beach at one am would be better sir hugo sniffed takes time to sway out those guns of ours get them ashore mount them on their trails and carriages and manhaul them up this slope rocky as captain chiswick says it is sure to be noisy as well captain cheney could you please be so good as to provide some scrap sans and rope fragments to muffle the noises for them sir aye mister lewrie but do you come to anchor here about half a mile offshore then lewrie pressed on feeling like a toddler having the presumption to purchase a house you have twenty fathoms of water there before it begins to shoal sand rock and coral bottom if all else fails you are in the islands lee and may fetchto without drifting too far to the west between waves of boats better yet take all of my ships boats to help things along i shall then stand offandon without the harbor entrance and enter harbor at six am will there be enough light for you then colonel even at low tide this entrance channel shows a possible five fathoms and culverin only draws one and a half with luck we shall overawe the french with none at all well have to close on stella maris here and get within two cables to shoot her to pieces with our carronades who shall fire first then sir hugo asked either way theyre sailors mostly lewrie schemed when things go to hell they run for their ship first you open fire at six am or when you see me enter the harbor channel captain cheney id admire if you had lady charlotte somewhere well in sight and close astern of me as you are able around that time you may at long range resemble a warship just enough to take the stuffing out of them i shall try sir but should i enter harbor block the entrance channel if all else fails aye sir cheney said looking squeamish enough that alan knew hed be nowhere near the harbor entrance at six am for all the best reasons hed not risk his thinsided transport at the behest of some jumpedup junior navy lieutenant well just as long as he may land the troops and stand seaward where he can be seen lewrie sighed that would be good enough heres to victory on the morrow gentlemen sir hugo proposed as glasses of wine were passed around by cheneys steward confusion to the french and clear heads for us lewrie chimed in the rest of the night was hell lewrie went back to his ship and went below to sleep her former master had had a large berth as big as a doublebed back home built into her stern quarters widening the transom settee into a solid bedstead instead of hay or cornshucks the mattress was stuffed with indian cotton which wicked up any night sweats one would suffer below decks in the sweltering tropics he had come to enjoy the berth with both stern sashwindows open for a sea breeze to cool him well enough to sleep undisturbed in those hours that a ships captain could expect to find rest but this night would not pass and he could find no ease not even a stiff glass of brandy could numb him into true slumber and there could be little of that anyway culverin stood offandon reaching across the easterly winds first north toward the island until near enough to see the hint of bonfires then tacking out to sea once more always clawing in her tacks up to the east to correct drift to leeward every two hours he was summoned to the deck to supervise the maneuver and lay the course he desired in between below decks he would shuck his clothing and attempt to sleep but then what if he would think and his mind would go galloping off on a flight of frenzied imagining had he forseen all that could go wrong had he forgotten anything vital and then those possible disasters would play themselves out in halfnodding nightmares from which he would snap awake only to slip into another goddamn im only twentytwo years old he muttered aloud who in their right mindsd ever give a twit like me this much to be responsible for he might get people killed on the morrow he knew some people would die for him what if they died for nothing like the battle of the chesapeake like yorktown like jenkins neck the expedition into the barrens of florida or trying to retake turks island hed go back over his plan once more finding gaping flaws in it would shiver with chill and bolt upright suddenly finding need to speak to lady charlotte or his father now ashore just one last time but that was impossible would pore over his one poor chart searching for omens for portents of victory or defeat they came about for the last time at four am just as the last of eight bells chimed ending the midwatch and the bosuns pipes sang to summon all hands to scrub decks and stow their hammocks in the bulwark nettings for the day time too to prepare for what the dawn would bring lewrie dressed in one of his navy uniforms spurning civilian clothes for the days bloody work the coat and waistcoat were badly wrinkled from being pressed to the bottom of his seachest mildewy and stiff with salt crystals from being so long at sea ready about mister hogue he asked aye sir helm alee lewrie shouted with nothing aloft but foreandaft sails on both masts there was little of the usual heavy labor involved except for the jibs up forward they almost tacked themselves should be here if we maintained an easy four knots during the night lewrie said peering at the chart tacked to the traverse board a little east of north would put us here even with the harbor entrance by halfpast five perhaps that would be even better than waiting until six and full dawn and if we have slipped to leeward that far during the night we may harden up to the wind and make it good sir hogue added dyou want t inspect the decks sir murray asked coming aft from the waist of the ship white decks are not the greatest thing on our minds this morning mister murray lewrie replied unable to suppress a smile hands to breakfast then douse the galley fires soon as theyve eaten aye sir murray replied knuckling his brow got some ot coffee sir cony offered an wotll ya be avin fer yer breakfas sir just the coffee cony thankee lewrie replied taking the mug in both hands to savor its warmth and its aroma land ho the lookout called where away one point off the starboard bow sir that should be the central hill the highest point above the sea and a little to the left of a direct line for the entrance alan surmised bending over the chart again then straightening quartermaster larboard your helm half a point no more pinch us up to windward a mite aye sir they should be able to see us by halfpast five sir hogue prodded aye lewrie nodded bows on coming into harbor like were expected with no flag flying now who i ask you would be stupid enough to enter a pirates lair but another pirate mister hogue they might go on their guard but they dont know what a surprise we have ashore already we shall have to chance it from here on aye sir hogue shrugged with him you get below and eat if youve a mind i have the deck lewrie said spell me when you get back so i may shave and then mister hogue we shall beat to quarters chapter were going to be damned early lewrie groused the winds out of the east were beginning to blow more freshly and culverin had the bitt in her teeth cleaving the early morning at a pace he did not like hands to the braces ease her sheets they winged out the big gaff sails until they luffed and fluttered then hauled them back in until the luffing eased but culverin was still making a rapid five knots too fast theyd arrive in the middle of the narrow harbor channel not a quarter of an hour past five am lower the outer flying jibs lewrie commanded it made little difference as if their little warship had a will of her own she slowed by perhaps half a knot and the shore loomed closer first reefs in the mainsls sir hogue suggested lewrie took a look at the chart once more gnawing on the inner side of his lips in frustration and worry last of the ebb still at least five fathoms in the entrance channel he told himself narrow entrance but widening once were in calmer waters once inside and the eastern peninsula will partially block the winds wed have to shake out our reefs once were in harbor and well be too busy for that and gunbatteries he almost gasped something else i didnt consider but only a fool would not have a battery on the tip of the western peninsula to guard the entrance speeds the thing get past them before they could get off more than a couple of broadsides no mister hogue stand on as we are he ordered i think a certain amount of dash is necessary this morning leadsmen to the chains now you take the gun deck aye sir sail ho the lookout called from aloft making lewrie feel like his bladder would explode t the larboard beam lewrie seized his telescope from the binnacle raced to the larboard mizzen shrouds and scaled them until he was about twenty feet above the quarterdeck thank god it was only the lady charlotte standing soueast from her night anchorage after disembarking the troops fulfilling her role as a possible threat she was deliberately being placed too far down to leeward to make the harbor entrance against the prevailing wind but at least she was obeying his command even in part it was getting light now light enough to see details on the island now not two miles off culverins bows suddenly lewrie was glad the wind had freshened now came the time when the plan lay at its most exposed troops possibly in position artillery ready for firing perhaps and culverin and another strange ship racing to enter harbor lets get it over with he thought eagerly he descended to the deck and stowed his telescope away trying to show that great calm which was expected of naval officers the calm which he had never quite achieved before things always seemed too urgent and desperate to him at moments like this to walk instead of run to keep a gamblers face instead of cheering his head off or cursing fate and a half two a leadsmen screeched from the focsle lewrie could not stifle a yelp of alarm where in hell was that shoal sprung from was it charted were they about to wreck this fine little ship he bent to the chart and sighed heavily it was marked an outer reef wall that lay tumbled like those the romans had built in the far north of england centuries before some islandtobe an outer harbor that might have existed long before a taifuns fury had shattered it coral heads and breakers to starboard two cables off thank christ and a half two the other leadsman shouted culverins keel was now skating across razorsharp coral with about six feet to spare if the chart did not lie please god he prayed three the first leadsman yelled three fathom it sounded like a winter wind to hear all the people on the quarterdeck sigh out in blissful relief at the same time and culverins captain the loudest of all six fathom at low tide from here on to the entrance alan told them once he had got his breath back well see breakers to the west on the shoals off the peninsula and a long line of breakers to eastrd the entrance is a cableandahalf wide gentlemen and the main channel will be dead in the center right quartermaster aye sir the man replied chewing vigorously on a plug of tobacco hands to the sheets harden up mister murray aye sir one mile to go with culverin gaining speed once more dull grey light of false dawn twelve minutes past five in the morning culverin sailing almost flat on her bottom on a reach a soldiers wind across her beam the shore nearing the breakers crashing and foaming above the sound of her wake the rush of ocean round her cutwater and down her sides foaming up in low waterdunes on either side of her bows sucking low amidships hummocking under her narrower sternquarters before spreading out into tumbled briny lace in her train artillery murray gasped yes over the sounds of culverin as she sprinted over the hiss and roar of the breakers there came sharp little flat bangs tiny tongues of flame on the base of the western peninsula lit up the predawn the th native infantry had seen culverin rushing at the entrance like a cavalry charge and had opened fire a point to windward quartermaster put yer helm down lewrie commanded eyeing the disturbed water of the channel breakers abeam the tip of the peninsula to the west and the jumbled sucking shoals even with the mainmast culverin staggered as she met the breakers cocked her bows high as she was for a moment checked by the mass of water then surged onward surfing atop a great growler of a wave with spray flying over the quarterdeck and the long curved tiller bar almost alive and kicking with two quartermasters throwing their strength on it to keep her from broaching sideways onto the next wave astern then she was through into calmer waters hoist the colors lewrie shouted let these bastard frogs know who theyre dealing with the battery of guns on the peninsula fired once more and they could see tiny little whiteandred ants rushing forward to the attack from the jumbled rocks of the headland squeal of a metal sheave as the navy ensign soared up the gaff on the taffrail and cracked in the wind and the sun rose a tropic sun that exploded over the grey horizon like a bomb as bloodred as roses larboard battery stand by open the gunports and run out there was no battery of guns on the western peninsula some men running along the strand back toward the palisaded encampment or back to the safety of their ship before all hell broke loose but no guns to threaten his vessel harden up helm down a point more hogue was chanting instructions to the guncaptains as they cranked in elevation with the rear setscrews as they wheeled their long recoil slide carriages pivotting on the mounting bolt at each gunport the rear iron wheels rumbling as the carronades were aimed as far forward in the ports as they would bear well give yon brig the first taste mister hogue lewrie shouted forward through a brass speakingtrumpet fire as you bear aye aye sir a long minutes wait as culverin ghosted forward more slowly now that she was winded by the eastern headlands the wind snaking its way across the breakers where it found no resistance creating a little river of air more from the southeast than the east one more point to windward lewrie said closehaul her stand by hogue shouted as you bear fire five terrifically loud explosions spaced evenly as a fired salute one splash close aboard poor richard two strikes on her lower wales making her rock and splatter hullshaped rings about herself two more strikes that struck her upper works twentyfourpounder solid shot creating whirling clouds of dust and debris and shattered planks flying as high as her maincourse yard to splash down alongside and again lewrie shouted more abeam this time instead of aiming far forward now the range was under a cable and they couldnt miss poor richard heeled over and shivered with each hit her masts whipping across the sky and shedding rigging there seemed to be no resistance aboard her cease fire lewrie ordered aim forward for the next ship and stand by stella maris was a different breed of cat entirely her ports were opening men swarmed aloft to loose canvas and axeheads glinted in the sunlight as they tried to cut her bow and stern cables to escape a ranging shot howled over the quarterdeck from one of her aftermost gunports and other gunports were opening luff up quartermaster lewrie snapped with the tiller hard over culverin turned parallel to stella mans to bring her guns into bearing her sails now pointed straight into the wind and flapping in thunderous disarray as you bear fire hogue obeyed goddamn my eyes murray howled with glee oh bloody lovely the trunk of stella mans mizzenmast was sheared in two and the upper portion of the mast came down like a giant tree to drape in the water over her stern ripping all the standing rigging and running rigging to shreds aloft her transom and rudder post shattered into a swelling maelstrom of broken timbers and planks part of her upper bulwark on her quarterdeck disappeared and starshaped holes burst into existence in her hull again lewrie raved hit the bitch again he went to the larboard side climbed up on the bulwarks gripping the mizzen stays and spread his arms wide as culverins guns belched fire once more eat it froggies he screamed across at them see how you like the taste of that another minute an well be in irons captain murray said from below him helm up to starboard keep a way on her slow as you like but keep a way on her larboard battery together fire hogue screamed as the ketch bore off a little getting some wind in her sails once more to skirt down toward the french ship it was a blow right under the heart stella marts shook like she had an ague as the weight of that broadside lashed her pieces of her whined through the air making lewrie jump down from his vantage point and go back to the binnacle in the middle of the quarterdeck close and board her sir murray asked no mister hogue cease fire hands to the sheets lewrie called stand by to come about stations for stays well make too much leeway if we continue on this tack mister murray better we sail up to windward on the larboard tack then wear ship and come back to give her the starboard battery with the wind up our stern no reason to board her and get our people cut up when we can lay off and shoot her to pieces if it takes all morning within half a cable of the stricken stella mans culverin showed her her stern as she tacked across the wind to run south at the wall of breakers but long before she got anywhere near them they tacked her again and drove her toward the eastern shore the leadsmen chanting out the depth once again three fathom hands to the braces helm alee wear ship to larboard culverin came about across the eye of the wind then farther taking the wind across her stern at last steering back down to the west with the beach on her starboard side and the wind on her larboard quarter stella maris had by then cut her cables and was underway of a sorts if one wanted to be charitable about it she had paid off from her headtowind anchorage somehow pivotting off her fallen mizzenmast bumping against poor richard astern of her and was aiming for the harbor entrance hands were laid out on her topsl and course yards to get sail on her but there was no wake about her yet slow as she was her ravaged rudder not yet getting a grip on the water aim right for her bowsprit lewrie said well round up as we close to fire broadsides then point at her directly to make less of a target before the next is ready shell make a lot of leeway sir murray warned if they aint careful theyll have her on the beach o that western headland sure as fate even more reason to stand off and shoot her to ribbons at a safe distance lewrie chuckled once we strike three fathoms back we go onto the wind lets take the first reef in the gaff sails on main and mizzen were much faster than she is now aye sir culverin came on like doom implacable and menacing for all her saucy handsomeness her gunports open and carronades cranked forward ready for another broadside stella maris began to slide across her bows as her crew got a staysl and jibs set and a foretopsl let fall at last to give her some steerageway the troops ashore have the palisade sir murray pointed out an english flags flyin on that tower o theirs three points of larboard helm now quartermaster stand by the starboard battery fire lewrie shouted oblivious to what was taking place on the island almost lost in blood lust to finish off his part of the day the carronades roared out their challenge one at a time stella maris quailed and cringed at each hit shying away downwind culverin went back onto a westerly course pointing her jibboom and bowsprit right at her until the guns were loaded once more when they rounded up the next time the range was just about yards take your time with your aim sirs lewrie told his gunners hogue brought down his arm and his voice was lost in the howl of the guns more shattered wreckage soared about her as the iron shot ripped her open masts quivered and shed blocks and cordage in a rain the men at her helm were scythed away by a ball that struck on her quarterdeck bulwarks a quarterdeck gun and its carriage took to the sky tumbling over and over before splashing into the water to the downwind side stella maris no longer under control sagged down off to leeward presenting her stern to them listing noticeably to starboard where their first broadsides had punished her already men were tossing over hatchcovers to escape another volley of shot shell go aground on the beach lewrie shouted in triumph cease fire cease fire mister murray round us up and let us get ready to anchor about there i should think springs on the cables before they could lower their sails and drop their bower the french ship struck by then she was well heeled over and sinking low in the water with the wind behind her she hit the shoals and sand the savage coral heads of the harbors western shore going at least knots per hour not enough forward progress to tear her open but enough to jam her onto the coral heads and pound and pound so that she came apart slowly her masts stayed erect for a time before the strain on the larboard rope stays became too great and they popped one at a time to lower her masts yard by jerking yard until they groaned and split to topple into the sea they got culverin anchored by bow and stern springs on her cables so she could swing in a great arc to aim her guns at any ship attempting to enter the harbor the gun crews were stood down and lewrie ordered the mainbrace to be spliced in sign of victory he even took a mug of rum and water himself suddenly reeling with exhaustion with relief that it was over and that not a manjack of his small crew had even been wounded with the lack of solid fare in his belly and with the shuddery weakness he felt at the conclusion of a battle sail ho the lookout called from aloft oh god what next lewrie asked the heavens where away what ship he shouted back lady charlotte sir bearin fer the harbor mouth came the reply whew lewrie sighed laughing at his own fear whew chapter stella maris wrecked on the shoals and her surviving crewmen made prisoner he wrote in his lieutenants journal which would also be a first draft for his report to captain ayscough when he came to the island and the official account of the venture someday in faroff london and the admiralty we discovered storehouses ashore in the palisaded fortress hmm he speculated it wasnt exactly a fortress now was it a bamboo log palisade with ships planking for reinforcement and built so amateurishly one could have hurled a large dog through it anywhere one wished still fortress would read better back in official circles than armed cattle pen he dipped his goosequill pen in ink and continued more than a little tongueincheek the goods amassed were considerable both genl trade goods to an estimated value of ј quantities of gangetic opium silver rendered into oz bars chinese taels to a value of ј also discovered were stands of arms french mod st etienne arsenal muskets with all accoutrements cutlasses pole arms boarding pikes espontoons powder shot six pdr french naval carriage guns powder shot ditto twelve pdr cannon unmounted do he leaned back and took a sip of a rather good bordeaux that had traveled exceptionally well all the way from its point of origin to this dry and rocky hell halfway around the world and outlined to his superiors what a clever little fellow he had been how he had dismounted some of lady charlottes twelvepounders and sited a threegun battery on the point of the western peninsula to protect the harbor they now occupied how they had finished the observation tower in the fort to an advantageous height giving them a thirtymile radius to espy the arrival of their foes or the relief ships how the captured guns with carriages had been sited to scour the harbor should any ship get inside and the crew of the lady charlotte had been commandeered he preferred that word to pressganged into serving as gunners stella maris stripped of all her fittings and useful articles her artillery and powder that had not gotten soaked employed in further defensive positions atop the high ground of both headlands before she was burned to the waterline and the ribs and carcass towed off the shoals to sink out of sight in deeper water stella maris provided material with which to refit poor richard this american whaler was restored to her capt one lemuel prynge such of her crew as survived their seizure cruel enforced servitude their rightful cargo put back aboard poor richard allowed to sail for manila the closest port where they could hope to meet up with other yankee vessels a snr owner master bearing dipl title of consul with whom capt prynge assured me the most strenuous representations against the french govt would be presented he concluded by listing the very few dead and wounded among the native infantry the utter lack of hurt to his ship or his men the great number of french dead and wounded the names of the americans who had died or been hurt by capture or captivity and strong praise for those of his warrants and seamen he thought deserving what else he muttered leaning back in the rattan chair that creaked and gave most alarmingly as he did so the table the very walls of this shore house were of the same material fetched from god knew where surely not from anything that grew on the island that was for certain even the thatch of the roof was of palm fronds and fairly fresh too so it had been a recent import to spratly island he thought about putting down his suspicions that the illana pirates had already come to visit but decided against it a lieutenants journal was for wind tide and seastates for weather or ships routine for a different slant on eventsnot for idle musings he closed the inkpot sluiced his pennib off in a cup of water and blew on the pages he had written to dry them a slow process that mr brainard had promised cooler climes at spratly but if this was in anyway dryer or cooler than bencoolen it was a matter of degree only they had had several spells of freshening weather as the winds shifted more soueasterly to the seasonal norms of the summer monsoons wind lashings of rain cool blustery halfgales that so far had not swelled to shipthreatening storms the cisterns and rockpools had filled with water and culverin and lady charlotte had caught hundreds of gallons of fresh water in canvas chutes enough to succor the men and animals brought to the island enough to support all the livestock running wild or penned up for slaughter the french had brought frankly they had enough livestock to start a wellrun estate and that was just the imported animals what ran wild on the island could keep one awake at night with their miniature stampedes and alarums everyone had been eating well ever since they arrived he finally got the ink dry enough to roll up the pages and tie them with a hank of thin rope then went out to check on his latest project rather his fathers latest project for which he was giving up a few crew members no ship could take being fired upon with heated shot once a redhot iron ball lodged in a ships timbers the tinderdry wood took fire like fat pineshavings lt col sir hugo st george willoughby had suggested a battery for that purpose and lewrie had concurred eagerly said battery was now installed above the fortress halfway up the rocky slopes of the central hill he toiled up the rough path to the battery to take a look at it two twelvepounders sat in a hollow partially dug into the slope screened from view by a shielding wall of boulders laid loose against each other and some dry brush there were two wide embrasures through which they could fire and cover the entire harbor and being about sixty feet higher than the beach gained an advantage in range over a shipmounted artillery piece that might try to return fire there was a magazine dug into the back slope and off to one side where it never could threaten the powder supply was a rock forge where iron cannon balls could be heated before being carried to the battery and loaded down the muzzles of the guns firewood should have been a problem except that stella marts had provided tons of scrap lumber and enough bariron to make the cradlesized carrying tools for heated shot poor richard had also gladly sold several barrels of whale oil with which to ignite the forge and alan had an idea lurking in the back of his mind about the rest of the whale oil good morrow to you alan his father said as he reached the battery and to you as well sir he replied are you ready for a test of this contraption just about sir hugo nodded several of his sepoys were hacking hull and deck planking from the unfortunate stella maris into kindling ever used heated shot no sir alan chuckled not a good idea aboard a ship at any time and during battle well im told the french tried it but had disastrous results been shot at with it at yorktown though by my calculations i expect to be able to fire random shot to almost the outer harbor breakers along the reef line sir hugo said but theres only two fathoms at high tide out there anything worth shooting at would be aground that far out lewrie replied one of his other ideas to keep his hands busy and out of mischief or boresome rumbling was to survey the harbor at low tide and update mr brainards chart correcting what he found mismarked or filling in a few mysterious gaps those mistakes and gaps were horrendous taking the average of noon sights with hogue and captain cheney and his officers they found that spratly island itself was incorrectly charted out of its actual location by at least fifty miles the coastline was half imaginings and the soundings inside the harbor seemed to be the speculations of a terribly optimistic mind it made him cringe every time he thought about how he had trusted that chart when he sailed into harbor over that broken reef wall and through the pass maneuvering free as a brainless sparrow over its entire length and breadth during the fight with stella maris in a proper ship such as a frigate hed have been wrecked half a dozen times over id admire a copy of that chart of yours then sir hugo bade very useful for my binkinabob my gunnery officer i shall have it done directly sir alan offered sail ho the tower lookout screamed choundas sir hugo stiffened it very well may be alan agreed grimly tis the middle of april time enough for him realize sicard isnt available any longer and then sail from pondichery it was a jumbled run down to the enclosed fort then up the rickety towers bamboo ladders to the top platform easier to continue to the top of the hill he was already on which was almost as high sir hugo grabbed a spyglass and they halfran halftrudged up the slope to the windswept crest where away alan shouted down he could not hear the lookouts returning shout but the man pointed to the east bloody hell now who could this be choundas coming back from an early meeting with his natives sir hugo snapped he might have never gone back to the indian ocean not with us on his trail get an early start and reinforcements once they had gotten their breath back and had steady hands sir hugo extended the tubes of the telescope and peered at the eastern horizon here he snarled cant see a damned thing and alan noted his hands were none too steady either if i might borrow your shoulder for a rest sir he asked and as the sailor in the family i might know what to look for a sail very much resembles what you might take for a cloud some there was a sail out there to the east in point of fact there were a lot of sails dark tan they looked almost silhouetted by the early morning sun and fairly low to the water with the wind out of the soueast now as a steady trade wind he was looking at the cusps of someones topsis perhaps angled to take the wind from the stern quarter running almost free with a landsmans breeze but there were so many of them almost as many as the first sight hed had from the desperate frigates tgallant yard the morning the french fleet under de grasse sailed back into chesapeake bay i count at least twelve perhaps fifteen sail lewrie muttered it could be a fishing fleet but i doubt it they look like praos with their one squaresail flying if they come up over the horizon and dont pass on by theyre coming here the lanun rovers sir hugo spat come to meet with choundas come to the spratlys for whatever purpose they have yes pray god they enter harbor sir hugo snickered shaking alans resting telescope with your batteries your ship and my guns and my troops waiting ashore we could make it damned hot for em well let me tell you weve tangled with praos before last autumn alan replied hold still would you please sir each one carries nearly an hundred pirates not much in the way of artillery but we have to be looking at well closer to fifteen boats now so that could be a force of over fifteen hundred men the more the merrier sir hugo shrugged waving the resting telescope tube about the sky forcing lewrie to close it and give up a bloody check here could ruin this fellow choundas how the devil do you come by that alan asked when you slap your invited guests in the face they dont invite you to their house for supper any longer now do they lad sir hugo boomed then wed better make sure we leave a few to carry word back to their lairs should we not alan said getting the drift choundas would not know of this until he tried to meet up with his native allies and they just might do the english the favor of cutting the mans heart out for spite i wonder if those pirates yonder know the difference between a french and an english flag sir hugo speculated humming some song to himself whether they do or not sir i do believe youre going to get a practical test of this battery of yours before the days out chapter by god what a fearsome sight lewrie thought pacing his tiny quarterdeck as the mindanao pirates from the illana lagoon came into the harbor no matter the surprises theyd discover once they got in range no matter the number of artillery pieces ready to lash every inch of the bay or the troops waiting with loaded muskets and fixed bayonets to receive them they were a terrifying spectacle eighteen large oceangoing praos crammed with warriors all experts with their wicked curved swords and krees knives with artillery and muskets warriors used to raiding cruises that the unfortunate mr wythy said lasted up to three years no shore in all of asia was safe from their depredations no native troops could stand against them if such troops stood between them and plunder cheer em boys lewrie shouted with a grin plastered on his phyz theyre your bloody allies damn their black souls theyre going to help you take ships and make you rich christ amighty hoolahan whispered crossing himself as he stood by his carronade but theys a passel o the fuckers sor not a one of em half the man you are hoolahan lewrie assured him with a clap on the shoulder as he paced along down from the quarterdeck to the waist of the ship where the artillery waited ready to fire when the word was given got your swivel charges ready for em spears oh aye sir good lad now wave your hat and cheer em the bloodred praos breasted easily over the harbor bar through the disturbed breakerwater and spread out furling their single sails at long last after a long passage they might have stopped off on the coast of borneo dangerous as that was even for them among the headhunters and done the last three hundred miles to spratly most of the men in the boats stood and waved back brandishing swords muskets or older matchlocks like hindoo jezails whooping fit to bust they had livestock with them crammed in anyoldhow and slaves to do the rowing at the long paddles yes they must have replenished on borneo alan decided to have that much food aboard and it appeared theyd come prepared for a long stay every prao was piled high below her rowing benches with bamboo logs and palm leaves with which to make huts lewrie made his way back to the quarterdeck watching the pirate fleet advance in a ragged band making for the beach steering a course for culverin and for lady charlotte lady charlotte wore the french merchant flag on her stern and her spanker gaff had been given a stunsl boom lashed to its inside end to make it look like the older lateen that the pirates would expect to see on sicards la malouine culverin too flew an extemporized french ensign painted on one of lewries bed sheets oh christ dont beach your damned ship there hogue prayed as three praos angled for the inviting strand on the western peninsula there were troops there hidden in the rocks at the crest with some light artillery to support them unlike newer naval guns those were fired with powderfilled goose quills or tin ignition tubes to ignite the powder charges in the barrels and that required a burning length of slowmatch to touch the quills or tubes off slowmatches which were now lit and smouldering giving off tiny trails of smoke if a pirate spotted that before the ambush could be sprung theyd have a battleroyal on their hands and the troops could not hope for total cover in the rocks let someone walk up the beach a few yards and the game would be over there were thousands of the buggers just as he had surmised and even with modern weaponry sir hugos troops could be overwhelmed the two ships could be swamped with fanatically enraged pirates with no hope of aid from shore come on you buggers lewrie muttered go on and beach your silly arses by the fort where the goodies are waiting the plan was to wait wait until most of the pirates had beached or anchored their boats at the fort canvascovered piles of what looked to be trade goods sat out in the open delectably available once between lady charlotte and culverins guns and the firepower available ashore the trap would be sprung sir hugo had enough men to cover the north shore around the fort and part of the western headland only able to spare a halfcompany to reinforce the heavy battery on the point if the pirates tumbled to it earlier it would be a near thing as to who would get the worst of it praos drifted by to bow and stern some coming very close in as they passed it was much like being in the middle of a pack of hungry sharks i think this bastard wants t come aboard sir murray said pointing to one prao that was rounding up below the entry port do we let em sir christ lewrie hissed hard as the battle to take the island had been on his nerves it couldnt hold a candle to this there was a person of some rank among the pirate band standing on the rails of his boat waving and shouting demanding entry ashore lewrie said pointing in that direction ashore hey you go there no come here he was all but wiggling his bottom trying to get the gist of his message across one pirates eyes over the bulwarks to see loaded cannon and crews at the ready and theyd swarm culverin like a hive of disturbed bees he dont sound too happy about it sir murray warned the pirate clad in a clothofgold turban green silk skirt jewels and weapons was gesticulating and swearing to beat the band upset that his will was being defied that his august personage was being waved off instead of catered to oh god look sir hogue yelped those three praos had beached themselves on the western shore and their crews were disembarking stretching and bending to loosen muscles kept taut at sea and were spreading out in a dense pack over the peninsulas beach stand by with those grenadoes mister hogue lewrie warned well if you want to come up who am i to stop you you little bastard he relented waving and bowing for the pirate to scamper up all hands stand ready ready to hoist the proper colors the pirate took on a smug look having gotten his way with the infidels at last and began to step up to the mainmast chains the rail of the prao was not so far below culverins bulwarks most of em past us lewrie asked going to the starboard gangway to greet his unwelcome visitor about half looks like sir hogue shuddered like to faint with anxiety only bout half so far best well do then lewrie sighed his own nerves twittering like a dropped harpsichord he stood and waited for his visitor a smile on his face the pirate stepped up on the bulwarks and frowned when he saw what waited him he opened his mouth to yell lewrie drew his hanger and lunged he put the point in just around the navel and sank an unhealthy foot of steel into the mans belly before he even had time to shout or draw breath he was over the side tumbling back into the water between the ships grenadoes lewrie screamed open your ports and open fire get english colors aloft the signal for the opening of the battle even as the pirates were beginning to realize their captain was dead and starting to howl with rage empty wine bottles went over the side with wicks burning some were filled with whale oil some with gunpowder and cut up scrapiron bits when they shattered they burst into flames among the densely packed pirates among their galleyslaves at the rowing benches those that did not shatter those wrapped about with cloth to protect them exploded as their fuses burned out and reached the powder they caused more panic than casualties but it didnt do the pirates nerves any good and then the ports were open and the carronades were firing the light twopounder swivel guns were spewing lethal loads of canister or grapeshot down into the boats closest alongside scything howling pirates down in midcry praos farther off rocked and came apart at the touch of solid shot spilling their crews into the water once the prao alongside was fended off and allowed to drift shoreward on fire and already sinking lewrie ran back to the after deck where cony waited with his personal weapons he took the time to see lady charlotte blazing away with her remaining heavier longbarreled twelvepounders ringed with boats the shore beyond her was almost lost in the crackle of musketry and the clouds of gunpowder produced by the infantrymen and the firing of the light artillery there was a blast of smoke high up the hill as the first of the hidden battery up there fired and a great feather of spray sprang into being next to a pirate boat farther off lewrie went to the rail with the ferguson rifle he had obtained at yorktown and began picking off those pirates who seemed to be leading in the nearest boats cony was himself a fair shot as well and he used a caliber fusil to snipe at helmsmen and gunners aft lewrie shouted hands aft get a swivelgun here there was a prao out there not two hundred yards off that was being turned with its oarsmen aiming its two focslemounted guns at culverins unprotected stern hands came running bearing the weight of one of the portable swivels dropping the long spike on the base of its mount into one of the holes along the taffrail as lewrie fired again bullets sang in the air as pirates let fly with muskets at impossible ranges only a few being able to reach him lewrie sat down on the flag lockers to one side of the tillerhead braced himself on the railing and aimed for the foredeck of the prao he pulled the firelock of the ferguson back to full cock and bent to sight on one of the gunners holding a little high for drop at that range he let his breath out and pulled the trigger there was a respectable bang as the piece discharged a whoosh of burned powder in his face from the pan but he had struck his man at nearly two hundred yards there were only two weapons in the world that could fire that far the american kentucky rifle and the ferguson and the ferguson was a proper military piece he cranked the lever under the stock one turn dropping the screwbreech out of the way pulled the dogsjaws back to halfcock and bit the end off a cartouche priming the pan with some of the powder inside rammed the rest into the rear of the rifles breech screwed the breech shut with one turn of the lever fullcocked the weapon once more and aimed another shot and another pirate down with a ball through his back and then another and another and the pirates began to shrink away from their guns no one could kill at that range that quickly the swivelgun went off spears had aimed just as carefully and put a solid twopound shot into the pirates forecastle where it shattered and crazed the air with savage shards of itself flinging pirates right and left that was one vessel that had lost interest in trying to rake culverin up the stem make it hot for em spears lewrie ordered getting to his feet bow sir hogue was shouting and waving for lewrie to join him and off lewrie went racing forward up the narrow path between the guns on the main deck to the focsle to face another hazard here he found a prao almost under their jibboom with a horde of raving pirates ready to board grenadoes here swivelgun with canister lewrie snapped taking a deep breath to steady his aim he loosed a shot from his ferguson splattering the leaders brains on his minions then dropped the rifle and pulled his pistols a shot from the right weapon then a shot from the left while cony lit fuses atop wine bottles and got them ready to hurl for gods sake cony get rid of those damned things dont wan these buggers athrowin em back sir his man replied tossing one to soar endoverend quickly followed by a second two explosions and the whining of broken glass bent nails and musket balls quickly followed by wails of alarm then cony was up and throwing the flammable variety which he had purposely lit and set aside so they would be going nicely when he needed them these burst with softer whoomps as they shattered and the whale oil splashed on the boat and its fell crew and took light turning the wails into impassioned screams the swivelgun lit off scattering death almost within touching distance and pirates melted away from their own forecastle to shrink back amidships muskets banged and the swivelgun man by lewries side screamed as he was flung backward as if hammered with a heavy sledge lewrie bent to pick up the dropped canister bag he tilted the long barrel straight up dropped it down without taking time to ram it firmly home and stuck the sharp end of a linstock into the vent to puncture the powder charge in its flannel sleeve he had to bend to the deck once more to retrieve the fallen sailors goosequills and slowmatch more shots sounded and musket balls flailed the air over his head thudding into the fore part of culverin bows like hammer blows cony was still heaving away with grenadoes ducking and weaving through a sleetstorm of lead more sailors were coming forward to return fire with their brown bess muskets lewrie blew on the slowmatch stood up behind the swivelgun and aimed at the thickest part of the throng he touched off the quill and the world was blotted out for a second or two by the dense blast of powder smoke when it cleared there were no more pirates on their feet anywhere aboard the prao except a few stunned survivors in the sternposts who were cut down with musket fire even as they stood there stupefied cony do you take charge of the focsle and keep em off us lewrie shouted in his ear before gathering up his rifle dropped pistols and moving back amidships to reload where it wasnt so dangerous carronades to either beam were firing every few seconds the swivels along either bulwark were blasting away as were the ones aft lady charlotte he could see had cleared the waters around her with her highvelocity guns and lewrie could spot the halfsunken wrecks of at least three praos no prao would venture within range of his own carronades for once hit they were shattered like tea cups by the heavy shot culverins guns had done for three more of them already lewrie regained the quarterdeck puffing and blowing to get his wind back and to get a sense of the battle from the higher vantage point the battery on the point was blasting away steadily one gun at a time of the three firing on pirate boats that were making their way for the harbor entrance the ambush had been badly sprung before every victim was in the killing zone at least ten boats were off on their way to escape those three that had landed on the peninsula were still there their crews just falling back in disorder from a charge against the troops on the crest he could see redcoated soldiery rising from the rocks and beginning to advance in two lines with their bayonets winking in the sun and all the while their light guns were spraying canister and grapeshot into the pirate band ashore by the main encampment it was impossible to tell what was going on for all the smoke but he thought he could espy at least four praos grounded on the beach one of them well alight and pouring out greasy black smoke there were three more boats that had sailed for the far eastern headland and were mucking about in a quandary of doubt flee for the harbor entrance against those guns on the point rejoin the fight ashore or tackle the ships again a glowing ember dashed from the rising pillar of smoke ashore soared in a sinking arc and struck one of the praos making her shake like a kicked kitten within half a minute the boat was aflame and her crew abandoning her if it accomplished nothing else this day his fathers heatedshot battery had proved its worth there sir hogue shouted as some praos came reeling out of the smoke from the shore bent on escape larboard battery load and stand by lewrie shouted through his brass speakingtrumpet we clear aft spears aye sir fer now the man shouted back as he reloaded the nowhot swivelgun for another shot clear forward cony he asked fairly well sir cony said with a fierce smile bloody hell what does that mean lewrie fumed whatever it had meant it would have to do for there were now six praos headed their way rowing madly to get out of the gunarcs of lady charlottes twelvepounders between culverins anchorage and shore there was a halfmile of water with careful aim and gunlaying lewrie could expect his carronades to scour only half that distance for a carronade was a very lowvelocity gun for all its hitting power the smashers were closein weapons here they come hogue yelled stand ready guncaptains aim for the two lead boats one and two take the one on the right three four and five take the one on the left good for hogue lewrie thought a sensible young man who could see that the lead boat to their right was poorly manned and not much of a threat while the one to the left had so far missed out on what horrors they were dealing out this day lewrie traded his ferguson rifle for his telescope and saw that the boat on the left had what looked to be eight or ninepounders on its foredeck and the pirates were swarming over those guns readying them for firing fer what were about t receive may the good lord make us joyful murray sighed as the prao got her guns into action a ball hit culverin low on her larboard side making her shudder heavily while the second struck the bulwarks between number and number larboard guns and turned the wood into a burst of flickering teak splinters cutting down the gun crews and raising a great howling among his crew fire hogue shouted once the praos were within their limited range culverin lurched sideways as the guns lit off the first boat on the right almost leaped out of the water as she was struck mast and large leafbladed paddles flying in all directions along with some of her hull arabian building techniques with rope and buttjoined board could not take such punishment and she dropped back into the sea with a great splash as she came apart like an artichoke spilling her crew into the water the second boat to the left had her foredeck cleared by a hit guns and men flying as the heavy twentyfourpounder ball shattered amongst the barrels her mast came down and some powder cartridge bags went off with a great burst of dirty yellow smoke and flame she came to a dead stop and began to sag down off the wind toward the western shore right into lady charlottes guns well damn them lewrie spat the other four praos were now bearing off under human power their paddles or oars slashing the sea as they fled east out of range of the carronades that had smashed up their leaders boats like a giants fist lewrie turned to look seaward once more the battery on the point had sunk one prao but it looked like at least four would get out through the channel and the two surviving pirate boats to the east were working their way along the line of the breakers in shallow water beyond the reach of even the high batterys guns which was where the four that had challenged him were going mister murray sir theyre going to get away from us if we sit here lewrie said feeling grim about it and more than willing if given any kind of excuse to let them do so but it was his duty fix buoys to the anchor cables and prepare to let slip well pursue them aye sir murray said with a sharp intake of breath mister hogue secure your guns for a while we shall hoist sail let slip the cables and get underway thank god for a simple rig lewrie said scant minutes later it would have taken a squarerigger half an hour to hoist sail but little culverin could simply hoist her jibs and gaffsails haul in on the sheets to angle those sails to the wind at the proper angle and she was moving ahead and under control it made him wonder if a way could be found to rig a larger warship so simply even if it took four masts instead of three a foreandaft rigged ship with a deep fullrun keel for a good grip on the water so she could go to windward like a witch with no courses well maybe a forecourse to lift the bows and nothing highermounted than large topsis armed with carronades for the most part with a few longranged muzzleloaders amidships for course sir the mind can do the oddest things at the worst moments lewrie murmured laughing at himself he might not be alive half an hour from now if he took culverin into that desperate pack of bloodyhanded murderers now intent on escape and even more dangerous than before and here he was speculating on naval architecture closehauled on the larboard tack for the harbor lewrie said well have to tack east or end up running aground but thatll give us a chance to fire into those boats running along the reef line culverin could point high but the wind was solidly out of the soueast and the best she could do was a little west of due south to approach the harbor entrance on a long board leadsmen swung chains to sound the depth ahead of her as she clawed her way seaward and a half two helm alee off foresl sheets culverin tacked across the eye of the wind onto a short board back to a heading of about point about degrees north of east but she had gotten close enough to threaten those fleeing praos along the reef line inside the breakers ready sir hogue called to him i make it about two cables try your eye mister hogue lewrie nodded blaze away the guns on the starboard side came reeling inboard one at a time the heavy balls fired at maximum elevation and laid so close to the edge of the portsills they almost singed the wood failed to hit they landed short raising great feathery plumes of water into the air but the praos checked their frantic pace and paid off the breaker line stymied by fear hands to the sheets ready to come about helm alee alan commanded he did not want to get too far to the east inside their harbor for that would put him too close to the reefs to be able to tack to windward to reverse course to wear ship downwind would lose him every inch of ground he had gained south for the entrance channel now we shall try our luck against yonder bastards jesus murray yelped ducking into a halfcrouch as a solid shot moaned overhead whered they get such heavy iron sir that was our battery on the hillside above the fort murray lewrie commented standing erect from his own crouch i pray those gunners know what theyre about with that heated shot didnt miss our masts by a boatlength sir murray carped as culverin sailed right through the ringshaped splash of the spent shot half a minute later an they havent got the range for very much longer caint we signal em t stop sir ah uhm im afraid thats one signal we didnt discuss murray lewrie confessed suffering another qualm at all he had not considered once again and feeling the lack of prior planning acutely we shall have to trust to their good judgment good judgment from soldiers murray gaped with a sour look ready the larboard battery mister hogue fire as you bear and a half three the leadsman chanted as you bear fire hogue screamed his voice cracking now the larboard guns lurched back on their recoil slides and a harsh stinging cloud of powder blossomed forth checked at the bulwarks by the winds and wafted back over them blanking out the world for a minute when the smoke cleared the hands cheered at the sight of a pirate boat that was rocking keelup about two hundred yards away with survivors struggling and wailing about her and a half two ready to come about lewrie called helms alee one more closehauled short board on the starboard tack to the east perhaps the last they could make as they neared the harbor entrance and the line of breakers the next larboard tack would take them through the main channel and out to sea hogue let loose with a broadside from the starboard guns once more hitting nothing but the pirates trapped in the lagoon were too rattled to notice and shied off again back on the larboard tack breakers growling and fuming the battery on the point firing at a boat ahead of them and straddling it with two shotsplashes hitting it amidships with the third ball and shattering it so quickly that it jackknifed like a paper boat broke in two and went under two more hands to the tiller murray lewrie snapped stand by to pinch her up as we cross the bar there was more depth in the channel this time of day as tidal flooding rushed into the harbor softening the shock but culverin could still broach on that deceptively calmlooking swell if she hit it wrong culverin rose soaring up on the swell with a line of spume racing down past her sides her bow cocking up for the skies helm down lewrie shouted luff up square to the wave four men threw their sinewy strength to the tiller to keep it from lashing to either side or throwing them overboard culverin lay on the tip of the swell sails luffing and thundering then began to fall as the wave left her behind bow dipping until it looked as if shed bury her bowsprit into the trough and keep on sliding down into the depths she then began to gather speed after being checked in her slide helm up and give us way closehauled it was like rowing a boat across the surf line without going arseovertit or being rolled like a stranded whale culverin paid off and her sails filled with wind as a second swell gathered her up out of the trough where they could find air thundering and flapping then taking shape once more with a series of loud boomings hold her no more than a point west of south quartermaster lewrie turned to say culverin soared upward once more almost forcing him to his knees in her hurry to ascend to heaven but she was halfway out of the wicked harbor entrance now even with her hellish tendency to go to leeward like a woodchip they would clear the western shoals under the point if they could only make this course good to have to tack while fighting those entrance bar swells would be disastrous two fathom the starboard leadsman howled hold her lewrie growled pinch her up as youre able but for gods sake hold her head and a half two the point was astern the shoals left behind in her wake he breathed out as the leadsman found three fathom then four fathom the broken reef wall would be no threat not on a flooding tide that would put six fathoms over those tumbled ruins they were beyond the threatening swells too out on the open sea damn fine damn my eyes if it wasnt lewrie said to his shaky helmsmen as they eased their deathgrips on the tiller bar thankee sir thankee right kindly they mumbled working on their cuds again in mouths gone dry as desert sand now lets get after our pirate friends lewrie exclaimed beaming mister murray they seem to be trending east running for home and mother aye sir want t tack an pursue em now sir wait until were safely over this broken reef first then lay her on the starboard tack lewrie replied break out the waterbutts for anyone as thirsty as i feel for now gun crews stand easy aye sir sail ho the lookout called where away due south sir the man replied four points off the larboard beam fullrigged ship sir damme dyou think mister choate finally got here sir murray asked now between us well put paid t these motherless buggers lewrie took up his telescope and went up the mizzen shrouds to almost the top platform he raised it to his eyes once he had an arm and leg threaded through the ratlines and stays to keep himself from falling and took a look for himself three masts pale tan sails coming on for the island from the souwest with the wind large on her starboard quarter already almost hull up good lines frigatebuilt he thought ayscough chose well a large swell over the broken reef wall lifted culverin higher for about half a minute far off another swell raised the stranger as well lewrie could espy a pale ochre hull with what looked to be a wide white gunwale stripe poisson dor he cursed choundas why did he have to arrive now of all times huge clouds of gunpowder hung over spratly island artillery still fired on those praos yet trapped in harbor or trying to run the gauntlet to sea to see a strange ship giving chase to a pack of pirates fleeing to the east would be the final straw they could not lure poisson dor into harbor choundas would be wise to the game and sail off for parts unknown as sure as fate goddamn your bloody luck you rotten shit lewrie almost wept with frustration here hed just won two battles in a fortnight done away with pirates by the battalions had sunk frogs left right and center and all for nothing what to do now he pondered one course of action was to go back to seal the entrance to the harbor so most of the pirates could end up slaughtered or he could pursue the eight who were getting away if he did continue the chase he might be able to lure choundas into action but the man had longranged guns to his shortranged carronades stout as culverin was shed be pounded to bits while he would be lucky to inflict even minor damage to choundas he raised his telescope again to peer at his foe poisson dor altered shape she was turning north putting all her masts in line heading somewhere to the east of spratly island to interpose between culverin and choundas fleeing allies bastard lewrie growled for little danger choundas would appear to have saved that terrified remnant driven off an english ship and restored his luster among the mindanao pirates and he would end up escaping after all to some port where they had no hope of finding him bastard chapter and you could not pursue him mr twigg demanded sounding as if he did not believe one word of lewries report once wed convinced the rest of the praos to surrender sir lewrie replied striving to keep a cool head in the face of twiggs unspoken sneering after i had returned to harbor and blocked their escape i did sail off to the eastrd for two days sir but found no sign of him or the pirates who did get out of harbor after that two days i felt it my duty to return to spratly and defend it until lieutenant choate arrived with cuddalore to relieve me sir they held their conference on telestos poop deck under the canvas awnings with lots of liquid refreshments instead of the airless great cabins below for the day was sunny hot but breezy and the estimable lieutenant choate is where sir twigg inquired off the coast of borneo sir lewrie stated he unloaded his cargo of supplies then told me to remain here as harborguard he would scout to the soueast up to windward from the rajang river delta to balabac strait he took along one of the captured praos in tow sir so he could go close inshore good thinking that ayscough said of his first lieutenant a bit too late that twigg retorted let me remind you mister twigg that you were still of the opinion that choundas would be here by midjune and in that you were deadwrong captain ayscough rumbled deep in his chest arms folded over his stomach i also get the sense that you disapprove of mister lewries actions here on spratly well let me tell you i have read his full report even if you have not and as a commission sea officer i find no fault with his conduct of our campaign so far nor with any decision he has made my report shall contain my highest approbation for his actions actions in the very best traditions of the sea service hmmpf twigg sniffed loftily two seadogs whelped from the same litter your approval is only natural but a chance was missed if anything the already strained relationship between twigg and captain ayscough had grown even more testy in the weeks since alan had last seen them going past gentlemanly conduct to the words and sneers that back home would have resulted in a predawn duel choate had warned him to expect the worst of them and had expressed worries that their acrimony was bad enough to jeopardize the future conduct of their expedition perhaps that was why choate had been so eager to get back to sea so he would not be there when they arrived they had come into port at spratly three days earlier the fifteenth of may choate had brought cuddalore a fine twentygunned merchantman across the bar on the first of may and had departed in a haste such as if all the imps of hell were chasing him which in a way alan realized they were hed rather be anywhere than around these two headstrong men whose relationship had degraded to an open feud why thankee mister twigg captain ayscough beamed that was a pretty compliment to my lights and i do take it as such i would like to think id been as successful had i been in this lads shoes the island taken with minimum casualties a french cartel ship captured and burned and not just any hired vessel but one of choundas outright ownership a cartel ship i might remind you we were not even aware of and she moored not a quartermile ahead of us for six months at whampoa hmmpf twigg reiterated turning beetred from that insult to his intelligencegathering powers his lips going twinethin the harbor fortified and provisioned as good as any and the encampment improved though i am sure we have sir hugos skills as a soldier to thank for that as well ayscough continued inclining his head toward lieutenantcolonel willoughby who was sprawled in a canvas deckchair with a glass of brandy in hand booted feet up on the rickety deal table sir hugo raised his glass and smiled beatifically lewrie could not help but swell with pride as his praises were sung so nicely if ayscough were any more complimentary he imagined theyd commission a te deum mass at st paul s and lay on fireworks an entire pirate fleet destroyed sir ayscough went on hammering gaily away at twiggs arguments ten out of eighteen lanun rover praos sunk taken or burned sir and over twelve hundred cutthroats dead or made prisoner why these mindanao pirates havent suffered such a bloody check in a hundred years wiped from the face of gods blue seas as you demanded back at bencoolen sir one might also mention the harbor properly surveyed for the first time in living memory and the islands exact location corrected sir sir hugo prompted the late captain cook could have done no less in these waters i shouldnt doubt and that american whaler freed too ayscough concluded yes that american whaler twigg drawled now off in manila shouting to high heaven letting the world in on our little secret did it not occur to you mister lewrie that our mission out here is secret twigg got to his feet to pace his anger off it cannot be known publicly by any other power that england had disguised warships in these waters or the recent treaty is violated and we might face another disastrous war with france or any other nation that might decide to side with them those yankees saw a battalion of east india company troops and a vessel flying royal navy colors do battle with the french sir now how secret do you believe our mission is any longer you should have kept them here found any excuse to delay their departure until i could arrive so no one could learn of this but no you oh bloody hell sir hugo snapped slamming boots on the deck did it never occur to you mister twigg that there may have been a tad too much bloody worry about secrecy i beg your pardon sir hugo twigg snarled back two years ago when our first ships started going missing it would have made eminent sense to raise the hue and cry with every seafaring nation out here and make a concerted campaign to defend trade not just our trade but everyones let the world know theres need to chastise every bloody pirate in the far east sir hugo went on but that may have been too much good sense for our masters back in london seems to me sir this exposure at last with our american cousins shouting the loudest is just the thing for us in a year the worldll know it was this choundas and the frogs backing these pirates now our works fourfifths done and public pressure and an end to all this bloody sneaking and hiding will do the rest for us without getting any more good men killed i say its time the wraps came off this bloody business and as for freeing those yankees refitting their ship and all well thatll stand us in good credit with those new united states and should another war break out well need all the good credit we can stand else theyd side with their former allies i would not normally expect twigg said after a long sigh such perspicacity in a military man sir hugo and in private i might be able to agree with you but the crown decided otherwise and its not simply about piracy you see its not even about this fellow choundas when you get right down to it sir its about laying combinations out here for the next war oh bugger sir hugo growled you consider another war with france inevitable sir hugo as much as i at this very instant there may be three dozen schemes in play such as ours and even i have no knowledge of them and shouldn t unless one of the others impinges upon mine all to see that future foes have no strength or credit here in the far east nor any allies or secret bases that could threaten england to put too much light on ours sir to expose any of them would be to expose all of them eventually the best mushrooms i am told are grown in the dark the best roses need the most cowshit too ayscough huffed nevertheless sir sir hugo smiled a disarming lazy smile that lewrie knew of old was one of eminent menace i do trust that when you come to write of this campaign you shall sound at least the slightest bit grateful for what weve done for you so far and commending of course i shall sir hugo twigg relented obviously seeing the threat that lay behind that smile and being enough of a political animal with the ability to read others so he could best use them for his own purposes or the crowns to know he could carp no longer so captain ayscough grunted how best to conclude thisun now weve hamstrung this choundas bugger so thoroughly have we sir twigg scowled and for how long well hes lost this island base of his ayscough rambled lost la malouine lost stella mans and his secrets soon to be out thanks to those yankee doodle whalermen now he may have other cartel ships out here to serve him but for now hes on his own he still has the lanun rovers sir twigg pointed out with some glee and he has his freedom to rebuild a semblance of his web like some noisome spider without the silver and opium we captured here without all the arms he would have given the pirates or the trade goods i doubt he still has the lanun rovers captain ayscough replied they lost too many of their brethren here for choundas to hold their allegiance oh he saved some few of em by showing up when he did but he failed to rescue the rest even with that big fine ship of his he didnt sail up and fight us he may have em in name only but not firmly in his grasp any longer and for the moment hes vulnerable if thats so bloody obvious then why isnt he running home right now cutting his losses sir hugo speculated sitting back down and refilling his glass he must know this is his last raiding summer and its riskier now moren ever because he is who he is sir hugo twigg said with a knowing leer ive had a chance to interrogate the surviving frogs from this stella marts amazing what a man will confess when threatened with a noose for piracy the second mate told me that most of the officers thought choundas a rather odd sort odder than most not merely in his sexual predifictions but in his mind sirs lieutenant lewrie do you recall that nonsense he spouted the day of the execution what he had to say about the ancient gauls and celts being related aye sir i do lewrie agreed tensing for another lesson in just how simply clever twigg thought himself to be he said that the britons the gauls and the celts were one race sir damned fool us kin of frogs sir hugo spluttered i mean the normans aside what a lot of you will pardon the play on words but what gall choundas was born in low circumstances yes twigg related with relish though not fishmonger poor his father owned several boats and hoped for better things for his son education and hopes hed enter the priesthood dont have to be a nobleman to do well in france if you wear the cassock but the boy besides being a superb sailor developed a bent for scholarship in history and in latin of course why he named stella marts by a latin name and not etoile de la mer i spose does this have any bearing on anything ayscough groaned whats the thing all latin students read sir caesars gallic wars naturally as a breton choundas would sympathise with the ancient gauls under vercingetorix and such but most specifically he imagined himself and his line to be kin with the veneti when oared galleys darent go five miles offshore these veneti in their oak ships with leather sails would roam the entire known world much as we do today their strength was in their navy even the vikings of latter days didnt dare as much as they did i think lewrie summarized for them unable to pass up the sterling opportunity to shine or to spill the air from twiggs sails that what mister twigg means is that if he thinks hes the last of this noble seafaring line of veneti and goes on about it so much he bores his compatriots to tears with it we may assume the silly arse will tweak our noses and raid our ships this season sirs then why didnt you merely say so mister twigg captain ayscough asked with all innocence in his expression right then ayscough trotted out his chart of the south china seas and laid it on the table anchoring the corners with bottles and glasses so the wind wouldnt scud it off somewhere to leeward if he thinks hes that bloody good he cant have sailed too far to the eastrd ayscough chuckled west is out cause hed have to beat so far to windward against the prevailing soueasterlies this time of year to get to his cruising grounds choate is scouting the borneo coast now and we may have good news from him soon down there is to windward where id wish to base myself were i this last of a noble seafaring line but theres a problem with that too the borneo pirates lewrie interjected theres little love lost between them and the lanun rovers is there sir exactly so mister lewrie he may have some relations with em as a holecard so to speak and he may be forced to play it to allow him one last chance to go home a winner but well damme what twigg rapped out well heres this lad choundas born a commoner normally denied his chance to shine in the french navy but thinking himself kin to ancient seakings i see why you would think he would have to do something grand against us before going home mister twigg but think on this for a moment ayscough beamed cleverly the borneo boys are riverbased and they dont go out of sight of shore too often who would choundas feel the most in common with the lanun rovers still twigg exclaimed right then ayscough said once more rubbing his horny palms in satisfaction were i looking for prizes id be far south opposite the johore straits around anambas or pulau natuna where we met that pirate fleet last year here at spratly maybe up farther north and still to windward of the canton run on the tizard bank no shelter there though if the winds pipe up too close to dutch or english patrols down south sir lewrie commented thats why he chose spratly in the first place yes so we must assume that hes somewhere up to windward but not too far to the eastrd with his resources reduced he has to be close to the scene of action and do his own dirty work for a while so if i were constrained in such a way id be somewhere around the mouth of balabac strait ayscough frowned pacing off a divider across the chart id not be too deep inside the philippine archipelago if my allies started disliking me thered be no escape for a single ship even as wellarmed as we assume poisson dor to be so he would be west of the sulu sea still allied even tenuously with the mindanao pirates and using whats left of that alliance and their reputation as a shield to prevent pursuit is this not a spanish naval base here on palawan sir hugo asked leaning over the chart this puerto princesa seems theyd have this area covered why let some outsider upset what arrangement they have with their own native pirates theyd kick him out soon as those yankees let them know of it ah but he doesnt even know that stella maris took a yankee as prize sir hugo ayscough grinned hugely enjoying himself it dont signify anyway that the spanish would even be aware of them being there all they have are guarda costa luggers and such not ships of worth hell its two hundred miles from puerto princesa to the balabac strait the dons are flatbroke and all they care about are the northern islands anything south of leyte is pretty much controlled in name only they have a loose agreement with the natives in the southyou dont kill us we wont bother you healthier for spanish fortunes in the long run ayscough chuckled with mirth so aspiring young dons dont get their throats cut or their reputations ruined by a raggedyarsed pack of fanatics so this balabac strait is pretty much the kings highway to these pirates sir lewrie asked peering at the chart yes just so and id expect choundas to be somewhere near the western entrance around the island of banggi on the north tip of borneo or on the island of balabac itself ayscough concluded tossing down his dividers we have little time then before the first ships sail from calcutta and madras for this years trading season twigg fretted well not see him playing innocent in canton again one raiding season then back he goes to the indian ocean leaving other ships to be his bearers for the last loads of loot whilst hes off like a hare to france we might be able to stymie his designs by our presence and defeat him that way but theres the matter of all those ships weve lost the last two years all those murdered men damme if i care much for him escaping with even the slightest hint of success sirs i wish him destroyed utterly like catos demand sir hugo mused carthage must be destroyed exactly sir hugo twigg said firmly for everyones peace of mind choundas must be destroyed mister lewrie captain ayscough asked whatever did happen to those veneti caesar sank the lot of them in bc sir lewrie replied chapter to ease the overcrowding aboard lady charlotte and not knowing how long they would be at sea the battalion of troops had been spread out among all three ships as had the fortune in silver the captured powder and shot unfortunately they had been forced to burn the bulk of the opium and trade goods disposing of the remainder in the deeper part of the harbor at spratly island along with the cannon barrels and stands of arms they would leave nothing behind that required a guard force to deplete their strength and nothing for choundas to regain should he double back on them the praos were burned as well and the prisoners disarmed and left to fend for themselves with the wild livestock for sustenance and only the rudest remnants of the encampment for shelter leaving lady charlotte to make her slower way astern telesto and culverin ranged soueast beating up to windward with an eventual rendezvous planned several days hence once they had met up with lieutenant choate and cuddalore as he scouted northward towards the strait too and delivered his report or lack of news on choundas possible whereabouts telesto had to stand off to seaward whilst the shallowdrafted culverin did the main work closer inshore which arrangement was pleasant for lewrie since it got him out of snapping distance when twigg and ayscough had at each other like snarling wolves and a half four the leadsman in the chains said getting bored and sunburned at his thankless task they were skirting round the foetid marshy tip of borneo near enough to a native settlement marked on the chart as kudat which was about all that the chart had gotten right in the past few days to have seen several single praos out at sea these at least had been peacefully fishing but had run ashore as they drew close leaving them sole possession of the sea time to change the leadsmen sounds like lewrie said he drew out his watch and looked at the time almost the end of the day watch five minutes to eight bells mister hogue stand offshore once the watch changes sir hogue asked i think well continue as we are for the first hour of the first dogwatch after that the light will be too far westerly for us to spot shoalwater lewrie replied well alter course after four bells aye sir hogue said yawning and a quarter less five the leadsman sounded out borneo reeked as did its shoals rotting vegetation rotting weed washed up on her shores stagnant mudflats and deadfish odors and the heights inland blocked a proper seabreeze to waft it all off now and then a hint of cooking now and then some gorgeous aromas from riotously thriving flowers but mostly it stank horribly like some gigantic slaughterhouse theyd all be glad to get out to sea something in the water the lookout on the tall mainmast shouted three points off the starboard bows shoal lewrie wondered raising his telescope for the umpteenth time that day it looks low enough no a rock perhaps native boat sir hogue said with the advantage of his almost uncanny eyesight turned turtle looks like god no its a ships boat fetchto mister murray lewrie shouted to his bosun lead the cutter round from astern and call away a boat crew shall i go sir hogue asked anxiously no you stay aboard lewrie said its not half a cable off and were at least threequarters of a mile offshore keep the hands near the guns though just in case ill be back shortly they rounded culverin up into the slack winds jibs backed to force her bows off the breeze but mainsis still drawing and trying to drive her forward stalling her inirons cocked up to the wind and unable to go forward or back to drift on the slow current cony was already in the boat at the tiller with eight hands at the oars held aloft like lances as they waited for lewrie shove off cony lewrie said once he had taken his salute at the rail and settled himself onto a thwart near the stern aye sir shove off bow man ship yer oars give us way larboard backwater starboard cony instructed now avast now give us way tgether once the cutter was moving shoreward with both banks of rowers pulling at an easy stroke cony turned slightly on his buttocks and leaned over the tillerbar dya think them pirates got fed up an done fer this choundas feller sir t would be a fitting end for him no error cony lewrie said in reply a thing devoutly to be wished boathook ready there cony snapped turning back to his duties easy all unship yer oars toss yer oars boat yer oars it was a european ships boat right enough halfsunk at the bows and charred to crumbling cinders for much of its length which sight made lewrie shiver with dread that somehow it was la malouines boat hed seen burn and capsize that it had drifted all this way to confront him after all those months ah jaysus the bowman gagged as he peered down into the boat up forward two men lay in the bottom stuffed under thwarts to keep them from sloshing about in the footdeep water that flooded her or what was left of two men they had bloated and split open with rot in the cruel heat and humidity swelled like leatherhued steer carcasses and their clothing stretched taut as drumheads where the seams had held together their wounds where exposed to the air above the water level swarmed with flies blueblack and festering one man had lost his leg below the knee and some attempt had been made to tie it off with a tourniquet and bandage the stump the other had the marks of several bullet wounds that had also been treated with scraps of clothing for bandages but both faces gaped widemouthed under the scummy water in final ghoulish rictuses of agony and their eyes had gone for gullfood theyre sailors anyway lewrie coughed on his bile as the odor hit them but whose in the stern which was somewhat dryer where only an inch or so of water sloshed about there was a barricoe of water a sodden biscuit bag and many bones and feathers littering a tarpaulin that might cover other supplies looks like they mighta et some seabirds afore they died sir cony shuddered mighta been driftin fer weeks out ere lewrie prodded the water butt with his sword and it tumbled into the water floating high and empty the bung gone jesus christ the bowman screamed as the tarpaulin stirred lewrie felt the hairs on his head stand up in terror as a shape came up from the bottom boards of the boat draped in the tarpaulin a ghost one of the oarsmen keened in shrill horror then the tarpaulin was flung back revealing a ravaged face that face also split in horror and screamed like a banshee just as terrified as the boat crew a bony sunscarred arm emerged with a seamans knife clenched in a lean and bony fist lewrie put his sword forward ready to lunge hold he shouted oh god no dont kill me please dont kill me haint i been through enough the apparition managed to say through a dry throat and blistered lips but he dropped the knife are you english lewrie asked aghast aye sir r you please don be them frog devils oh say yer english please cony fetch the water butt lewrie instructed water god yes lord love ye sir water the man raved i haint ad no water fer days jus some blood outen a gull oncet what ship lewrie asked feeling another shiver of dread cuddalore sir cuddalore lewrie burst out what happened to her at frog ship poison door took er sir a week ago n more goddamn my eyes ayscough sighed so pale and shaky it was as if hed seen a ghost himself is this choundas in league with the devil what the hell are we up against a bloody clever man sir twigg replied a bloody lucky one but still just a man captain ayscough what else did he say mister lewrie sir he said cuddalore fought poisson dor about a week ago lewrie informed them somewhat gloomily close inshore of banggi and with the help of several praos they put up a good fight the man said but eventually they were overwhelmed lieutenant choate was killed oh poor man ayscough groaned his poor family dismasted shot to pieces lewrie went on they captured her sir murdered the survivors lieutenant mctaggart and all the mates and warrants this fellow prouty was lucky to get away sir his mates got into the boat cut it loose from being towed astern but the french shot them dropped a round shot through the bow to sink it and set it afire prouty went over the side and clung to the rudder where he couldnt be seen they drifted ever since forward or back on the currents and tides no oars no masts tis a wonder he lived had to use their corpses to staunch the inflow what a gruesome experience he must have had ayscough said will he live the surgeon is not too hopeful sir burns and exposure to the sun no food but for one gull in all those days lewrie sighed prouty did inform us he watched poisson dor take cuddalore in tow though sir downwind to the northrd balabac twigg exclaimed where else to leeward could he find harbor in which to strip her and haul her in front of his mindanao pirates to prove to them hes still worth alliance ayscough growled aye so if it be balabac the best and most sheltered harbor is on the north end see here ayscough shuffled through several rolledup charts to find the one he wanted and rolled it out onto his desk a good channel to east and west some small spits of land to the north to shelter against the winds when they come norwesterly and a village a pirate village sir twigg asked not as i recollect ayscough shrugged we patrolled around here during the last war after the spanish came in on the rebels side with france watered there once they were a peaceful enough lot no big seagoing praos just fishing boats and such but if the lanun rovers put in theyd have to go along with whatever those devils want for safetys sake better to suffer some looting and a rape or two than end up massacred are there no better harbors sir lewrie asked peering at the chart which indicated several settlements and coves there are others to be sure mister lewrie ayscough allowed but most of those are more suited to praos which may be beached like greek ships of old but choundas needs at least five fathoms of water at low tide to feel comfortable with a proper ship and this is the only one of which i am aware if one were to need a snug harbor for repair and a place to strip another vessel this would be my choice and anything on the southern coast would be too exposed no matter how tempting it would be to base closer to open water i take it twigg added the eastwest channel leaves two avenues of approach or escape yes ayscough agreed and open water deep water either way without having to claw off a lee shore whilst the winds are out of the soueast each time one leaves port ayscough drummed his fingers on the chart for a time then slapped his palm on the chart making them all jump my regards to colonel willoughby and captain cheney in lady charlotte signal captains repair on board with luck if were quick enough we may have this bastard at last after his successful defense at spratly island captain cheney was almost resigned to playing warship one more time in company with culverin and telesto sir hugo peered at the chart for a long time in silence cocking his head this way and that when he did leave off an irritating humming he asked a few questions about the various beaches what the interior was like what ayscough remembered from years before about the terrain do you put my troops ashore here he finally said three or more miles shy of the village we shall proceed inland to here where you remember crops and fields captain ayscough open country where i may employ my troops to best advantage that is if youre set upon this completely without reconnaissance oh well scout sir ayscough retorted well put a boat down and send her inshore once were close enough then i should request some cloth sir hugo said smiling bleakly something that could resemble yellow silk a navy ensign as well and some wood for staffs hey ayscough asked perplexed i shall also have need of your pipers sir sir hugo added chapter lt alan lewrie royal navy paced his tiny quarterdeck as the hours dragged past hands in the small of his back head down deep in thought and in worry a launch from telesto had assured them that there were two european ships at anchor in the rude harbor at the north end of balabac island one painted a golden ochre with white gunwales and one vessel that bore no masts above her lower masts and tops there were also at least twenty native praos beached by the filipino settlement big seagoing boats with hulls painted blood red it hadnt been much of a reconnaissance just a quick peek in from seaward at sundown of the second day after they had discovered the lone survivor from cuddalore choundas is a clever animal lewrie fretted to himself during his limited pacing hes sure to have hidden batteries on the harbor approaches perhaps hidden batteries offshore on those low islands that to the north shelter the harbor his minions in stella mans had not deployed artillery at spratly past the palisades walls but they could not assume choundas would make that sort of mistake god help us it seems he never makes mistakes lewrie cursed in the darkness and sentinels all along the bloody coast on all the land approaches to did you say something sir hogue asked with a yawn making my peace with the good lord lewrie snapped driving the acting lieutenant away who would interfere with a man praying at a time like this lewrie thought somewhat cynically since culverin was so shallowdrafted she had been chosen once again that evening to ferry troops ashore from ladycharlotte which had to stand at least a mile offshore three trips theyd made in all in almost total darkness with culverins decks and former mortar wells packed tightly with sepoys and weapons with field artillery and all the accoutrements for sixpounder carriage guns twopounder boat guns on low widewheeled mounts and coehorn mortars with their carrying blocks equipped with four small but wide wheels like dogcarts lewrie also worried about burgess chiswick when he had last seen chiswick and shaken his hand before he embarked in a ships boat for the beach with the men of his light company burgess hand had been all atremble that would seem perfectly natural in any man but in chiswick he felt it a sign of his friends unpreparedness his weakness there had not been time enough to say all the things one wished at a moment like that there never was perhaps that lack of time was a blessing burgess had given him a small parcel of personal items he wanted passed on to his family should he fall a final word for dear sister caroline and a promise burgess had wrung out of him that should he fall there that platitude again alan would swear to take care of caroline and the rest of his family as well as he was able in his stead it seemed portended that fall and a gruesome farewell parting with his father was much easier time damnit sir hugo had snarled look here lad if we make a muck of this im much happier youre safe aboard this little ship of yours think kindly of me if youre able lift a glass and toast my shade if you aint take good care of the lewrie name today and ill see to mine right goodbye me son they had put the troops ashore starting at eleven that night on a leeward beach on the western shore of balabac a little more than a league shy of the village and harbor approaches once that was done the three ships had stood out to sea telesto leading and culverin in last place making a long leeboard out to sea with the wind up their sterns and all sails doublereefed or brailed up to make it a vexingly slow leeboard which would place them due west of the harbor channel just before first light there telesto would turn east and beat up into the soueast summer monsoon winds closehauled as she would lie and with all battleflags flying and lewrie had prayed hed been raised church of england and as much a deist as any fashionable young gentleman of his class turned out to be after exposure to the better public schools the classics and the latest eighteenthcentury philosophy lewrie had also been tended to by a steady parade of governesses from lower stations in life who trended toward a more personal vengeful god neither curriculum had turned him off the more than occasional venality but when life got a bit too threatening and he was at the bitter end of his cable he found no comfort in a deists philosophical detachment and sought out the sort of god who could wake up reach down and pluck his arse to safety once more he prayed for burgess safety he prayed for gods help that this time theyd comer this choundas bugger for certain and carve him and all his kind into stewmeat so they could go home he slung in a thought or two for his father even if he was a rotten old bastard to me lord he dont deserve gettin turned off today and finally he asked for help so that his crew would not suffer too much that they would win a victory at a low cost please let the sentinels be blind as bloody bats lord hed muttered in the privacy of his tiny cabins get us past any batteries without too much hurt and if you plan to scrag me today then let it be quick and glorious id rather not know about it when it comes so let me go like achilles and dont let the surgeon have me better i die a sinner than survive a helpless cripple amen bloody hell capt burgess chiswick swore softly as his boots sucked and slopped in the muck inland from the beaches lieutenant colonel willoughby had at first tried to advance up from the strand and find cover in the forests for their forced march but the woods had turned out to be the ripest sort of mangrove marsh near the shore and the rankest densest sloppiest jungle inland from that but the artillery he had hoped to deploy on his right flank and center could not be manhauled through the slop indeed once deep into the overgrowth no one could maintain a proper line of march without constant referral to a compass and showing any sort of a light was simply out of the question so it was only the first light company that made its slow way through the jungle on the right flank and the rest of the battalion had to march in two company columns nearer the beach with the guns squeaking along the beach itself in the firmest sand the second light company led the advance in skirmishing pairs as scouts to feel out the way ahead and silence any pickets they encountered with cold steel or a twisted garotte fashioned from their puggarees so far thank god they had met none though it was impossible to know if a scout skulked in the deep jungle spying out their march and sending reports to the village to prepare them chiswick shivered with a nameless dread except for his man nandu who marched alongside him he could barely espy any of his sepoys they were jangliadmi used to jungle in their home territory of bengal hunters farmers poor villagers raised at the edge of a dark green labyrinth where danger lurked a lush green hell full of terrors so much greater and more threatening than carolina woods chiswick asked himself for the thousandth time why he had ever thought he wanted to be a soldier why he had thought life was better in regimental service when he could have bowed to fate and clerked or farmed back around guildford what stupidity had led him to this he trembled he was not so much afraid of death as he was afraid of making a total ineffective ass of himself when battle was joined there seemed to be no steady center he could seize to calm his trembling a mosquito whining in his ear set his heart to racing every time he felt as if his heart wanted to leap free of his chest and escape even if he could not and when nandu got mired and put out a hand on his shoulder for help he almost jumped out of his skin and yelped with fright oh god dont let me fail was chiswicks prayer come on oh one pubic hairs col sir hugo st george willoughby rasped in a harsh whisper of nearperfect hindee ive seen rajput whores carry heavier loads subadarmajor ji march our children white teeth and eyes gleamed briefly in the darkness above the white facings the white dhotis and kurtah shirts of their uniforms the redfaced coonesahib seemed angry but they knew him well by now and knew it was not true anger theyd seen enough of that by then as well and knew the difference hed ask them to do this one last dangerous thing and then if they were successful theyd all go home to calcutta they were soldiers no matter what their humble beginnings no matter how low their castes and colonelsahib weeby treated them as such with respect unlike so many of the gora log feringhee officers they would do this one last dangerous thing for colonel weebysahib who threw all his efforts into their training and welfare for this regiment of theirs that had become a haven from indian society and the decreedbybirth poverty of their castes they may have started as poor ryots or zamindars but they were treated like allconquering kshatriya now men of the warrior caste they had not always conquered during the war in the south against hyder ah and tippoo sultan or against the french but they had tried god grant us a victory sir hugo mumbled a victory that lets me keep my colonelcy so another damned fool straight out from england dont fuck this regiment up lord knows its all ive got and ill be damned if ill throw it away for nothing either so give us victory and a mentionindispatches back to john company would go down right nice too a little loot for my old age if youve a mind i enjoy one after this days bloody work and look after my lad i really do mean to do right by him a little time to do right by him would be sweet even if i cant let him show well today carry on the family line with honor and glory you know me well enough by now i dont make silly promises i dont mean to keep so i wont make any to you now and the regiment lord i know theyre heathens but theyre good lads well most of em anyways let em carry all before em and not bring any dishonor to the colors captain fessenden interrupted what else sir hugo would add sir hugo sir he whispered the jungle seems to be thinning out on our right flank and the beach is bending east i think were getting close chandraji sir hugo muttered snapping his fingers at his bewhiskered orderly run tell chiswicksanfc to halt then feel to his right major gaunt halt the column grenadier company to form on the right captain fessenden your light company to form on the left front across the beach for now fifty paces forward at once sir that taken care of sir hugo found himself a fallen palm log on which to sit and await the results of his scouts he amused himself by drawing designs which he could not see in the sand with a walking stick sir captain chiswick whispered having been led to him by chandra after a quarterhour had passed good morrow captain chiswick sir hugo grunted what have you to report forward of where we stand sir the jungle continues for about three hundred yards thinning out as it goes and the footing is much firmer firm enough i adjudge for artillery beyond that there are flooded rice fields and other crops burgess said with a shaky tone damme sir hugo spat but there are some sort of firm dykes surrounding the fields sir that are wide enough for gun carriages and for troops marching three abreast chiswick offered and the flooded fields are more inland beyond our right flank if we stay close to the beach with our left flank we could extend across the dry fields and use the flooded portion as a shield for our right how much of a front i estimate about four hundred yards sir burgess reported his body trembling with anticipation and feeling as if he had already spent all of his strength in scouting and pacing off the area too bloody wide for eight and a half companies his colonel muttered look here wheres the bloody village then how much of it do we threaten if we form as planned they paced out into what little moonlight was left to draw a map on the beach sand with chiswicks sword tip using dry palm fronds that could be more easily seen once we incline right sir chiswick stated on his knees the beach here west of the village is rather wide i saw what i took to be pirate boats beached starting here theyd have artillery in the bows that could enfilade us thin undergrowth and trees for cover above the beach extending south for about one hundred yards open fields with kneehigh plantings god knows what all around it if we come in from the west instead of striking north wed have three hundred yards frontage before our right flank brushed up against these dykes and ricefields chandraji summon officers here to me sir hugo commanded then rose and paced while chiswick continued to draw out a more elaborate plan of the village and its environs palisades captain any batteries your scouts could discover facing inland bamboo or palm logs for a palisade sir quite low chiswick replied intent on his model that he was now adorning with fronds to represent the jungle the dykes and the palisade we saw no guns on the inland wall sir there is a french battery on the point right about here where the coast trends east sir hugo asked using the toe of his boot for a pointer yes sir dug in as a threesided redan made of palm logs and sand its been planted with bushes on the seaward side to conceal it two perhaps three guns my scouts told me sir chiswick went on intent on his model it felt so much like playing soldier childish and silly to be on his knees once again recreating his little fields of battle moats and entrenchments out of the clay or sand soil of his native north carolina hed stolen clothespins off the lines to be troops and they could be anythingromans indians or grenadiers how big is the village sir hugo asked kneeling down slowly so his joints didnt creak and pop how far does it extend sir about a quartermile sir on the far side there is more jungle much thinner than here and some dry fields and another battery of guns about a mile farther on chiswick said gathering more material for his construction theres a quartermile of open lands beyond the far palisades and the last native houses pretty much the same as this end the ricefields dont extend that far though sir they approach the center of the villages back walls which would funnel us down as we fight our way in sir hugo mused and if we came up from the south wed have to split the regiment on either side of them sir or get channeled into the dykes damme if ill play that game sir hugo snorted with derision as the white officers and their native subadars came to hear their orders gentlemen we shall change direction right at the halt and go east through the thin jungle south of these ricepaddies and fields sir hugo began our ships shall be sailing into harbor from the west so we must attack from the east to create the greatest confusion one gun battery here captain fessenden on the point ahead of us have your best jangliadmi emulate kalis thuggees and silence them now yes sir hugo fessenden whispered back we shall form regimental front facing west here in the jungle east of the village captain chiswick your light company to seaward on the new right flank you get two of the light twopounders and i want you to silence this battery to your rear that your scouts discovered grenadier company in the center with the bandsmen and the sixpounders spaced between companies coehom mortars two hundred paces to the rear of the grenadier company and prepared to support either wing major gaunt your halfbattalion shall form our left with captain fessendens light company on your extreme left supported by one twopounder the other three twopounders placed between line companies across our general front be ready captain addams to shift your pieces to repel any threat our front shall be between three and four hundred yards so we shall have to form in two ranks only with the rising sun at our backs we should have good shooting and they should not caught between our ships and our attack we ought to create a little confusion for them and their only line of retreat will be to their boats on the beach or across our front through the paddies then south into the jungle major gaunt you shall decimate them should they retreat south captain chiswick you shall threaten their boats once in position prepare torches so you may set fire to as many as you are able as you advance down the beach do not allow the bastards to put their bow guns into play there is a low palisade about this village i shall not wish us to actually enter the damned place and get cut up in their little lanes better we incline right and seize the beach though it may be necessary to at least gain control of the eastern palisade questions gentlemen once we incline towards the beach sir do we let the enemy flee into the paddies and jungle major gaunt asked if they seem to be in great disorder sir you may find it necessary to torch the southern palisade and houses then form your halfbattalion as a screen to prevent any counterattack from that quarter facing south once weve taken the beach and the east wall sir hugo stated after a moments thought the fire should guard your back well enough and discourage anyone left in the village there were no more questions sir hugo dug his watch from his breeches pocket and held it up close to his nose swiveling in the faint moonlight to try and read it it lacks a quarterhour to three gentlemen and the navy tells me true dawn is at a quarter to six false dawn a quarter past five i wish to be in position at least half an hour before that then let the navy have first honors return to your companies good luck god speed and let us be on our way chapter time to do what they pay us for cony lewrie said decisively shoving away what was left of his cold breakfast damme all banyan days gruel cheese hard biscuit and small beer with a banana for something sweet in place of a duff several days of the week were meatless according to the strictures of the victualling board and lewrie felt no desire to end up paying for anything he wasnt given permission to issue even in foreign climes seems t me sir cony said with a rueful expression ifn they warnts us t fight strong an all theyd make allowance fer a battle they would wish to god somebody would alan grinned in return he put on his coat squared away his sword and donned his hat he stepped out onto the quarterdeck just forward of the sweep of the tiller and leaned one hip against the after capstanhead the crew had stowed their hammocks away already and stood swaying to the motion of their little ship evidently they were not very hungry this morning either the cook was shoveling coals into the sea off the lee side and his assistant was hauling up a bucket of seawater to put out his galley fire good morning captain hogue said from his station to leeward good morning to you mister hogue any signal from telesto nothing yet sir but even as hogue spoke there was a tiny shielded light that appeared on teiestos taffrail far ahead of them a tiny spark from a single lantern to show them where she was followed by another from lady charlotte mister hogue prepare to put the ship about onto the wind lewrie ordered we shall tack in succession aye sir second light sir murray pointed out her helms down and the two weak glims swung slowly into line as one then ghosted to the right across their bows a minute later lady charlotte did the same and when lady charlottes faint glimmer was directly on their starboard beam so too did culverin shake out our night reefs mister murray mister hogue beat to quarters lewrie ordained and hoist the colors now furniture chests provisions livestock from the manger and any flimsy temporary partitions were struck below out of harms way the decks were sanded for better traction for the gunners and bracetenders firebuckets were filled and slowmatches lit in case the flintlock strikers of their carronades did not function properly in the damp of a tropic dawn the guns were run in on their wooden recoil slides the tampions were removed from the muzzles and stowed out of the way serge powder cartridges were rammed firm then heavy twentyfourpounder solid shot were trundled down the barrels and seated with a thump from the rammers charges were pierced with metal prickers to give vent for the ignitions to come and the secure lashings on the gunports were uncleated they would wait to prime their guns until they had the enemy in sight since the humidity might spoil the powder in the pans with the pans empty they checksnapped the flints to see if they had a good edge that would spark well against their checkerscored metal frizzens then covered them with leather flaps to keep them dry stand easy hogue instructed from the gun deck mister owen ill see to those swivelguns now the night was still dark as a boot with the island and its harbor a faintly heavier darkness ahead of their starboard bows a thin line of charcoal grey heralded the false dawn to come against which the masts and sails of the leading ships could almost be seen now and again for a lookout gazing to seaward they would still be invisible their wakes lost in the general roil of offshore waves to leeward of the rising sun ope this lastunll do fer all sir cony muttered fetching lewrie one last bracing mug of coffee this coffee or this battle cony lewrie asked amused in spite of the circumstances be nice t see england agin sir cony smiled be damned nice to see tomorrows sunrise the battery to our rear is silenced sir hugo chiswick told his commanding officer breathless from a quick jogtrot mindanao pirates mostly with four frenchmen to supervise we lost four men oh i am most dreadfully sorry sir sir hugo replied but it was a perfunctory sort of sorrow he dragged out his pocket watch and read the face with more ease false dawn quarter past five yes sir no enemy to our rear no scouts or sentinels along our front to your determination captain sir hugo went on no sir very well rejoin your company and stand by sir hugo paced out in front of his command he could barely see most of it the grenadier company lined up two deep spaced out wider than hed like instead of shoulder to shoulder but they would have to suit the bandsmen with their drums and fifes and ayscoughs borrowed pipers tricked out in castoff red tunics the sixpounder field guns and behind them the coehorn mortar crews the color party nearest him the other companies were too far away too deep in the fringes of jungle he could see them in his minds eye though could imagine the formed ranks standing easy with their muskets with their officers to the front one word of command and they would be erect as ramrods ready for what this bloody morning would bring it was hot and close the air like a steaming barbers towel and just as moist there was no hint of rain and the ground across which they would advance was dry and firm it was simply the humidity of these climes making a slight mist that tried to hide the village from them and hid his regiment from the foe willoughby paced farther out in advance with his subadarmajor the senior native officer and his bearer chandra by his side until he was about twenty paces forward of his color party he consulted his watch again sah his bearer gasped with a quick indrawn breath willoughby looked up to see a woman and a boy child not fifty paces off they had arisen early perhaps to fetch water or firewood for the morning cooking they froze in place almost froze in midstep as they might at the sight of a tiger then the woman gave out a shrill yelp and turned to run back to the village oh for christs sake sir hugo groaned you brainless old bitch theyre not even friends of yours and youd warn em mebbe jus frighten sahib chandra commented outwardly calm though his luxuriant white mustaches quivered as he chewed the lining of his mouth either way shell give the alarm sir hugo sighed he took a deep breath and opened his mouth regment he boomed out loud as stentor and could hear the bushes in the jungle shiver as his men awoke from their standing doze talion came the answering shouts from gaunt and the other halfbattalion commander shun sir hugo roared as he drew his smallsword from its scabbard lush green stamping of feet muffled by vegetation uncase the colors two color parties came forward from the jungle the flagstaffs held low like pikes until they were out in the open the leather condoms were stripped off and the colors rolled out to hang limp in the light breeze two british ensigns one borrowed from a warship the kings colors two regimental colors one real and one made up from light canvas and painted to resemble the pale yellow silk of an authentic regiment light companies will advance fifty paces forward the light companies left their extreme flank positions to trot out ahead of their line companies as skirmishers once in position sir hugo turned to face the front raised his sword on high and gave the decisive order the regiment will advance there was a ruffle of drums an eldritch wailing moan a thump of a bass drum and then came musicof a sort it would be the first time anyone on this island any lanun rover had ever heard itperhaps the first time french seamen had ever heard itas the pipes began all the blue bonnets are oer the border and the regiment emerged from the jungle two light companies two color parties what seemed to be two grenadier companies massed in the center and two ranks of men in red coats and white puggarees with their muskets held at shoulder arms legs moving to the lilting skirl of the pipes and the crash and roll of the drummers sticks more urgent more compelling than the stately one hundred steps a minute of a usual line battalion as the ranks approached sir hugo could see the expressions of his sepoys first the same sort of alarm he wished to see on his foes their eyes rolling at this strange new invention and then the grins of delight it wasnt feringhee tootles on fifes this strange new music it was wild heathen barbaric and brutally martial they seemed to like it a lanun rover was making water off the parapet of the low palisade he had roistered with his fellow pirates all night long drunk deep of cocopalm arrack had had his way with a frightened filipino girl who had known better than to complain not if she knew what was good for the health of her family and her own life shed wanned from fear to resigned sullenness to his play and hed left her one tiny spanish coin in the midst of his plashings though here had come a woman and child running for their lives from the forests and he could barely see some strange men standing out in the open by the edge of the jungle oddly dressed men but he had shrugged it off there was no telling what the french would do next and then had come a great shout a series of shouts and the most hideous screeching and howling he had ever heard in his life a whole raped village or ship had never made such a noise and then he could see men a lot of men all dressed in red with muskets at their shoulders and between groups he could see a cannon or two just like the tale the survivors had told of the slaughter on the island he realized hed forgotten his original order of business entirely and had pissed down the entire front of his pareu he drew a trembly breath and gave a great shout capitaine guillaume choundas liked the orient liked oriental women they were so tiny compared to the breton girls back home or the languid cows hed had in paris all beef to the heel as if they had to emulate some artists reproduction from the classics tiny childlike and helpless chinese girls were all right he supposed but he much preferred the fineboned slimness of these filipino natives indian whores in pondichery were fine but sometimes too european in their features too wide across the beam and cursed with heavy thighs something had awakened him and he lay there for a while with the girl beside him shed fallen into an exhausted sleep after hed used her well into the evening she twitched and shuddered in some dream perhaps reliving the memory of what hed forced her to do in that endless night as he relived it he became prickproud he reached out to touch her smooth peachlike bottom and she stiffened her breath halting as she awoke on the mats in his shore hut tiny to begin with not over fourteen years old and coltishly slim to top the bargain he rolled over atop her took hold of her wrists to hold her facedown and insinuated a knee between her legs tuan she begged he liked it when they were aware of what was in store the first time was delicious whore or virgin to be forced was outside their experience but to repeat the act and feel their fear even their revulsion that was sweetest of all this was ancient gallic this rapine he used his thighs to part hers to push her adolescent bottom up in the air a little so he could enter her from behind she was panting in fear now whining with pain as he forced his large member between the dry lips of her entrance could almost taste the wetness waiting inside her once he was past the gates he merde he exclaimed as he heard the strange noises freezing in midstroke zut putain the bamboo door was kicked open and his first officer stood there bending down the english are here troops and guns to the east capitainel choundas shoved the girl away from him and scrambled for his breeches and stockings from the east and just how did they land eh gabord get back to the ship and prepare to upanchor well have the biftecs sailing into harbor with the sun behind them i join you as soon as i stiffen our miserably blind allies go he stood and donned his shirt and gave the crawling girl a kick of frustration goddamned useless all of them putain regment talion came the chorus halt rather a lot of em sir hugo thought surveying his enemies the village had come to a boil and what seemed a brigade of pirates had emerged swords spears and antique muskets waving each done up in gold silk and batikprinted cotton as sleek and shiny as an army of poisonously colorful seasnakes regment will load he shouted stepping back toward his color party skirmishers engage the light companies broke off into skirmishing pairs one man standing and one kneeling with a howl of rage the lanun rovers lurched forward thousands of them in an avenging mob the flat crack of muskets sounded from the light companies as they opened fire once a man had discharged his piece he would retreat a few paces behind his rearrank man who would cover him while he reloaded and take a shot of his own back they came giving ground slowly and raking the leading pirate ranks with ball dropping a man here a man there the pirates checked shying away from being the first man to die while their leaders urged them on light companies retire sir hugo howled regment first rank kneel emboldened by the seeming retreat of the skirmishers the pirates found their courage again and started walking forward at first uneasily then with greater boldness some began to trot to save their lungs and strength for handtohand combat later some braver souls broke into a run sir hugo stepped forward again to ascertain that both light companies were safely out of the line of fire on the flanks brown bess was a hideously inaccurate weapon massed gunfire shoulder to shoulder settled the day delivered at a mankilling sixty yards to strike a man in the middle one aimed high for the neck at that range even so with his regiments deployed in only two ranks sir hugo had to wait to let them come even closer cock your locks sixty yards and mechanical crickets sang present fifty yards and barrels were leveled with sighs forty yards fire the long line of musketmen erupted in a wall of gunpowder and the crackling reports of priming pans and rammed charges sounding like burning twigs pirates screamed in surprise and went down like wheat second rank cock your locks present fire he could hear the rattle of ramrods just before the second rank pulled their triggers and the snapping and crackling rang up and down the line more pirates howled with pain this time and he saw men driven backward thrown off their feet and back into their mates by the sledgehammer blows of caliber lead ball guns he yelled turning to glare at captain addams and the artillery went off rippling from the center halfbattery of sixpounders out to the flanks where the converted boatguns barked and reared on their trails well goddamn sir hugo spat hed never seen the like not in the last war certainly not at gibraltar for sure the air was so moist with humidity that when the artillery discharged those brutal barrels not only flung out a huge cloud of spent powder and sparks they split the air with their loads leaving a misty trail behind the best one could expect from any field gun loaded with canister and grape was about five hundred yards and one usually saw the end result but not the passage of shot but this time it was as if each barrel had flung out a giants phantasmagorical fist of roiled air that went milky as the shock wave passed through it like a row of shotguns the artillery cleaved great swathes from the enemy ranks densely packed as they were they went down by platoons before each piece there was a mown lane of dead and dying twenty yards across and three times that deep platoon fire sir hugo roared now for the grim business to continue in normal fashion to create a continuous rolling volley of fire up and down the line no one could fire faster and with more effect than an englishtrained regiment the pipes had been skirling out something sir hugo had never heard before now with no need to set a marching pace they broke into civilian strathspeys and reels the wind that shook the barley the devil among the tailors and the high road to linton harddriving frightening in their hurried pace for all their gaiety dance tunes turned to the devils business amid the rattling of musketry and the deeperbellied slamming of the guns theyre breaking major gaunt shouted theyre retiring cease fire load fix bayonets fix bayonets the officers repeated eerily and the sudden silence was broken by the slither of steel steel that winked and glittered in the dawn the th will advance the pipers cut off their latest reel extemporizing themselves back into a march as the coehorn mortars began to fire explosively fused roundshot lofted overhead to burst in midair above the wavering hordes of pirates who had just begun to screw their courage back to the sticking post and were ready to charge once more it was the guns that decided the matter slow to roll between the company ranks the regiment had to stay to a halfstep pace even with the pipes urging them on so that they looked as if they minced forward but with both ranks bearing musketstocks held close to the hip barrels and wicked bayonets inclined forward and for bayonet work the sepoys had to be closer together shoulder to shoulder reducing their front to a bare two hundred yards with an unintelligible shout the native pirates came forward to meet them once more sure they could sweep around both flanks and encircle them this time and chop them to bits at last regment halt sir hugo screamed first rank kneel cock your locks well serve em another portion of the hottest curry theyve ever tasted by god chiswick pulled back the firelocks of his two pistols stuck his smallsword into the turf in front of him and stood ready with his nerves singing a gibbering song as that manic horde came on by volley first rank fire twenty muskets discharged at sixty yards perhaps nine foemen went down trampled by their fellows in their rage to get at sir hugos men too damned soon he cursed himself second rank present fire another eight or nine pirates were hammered backward too few once more the artillery subadar looked at him and he waved his arm vigorously both boatguns bucked and reared slashing the front of that implacable mob with grape and canister and finally they checked their headlong rush shying away for a second goddamnit chiswick moaned he had shot all his bolts and there was nothing left although his immediate front was cleared there were at least a hundred foe sweeping his right flank he fired both his pistols and took down one man then cast them aside and drew his sword from the earth bayonets charge his troops went in at a rush weapons fully extended to be met with shields spears and sword blades at first they carried all in front of them with bayonet and musketbutt chiswick carved a spearmans face open reversed and ripped the belly from another to his left nandu gave a great scream as he was shouldered backward and stumbled under the point of a third chiswick hammered the edge of his blade across the foes back the man screamed like a rabbit with his spine cut in half then twitched uncontrollably dahnyavahd sahib dahnyavahd nandu shivered as chiswick helped him to his feet achcha thanks sahib thanks good bloody young fool sir hugo grumbled captain yorke face right double time and reinforce the right flank support the guns nineteenth charge once again two slim ranks of musketeers had shattered pirate ambitions and the guns had strewn the ground with howling broken wounded it was time to go in with cold steel or be driven back one more charge choundas insisted no tuan boats his interpreter shouted back as the pirate chieftain raved and slobbered with wrath he want go now no good this place no more no good fight on land hell sail off and leave all his treasure choundas sneered coldly sail off and abandon all my gifts all the muskets and shot he say you want you stay and keep tuan the interpreter finally replied he go illana steal more nex year filthy cowards choundas whispered filthy pagan brutes he turned on his heel and stalked off for the waiting launch his face burning with anger at this final failure of his ally this final proof of their utter uselessness and with his own failure as well he had no hope now of a raiding season hed seen the two regimental colors and the massed bands all the artillery that only two onebattalion units could array where had the heretical english gotten so many ships to carry that many troops and then land them on the eastern shore where he had not expected them only an overt operation with the full strength of the royal navy could put such an expedition at sea and support it this far from india something had happened to force the english to take the lid of secrecy off had another war broken out back home of which he was unaware to the ship he snapped at his waiting boat crew as he sat down in the stern and quickly he merde alors his new coxswain groaned pointing out to sea les anglais chapter have we the depth to stand in closer hogue asked and a quarter less four the leadsman shouted from up forward as if in answer captains ayscoughs recollections say we do sir lewrie replied with a happy but fierce grin on his features helm down to larboard quartermaster ease her up as close as shell lie to the wind full and by full an by sir how we got this far i dont know sir hogue enthused as they swept into the harbor in telestos wake i was sure that was a battery on the point but nary a peep from them did we hear most thoroughly in the barrel drunk as lords i expect lewrie said clapping his hands with anticipation as he strode to the quarterdeck nettings to look down upon his gun deck mister owen i give you leave to open fire as you bear thankee sir owen shouted back wait for it lads wait for it culverin could work her way much closer to the beach than any of the other vessels where her shortranged but heavy carronades had the advantage there was a mushrooming pillar of smoke coming from beyond the native settlement he could see a coehorn mortar shell burst in midair most excellently fused against the rim of sunrise on the horizon over the trees and on that wide beach was a gunners fondest dreams stationary targets drawn up with their prows resting on the sand their guns pointing inland and useless at least twenty bloodred praos abandoned by their crews engaged against the troops on the far side of the little town telesto opened fire first followed by lady charlotte sand flew into the air as eighteen and twelvepounder balls struck the shore boats twitched and thrashed as they were hit their sterns leaping out of the water to fall back downward and flail the shallow waters like a beavers slap masts and paddles went spinning in confusion and hulls split open as they were flayed with iron two cables sir owen shouted ere we go then number one gun fire lewrie stood amazed as the flower of smoke and flame gushing from the muzzle expanded into an opening blossom larger than any he had ever witnessed the air torn apart with weapons song and the twentyfourpounder balls progress marked by a misty trail of shock and turbulence as if they were firing combustible carcasses the ball hit a prao on the beach square on the sternposts ripped right through the light wood and flung a shower of broken timbers and lacedtogether planking into the air there was a sudden screeching rrawwrrkk as the ball rivened her from stern to stem to topple her in ruin huzzah lads do us another lewrie cheered his gunners as they took aim with the rest of the starboard battery quartermaster luff us up a mite slow our progress to give the gunner more time to aim smoky belching crashes as the carronades spewed out their loads thin dirty trails of roiled air emerging from the sudden mists of burned powder and then the slamming screech of ravaged wood ashore as another prao then a third leaped like frightened birds at being touched with iron screaming their rrawwrrkk rrawwrrkk as if in their deathagonies carry on mister owen lewrie said picking up a telescope for a better view in the distance he could see villagers running one direction pirates in their gaudier clothing falling back into the village and down to the beach to save what they could of their ships to fall in irregular clots of terror as iron shattered and keened in clouds of sharp shards and splintered wood he directed his glass forward to see telesto take poisson dor under fire the french ship had cut or slipped her cables abandoning her anchors and was getting underway even as several ships boats thrashed oars in her wake to catch her up by god i do believe thats our bastard choundas in one of those boats lewrie crowed aloud cant even fight from your ship this time can you you pervert have to let some more of your people do your dying for you you poxy whoreson frog poisson dor had gotten her jibs and staysls set her spanker over the stern hoisted and had let fall her topsis but they were acockbill and not yet fully braced round to draw the wind she was not yet under full control but her larboard gunports flew open in unison and muzzles emerged she would fight it out and right in telestos wake sailed lady charlotte paying off the wind a little as if in trepidation of getting too close but her guns crashed out a solid broadside and the sea around poisson dor erupted in feathers of spray and several balls hit her low twixt wind and water a hefty explosion drew lewries attention back to the task at hand a ball had hit one of the praos on her foredeck where her guns were seated igniting a powder store which had blown up in a great dark bulb of smoke and flame the prao had disintegrated and was cascading down in smoldering chunks onto two other boats to either side setting them alight and scattering the pirates around them a guinea for that gunner mister owen my word on it alan vowed and a quarter less five the leadsman called out over the roar of the battle damme sir we could get inshore even closer hogue shouted were dead astern of poisson dors anchorage deep water sir luff up again quartermaster pinch us closer inshore alan commanded mister owen load your next broadside with canister and grapeshot put an iron hail on the beach and skin the bastards culverin rounded up into the wind ghosting almost to a stop with her sails shivering and thrashing until the leadsman found only three fathoms of water the quartermaster put his tiller over to the windward side to fill the sails with wind and she heeled hard for a moment before riding back upright they were now only a single cable off the beach two hundred yards just as the central part of the village came abeam pirates were falling back in disorder through the town massing on the beach and heaving to launch their boats for an escape alan could almost hear the sudden fatalistic sighs the groans of alarm as they saw the trim little ketch with her guns run out and the muzzles staring them between the eyes as you bear fire lewrie called five carronades lurched inboard on their recoil slides five crashing bellows of noise stink and shudders five great blooms of smoke towered over her sides and drifted away to leeward through her sails five fists of god struck the beach hewing away everything they touched taking down the bamboo log palisade behind the beach scything the palms above the hightide line lashing the thatched rooves but most particularly flailing the sand into a bloody cloud and scattering lanun rovers bowling them over like ninepins and when the smoke cleared the beach had been abandoned by the living with only the broken dead and whimpering wounded remaining merciful god in heaven murray whispered in awe at what they had wrought bloody and again mister owen lewrie bade grape and canister the next broadside only thrashed at the heels of the pirates who fled that threat of death back into the palisaded village for shelter bold searovers too afraid to save their ships theyre afire up yonder sir murray pointed lewrie raised his glass and looked toward the eastern end of the harbor praos were burning there smudging the dawn with greasy coils of smoke and ruddy flame i see soldiers on the beach there he rejoiced mister owen direct your fire upon the village walls and clear the way for the troops aye sir and a half two the leadsman warned i believe we may haul our wind a point or two for now men lewrie told his helmsman the long sweep of the tiller was put over to starboard and the bows swung off the wind deck crew flung themselves onto the belaying pins to free the sheets and ease the set of the sails to draw more wind and culverin slid to a stop one fathom and a quarter the leadsman called out much too late well shit lewrie fumed turning red with embarrassment at running solidly aground right in the midst of a battle of all the places to choose from hed staggered right onto an uncharted sandbar uhm she struck mighty easylike sir murray frowned his mouth working hard probly didnt do no damage t her quickwork her gripe an her cutwater is solid enough and shes a tough old lady she is sir ratrun bottom too ahh er that is fer when the tide goes out sir ah lewrie sighed wishing it was possible to die of mortification hmm yes the tide bloody hell aye sir murray commiserated taking a pace away well damn my eyes lewrie sighed heavily one hand on his hip and gazing up at the masthead for clues look have chips go below and sound the forepeak to see if theres any leakage a hand thats a good swimmer over the bows to see how hard shes stuck and boat crews into the launch and cutter to see if we may tow out the stream or kedge anchor and work her off before were left high and bloody dry til suppertime aye sir murray replied knuckling his brow damn all hard luck sir hogue told him i feel like such a goosebrained twit lewrie confessed happens to the best im told sir hogue added though he had to work at keeping a straight face there was a shattering explosion just at that moment which spun them about in their tracks something had set fire to cuddalore anchored farther to the eastperhaps a few diehards from the prize crew choundas had put aboard to safeguard her from being plundered by his allies she had just gone up in a titanic blast as her magazines burst ripping her into a plume of fragments farther east and out in deeper waters poisson dor was still fighting with telesto close aboard on her left beam as they fell off the wind to the north for the chain of tiny islets that guarded this harbor from the opposite monsoons lady charlotte had continued on easterly as she could to cross the french ships stern and rake her before turning north as well on the far side to lay poisson dor in a savage crossfire to think that but for a moment of stupidity we could be a part of that lewrie said with a bitter growl god what a glorious fight theyre having and weve missed it grand seats though sir hogue replied cheerfully right in the stalls as it were to witness it owen came up the starboard ladder to the quarterdeck and gave a cough to let them know he was there scuse me sir but ive flat run outa targets sir no more o those pirates t be seen an half the village knocked down s far sir want me t keep on no mister owen continue to fire with one gun only and i wish to have your other gunners for boat crews we have to kedge off before the tide runs out too much aye sir sir murray called those boats yonder from poison door sir tryin t land on the beach lewrie seized his glass and climbed up on the shoreside bulwark to peer at the two longboats being rowed ashore choundas lewrie howled with frustration can we lay a gun on him hell get away into the jungle else er nossir owen almost moaned wringing his grimy hands in frustration hes outa our gunarcs less we had a focsle chasegun an it dont look like hell put it anywhere close t our poor range hell get away at last lewrie snorted in disbelief all of their labors and suffering for nothing again mister hogue sir take charge of the ship sir lewrie exclaimed keep mister murray and mister owen with you and defend her should the pirates try to get off the beach and take her now shes aground use your artillery over our heads should we run into trouble on the beach are the boat crews assembled good arm them muskets a pistol each and a cutlass cony fetch my case of pistols the cutter had eight oarsmen a bowman and cony as coxswain the launch had a total of eight men aboard instead of a kedge anchor lowered into the sternsheets or one of the stern cables the men were surprised to receive arms row for the beach lewrie snapped row like the devil was at your heels i want yon bastard they cast off and put their backs to it digging in deep with their oarblades and grunting with the exertion lewries cutter in the lead he stood in the bows loading his pistols not straight for the beach cony take us east up the coast for a ways before cutting in closer to them before we ground aye sir cony replied angling the tillerbar under his arm to steer them more slantwise across the lapping wavelets choundas looked up from gazing at the bottomboards of his boat with a bleak expression the eastern palisade of the village was yet being defended but he could see most of the pirates streaming off for safety south through the longest wall and over the ricepaddies into the jungle the remaining praos on the strand were on fire damaged or under the guns of the ketchrigged gunboat there would have been no safety aboard cuddalore minus her topmasts and rigging so after picking up his tiny watch party from her he had set her on fire so the biftecs would not have the satisfaction of recapturing her shes aground i think he said to no one turning to look at the saucy little ketch and a dropping tide no means of escape there either even if his small party could take her coehorn mortar shells were bursting farther inland over those ricepaddies and he could hear the muffled popping and crackling of musketry in a steady rolling platoonfire they would have to run that deadly gauntlet across the paddy dykes to escape and from the continual thin screaming they could barely hear that way was being turned into a killingground choundas swiveled aft to look at his beautiful ship poisson dor one of the finest thirtytwogunned frigates that had ever swum was almost hulldown up the fringe of islets wreathed in a mushroom cloud of gunpowder with two of her masts gone as thinly manned as she was after losing la malouine and his best hands she was putting up a marvelous fight but she was going to lose it was fated and he wasnt aboard to lead the fight in her when she was battling for her life as a captain as an officer of the french navy should be no he had waited too long trying to put some spine into that churlish native chieftain who could have expected the damned english to land their troops on the east side of the island and march overland through all that trackless jungle and then attack him from the west with their ships only the insane would beat against the wind and attack from leeward when the best approach would have been to ghost into harbor with a following wind with the rising sun at their backs to ruin his gunners aim everything had gone wrong what shall we do now sir one of his surviving garde de la marines asked him in a soft whisper close to his ear choundas lifted his face to gaze at him nineteen years old the equivalent of an english midshipman an officerintraining choundas wondered just what sort of lesson valmette was learning today steer for the beach timonier choundas instructed his new coxn land us west of the land fighting but out of range of those guns on the ketch this side of the eastern palisade we shall take a path through the village go out its western side and get into the jungle away from the biftecs artillery then strike down the western coast and find a decent seagoing boat a prao perhaps two boats setting out from the ketch sir valmette warned to kedge her off could we take her too few of us choundas snapped having already counted heads and discounted their chances and their boats are no better than ours for deep ocean choundas took a second look small as his party was he had more men wellarmed men than what appeared in the english boats hostages perhaps mes amis choundas brightened for safe passage out of here timonier steer to meet them in the shallows men ready your muskets i want prisoners an officer if we can theyre turning to meet us shy of the beach lewrie told his boat crew were going to have a fight on our hands lad a devil of a fight load muskets and pistols and lay your swords to hand lewrie looked back at culverin there was not one gun barrel that could be cranked around in its port to lay on the french even if they could have pointed the range was too great he looked back to the shore to the eastern end of the beach where the boats were on fire it would appear that his fathers regiment had been held up in their advance there would be no aid from that quarter either i could meet em gunnel to gunnel he thought but one peek over the side canceled that thought the water may have been clear as gin but there was the niggling little matter of his not being able to swim and boats were sure to be capsized if they meleed like miniature frigates the water was so clear it was impossible to judge its depth but for the faint sunrise shadow of his hull on the bottomsand and he judged that to be over his head perhaps a full fathom still cony put your tiller over hard alarboard he ordered we beach and meet them with the boats for cover and steadier aim aye sir cony parroted and shoved the tiller bar over the second boat in his wake followed suit a moment later well be the stone fortress hell be the enemy squadron men lewrie told both boat crews to cover his queasy fear of being drowned once ashore get down below the gunnels and well skin em and if they want to come to us then bedamned to em i say save your pistols for when they get close the french boats changed course once more and the oarsmen laid almost flat on their thwarts to drive faster once they saw their plan for a miniature naval engagement was for nought row row get us ashore quickly now lewrie urged his hands the french were aimed right for him trying to be upon them even before they could jump over the gunwales or get the oars shipped musketeers lay in the bows of the french boats and one or two tried shots at long range a stroke oar aft by cony shrieked and fell back among his mates upsetting the furious stroke his neck shattered by a ball toss yer oars cony yelped as the surf heaved them forward on a limp wave the cutter lurched and slithered with a wet hiss as her keel ran onto the sand damn the oars lewrie shouted over the side and make ready the bow man leaped shindeep into water and started to drag the bows farther up the beach while the oarsmen let go of their oars and took up their weapons the bow man was hitflung backward with a grunt of ruptured lungs which encouraged them to make haste and slither over the offside gunwale instead of standing and leaping out with a care to staying erect and dry muskets were popping and bits of the cutter were flying into the air as ball splintered the wood lewrie had gone sprawling once over the side and when he raised his head there was the lead boat not ten yards off ready to ground almost alongside cock your locks take aim fire he shouted as he drew his first pistol six muskets spat out a thin volley the seventh had soaked priming and only squibbed with a dull phutt but three french oarsmen had been hit as they stowed their oars and took up weapons from the bottom boards the second french boat the one with choundas aboard was landing ten yards farther up the beach lewrie drew back the lock of his pistol and took aim at a french musketman he pulled the trigger and his weapon squibbed well damme he spat tossing the useless pistol aside and drawing its mate by then his target was kneeling out of side on the far side his arm appearing as he rammed down a fresh load he popped back up and lewrie fired this time the weapon gave out a sharp bark and the frenchman fell back with a shrill scream as the top of his head was blown off fire at will his second boat grounded and the musketmen came running for shelter behind his cutter as four muskets fired the french sailors were returning fire at a suicidal range cony our crew steel lewrie snapped witty give em a volley and then join me he drew his hanger as the last of the french weapons popped boarders away boarders he went round the bows of his boat and ran straight for them pistols were going off a frenchman leaped up with a musket to confront him but was shot down another spun about in his tracks and fell into the surf with a great splash and then lewrie was upon his first man twohanded he slashed upward forcing the mans long musket barrel high stamping forward with his left foot to get inside the reverse swing of that hard metalplated butt as it came for his skull only pummeling his shoulder a quick downward slash that left him kneeling and his foe was howling with pain his belly laid open from left nipple to right hip a cutlass came probing from his dying foes right tangled in the mans flailing arms and lewrie drew back and thrust taking this enemy in the stomach lewrie sprang erect pushing himself forward to stay close so choundas musketeers could not take a shot at the melee and pick out englishmen to kill he was met by a flaxen blonde sailor who was trying to decide if he wanted to finish ramming home a charge in his musket or drop it and draw his cutlass lewrie towered over him and cut downward through shoulder and collar bone bringing a huge gout of blood that shot into the air like a fountain there was a volley of musketry and two of lewries hands went down as they clambered over the boat to get at the frenchmen from higher up the beach there was an answering volley choundas had gotten his crew organized and they fired able seaman witty had taken his hands out to the right flank where they could get a clear shot pistols witty then charge lewrie howled come on men at em culverins without looking to see how many hands remained he waved his sword and ran for the second french boat choundas waved his men on too so no more shots could be fired at his own hands those who had fled from the first boat found nerve to turn and join the charge as their gallant captain led them they met in the shallows between the boats up to their knees in water with the light surf surging up to their crotches and their feet sinking into the swirling sands as the waves lapped in and drew back wittys hands were coming in from the shore side forcing the fight into deeper water pistols were popping and a feather of spray from a nearmiss leaped up between lewrie and the young frenchman he faced off with hes a gentleman lewrie thought seeing the fineness of the young mans smallsword they crossed blades and lewrie was sure of the mans background he had a good wrist and arm and quick nerves meeting a direct attack with a prime movement going to a high guard over his head at fifth to fend lewrie off then swinging under his blade to second before launching a thrust of his own lewrie let his left hand go and counterthrust at the young mans lower sword arm which was blocked by a marvelously wellexecuted circular parry to spiral lewries point wide to the left but lewrie drew back out of range twohanding his hanger again and cut over from left to right dragging the officers blade back up to a high fifth position as he did so he waded forward to get inside the mans guard feinting a thrust the young mans reflexes learned in an elegant swordmasters salon made him step back and he tripped over his own feet bouyed free of the sand momentarily by the surf as he came back up spouting and blowing flinging stinging salt from bis eyes lewrie overhanded a thrust down like stabbing at some fish and speared the young man through the side of the neck with a gasp of surprise the man sank once more with bright arterial blood looping and trailing in the sea vous choundas screamed beating his breast and striding easily through the surf toward alan timonier a mois i think e slay ze wrong man in zat alley en garde i eat your brains and shit in your skull lewrie waded shoreward to meet him to avoid the clumsy fate of the younger officer sword held at third waiting for choundas first move it was like an explosion choundas had no grace no elegance to his swordplay coming from a rougher school with howls he was upon alan with his smallsword swinging like a cutlass blades rang not in beat but with the rasp of a farriers hammer and the shock sang up lewries arm like a bells echo with each blow try as he would to thrust and counterthrust to slash with the point and cut over from defensive guards to direct or even indirect cuts choundas was always there quick as lightning all attack and very little defense of his own lewrie was forced to give ground half a step at a time and the sea swirled higher up his body from the ankles to his shins to his knees then to midcalf captain osmonde warned me id meet a truly dangerous man if i kept this up lewrie frowned recalling the marine officer aboard his first ship the one who had taught him the true rough and tumble of steel and guided him through his first adult duel on antigua choundas was pressing forward both of them up to their waists in salt water and being buffeted by the incoming surf lewrie swung down and left to ward off a chest cut felt a leg reach out to tangle with his to bring him down and stumbled right and away into shallow water choundas sword came arcing up out of the water glistening in the dawn light with water droplets and he met it high left the beat of steel on steel forcing his own blade back to touch his left cheek a shoulder lunging forward and lewrie stumbled again reaching back with his left hand to steady himself falling sideways into the surf with choundas splashing forward to tower over him and a wicked razorhoned blade descending in a powerful twohanded overhead strike he got his hanger up to parry at fifth got his left hand under his hip and swept out with his legs cut directly down and forward under the offbalanced frenchmans blade to clash with the handguard choundas reeled back almost going down himself lewrie came up soaking wet with his left leg under him and thrust with all of his might to leap like a porpoise with sword arm extended as rigid as a pikestaff and missed his swords point went over choundas left shoulder as the man ducked their bodies slammed together and choundas was going over backward but he hefted alan high enough over his shoulder to heave him a few feet away to splash into water deep as his waist drowning lewries mind screamed as he tried to get his feet under him tried to fight the rush and shove of another wave tried to find a breath of air for lungs thumped empty by choundas body lewrie lurched erect coughing on the water hed taken in his eyes burning with salt and his hair streaming down his face choundas the final thrust death arm across his chest to defend sword point held low at prime the blade pointing down as the thrust came for his throat a sting on his left hip as the smallswords point bit him and he was going over backward again and could feel choundas feet near to his own he kicked with his right foot as he landed on his left hand and knee the heel of his shoe took choundas in the nutmegs making him hiss like a serpent choundas bent over with the sudden agony and lewrie came up with all he had left bright steel and sterling silver came sweeping up from the sea bottom under choundas guard under his upraised sword drawn back for a killing hack salt water streamed in a glittering arc as the hanger swept upward choundas flinched back to avoid it lewrie could feel the shock in his wrist up his arm as his sword made contact flicking pointlow to pointhigh following the angle of the razorsharp edge as he straightened his wrist and turned it and choundas was falling backward his sword hand to his face a wave of surf surged high as alans shoulders as he got to his knees following that stroke and choundas was tumbling about in the water rolling and tumbling shoreward like a piece of flotsam dont tell me i actually killed the bastard lewrie gasped in surprise retching saliva and salt water as he rose to his feet and shuffled onto the beach sword ready at fourth slightly across his body should choundas be shamming but there was red in the water pink on the mans shirt and when choundas managed at last to crawl ashore on hands and knees his sword forgotten he was screaming screaming and writhing like a worm in hot ashes moaning and whimpering pitifully between his screams and patting his face rolling over and over twitching like a serpent strike you bastard lewrie hissed prodding that body with the tip of his sword choundas kicked out with his left leg and hit lewrie painfully on the kneecap and without thought lewrie slashed down hard into the back of choundas left calf which raised another howl of pain and set him rolling and thrashing again sir someone was yelling sir we done fer em sir they struck sir lewrie stepped back from choundas and looked up to see cony coming toward him limping from a swordcut across the outside of his thigh and blood matted in his sweaty blonde hair the beach was littered with dead and wounded and the most of them french lewrie was happy to observe the rest were sitting in a fearful knot covered by his mens weapons you failed lewrie crowed at choundas you failed at everything you tried you bloody murdering bastard we beat you understand me alan whats all the shouting about hey he said swiveling to see captain chiswick coming down the beach leading two spaced ranks of his troops his hat was gone his sword was slimed with blood and he winced with each step but he was whole bloody hell where did you spring from took you long enough were you impatient for my arrival dear alan chiswick said with a rasp of gunpowder in his throat had to clear this damned eastern palisade first had a busy morning have you tolerably busy yes lewrie replied now that the fight was over now that they were safe in the hands of the sepoys of the th native infantry he could allow his usual weakness to creep over him as he loosed the awful tension of mortal combat a moment later and it was all he could do to stand much hurt chiswick inquired anxiously after wiping his sword clean and sheathing it to come to his side pinked in the hip lewrie allowed sinking down on his haunches to let cony undo his breeches and take a look at it not deep sir cony assured him as he laved it in the sailors universal nostrum fresh seawater taint bleedin much neither so e didnt get ya nowhere vital make ya stiff fer awhiles sir could i ave yer breeches sir i could bind it er if ya got a clean handkerchief in yer pocket sir i could fother a bandage overn it fer now the bandage cony lewrie said with a shaky laugh damned if i want to go back aboard barearsed chiswick dug into his tailcoat pocket and offered a small silver flask which alan drank from gratefully urn a lovely brandy you have there burge i was halfexpecting some of that corn whiskey i remember from yorktown are those bloody pirates beaten yet slaughtered like rabbits chiswick assured him with a harsh laugh which made lewrie look up at his face there was something odd about chiswick now some newfound brutality he hadnt had when theyd put him ashore the night before and how did your regiment fare main well chiswick replied shrugging and taking a sip of brandy himself i got my light company in a hellish predicament shot my bolt a bit too soon and had to melee with the bayonet but the boatguns cleared the way for us and your father sent reinforcements to our flank we lost about fifty dead and wounded it looks like fourteen of them from my company im sad to say sorry to hear that aye they were damned good lads chiswick added nodding and getting to his feet they could hear the pipes skirling as the regiment took the village at last and the guns fell silent they could also hear the braying of lt col sir hugo st george willoughby as he issued some new command and laughed at something that amused him seems im still blessed with a father lewrie smirked here whats the matter with this bugger chiswick demanded toeing choundas in the ribs which brought on another bout of howls hmm hamstrung neat as any indiand do a straying slave hell be a mister hopkins from now on if im any judge dont take on so you bloody bastard youll hang before it heals chiswick used his foot to roll choundas over my word chiswick gulped kill me choundas pleaded in a harsh whisper kill me our captum done fer em sir one of the sailors boasted choundas had taken the hangers edge across his lips and the hard steel had knocked out several teethknocked them out or cut them out for the upper gums were laid open on the right jaw the right cheek was pared back to show the chipped bone beneath and the nose was hanging free on the right side choundas right eye teared blood from the slice that had chopped it in half like a grape and a ragged patch of eyebrow and forehead hung open matted and gory with clotted blood and sand well aint you the pretty young buck now captain beaunasty chiswick drawled once he had gotten over his shock i say alan you do bloody nice carving when youve a mind remind me to have you for supper next time we have roast beef kill me choundas croaked messieurs je implore chiswick drew a pistol and checked the priming no lewrie shouted reaching up to put a hand on chiswicks wrist leave him the way he is let him live with it yes i suppose mister twiggd prefer a hanging at that burgess sighed putting the pistol back into his waistband i think hed prefer mseur choundas go back to france as he is lewrie replied as a warning an example of failure of what the next bastardll get should they dare cross our hawse in future well chiswick nodded seeing the wry sense to it spose he could always do himself in later my dear burgess lewrie chuckled the way this poor wretchs luck is going hed probably miss with a pistol to his skull failure has a way of staying with you dont ye know there was a dull boom that sounded across the harbor making them turn to look seaward a cloud of smoke wreathed culverin as she sat higher and dryer as the tide ran out but coming into the bay was a frigate almighty god lewrie snapped getting to his feet and doing up his breeches cony get the hands back to the boats we have to defend our ship flag sir cony said instead taint frogs sir what are they chiswick asked well goddamn i do believe its a spanish ship of war alan blurted as the whiteandgold flag curled out lazily bet theyre going to be mightily displeased with us chiswick prophesied poaching in their private preserve and all back to the ship anyway burge i trust ill see you later after captain ayscough and mister twigg talk their way out of this think you they can alan burgess twigg is half a politician lewrie replied smiling he can talk his way out of anything v lam valete formosi nos ad beatos vela mittimus portus magni petentes docta dicta sironis vitamque ab omni vindicabimus cura now fare ye well ye goodly youths we are spreading our sails for blissful havens in quest of great sims wise words and from all care will redeem our life catalepton v virgil chapter the board room at the admiralty was blessed with a huge fireplace trimmed in wooden carvings of navigational instruments tall candles lit the chilly chamber against the gloom of a late february afternoon as they huddled in front of the fireplace lifting the tail skirts of their uniform coats to warm their frozen backsides lt alan lewrie studied the whiteandgilt ceiling the lighttoned wood paneling and the parquet floors hed only been inside the admiralty once in his life back when shrike had paid off in and then only to the first floor to cool his heels for hours in the infamous waiting room before going to the basement to wrangle for even more hours with a clerk in a tiny monks cell of an office perched on tall stools to stay out of the two inches of water that had seeped in from a recent thames flood all to balance the ships books and military inventory ahem captain ayscough grumbled as the double doors opened and two elderly officers entered first was admiral lord howe first lord of the admiralty followed by admiral sir samuel hood in their retinue were several civilians lewrie was amazed to learn during the introductions that they were secretary of state lord sydney and the first secretary to admiralty phillip stephens they took their seats behind a long table and ayscough percival and lewrie were seated on the opposite side we have read your report with great interest captain ayscough lord howe stated the lieutenants journals as well with not only great interest but may i be the first to say so great admiration for your energetic prosecution of this matter in the kings name there is also milords gentlemen lord sydney added the report from mister zachariah twigg as regards the uhm political matters beyond the purely nautical and military scope of your recent expedition the gentleman commends you and your officers in the most forthright manner captain for your zeal and enterprise sagacity and competence in fact his only regrets or recriminations are the unfortunate demise of his fellow crown uhm emissary mister wythy in canton and the untimely arrival of that spanish frigate at balabac island had that not occurred we might have been out and gone before any civilized nation could ever learn of our presence in those waters assuring us total secrecy start to finish and then the book could have been closed shut on this affair forever well the french know of it milord admiral hood scoffed to their detriment even if the dons did free choundas and his men there are some niggling uhm lord sydney posed ramifications anent our relations with the spanish crown regarding this expedition violation of their territorial waters for one violation of their sovereign sanctity ashore some remuneration paid sub rosa i need hardly inform you to their viceroygeneral in manila to help restore that native village one would assume should the moneys ever find a way of trickling down through their viceroys fingers lord howe smirked cracking his bleak and patrician visage for a brief moment fortunately there was hardly any mention of the incident in the uhm american public notice from the crew of that whaler we freed lord sydney continued that nation has more on its rebellious little mind than taking time to be in any way grateful for the lives and freedom of some of its uhm citizens gratitude to their mother country is in rather short supply on that side of the atlantic and most likely shall be for a generation to come whilst gratitude here at home for the heroes of this venture shall have to be rather thin as well sirs lord howe intoned turning in his chair to see if lord sydney had anything further to add lord sydney inclined slightly towards the older admiral allowing him to proceed by god sirs had we leave to print your reports in the marine chronicle or the gazette it would be an eightday wonder the populace would chair you through the streets howeverhere he sobered once more and settled back into a strong resemblance of the rebel general george washington suffering an acute attack of gasfor diplomatic reasons none of this may ever see the light of day i fear captain ayscough that the inestimable credit due you lieutenants percival and lewrie shall never be adequately expressed by a grateful crown or an equally grateful admiralty until such time as another war occurs with france any word of this glorious expedition of yours must never pass your lips not even to your dear ones i that is we completely understand milords ayscough nodded sternly and obey your strictures without question it goes without saying there shall be no public commendation lord sydney smirked but that does not mean there shall be no expression of pleasure for your valiant deeds name the reward dearest to you my good sir in reason and we shall endeavor to please an adjudgment by droits of admiralty in the matter of prize money milords ayscough said quickly not for my own gain let me assure you but for the ships people most especially for those widows left without succor i believe the reckoning of what we took at spratly and at balabac was in excess of five hundred thousand pounds assigned as droits of the crown even an eighth of that for warrants petty officers able and ordinary hands would reward them for all their magnificent courage and loyalty even when they didnt know what we were doing out there nothing for your officers or yourself lord howe queried active employment naturally milord ayscough reddened feeling ashamed to even dare ask for anything for himself the heartfelt cry one would hear from any sea officer and do daily belowstairs admiral hood stuck in with a short bark of amusement by god captain your concern for your people is perhaps even more commendable than any deed youve wrought the past two years well said sir damn well said i believe it would be impossible to deny such an aspiring and courageous officer the opportunity to ply his profession lord howe assured him active commission it shall be sir a fifth rate frigate at least and your personal selection of first officer lieutenant percival sir ayscough said quickly make it so my dear stephens lord howe told his principal secretary who was scribbling away at the end of the table it would have been nice for ayscough to have wanted a share of all the booty theyd taken from the lanun rovers lewrie thought as the praise was heaped on their shoulders it would have been nice for him to have included his poorly paid officers in that request for reward but lewrie was not as rankled as might have been his usual wont his father had been one of the first into the chieftains personal lair and had emerged dripping diamonds rubies pearls and emeralds with his bearer chandra grunting under the strain of a small chest of more loot what ayscough reported as captured thence to be given to the crown as their exclusive droit was only about twothirds of what had actually been there the rest shared out among the sepoys and officers of the th native infantry before telesto had sailed for england from calcutta hed had one final supper with his father lewrie had regretted that draupadi apsara and padmini were no longer in his fathers employ but the loot had restocked his bibikhana most wonderfully well and it had been the grandest sendoff hed ever had sir hugo had handed over certificates worth enough to pay off his creditors back in england and as a final parting fillip had given alan a little present or two as well a reddish gold necklace set with diamonds and rubies heavy and showy enough for royalty and a triple strand of pearls with matching earrings bracelets and rings fit for a queen he hadnt had a chance to have them appraised by a strand or st james jeweler yet but he was sure he was at least five thousand pounds richer and for you sir lord howe asked lieutenant lewrie hum lewrie said coming back to earth from his monetary musings come on you toadying wretch think of something to ask for a reward you really desire no he countered ask for something noblesounding or theyll know you for the greedy swine you really are well there is the matter of midshipman hogue sir lewrie began shifting in his chair it would be a hellish comedown for him to revert from acting lieutenant to one more midshipman milords if there is an examining board to sit soon i assure you he could pass it and were there an officers berth come available i know it would please him no end should he gain it acting lieutenants made on foreign stations have no need to sing for their supper hood stated consider him a commission officer and i would desire him aboard my ship milords ayscough added as the least senior officer to season him properly make it so stephens aye sir the longterm servant replied nothing for yourself mister lewrie well there is the matter of my father mister stephens milords lewrie stammered out sir hugo st george willoughby ah lord sydney replied with a suddenly prim expression his lips popping together him youre his uhm son are you when we left calcutta the question of his brevet to colonel of the th native infantry was still up in the air milords and he more than proved his worth on every occasion he wishes to remain in india in john company service lord howe asked incredulous that anyone would want such an exile he does sir his men adore him and he well whatever his faults milords he is a good soldier and a good officer and he truly does care about the regiment hmm spose thats best after all him to remain out there lord sydney sighed im told hes cleared his creditors and there was a captain chiswick mentioned in twiggs report i assume he is to stay in that regiment as well a catercousin to you is he a good friend milord we were together at yorktown in fact i shall be going down to guildford to visit his family next week to deliver news of him and some presents for them there wouldnt be a pretty sister would there lieutenant lewrie lord sydney teased there is indeed milord lewrie said blushing for real active duty naturally hood intoned lifting a wary brow officers of bis generation were extremely leery of younger men who contemplated marriage too early in their careers they were forever lost to the sea service in their opinion and even the hint of an imminent attachment was suspicious to that worthy i trust hmm active duty yes milord that goes without saying lewrie answered quickly that was the response they expected much as he wished he were brave enough in the face of this exalted gathering to tell them what he really thought that if he was truly as rich as he dared hope they could have his resignation and bedamned to all the nautical deprivation hed suffered since his father had damned near pressganged him into the navy as a midshipman back in after the last bit hed had nearly enough and no public thanks or fame from it either but that could never be said he realized and shaming himself before ayscough hood and howe by such a declaration was a thing he didnt have the courage for he could only hope that they would file him away for future employment hopefully very close to home for a change else theyd allow him a few months shore leave and forget their promises as great men were wont to do and let him fester most happily on the halfpay list to the end of his indolent days i once milords awarded lieutenant lewrie command of a small brig of war off cape francois admiral hood said turning to face his fellows the war ended before he could make his mark with her but he more than made up for it with little culverin this time i am convinced he would be wasted in some other captains wardroom oh sufferin shit lewrie groaned to himself aghast that they would send him right back to sea it was peacetime after all the waiting room below his feet was crammed to the ceiling with halfpay officers so eager for employment theyd crawl from whitehall to limehouse reach on their hands and knees in a dogcollar if they could crawl up a ships gangway when they got there lewries throat was already dry and he essayed a cough the artificial soon became the genuine article maybe he mused if they think im going to expire right here in the board room from the flux or something theyll delay it at least he dug out his handkerchief and began to bark into it are you well mister lewrie lord sydney inquired with some alarm on his face a glass of something perhaps the change in weather milord lewrie struggled to reply all this cold and rain here in england after the tropics he cut that statement off paling at what they might do about it idiot he could have kicked himself no wrong thing to say you damned fool goddamn their solicitous little hearts theyll probably ship me right back where i just came from and think they do me a blessing dear lord jesus just a little help here please a small vessel below the rates he heard lord howe instruct mr stephens in a somewhat healthier and warmer climate than the channel squadron i should think what do we have at present pray god theyve all sunk lewrie hoped turning a wild gaze on stephens stephens had been first secretary to the board of admiralty for years the lords commissioners for the office of high admiral surviving one first lord after another more than any other man in england he was the one who truly had his fingers on the pulse of the fleet such as no senior officer or appointee had stephens executed more administrative power in an hour of scribbling and reading of files than most fighting admirals did in an entire career of bloody battles he knew of every opening every promising officer every fool and every little scandal stephens gazed back at lewrie sizing him up cocking his head to one side as if reading his career file from memory lewrie ducked a little stephens most probably knew of his every scandal too nothing suitable immediately milord stephens said after pretending to glance through a sheaf of documents there is a possibility coming due in a few months though lieutenant lewrie shall find it familiar i believe a ketchrigged gunboat shall be ending her commission and returning from the mediterranean station at gibraltar we had discussed sending her to the bahamas after her refit you may recall milord ah yes howe nodded weve need of swift shallowdraft vessels out there lewrie if its not piracy in the bahamas its our yankee cousins violating the navigation acts and stealing our carryingtrade selling their shoddy goods without paying customs due and the bahamas are so temptingly close to that new nation so easily reached from their southern ports rather a dull little backwater but for that as i remember but just the place for an ambitious young officer to show his mettle hey what say you sir ready to conquer the kings enemies a little closer to home lewrie remembered the bahamas as well and none too fondly the most fun hed had there was watching the dogs roll over halfway through their afternoon snoozes well nassau on new providence was sporting enough after sundown and heaps of american loyalist families had made the place their home after the war ended surely one or two of emd have daughters he swore to be more careful this time i really should never set foot in the admiralty again he told himself every time i do i come out feeling raped with an exuberance he most certainly did not feel he was at last forced to say words cannot express my gratitude milords sir naturally i shall be delighted to serve in any capacity lead me to em thats the spirit lord howe exclaimed approvingly thats our sort of lad lewrie i knew youd be pleased yes he thought it seems im fated to be your lad for bloody ever dont it afterword from some of the fan mail ive received i may have erred on the side of authenticity when it comes to shiphandling and the jargon of the sea in use in the eighteenth century this came from a deepseated fear that someone a whole lot saltier than i ever hope to be would telephone me in the middle of the night and call me a lubberly farmer if i got it wrong it also came from my abiding love of ships and the sea i figured that if i was already there so to speak i might as well learn something for myself as well and too there is the tendency among sailors to speak a language that most landsmen dont readily understand a language i must admit i have to partly relearn every boating season but one that makes me one of the fraternity ships propelled by the wind didnt deal in numbered bearings on their compasses their crews spoke of windward or leeward going up to windward eighteenthcentury squareriggers could not get closer than roughly degrees to the apparent wind points of degrees each when sailing as close to the wind as they would lay they were said to beat to go full and by or lay closehauled if their destination was up to windward it could take forever to get there sailing aslant in a zigzag that took two or three times the actual straightline distance to fetch a port they would beat or proceed closehauled on either the starboard or larboard tack when the wind crossed the starboard right side of the vessel first and they sailed a course to the left of the baseline this was called the starboard tack when the wind crossed the larboard left side of the ship first and they proceeded to the right of the base course this was called the larboard tack i warn you now sailors were and still are a contrary lot to zigzag from one side to the other ships tacked across the eye of the wind wheeling the yards around from one tack to the other shifting the foreandaft sails from one side to the other to go with the wind abeam was called reaching this was also know as a soldiers wind since sailors have always considered a soldier less capable and intelligent than a sailor the side of the ship facing the wind was referred to as up to windward sometimes aweather while the side away from the wind was the lee side or alee anything below the ship and the source of the wind lay to its lee and a ship made leeway going to windward as well this depended on how deep and how long the keel and underbody of the ship were her quckwork below the waterline as well as how hard the wind was blowing and how much she leaned over from upright how much she heeled too much sail aloft could make her heel even more making her less efficient through the water as could the distribution of her cargo to sail off the wind with the wind from abaft is now called broad reaching but back then was termed running free with the wind on her quarter a ship just a little off the wind had a fair wind one heading steeper down to leeward had a leading wind and one sailing even more southerly on the chart provided had the wind large on her quarter or fine on her quarter to sail directly downwind was to run sometimes to scud or to carry both sheets aft and was also known as a landsmans breeze winds by the way are named for the direction from which they blow not the direction in which they blow the northeast trade winds in the caribbean come principally from the northeast they do not blow toward the northeast to change course while sailing off the wind is now called a gybe but in the eighteenth century was termed wearing ship it was easier to perform shorthanded so many captains preferred even when going to windward to make a complete circle in the water falling off the wind wearing the wind from one quarter of the stern to the other then hardening back up to the wind on the opposite tack closehauled the pointy end up front is called the bow that is forward corrupted to forrd the wide end at the back is the sternaft a ship has two sides the righthand side of the ship is always the starboard side the lefthand side back in the eighteenth century was called the larboard side its simple when youre facing the bow but when you turn and face aft they dont change places sailors back then were more concerned with which side was the weather side and which was the leeward side depending on where the wind was coming from anyway steering commands were issued with that as the prime concern here we reach another of those pesky posers created by the contrariness and conservatism of seafarers in the very old days every ship they werent so big back then was steered by a rudder that was controlled by a tiller a wooden bar that sticks out from the top of the rudder like a lever you still see them on smaller boats boats do not steer like a car to make a boat turn to the right to starboard the tiller has to be pushed over to the lefthand side to larboard this angles the rudder so that the force of the water across it swings the stern out in the opposite direction and swings the bows the way you want to go thats why lieutenant lewrie would order helm alee when he really wanted the ship to head up closer to the wind putting the helm down turns the bows up putting the helm up turns the bows away from the wind helm aweather by his time most ships had a wheel on the quarterdeck to steer with but the wheel controlled ropes and pulleys connected to a tiller head below decks that did the same thing that a small boats tiller did when lewrie said helm up or helm aweather the helmsman would turn the wheel a few spokes to either the leeward side to put the helm down or turn it to the windward side to put the helm up or aweather but even if the addition of the wheel made it seem more like driving a car the deck officer and the man on the wheel knew what they were really referring to was what was happening with that tiller hidden below decks and what the rudder was doing not which way the wheel was turning there were no auxiliary engines back then no motive power except the wind and sometimes an ash breeze when the ships boats were used to tow a vessel in light air when the wind came foul so that there was no way to work out of harbor no matter how well drilled a crew was in tacking ships sat in harbor until the wind shifted in the indian ocean south china seas and the bay of bengal the monsoon winds shifted fair or foul by sixmonth seasons while it might be fine for a ship bound south and west for the cape of good hope and a homeward voyage it would be almost impossible for a ship to make a journey in the opposite direction beating into the teeth of that same wind from the cape of good hope to calcutta which lay to the northeast further no naval captain would willingly cede the windward advantage to a foe staying up to windward and making the other fellow come to you was known as keeping the wind gauge choundas could not operate against the principal sealanes to and from canton from leeward he had to be up to windward from which he could strike and then dance away if he ran into some ship stronger than he was i hope i have related the limitations and advantages of wind position in the kings privateer the harbor i invented at spratly island was a right bastardeasy to get into with a southeast trade wind almost impossible to exitand i hope i showed how near lewrie was to losing culverin in his attempt to get to sea and chase those pirates harbors were always carefully selected so the entrance was not blocked with a headwind a dead muzzier most of the time a ship trying to work its way out shorttacking across a narrow entrance channel would end up stuck on a lee shore and pounded to bits by the waves and rocks thats why most harbors in the caribbean are on the lee side of the islandsnot just for protection from gales i could get into a lot more detail shown on the sketch of a fullrigged shipwhat the braces lifts jears and halyards did and all thatbut that would take an entire book in itself let me recommend instead the guide john harlands seamanship in the age of sail us naval institute press lavishly illustrated by mark myers royal society of marine artists fellow of the american society of marine artists the us naval institute also has bryan laverys the arming and fitting of english ships of war and peter goodwins the construction and fitting of the english man of war interesting too is the fighting ship of the royal navy by e h h archibald timelifes seafarers series is out of print i believe but most libraries should have fighting sail which covers the american revolution and the high points of the napoleonic warsthe great age of sail speaking of the napoleonic wars theres alan lewrie bound for the bahamas after a few months rest ashore i expect that he shall have a rather peaceful time of it during his threeyear commission that should put him back in england should he outrun any more irate husbands or furious daddies in just in time for but as they used to say at summer camp when they shooed us off to our cabins so the counselors could cavort with the girls across the lake thats a story for another nights campfire
